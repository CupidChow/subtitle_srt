Your Honour, you're here early as usual.

How can a civil servant who gets
his pay from the citizens be lazy?

- Keep up the good work today too.
- Yes.

11
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:22,504
It's such a pity for him
to remain in the court.

12
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:26,934
Right? He should go to
Yeouido and do great work.

You're amazing for doing
this in such a short time.

00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:02,402
You've worked hard.

Do you have a death wish?

21
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:08,175
It was worth it to make you
guys creative directors.

22

Go home and get ready. I'll meet
you guys in front of Woowon.

I need to get this reviewed
by Director Han-na.

Would the chairman's
daughter know what this is?

26
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:22,789
You still don't know?

27
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:23,863

You've all worked hard.

Alright, who will go first?

32
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:06,232
Director Go, why did you
come here empty handed?

33
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,099
We aren't done with the editing yet.

34
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:12,624
So you'll be doing the
review without the video?

35
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:13,463
No.

36
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:15,008
We're not going to review it.

37
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,447
We were supposed to review
the presentation this morning.

38
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:26,688
Do things always go according to plan?

39
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:36,023
Since you were unable to finish it
before the deadline we agreed on,

40
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:39,424
can I take it that you have lost?

41
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:46,047
The deadline is 1pm today at
Woowon's presentation room.

42
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:50,288
Go ahead. I'll listen to it seriously.

We're competitors in this presentation.

44

How can I be the only
one showing my proposal?

45
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:07,104
Every second is important to me right now,

46
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:08,795
so I'll take my leave first.

47
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:13,667
Director Han-na.

48
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:14,984
Yes?

49
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,571
If you're curious, come to
Woowon and see it for yourself.

50
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:21,041
Why should I?

51
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,968
I'll see you on the presentation day.

52
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:29,143
You're going to come too?

53
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,617
Of course I should be there.

54
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:39,526
Things are always the most interesting
when you see them for yourself.

Director Choi, let's cancel today's review.

56
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,859
It seems like Go Ah-in is
trying to do me dirty again.

57
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,344
She definitely has something up her
sleeves.

58
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,467
I get her intentions,

59
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:23,403
but I don't get her purpose.

60
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:27,374
I have a feeling.

61
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,704
What kind?

62
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:31,784
A feeling that I'll regret it if I don't go.

63
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:32,946
Let's go then.

64
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,424
It's not strange for an agency executive
to be present at a presentation.

65
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:39,448
Besides,

66
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:41,988
it's not like a star...

67
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:43,590
...to be absent from an important event.

68
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:47,103
Alright.

69
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,497
Let's see how good of a job she has done.

70
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:53,544
If she's commanding me
after doing a sloppy job...

71
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:55,469
We can show her what will happen then.

72
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:56,888
Let's go...

73
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,768
...to Woowon.

74
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:05,779
What am I doing here after
pulling an all-nighter?

75
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,452
He should be at the kindergarten now.

76
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:14,187
Ouch, my back.

77
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,784
Oh?

78
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:44,568
Mum!

79
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,721
A-ji, why didn't you go to kindergarten?

80
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:53,126
He seems to be having a cold,
so I didn't send him to school.

81
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:55,424
I see.

82
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,497
You're now done with
handing up your work right?

83
00:06:58,648 --> 00:06:59,766
Well...

84
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:03,743
It's the presentation day today. Right.
I need to wrap up the presentation first.

85
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,983
So you won't have to go to work
from tomorrow onwards right?

86
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:07,007
What?

87
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:08,475
The thing is...

88
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:10,343
Well...

89
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:14,824
I mean, you could say that,

90
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:17,903
but even if it's not,

91
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:23,256
you could say that isn't entirely
not wrong too, I think...

92
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:29,162
I don't have time. I need to
quickly wash up and go out.

93
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:22,704
I will work hard so as to not
let his expectations down.

94
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:23,424
One year.

95
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:27,248
After a year has passed, don't
you think you'd become calmer?

96
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:34,127
It feels weird for me to wear this,

97
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:39,408
but it hurts my pride not to wear this.

98
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,464
Director Go isn't here yet right?

99
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:54,728
Yes.

100
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,023
I just went to the bathroom,
but I want to go again.

101
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:00,864
Do you have an issue with your prostate?

102
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,989
Why would a woman have a prostate?

103
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:04,504
They don't?

104
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:05,725
What's wrong with you?

105
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:07,463
They don't. Just like how you
don't have thoughts in your head.

106
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:08,424
You're really amazing.

107
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:12,944
You even tried to pat the
head of your direct senior.

108
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:17,737
I'm not even the one doing the
presentation, why am I so nervous?

109
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:19,784
It's not like it's your first presentation.

110
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:22,047
Why are you being like this?

111
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:24,223
Am I the only scaredy-cat here?

112
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,448
Then...

113
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:36,984
...no one else here needs
a calming pill right?

114
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,488
Just give me half of it.

115
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:41,328
- A quarter for me.
- A quarter too.

116
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,087
Half here,

117
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,407
and a quarter each.

118
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:02,407
- You're here.
- You're here.

120

Director Go, have one too.

121
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:14,464
Why? Are you nervous?

122
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,208
Yeah, a little.

123
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:19,224
Are you the one doing the presentation?

124

We're one with you. Of
course we're nervous too.

125
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:27,928
You'll get used to it.

126
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:30,504
Sorry?

127
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:32,112
Used to running away because you're afraid.

128
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:35,915
If you're nervous, you should work
your way through the nervousness.

129
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:38,852
If you get used to avoiding
it, it'll become a trauma.

130

What are you waiting for? Let's go.

Can we switch our orders?

It is possible with mutual consent.

Why did you switch with me?

The direction is obvious
for such presentations.

Same goes for the creatives
that can come out of it.

That's all.

because of the influence from VC Group?

00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,155
Thanks for telling me.

481
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,634
Let's get a drink together soon.

482
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:05,570
I'll see if I have time.
I'm not sure if I will.

483
00:37:08,074 --> 00:37:11,977
Stupid fellow. He can't even handle that.

484
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:16,648
Should I throw this trash away or recycle it?

485
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,128
Let's just throw him away.

486
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:34,199
You want to fire the CPO just
because he lost a presentation?

487
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:35,555
Yes.

488
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:39,871
You want to use the presentation that our
company technically won as the reason?

489
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:44,576
They promised that whoever loses this
presentation will leave the company.

490
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,687
Are you sure you weren't the
one who told them to leave?

491
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,350
Well, not exactly that,

492
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:53,885
but it's similar I guess.

493
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,435
- I'm just thinking of the company...
- Rather than thinking of the company,

494
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:03,195
I think you're thinking of yourself.

495
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,716
"I'm above the both of you. I'll show
you what happens if you go against me."

496
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,380
Isn't it this?

497
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,716
Do I look like someone who will do that?

498
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,740
Yes.

499
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,076
You do look like you're doing that.

500
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,036
The thing is...

501
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,179
In a company where one can
get fired for a minor mistake...

502
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:25,835
and they have to be aware of the
owner's mood while they work,

503
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:28,156
do you know what kind
of employees will stay?

504
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,421
I don't know.

505
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,891
The incompetent ones.

506
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,897
The kind of people who will use flattery
and create office politics to get promoted.

507
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,866
When that happens,

508
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,604
the employees who are really good at
their work don't stay in the company.

509
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,409
They will either decide to leave
as they don't see a future...

510
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,113
...or get kicked out due
to the office politics.

511
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,251
What about Director Go?

512
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:02,754
Go Ah-in removed all the
employees she didn't like.

513
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,591
She did the opposite, in fact.

514
00:39:07,899 --> 00:39:11,363
She got rid of the ones who
survived through office politics.

515
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,700
Also,

516
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,035
she didn't fire them. She only
transferred them to a trivial post.

517
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,316
Are you asking me to not do anything then?

518
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,708
You want me to just watch
them crawl over my head...

519
00:39:26,379 --> 00:39:27,475
Yes, Sir.

520
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,915
Buy me a bottle of banana milk.

521
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,616
Get the straw too.

522
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,021
Uncle!

523
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,091
You don't have to go.

524
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:41,927
She'll calm down soon.

525
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,567
If I can't even do that,

526
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,836
how can I, with no
experience in the industry,

527
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,396
control these sly foxes? I can't
just let them drag me around!

528
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,796
Of course you can't let
them drag you around.

529
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,479
Then you should tell
me what I should do.

530
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,082
I just told you.

531
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,687
I told you Director Go transferred
those employees to a trivial post.

532
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,294
Well then,

533
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,834
please give your approval
according to what you've said.

534
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:26,404
Prepare the documents and send them to
me.

535
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,700
Alright.

536
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,660
(Court grants Chairman Kim
Woo-won's bail request)

537
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,979
(Prosecutor Kim Woo-seok)

538
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:44,456
Who got Kim Woo-won out?

539
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,362
I should find out...

540
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,964
...who this person is.

541
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,716
Investigator,

542
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,939
please help me to find a person.

543
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,060
She's here.

544
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,555
I'm getting off work.

545
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,219
Director Go, are you going home?

546
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,087
Yeah, why?

547
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:19,457
It was a really big presentation.

548
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,795
It was, of course!

549
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,355
Yeah, that's right.

550
00:41:26,379 --> 00:41:28,733
We should have a company dinner.

551
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:33,156
A company dinner is the
virtue of a true leader.

552
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,075
Shall I look for a place?

553
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:37,180
This place is good. Shall
I make a reservation?

554
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,676
Let's go.

555
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,939
Let's go.

556
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:47,300
N-Next time.

557
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:49,688
Next time?

558
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,595
Not "you guys can go and eat without me"?

559
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:53,435
Yes.

560
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:59,864
What year, month, date
and time is this next time?

561
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,196
Wh-When we have more time?

562
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,195
I'll get going.

563
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:10,140
- Get home safely.
- Get home safely.

564
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,555
That was a bold progress.

565
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,835
I was shaking even when I was saying it.

566
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:23,475
What's there to be nervous about? We
need to knock for her to open the door.

567
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,796
Knock?

568
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,356
It seems like you smashed your head
through.

569
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,627
Shall we get some drinks between us?

570
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:34,636
Next time for me too.

571
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,716
Do you have plans?

572
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,801
Yeah.

573
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,837
I'm going to treat my trauma.

574
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:42,676
She said that it'll become a trauma if I
get used to avoiding things I'm afraid of,

575
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,236
so I should face it head on.

576
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,060
I'll get going.

577
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:02,580
Alright. Let's go.

578
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,876
Attention, everyone.

579
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,145
You might get a shock, so
please halt your eating.

580
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,546
Let's talk.

581
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:30,355
Listen to what I'm going to
say without getting a shock.

582
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,123
I...

583
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,592
...didn't quit my job.

584
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:38,997
I mean, rather than quitting,

585
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:40,276
I got promoted.

586
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,034
I'm no longer a copywriter
but a creative director!

587
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,209
Why aren't you shocked?

588
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:53,355
Mother, why aren't you shocked?

589
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:54,746
I already knew.

590
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,217
That's right. Your expression wasn't
that of someone who had quit her job.

591
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,636
What are you talking about? I
worked so hard to put up an act!

592
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,435
You're terrible at acting.

593
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:07,875
I get worried every time I look at her.

594
00:44:07,899 --> 00:44:12,220
I was thinking how she'll survive
in the company being this naive.

595
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:16,539
I'm amazed that she didn't get
fired and even got promoted.

596
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,316
What's this?

597
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,873
So you all knew about it?

598
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,477
Of course not. There's
someone who fell for it.

599
00:44:31,899 --> 00:44:33,899
No!

600
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,396
No! No!

601
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,356
- A-ji...
- No! No!

602
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,275
You're a liar! You're a liar!

603
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:45,756
A-ji, I got promoted. Now I can't quit.

604
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,956
No! You can quit!

605
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,916
You can just hand up your work!

606
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,515
I can't. Creative directors
can't hand up their work.

607
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:56,660
I don't want that! I don't want that!

608
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,739
I don't want that too!

609
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,916
Do you know how hard I worked
to become a creative director?

610
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,956
I don't want that! I said I don't want that!

611
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,995
I don't want that too.

612
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:12,300
I won't quit. I mean, I can't quit!

613
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,996
If you keep doing this, I won't be your mum.

614
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,019
I'll just be the commercials' mum.

615
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:32,955
You should pacify him.
How could you fight with him?

616
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:35,756
He needs to get what I'm
saying for me to pacify him.

617
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,259
Who does he resemble
for him to act like that?

618
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,796
I didn't end up like
this because I did that!

619
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,476
Sure, sure.

620
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:55,180
A-ji, let's go into the room. Oh, you cried.

621
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:01,940
Darn it.

622
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,379
I faced it head on. Why
isn't my trauma healing?

623
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,258
Good morning!

624
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:23,328
Enjoy your food.

625
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:24,796
Grandfather, enjoy two bowls.

626
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,955
Why? You want this old man to
die early from high blood sugar?

627
00:46:27,979 --> 00:46:32,020
You need to have the energy to live a long
life to see us become the top in Asia.

628
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,540
You always speak like a congresswoman.

629
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,595
How could you compare me to
those four year temporary workers?

630
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:40,836
As they say, crooked logs make straight
fires.

631
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,715
The executives from headquarters
had lots of praises for you.

632
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,676
It's all thanks to the good work
by the employees at VC Planning.

633
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,115
You're right.

634
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:53,315
It was Director Go's work, not yours.

635
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:56,716
It's my employee's performance,
so it's mine too of course.

636
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,836
Your employee?

637
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,716
Is she really your employee?

638
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,433
She's an employee of VC Planning.

639
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,156
Hey, Han-soo.

640
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,156
- Yes, Grandfather.
- What are you saying?

641
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,300
Sorry?

642
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,996
If a servant does well, it's because
their master gave good orders.

643
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,517
How is that the accomplishment
of the servant?

644
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,636
Yes, you're right.

645
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,836
Having a servant who does
their job well under you...

646
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,036
...is a master's skill too.

647
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,459
Of course.

648
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,420
That female servant,

649
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,940
I need to meet her.

650
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:35,533
- You want to meet her personally?
- Yes.

651
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,995
Chairman Kim wants to meet her too.

652
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:41,435
Really? That's great then.

653
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:45,236
Then tonight when I have
dinner with Chairman Kim,

654
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,636
put one more chair beside me.

655
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,614
- Beside you?
- Yeah.

656
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:57,396
Those who grew up reading the room don't
like to sit at the bottom of the table.

657
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,716
<i>Look at him.</i>

658
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,700
<i>He's read up about Go Ah-in.</i>

659
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:04,115
- Grandfather?
- Hmm?

660
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:06,531
Stop working and rest.

661
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,676
I'll grow old if I laze around.

662
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,939
Will eating two bowls of
rice make me live longer?

663
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:18,330
Mr. Park, let's go.

664
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:30,636
Did you buy new shoes?

665
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,780
Yes.

666
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,459
A present for you.

667
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,236
What are you doing early in the morning?

668
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,263
What do you mean? I'm having fun, of
course.

669
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,636
Is this fun to you?

670
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,969
You're not a kid anymore.

671
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,555
Don't you know that
creativity is generated...

672
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:51,876
...when you look upon the
world like a child would?

673
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,116
I read that in a book.

674
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,540
A book?

675
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:58,356
You read that from an
online novel, didn't you?

676
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,585
No, I read that from a book!

677
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,979
Don't lie.

678
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,380
Please...

679
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,065
They're close.

680
00:49:16,499 --> 00:49:18,136
A little too close.

681
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,315
Director Go,

682
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,875
this is late, but congratulations.

683
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:47,498
Thank you. It was all thanks to you.

684
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,135
I see you bought new shoes.

685
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,540
You're available this evening right?

686
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:01,716
What is this about?

687
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,515
Chairman Kang's family and Chairman Kim's
family are having dinner together today.

688
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:10,499
They wish for you to join them as well.

689
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,315
Me?

690
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:13,500
Yes.

691
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:20,876
To be exact, which of the two
chairmen asked for me to be there?

692
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,333
To be exact,

693
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:24,869
the boss did.

694
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:29,980
("Exploding on social media")

695
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,980
(Chairman Kim's touch of humanity
by ordering chicken after prison release)

696
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,460
(The chairman must have craved
for chicken after his release too.)

697
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,019
(Chicken right after his release.
He must be a humble guy.)

698
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,427
It's getting good reactions.

699
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,116
Did you tell her?

700
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:54,956
Yes.

701
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,980
What did she say?

702
00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:02,555
Then, please reach the place
at exactly 6.50pm this evening.

703
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:04,976
I'll send you the address.

704
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,712
Mr. Park.

705
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,540
Yes?

706
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,250
Do you perhaps have any...

707
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:13,985
...advice for me?

708
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:16,708
Oh...

709
00:51:18,219 --> 00:51:20,224
When you meet the grand chairman,

710
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:22,860
think of it as standing in front
of the God of the Underworld...

711
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,063
...and be honest about
everything as much as possible.

712
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,979
Also,

713
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,934
don't buy them anything when you go.

714
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,204
They don't lack anything.

715
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,644
She didn't say anything much.

716
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,346
Okay.

717
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,532
Are you Director Go Ah-in?

718
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,820
Yes.

719
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,300
Please head inside.

720
00:52:49,529 --> 00:52:51,088
This way please.

721
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:57,779
You may sit here.

722
00:52:58,307 --> 00:52:59,322
Here?

723
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:01,893
You're a guest. You should
sit at the upper end.

724
00:53:05,107 --> 00:53:08,547
Be comfortable and act
like you usually would.

725
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,502
Nice to meet you.

726
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:14,372
I'm VC Planning's chief
creative officer Go Ah-in.

727
00:53:15,106 --> 00:53:16,107
Have a seat.

728
00:53:23,586 --> 00:53:26,517
You're here in someone's house for the
first time, but you came empty-handed.

729
00:53:27,106 --> 00:53:28,002
Sorry?

730
00:53:28,026 --> 00:53:29,921
Was that what your parents taught you?

731
00:53:36,787 --> 00:53:40,398
I think I've already given you a big
gift, so I came here empty-handed.

732
00:53:42,707 --> 00:53:44,936
I also thought you wouldn't
be lacking anything.

733
00:53:47,827 --> 00:53:51,175
I see. Welcome. Let's eat.

734
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:03,723
It isn't much right?

735
00:54:03,747 --> 00:54:05,282
No, this is fine.

736
00:54:05,306 --> 00:54:07,363
It's not that different
just because we're rich.

737
00:54:07,387 --> 00:54:09,763
We eat the same things as all other
Koreans.

738
00:54:09,787 --> 00:54:10,723
Right?

739
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,763
People always think we eat
steak and caviar everyday.

740
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:16,163
You always eat that kind of stuff.

741
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:18,307
When did I?

742
00:54:21,066 --> 00:54:24,507
I eat them occasionally. Just occasionally.

743
00:54:29,027 --> 00:54:30,866
Director Go.

744
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:35,347
Eat as much as you want.

745
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,522
Director Go,

746
00:54:39,546 --> 00:54:43,802
how should I express my gratefulness to
you?

747
00:54:43,826 --> 00:54:46,683
It's fine. I'm just doing
what I'm paid to do.

748
00:54:46,707 --> 00:54:48,883
I like your mindset.

749
00:54:48,907 --> 00:54:51,267
Doing what you're paid to do.

750
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:54,362
I know right?

751
00:54:54,386 --> 00:54:55,883
Shall we set up an agency too?

752
00:54:55,907 --> 00:54:57,906
Shall we?

753
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:01,003
I can pay you that salary too,

754
00:55:01,027 --> 00:55:04,163
so tell me if Han-na is
giving you a hard time.

755
00:55:04,187 --> 00:55:06,866
I'll give you however much you want.

756
00:55:06,947 --> 00:55:08,962
Before that, tell me first.

757
00:55:08,986 --> 00:55:12,322
The marketing executive director
spot in headquarters is open too.

758
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:15,323
An advertising person should stay in the
agency, why would she go elsewhere?

759
00:55:15,347 --> 00:55:18,723
We can always do a personnel transfer...

760
00:55:18,747 --> 00:55:20,986
...if she gets a promotion.

761
00:55:25,187 --> 00:55:28,587
Since it's a happy day,
shall we have a toast?

762
00:55:45,026 --> 00:55:48,043
It must have been uncomfortable for you.
We held on to you for too long, didn't we?

763
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:49,707
No, it's fine.

764
00:55:50,106 --> 00:55:52,323
I shall take my leave now.

765
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:54,107
Mr. Park.

766
00:55:56,707 --> 00:55:58,187
Yes, Sir.

767
00:55:58,227 --> 00:56:01,083
She's had a drink. You send her back.

768
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,723
It's fine, really.

769
00:56:02,747 --> 00:56:04,147
I'll see you again.

770
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:25,507
Don't feel too happy about it,

771
00:56:25,826 --> 00:56:27,803
and don't think too much about it too.

772
00:56:27,827 --> 00:56:29,826
They'll call you when they need you...

773
00:56:30,107 --> 00:56:32,867
...and kick you out when
they don't need you.

774
00:56:35,747 --> 00:56:39,922
Why are you being nice to me?

775
00:56:39,946 --> 00:56:43,027
Is this like a sense of
kinship between servants?

776
00:56:43,227 --> 00:56:44,587
No.

777
00:56:45,147 --> 00:56:47,322
We have a give and take relationship,

778
00:56:47,346 --> 00:56:50,627
so I'm giving so I can take.

779
00:56:52,227 --> 00:56:54,626
I'm getting afraid already...

780
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:58,267
...thinking of what
you'll be trying to take.

781
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,523
Can I go somewhere other than home?

782
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:02,547
Sure.

783
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:05,946
Anywhere as long as it's
below the truce line.

784
00:57:28,267 --> 00:57:30,666
You've worked hard today.

785
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:35,032
Looking at what happened today, you
must have a hard time working everyday.

786
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,667
See you.

787
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:21,312
How impious of me.

788
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:23,162
What?

789
00:58:23,186 --> 00:58:26,603
You just came from a dinner
with the rich chairman,

790
00:58:26,627 --> 00:58:30,746
but here I am serving
you such a sloppy dish.

791
00:58:31,826 --> 00:58:32,962
Don't joke with me.

792
00:58:32,986 --> 00:58:36,107
I was so uncomfortable that
I couldn't even eat properly.

793
00:58:36,506 --> 00:58:39,506
That's your bill.

794
00:58:40,787 --> 00:58:43,801
It's a reward for having
worked hard. Enjoy it.

795
00:58:51,546 --> 00:58:53,666
What should I do?

796
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:57,787
I think I'm stuck between
the prince and princess.

797
00:58:57,946 --> 00:59:00,307
Don't do anything.

798
00:59:00,506 --> 00:59:03,402
Don't try to win by siding with one party.

799
00:59:03,426 --> 00:59:06,505
Just observe the situation and
go with the one who wins.

800
00:59:06,787 --> 00:59:11,906
That's the never changing
law of success in this country.

801
00:59:15,187 --> 00:59:17,568
It's my honour. Let's toast.

802
00:59:19,147 --> 00:59:20,147
What's this?

803
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:22,843
Are you ignoring me already
since you're doing well?

804
00:59:22,867 --> 00:59:25,163
You're being noisy.

805
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,883
I was noisy?

806
00:59:26,907 --> 00:59:28,107
Then...

807
00:59:29,506 --> 00:59:32,243
Are you ignoring me already, Director Go?

808
00:59:32,267 --> 00:59:34,426
I told you to stop it.

809
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:08,226
A bill...

810
01:00:59,306 --> 01:01:00,906
Excuse me.

811
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:07,187
Why are you sleeping here?

812
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:52,867
(Agency)

813
01:02:18,466 --> 01:02:21,962
Between Kang Han-soo and Kang
Han-na, who will you work with?

814
01:02:21,986 --> 01:02:25,043
It's such an obvious story that
I understood it immediately.

815
01:02:25,067 --> 01:02:27,482
Can I take it as a positive response?

816
01:02:27,506 --> 01:02:28,803
Director,

817
01:02:28,827 --> 01:02:30,539
do you like me?

818
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:33,962
I need to have some guarantee too.

819
01:02:33,986 --> 01:02:38,363
Is there a job I can do in
the agency over there?

820
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:42,445
That's right. There's no rule in a fight.

821
01:02:43,147 --> 01:02:44,483
Of all times, why now?

822
01:02:44,507 --> 01:02:47,522
Ah-in, please live like others do.

823
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:49,603
Do you think I wanted to live like this?

824
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:52,723
If I become weak, I need to escape.

825
01:02:52,747 --> 01:02:55,164
That is the only way
I'll be able to survive.
