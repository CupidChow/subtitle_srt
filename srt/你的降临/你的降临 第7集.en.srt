1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,160
Day.

3
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,940
Hey, Lao Jiang.

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,600
I want to ask you

5
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,200
if Qiu Qian

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,130
is having a hard time right now?

7
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Let's deal with your problem first.

8
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Can you help her?

9
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,360
I'll figure something out for Qiu Qian.

10
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,640
All of this

11
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,770
might be a space-time chain reaction.

12
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,240
Qiu Qian said

13
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,240
during the final months of senior year,

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,100
you and Gu Ming became very close.

15
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,320
Gu Ming?

16
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
We were desk mates.

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,160
Being close

18
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,560
should be normal, right?

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,920
Maybe you weren't that close to him before.

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
Gu Ming and I

21
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,050
went to the same middle school.

22
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,840
So we were

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,079
relatively more familiar with each other.

24
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,880
But after starting high school,

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,120
I was still closer to Qi Shuo and Qiu Qian

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
than anyone else.

27
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,540
I feel like something might be wrong.

28
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,340
I'll look into it further.

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,160
Anyway,

30
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,640
be careful.

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,440
Gu Ming.

32
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,280
Gu Ming.

33
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,520
Did Lao Jiang make a mistake?

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,080
It can't be Gu Ming!

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,720
He's our good class monitor.

36
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,000
But why did we suddenly get so close?

37
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,480
However, at this point,

38
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,079
we can't fully trust anyone.

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,040
Let's first look at

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,200
the like from

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,360
An Zhenzhen.

42
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,770
An Zhenzhen.

43
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,600
Come to my office after class.

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,480
Ms. Liu.

45
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,050
Sit down and pay attention.

46
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,240
Ms. Liu.

47
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,240
Ms. Liu,

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,480
I really didn't mean to.

49
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,720
You misunderstood me.

50
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
You really misunderstood me, An Zhenzhen.

51
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,480
Last time you were on your phone,

52
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,040
this time the whole class is watching you

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,100
staring at Gu Ming.

54
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,800
Do you realize what time it is now?

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
What exactly are you trying to do?

56
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,760
Ms. Liu,

57
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,440
I wasn't deliberately staring at Gu Ming,

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,960
it's because...

59
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,760
Because what?

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't tell me

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,480
that Gu Ming

62
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,800
asked you to look at him?

63
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,560
At a time like this,

64
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,760
you still refuse to admit your mistake.

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,680
I have nothing more to say to you.

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,840
Ask Gu Ming to come in.

67
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,360
Teacher.

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,040
Go now.

69
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,840
Ms. Liu.

70
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,740
Gu Ming,

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,970
it's not that I don't trust you.

72
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
But you and An Zhenzhen,

73
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,160
you two aren't...

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,320
Teacher, you've completely misunderstood.

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,250
An Zhenzhen and I

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
are just classmates,

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,840
good friends,

78
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,920
nothing more.

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,090
That's good.

80
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,800
This is a critical time,

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,460
you absolutely can't slip up.

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,720
How about

83
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,290
I change your seats,

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,240
so that

85
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,970
you won't distract each other?

86
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
No need, teacher.

87
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,200
An Zhenzhen's father

88
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,040
actually asked me to supervise her studies.

89
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,800
Our families have known each other for a long time.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,840
Don't worry, teacher,

91
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,000
I know what's important

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,860
and what's not.

93
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,800
You've always been sensible.

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,860
If that's the case,

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,659
it's good for An Zhenzhen too.

96
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,960
Remind her occasionally

97
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,690
to pay more attention in class.

98
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,380
I have no idea what goes on in her head.

99
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,420
Don't worry, teacher.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,130
Go back to class now.

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,240
Class monitor.

102
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
I'm sorry,

103
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,240
I got you into trouble.

104
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,800
Liu Yaru didn't scold you, did she?

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,240
No.

106
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,920
I explained everything

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,780
to the teacher.

108
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,370
That's good.

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,760
Zhenzhen.

110
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,680
Let me tutor you.

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,440
Tutor?

112
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,080
Why?

113
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,760
The college entrance exam is coming soon,

114
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,220
you should address any problems right away.

115
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,200
What I mean is,

116
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,940
thank you, class monitor,

117
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,659
you're such a nice person.

118
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,650
Monitor.

119
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,920
I'll go to practice first,

120
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,520
we can study when we get back.

121
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,020
What were you guys talking about?

122
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,860
He said he's going to tutor me.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,520
Why?

124
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,080
Maybe my dad talked to him before

125
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,160
and asked him to keep an eye on my studies.

126
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,760
Our families have known each other for a while.

127
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,440
Mr. Jiang,

128
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,570
have you found any new leads recently?

129
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,850
He said Gu...

130
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,010
He didn't say anything.

131
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,180
We're here.

132
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,620
Let's get ready for training.

133
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,600
Stretch your

134
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,060
thighs.

135
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,280
Stretch your calves

136
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,080
and loosen up.

137
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,240
Breathe.

138
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,320
Lift.

139
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,840
Inhale through your nose,

140
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,370
exhale through your mouth.

141
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,500
Breathe in.

142
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,880
Control your breathing rhythm.

143
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm too tired.

144
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,240
Why don't we just run two laps first?

145
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,200
Otherwise I really don't think I have the energy

146
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,530
to finish the whole run.

147
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,690
Alright.

148
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,480
Ready.

149
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,120
Control your breathing.

150
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,820
Watch your rhythm.

151
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,840
Sprint through the curve.

152
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,480
Speed up,

153
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,450
faster, faster!

154
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,420
We're here.

155
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,320
How was it?

156
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,980
Was your time okay?

157
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,850
Pretty good,

158
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,880
not bad at all.

159
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
I knew it.

160
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,160
Why am I even trying for this sports scholarship?

161
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,240
Others leave me half a lap behind right from the start.

162
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,800
Know your limits,

163
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm just not cut out for this.

164
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm done running.

165
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,740
I need to tell my dad

166
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
that this sports scholarship thing

167
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,850
is for someone else, not me.

168
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,860
Mr. Wang drank even more than I did today.

169
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,530
Look how happy he is.

170
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,170
Sweetie.

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,520
Hey, Dad.

172
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,960
I don't want to do the sports recruitment program.

173
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,720
I can't run that well.

174
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,440
You're overestimating me.

175
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,120
About this running thing,

176
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,600
it's not up for discussion.

177
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,320
I've already asked people for favors.

178
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,920
But I really can't come in first place.

179
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,840
You don't need to come in first.

180
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,960
Daughter.

181
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,620
This isn't a special talent program.

182
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,540
You just need to run your best,

183
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,720
pass the minimum requirements,

184
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,400
and if you meet

185
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,160
the local teachers college's

186
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,540
admission standards,

187
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,680
we can pull some strings

188
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,250
to secure you a spot.

189
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
Isn't that wrong?

190
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,840
What if someone finds out?

191
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,180
Don't worry about right or wrong.

192
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,720
That's not your concern.

193
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,090
That's adult business,

194
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,800
why are you worrying about it?

195
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
You just need to

196
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,000
run as fast as you can,

197
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
and leave the rest to Dad.

198
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
Dad's busy working now,

199
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,040
if anything comes up,

200
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,000
call me later,

201
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,410
bye-bye.

202
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,640
I asked you earlier

203
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,880
to help with Qi Shuo's situation,

204
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,440
why haven't you done anything about it?

205
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,120
He wants to be an actor,

206
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,220
he wants to be a celebrity,

207
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,960
I don't know that many people in that field.

208
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,290
I'm talking about his college admission.

209
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,610
What a coincidence,

210
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,680
I only know some people in sports departments.

211
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Well,

212
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,730
about Qi Shuo's matter,

213
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll think of something when I get back.

214
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,130
I'll figure something out.

215
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,780
How's it going?

216
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,400
There are only a few days left until the special admission test.

217
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,460
Three or four days.

218
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,920
It's over.

219
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,480
Everything's ruined.

220
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,040
It's okay,

221
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,200
don't stress yourself too much.

222
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,280
How can I not be stressed?

223
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm not just running for myself now,

224
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm carrying my parents'

225
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,360
expectations on my shoulders.

226
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,560
It would be a miracle if I could run fast.

227
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,760
Actually,

228
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,440
when I was a child,

229
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,650
my health wasn't very good either.

230
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,400
So my aunt

231
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,960
would get up every morning

232
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,020
and take me jogging

233
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,210
to exercise.

234
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,600
If it weren't for her,

235
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,720
my health

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,730
wouldn't be as good as it is now.

237
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,320
What does your aunt do?

238
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,960
Now she

239
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,220
makes braised dishes.

240
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,600
Before that,

241
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
I remember she was

242
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,840
an athlete.

243
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,760
An athlete.

244
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,160
Xiao Jiang,

245
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
why are you back?

246
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,040
This is

247
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,050
my classmate

248
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,850
An Zhenzhen.

249
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,880
Hello, ma'am.

250
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,760
Hello.

251
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,760
Why don't you two go upstairs

252
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,760
and I'll

253
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,800
make you something to eat.

254
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,440
Auntie,

255
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,600
we actually

256
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,060
have something to ask you.

257
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
Weren't you a professional athlete before?

258
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,080
We were wondering,

259
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,760
my friend is going to

260
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,080
participate in a running competition in a few days,

261
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,760
and we wanted to ask

262
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,720
if there are any

263
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,380
techniques

264
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,760
and training methods

265
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,820
for quick results?

266
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,820
It's been so long since I trained.

267
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,720
But,

268
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120
if you want to practice running,

269
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
cardio fitness is essential.

270
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,480
For example,

271
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,600
regular long-term training

272
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,000
and proper breathing techniques,

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,320
lower body strength training,

274
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,960
hill climbing,

275
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,000
stair climbing and frog jumps,

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
are all good options.

277
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,680
If

278
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
you want to learn

279
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,760
running techniques,

280
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,530
I have so much I could teach you.

281
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Is there anything

282
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,620
that could improve performance in just a day or two?

283
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,920
How is that possible?

284
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
These improvements in ability

285
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,970
all require consistent long-term training.

286
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,120
If you want

287
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,280
quick results,

288
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,080
I think

289
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
getting a suitable pair of running shoes

290
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,010
might be better for you all.

291
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,480
You guys keep chatting,

292
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,940
I'll go prepare some food.

293
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,330
Goodbye, ma'am.

294
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,120
Running shoes.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,400
Expensive, aren't they?

296
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,840
Well,

297
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll ask my dad about it,

298
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,200
he should be able to help.

299
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,680
Turn around.

300
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,480
Touch.

301
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,240
Ready.

302
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,450
Good.

303
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,740
Look ahead.

304
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,400
Faster.

305
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,960
Lean forward.

306
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,280
In the Northern Sea there is a fish,

307
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,320
called the Kun,

308
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,000
which is many thousands of miles in size.

309
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
It transforms into a bird

310
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,560
called the Peng,

311
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,480
whose back

312
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,400
spans thousands of miles.

313
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,040
Rising in fury to the heavens.

314
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Soaring in anger.

315
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,840
When studying functions,

316
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,960
we often use the concept of intervals.

317
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,920
Let a and b be two real numbers,

318
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,560
where a is less than b.

319
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,610
We define

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,280
the set of real numbers x

321
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,680
where x is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b

322
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,340
as the closed interval [a,b].

323
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,400
Move forward.

324
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,730
Don't just stand still.

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Lower your knees.

326
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,660
Lower your knees more.

327
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,880
Push down.

328
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,680
Down.

329
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,180
Then swing your arms from side to side

330
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,040
and relax.

331
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,520
Look

332
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,290
forward.

333
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,800
Relax your shoulders.

334
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,970
Swing your arms naturally.

335
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,320
That's great!

336
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,080
So here with 'Celebrate,'

337
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,540
we need to transform it into 'Celebration.'

338
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,240
Zhenzhen.

339
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,000
Qi Shuo.

340
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,320
Choose.

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,130
Stand up and get out.

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,460
Everyone else, continue with the exercise.

343
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,040
From 'Celebrate' to 'Celebration'.

344
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,680
Ms. Liu,

345
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm begging you,

346
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
please don't call my family.

347
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
My sister is very busy,

348
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,440
I don't want her to worry about me.

349
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,160
Ms. Liu.

350
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,680
You should have thought about this

351
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,760
before falling asleep

352
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,480
in my class.

353
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,360
I promise you

354
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,520
it won't happen again,

355
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,920
and

356
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,960
I'm planning to repeat the year.

357
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,040
If I take another year to prepare for the arts exam,

358
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,400
don't you think

359
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,000
there would be no need

360
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,480
to call my parents anymore?

361
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,560
Which school are you planning to apply to?

362
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
The Film Academy.

363
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,970
What if you don't get in?

364
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,050
Then I'll try again.

365
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,360
As long as your family agrees,

366
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,480
I don't care how long it takes you,

367
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
whether you're applying to the Film Academy

368
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,760
or some Electrical Engineering Academy.

369
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,290
But if you sleep in my class,

370
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,880
I will have to call your parents.

371
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,540
Teacher Liu

372
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,840
Teacher Liu

373
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,960
Please don't.

374
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,810
Hello, Teacher Liu.

375
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,440
You're Qi Shuo's sister,

376
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,500
please have a seat.

377
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm Qi Shuo,

378
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,330
thank you for your time.

379
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
About Qi Shuo's issues,

380
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,280
as I mentioned on the phone,

381
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,640
he's not doing his homework

382
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,500
or paying attention in class.

383
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,600
When it comes to academic issues

384
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,290
and attitude problems,

385
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,360
we teachers

386
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,520
can only do so much.

387
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,160
But Qi Shuo,

388
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,490
he's quite intelligent

389
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,680
and very sharp.

390
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,420
He just doesn't focus on his studies,

391
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,920
right?

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
I understand completely.

393
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,850
Teacher Liu,

394
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,920
I really do hope

395
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,780
that Qi Shuo would put more effort into his studies,

396
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
but my work keeps me extremely busy.

397
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,520
Besides me,

398
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,860
there's no one else to look after him.

399
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,119
To be honest with you,

400
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,760
when Qi Shuo was very young,

401
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,160
our parents passed away,

402
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,250
and I raised him myself.

403
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,940
It's my fault for not guiding him better.

404
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,220
It must be quite difficult for you as his sister.

405
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,760
Regarding Qi Shuo's situation,

406
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
I should have understood it better,

407
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,560
that's a shortcoming in my work.

408
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,319
However,

409
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,920
I heard from Qi Shuo

410
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,650
that he's planning to repeat the year?

411
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,320
That's Qi Shuo's idea,

412
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,480
but honestly,

413
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,800
I can't manage everything by myself.

414
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,520
If he keeps repeating years

415
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,680
to get into film school,

416
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,740
who knows how many years it will take.

417
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,280
I was thinking

418
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,280
he should just take the regular college entrance exam

419
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,540
and find a way to get into any university.

420
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,120
But looking at Qi Shuo's current grades,

421
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,800
that might be difficult.

422
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,680
Does our school

423
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
have a sports recruitment program?

424
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,720
The school offers admissions to local students with athletic talents,

425
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,880
through special recruitment,

426
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,480
so those with special skills

427
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,640
have an advantage

428
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,700
when it comes to college admissions.

429
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,400
It might not be a top university,

430
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,000
but at least

431
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,320
he'd be able to continue his education.

432
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,560
Then please, Teacher,

433
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,160
help sign Qi Shuo up for this.

434
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Qi Shuo,

435
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,480
he doesn't seem to have any athletic talents, does he?

436
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,650
Without athletic talents,

437
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,960
he can't apply?

438
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,800
I heard

439
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,040
that in our class

440
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
a female student has already applied.

441
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,100
She doesn't seem to have any athletic talent, does she?

442
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,200
I heard

443
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,130
her family has some influence.

444
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,200
If others have it,

445
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,480
we can figure something out too,

446
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,760
right?

447
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,440
Signing up is easy,

448
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,640
but if Qi Shuo doesn't cooperate...

449
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,480
He'll go,

450
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,450
he's my brother.

451
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,620
I know him well.

452
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,330
As long as I tell him,

453
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,840
he'll definitely go.

454
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,740
Thank you for your help, Teacher Liu.

455
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,050
I heard everything.

456
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,000
But

457
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,280
I only want to be an actor.

458
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,500
You want to be an actor?

459
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,200
Fine,

460
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,280
I support you.

461
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,720
But you must apply to film school,

462
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,520
repeat a year?

463
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,280
That's so immature.

464
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,480
Qi Shuo,

465
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,360
you're not a child anymore.

466
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,560
We can't just do everything your way.

467
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,240
We've relied on each other for so many years,

468
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,770
you know how hard it's been.

469
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,920
I hope our lives

470
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,080
can improve soon,

471
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,840
instead of going around in circles

472
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,040
and getting nowhere.

473
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,600
I'm sorry.

474
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,800
I was being selfish.

475
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,360
I didn't want to tell you all this,

476
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,800
but you can't stay a child forever.

477
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,200
But

478
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,520
But sis, I want

479
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,600
to be an actor.

480
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,850
If I don't apply to film school,

481
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,680
what other options do I have?

482
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,120
Sis,

483
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,560
just believe in me this once.

484
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,040
Qi Shuo,

485
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,480
you're already 18 years old.

486
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,280
There are many things I can tell you now.

487
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,720
Look at those celebrities

488
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,760
who seem so glamorous.

489
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,320
But have you ever thought that

490
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,640
what you see is just their public image?

491
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,720
The hardships they endure

492
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,880
and the suffering they go through

493
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,320
behind the scenes, do you know?

494
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,380
Do you understand?

495
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,760
Besides, do we have any connections for this?

496
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,880
Do you know what kind of people

497
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,120
can get admitted there?

498
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,080
They all have both talent

499
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
and connections.

500
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
What do we have?

501
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,080
What do we have?

502
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,520
The path to becoming an actor isn't

503
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,960
something ordinary people like us can take.

504
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,680
Why don't you

505
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,960
understand that?

506
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,760
Sis.

507
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,240
Do I really have no hope left?

508
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,440
I think

509
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,280
I still have talent.

510
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,740
Is talent worth anything?

511
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,460
Don't you remember what happened during your art school exam?

512
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,290
Hello, teacher.

513
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,260
I'm candidate number 02, Qi Shuo,

514
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,340
Shuo as in 'shine.'

515
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,720
Height 188 cm,

516
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,160
weight 68 kg.

517
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,520
Next up is my

518
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,320
performance demonstration:

519
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,250
eating noodles.

520
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,080
And now

521
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,960
for my

522
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,560
physical presentation.

523
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,200
When my flowers

524
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,160
nestle in

525
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,000
someone else's heart,

526
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
I still stubbornly

527
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
cling to frost-covered vines.

528
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,480
On this desolate land,

529
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,840
we write

530
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
believe in tomorrow.

531
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,080
Why do we

532
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
never return once we leave?

533
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,080
Don't worry,

534
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,620
just run your best,

535
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,080
I'll figure out the rest.

536
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
This is a great opportunity,

537
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
you must seize it.

538
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,010
I'll head back to class now.

539
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,760
I brought you a gift from my business trip,

540
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
let's go get it

541
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,420
and grab something to eat.

542
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,200
I'll ask for leave first.

543
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,530
No need to ask for leave,

544
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,210
I'm here for you.

545
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,210
Let's go.

546
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Last ten seconds,

547
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,600
hang in there.

548
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,850
What are you doing here?

549
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,880
I also signed up for the sports recruitment,

550
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,810
take me with you.

551
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,000
Weren't you planning to repeat a year

552
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,260
and take the arts exam?

553
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,680
I've decided not to repeat the year,

554
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,120
I want to seize this opportunity now

555
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,320
to get into college

556
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,000
and ease

557
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,130
my sister's burden.

558
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,280
Since when did you become

559
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,480
so enlightened?

560
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,920
Let me tell you something first.

561
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,780
This is going to be hell training,

562
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
extremely tough.

563
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Can you handle it?

564
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm a grown man,

565
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,010
You can do it.

566
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,680
of course I can handle it!

567
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,610
Let's begin.

568
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,540
Bring it on.

569
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,570
Ten reps per set,

570
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,440
two sets.

571
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,520
Start.

572
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,860
Qi Shuo.

573
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,730
Speed up.

574
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,400
Good.

575
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,000
Look up.

576
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:46,880
Okay.

577
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,840
Speed

578
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,160
and frequency

579
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
need to increase.

580
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,980
Faster!

581
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,570
I can't do it,

582
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,530
give me a moment.

583
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,160
So fast!

584
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,400
Turn around and run back.

585
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,840
Wait!

586
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,600
Hold on!

587
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,880
Wait a second!

588
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,840
Just a minute!

589
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,400
How did Zhenzhen get so good?

590
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,600
If you practice more,

591
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,280
you'll be able to keep up too.

592
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,720
Pick up

593
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,690
the pace.

594
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,520
Faster, faster!

595
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,240
Follow the line

596
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,970
and run back.

597
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,280
That look in his eyes,

598
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
could he be in love with An Zhenzhen?

599
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,540
If you have time to talk nonsense,

600
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,040
you'd better keep up.

601
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,850
Don't worry,

602
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,140
I won't slow you guys down.

603
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,420
Mrs. An.

604
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,960
What brings you here?

605
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
I was just passing by

606
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,160
and wanted to see how you're doing.

607
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,620
I brought some groceries.

608
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,640
Thank you.

609
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,920
Zhenzhen is lucky to have such good classmates like you.

610
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,180
It's a blessing for me.

611
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,040
Since you're already here,

612
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,320
why don't both of you stay

613
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,040
for dinner?

614
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,440
Who else

615
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,720
do we have?

616
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,320
Gu.

617
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,760
Jiangling.

618
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,920
For the relationship between

619
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,040
sin x multiplied by cos x,

620
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
there is

621
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,960
a very

622
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,920
classic formula.

623
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,020
Finally, pay attention to

624
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,610
the range of substitution.

625
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,330
Continue working on it.

626
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,180
Do you understand?

627
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,800
I do.

628
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,130
An Zhenzhen.

629
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm here.

630
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,240
Thank you, class monitor.

631
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,300
I'll write it after

632
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,920
I get back from training.

633
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:28,880
Mom.

634
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,320
I've replaced everything with new ones.

635
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,780
I'll put these vegetables

636
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,000
in the fridge for you.

637
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,010
Don't forget

638
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,970
to eat this meat.

639
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,200
If it stays too long,

640
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,240
it won't be fresh anymore.

641
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,720
Okay,

642
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,650
or I can cook for you when I get back.

643
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,930
All these years,

644
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,130
I'm grateful for your care.

645
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,290
This is what I should do as your godson.

646
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,680
Alright.

647
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,520
What else would you like to eat?

648
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,380
I came right away after your call.

649
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,840
I have something else to do today,

650
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
so I need to go now.

651
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,940
Xiao Jiang.

652
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,860
Why don't you stay for dinner?

653
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,290
I can't, Auntie,

654
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,400
I still have work to do,

655
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,860
I'll come again next time.

656
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,290
You're all leaving?

657
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,780
We'll come visit you again when we have time.

658
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,320
Let me see you out then.

659
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,280
No need to see us out,

660
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,210
please sit down.

661
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,280
Drive safely.

662
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,880
Will do.

663
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,720
I didn't expect that you,

664
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,120
as class monitor, would be

665
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,320
so dedicated to a classmate's parents.

666
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,240
It's nothing.

667
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,450
Her mother's

668
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,100
situation is special.

669
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
As class monitor,

670
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,080
I should do what I can.

671
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,850
Have you been

672
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,260
taking care of her parents

673
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,800
since that incident?

674
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,370
We were classmates.

675
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,040
I help when I can.

676
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,420
What about you?

677
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,170
I didn't expect to see you here.

678
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,880
It's strange,

679
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,460
I've been planning

680
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,020
to write a novel recently,

681
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,000
but after thinking about it,

682
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,040
I couldn't find any inspiration.

683
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,840
Then I thought about An Zhenzhen's case,

684
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,100
so I came to take a look.

685
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,100
You should have

686
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,370
told me earlier about this.

687
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,320
Feel free to ask if you need anything.

688
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,250
About Zhenzhen,

689
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,220
I know a bit too.

690
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,520
Do you know

691
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,860
why she died back then?

692
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,720
Probably

693
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,380
what everyone thinks.

694
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,860
In the end, Zhenzhen was under too much pressure

695
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,000
and couldn't see a way out.
