1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,160
Hey.

3
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,000
Wake up.

4
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,300
What's wrong with you?

5
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,680
You just got out of bed

6
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,740
and you're already out of energy.

7
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,120
How are you going to attend class later?

8
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,770
Can you travel less for work

9
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,570
and spend more time with us?

10
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,920
Eat quickly. You need to go to school after breakfast.

11
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,520
Your dad will take you today.

12
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,820
What's the matter?

13
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
It's the 100-day countdown ceremony today.

14
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,620
I'm feeling the pressure.

15
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,170
Sweetie,

16
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,480
the college entrance exam is coming soon,

17
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,880
don't overthink things.

18
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,120
If you have any problems, tell Dad,

19
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
and I'll help you solve them.

20
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,079
Be careful.

21
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,040
Stay safe.

22
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,160
Be careful

23
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,360
and stay safe.

24
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,760
Not bad today,

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
you're wearing your seatbelt without me reminding you.

26
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
Dad, please stop talking to me.

27
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,060
Drive properly

28
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,740
and keep your eyes on the road.

29
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,800
Don't speed up,

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,280
you're going over the limit, Dad.

31
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,480
It's only 50 mph,

32
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,320
how is that fast?

33
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,760
The safest speed in the city

34
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,089
is between 30 and 40 mph,

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,890
50 mph is definitely speeding.

36
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Dad, be careful,

37
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,440
that motorcycle is coming toward us.

38
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,480
Keep your distance from him,

39
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,560
slow down.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,200
We're still far away.

41
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,580
What's going on today?

42
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,080
You're not singing anymore,

43
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,210
not messing around,

44
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
and you're all jumpy.

45
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,680
The college entrance exam is coming soon.

46
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,320
I need to avoid all risks.

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Listen to your daughter.

48
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,440
Slow down.

49
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,480
Drive slower.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,400
Okay.

51
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Someone's there!

52
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,520
Someone's coming!

53
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,450
Let him through!

54
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
Be careful

55
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,440
and stay safe.

56
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,090
An Zhenzhen!

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,010
An Zhenzhen!

58
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,409
An Zhenzhen!

59
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,440
Can you hear me?

60
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
Who gave you permission to go home on your own?

61
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
This is a serious violation of discipline.

62
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,970
Teacher.

63
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going back to the classroom.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,560
An Zhenzhen.

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,720
What kind of attitude is this?

66
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
This behavior is dangerous, An Zhenzhen.

67
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,320
Zhenzhen.

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,530
Teacher Liu.

69
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,820
All the test papers have been collected.

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,960
Gu Ming.

71
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,000
What's wrong with An Zhenzhen?

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,260
Did something happen in class recently?

73
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,600
An Zhenzhen

74
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,000
is probably under too much academic pressure lately.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,060
Academic pressure

76
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,880
doesn't justify

77
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
such disruptive behavior, does it?

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,100
Wasn't she well-behaved before?

79
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,940
Senior year

80
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,760
is exactly when psychological issues tend to surface in students.

81
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,600
The closer the college entrance exam gets,

82
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
the more anxious everyone becomes.

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,530
An Zhenzhen seemed normal before,

84
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
but she might have been suppressing her feelings for a long time.

85
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,760
Everyone's under pressure,

86
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,020
but we don't see others acting like this.

87
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,320
Everyone reacts differently.

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,200
Some get depressed.

89
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Some can't sleep.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,520
And some

91
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,010
undergo personality changes.

92
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,640
An Zhenzhen might fall into that last category.

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Don't worry, teacher.

94
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,700
This is all normal.

95
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,760
Well, Gu Ming,

96
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
as the class monitor,

97
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,600
please take better care of her.

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:06,930
Okay,

99
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,240
I'll head back to

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,280
organize the 100-day countdown ceremony.

101
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,810
Go ahead.

102
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,800
Zhenzhen.

103
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,000
Class is about to start.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,530
Why aren't you going in yet?

105
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,040
The third mock exam is coming soon,

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,720
cheer up.

107
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,320
Let's go.

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,640
To all senior year students,

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
embrace your dreams,

110
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,440
Embrace your dreams,

111
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,040
cherish your time,

112
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
cherish your time.

113
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,160
and set sail with determination.

114
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Stay focused.

115
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,010
Xiaoxin, do you like Qianqian?

116
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,000
Embrace your dreams.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Yes, I do.

118
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,120
Then show it with action.

119
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,600
Make the most of your time.

120
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,840
Set sail with determination.

121
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,280
Set sail with determination.

122
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,940
Set sail with determination.

123
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,250
Where's Jiangling?

124
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,280
He didn't just vanish, did he?

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,880
That would be way too cheesy.

126
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,680
Embrace your dreams.

127
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,900
What are you doing?

128
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,720
Stay humble,

129
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,159
be disciplined,

130
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
be self-reliant,

131
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,440
persevere

132
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,360
until the end,

133
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,920
never

134
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,720
give up.

135
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,600
Number 23, choose A.

136
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,900
Pay attention to this.

137
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,080
I can't save you,

138
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,159
and you can't save me either.

139
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,060
For question 25, choose A.

140
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,480
Question 26.

141
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,960
For question 27, consider the context of the passage.

142
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,120
Many students chose 'Living'.

143
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
Option D for question 4 is incorrect.

144
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,200
Question 28.

145
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,360
You're dead,

146
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,200
you have no future, An Zhenzhen.

147
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,600
All I know is

148
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,280
I'm about to be reborn.

149
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
An Zhenzhen,

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,000
goodbye.

151
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,560
Zhenzhen,

152
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,180
why aren't you eating?

153
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,280
I've noticed

154
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
you've been acting strange lately.

155
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,740
Did something happen?

156
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,140
Class monitor,

157
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,620
do you know where Jiang Ling went?

158
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
There are only 100 days left.

159
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,540
Don't get distracted.

160
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,400
We're all worried about you, Zhenzhen.

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,600
Zhenzhen,

162
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,480
this final period

163
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,600
affects all of our futures.

164
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
You need to pull yourself together.

165
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,760
Future?

166
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,740
There is no future.

167
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
What are you talking about?

168
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,500
Come on, eat your food.

169
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,180
None of us has a future.

170
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,000
So Einstein was right

171
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,040
after all. The present and future truly have no distinction.

172
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
If the future Jiangling disappears,

173
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,570
the Jiangling in my timeline will vanish too.

174
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
Go take your exam.

175
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,160
Why didn't you come to school today?

176
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,690
Do you have any idea how I...

177
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,460
Never mind.

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,800
Last night we had a power outage,

179
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,820
and my aunt hurt her back in a fall,

180
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,740
so I stayed with her all night.

181
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,560
What?

182
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,480
Lao Jiang asked me to remind you

183
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,280
not to forget to pay the electricity bill tonight.

184
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,300
How is your aunt doing now?

185
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,800
Did Lao Jiang tell you

186
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,840
why he wants me to pay the electricity bill?

187
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,480
No.

188
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,700
How does he know about my family affairs?

189
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,050
Is it really me from the future?

190
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,610
Did you cash in the lottery ticket?

191
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,280
Yes,

192
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,320
but I didn't win.

193
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,780
The numbers didn't match.

194
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,800
So,

195
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,760
I'm guessing

196
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,220
that our two timelines

197
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,480
actually can't influence each other.

198
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Hawking once said

199
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,760
that the universe has an invisible energy

200
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,560
that prevents

201
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,080
any changes to its normal trajectory.

202
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,690
I remember this article

203
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,250
was when Hawking...

204
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,570
Whether we can influence anything

205
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,370
I don't care.

206
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
I just want to know

207
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,960
about this Lao Jiang you mentioned,

208
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,040
why did he appear?

209
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
I want to know too.

210
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,800
I've been researching all this for days,

211
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
and I'm about to lose my mind.

212
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm even wondering

213
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
if it's some kind of reality show

214
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
or if someone is pranking us.

215
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,720
It's like a dream.

216
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,280
Did he tell you

217
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
about the future,

218
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,560
is my aunt in good health?

219
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,120
My father,

220
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,220
did he come back for me?

221
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,680
What am I doing in the future?

222
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,480
You.

223
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,520
Your future.

224
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,300
I don't know about what you said earlier.

225
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,840
But

226
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
in the future, you'll become

227
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,540
an extremely successful writer.

228
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,720
Maybe

229
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,720
you'll just have

230
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,180
some financial problems.

231
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,780
What about you?

232
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,440
I'm dead.

233
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,840
Died before the college entrance exam.

234
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll treat you to meals from now on,

235
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,010
you should save your money.

236
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,960
For the future

237
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,490
when you'll really need it.

238
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,130
Well, thank you.

239
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,450
Go ahead and eat.

240
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,840
You know,

241
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm practically dying here.

242
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,520
Shouldn't I just go completely wild for once

243
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,780
and do everything I've ever wanted to do?

244
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,690
It was just a phone call.

245
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
You haven't even seen

246
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,800
the person who answered it.

247
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
What if that person is a scammer?

248
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,760
But what if it's real?

249
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,400
There's no 'what if.'

250
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Why overthink it?

251
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,360
What you should be thinking about now

252
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,600
is how to live the rest of your life well

253
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,930
and make yourself happier.

254
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,570
I can't save you,

255
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,480
and you can't save me either.

256
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,760
You have no future, An Zhenzhen.

257
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,980
Jiangling,

258
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,240
we will have a future together.

259
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,720
Right?

260
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,520
I'm not eating anymore.

261
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
This tastes awful.

262
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,780
Let me treat you to something delicious.

263
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,240
I wonder if heaven

264
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,200
has chips this good.

265
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,960
Actually, there are still many things

266
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
I really want to do.

267
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,319
I actually want to have a kitten,

268
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,369
I've always wanted one.

269
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,280
I also want to visit Disneyland,

270
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,020
I've never been there.

271
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:32,880
It's okay.

272
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,740
I'll go for you,

273
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,890
don't worry.

274
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,160
I'll take your photo with me.

275
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,720
I'll travel to

276
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,450
every place.

277
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,440
Why do you want to take me?

278
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,400
Why do you want to take my photo with you?

279
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
I'm about to die,

280
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,600
and you're still making jokes like this.

281
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,130
I really can't believe you.

282
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
I was speaking hypothetically.

283
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
Can't you wish me well?

284
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,520
What if I survive?

285
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,680
Then you could take me with you,

286
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,600
take me in person,

287
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,200
not just my photo.

288
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,020
Why would I take you anywhere?

289
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,640
To Disneyland.

290
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:00,800
No way.

291
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,480
If I go abroad to be a writer,

292
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
I'll write to you.

293
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,640
Be a writer.

294
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,060
Jiangling.

295
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,380
Let me tell you,

296
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,320
in the future,

297
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,000
no matter what difficulties you face,

298
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,880
you must persevere.

299
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
For your dreams.

300
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,240
Live well.

301
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,290
Understand?

302
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,000
Good.

303
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,160
You're awake.

304
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,960
Great writer.

305
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,170
Here,

306
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,820
have some noodles.

307
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,440
Let me tell you

308
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,240
you're so young

309
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,570
don't try jumping off buildings anymore.

310
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,320
Cherish your life

311
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,080
got it?

312
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,760
From now on

313
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,120
you'll be working for me.

314
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,400
Eat up

315
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,890
what are you staring at?

316
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,960
Here are the chopsticks.

317
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,120
An Zhenzhen

318
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,810
goodbye.

319
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,400
Mr. Jiang

320
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,440
Mr. Jiang!

321
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,480
My back

322
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,400
is killing me.

323
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,440
My back hurts

324
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,770
why did you have to jump off that building?

325
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I got you a vehicle

326
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,440
it's parked downstairs.

327
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:54,900
Take it.

328
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,520
For me?

329
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,680
For you?

330
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,880
Dream on.

331
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,210
For deliveries.

332
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,760
You know how to drive, right?

333
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,410
If you can't drive, you should practice more.

334
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,640
Hello.

335
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,200
Your flowers,

336
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,800
thank you.

337
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,640
Hello.

338
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,120
What are you here for?

339
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,240
Delivering a document.

340
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,200
I'm looking for

341
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,040
Liu Yaru,

342
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,520
Teacher Liu,

343
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,680
I have a document for her.

344
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,480
She's not here,

345
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,800
why don't you leave it with me?

346
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,520
I'll pass it on.

347
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,050
Not here.

348
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,080
You can go now.

349
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,000
That's

350
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,700
You Lifeng.

351
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,800
You're still here.

352
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,840
What kind of question is that?

353
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,760
Where else would I be, buried underground?

354
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,600
That's not what I meant,

355
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,800
I graduated from here

356
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,860
over ten years ago.

357
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,770
An alumnus, huh?

358
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,440
Yes, an alumnus.

359
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
I wanted to have lunch here,

360
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:58,840
but why

361
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,690
are all those food stalls gone?

362
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,240
They've all gotten old,

363
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,280
can't work anymore,

364
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,360
and young people these days

365
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
can't handle that kind of hardship.

366
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,960
Since you're an alumnus, you must remember Old Kong,

367
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,600
the one with the noodle stall.

368
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:10,880
The noodle stall.

369
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,480
He was the one

370
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,240
who led all those vendors

371
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,560
in a battle of wits against me.

372
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,400
I'd chase them away and they'd come right back.

373
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,520
I got criticized a lot for that.

374
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,480
But later on,

375
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,850
when they were gone,

376
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,980
I actually felt empty inside.

377
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,560
There's a saying

378
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
that's very true:

379
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,240
the best solution to any problem

380
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,440
is

381
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,080
time.

382
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,040
It's been too many years since I've been back.

383
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,500
I'd like

384
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,420
to look around.

385
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,040
Sure,

386
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
I'll show you around,

387
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,440
just watch your step.

388
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:50,970
Alright!

389
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,600
Year after year,

390
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,120
students come and go.

391
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,320
The school remains while students pass through like flowing water.

392
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,800
One day,

393
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,130
when I'm old,

394
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,000
and can't work anymore,

395
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,930
I'll be gone too.

396
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,640
No way,

397
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,890
you're still young.

398
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,960
Still young?

399
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,740
Look at all this gray hair.

400
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
This school,

401
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,060
after more than ten years,

402
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,600
hasn't changed a bit.

403
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,720
The school hasn't changed,

404
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,780
but I've grown old.

405
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,780
Let's take a photo.

406
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,130
How about

407
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
we take a photo together?

408
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,210
Sure.

409
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,340
It's been so many years since we last met.

410
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,160
You go ahead and look around,

411
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,520
I'll wait for you at the entrance.

412
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,050
Alright.

413
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,880
Today we have a new transfer student in our class,

414
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,680
everyone please welcome Jiang.

415
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,490
An Zhenzhen.

416
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,040
Keep reading.

417
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,960
It's...

418
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:42,960
Real.

419
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,800
Are you human

420
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,160
or a ghost?

421
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,800
It's me.

422
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,880
Lao Jiang.

423
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,610
You're not dead.

424
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,080
You didn't jump off the building.

425
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,880
I didn't jump.

426
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,760
You didn't jump off the building.

427
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,680
Why didn't you call me

428
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,480
to let me know?

429
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,580
Do you have any idea

430
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,650
how terrified I was because of you?

431
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,780
The weather these past

432
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,360
few days was so nice.

433
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,640
No,

434
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,920
what's wrong with you?

435
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,160
You suddenly tell me

436
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,640
that you're from the future,

437
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,120
then mysteriously die in my phone,

438
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,650
and now you're alive again.

439
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,410
Explain yourself clearly.

440
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,460
Am I dead or not?

441
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
This phone call

442
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,130
was indeed unexpected.

443
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
But as for everything else,

444
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm asking you to believe me,

445
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,720
I absolutely didn't lie.

446
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,720
So that means

447
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,560
before my college entrance exam...

448
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,360
I really died.

449
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,890
An Zhenzhen.

450
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,920
Listen to me.

451
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,840
How did I die?

452
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,580
The specific details,

453
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,010
I really don't know.

454
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,280
I only heard that

455
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,760
you died at school.

456
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,000
As for the rest,

457
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,420
I couldn't find out anything.

458
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,320
School?

459
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,480
I died at school?

460
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Was it an accident

461
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
or was I murdered?

462
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,560
Lao Jiang,

463
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,840
can you help me?

464
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,000
Help me ask the police,

465
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,860
ask my parents.

466
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,800
I know,

467
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,560
maybe our two timelines can't affect each other.

468
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,000
But

469
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,570
you're from the future,

470
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,120
you can find out more information.

471
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,000
You can help me,

472
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,200
I really want to change things.

473
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,330
I still have so many things I want to do.

474
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,680
Lao Jiang,

475
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,980
I don't want to die.

476
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,600
I'll do everything I can

477
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,040
to save you.

478
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,560
It's a promise.
