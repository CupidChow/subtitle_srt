1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,240
Time: 8:30 to 11:00.

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,170
Gosh.

3
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,640
Zhen Zhen.

4
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,480
Get up.

5
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
The exam is coming.

6
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,400
What strange dream?

7
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
Oh, my.

8
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Ahn Jin-jin.

9
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,800
Can you hear me?

10
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,340
There are 15 minutes left.

11
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,560
The exam is almost over.

12
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,120
Remember to check the answer sheet.

13
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,980
Don't forget to write your names.

14
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,660
Gangneung, right?

15
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,760
Yes.

16
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
Hello.

17
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm the guardian of Jiangling.

18
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,680
My surname is Liu.

19
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm their English teacher.

20
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,900
and class teacher.

21
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,850
He can come to school tomorrow.

22
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Okay.

23
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,280
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

24
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,600
This kid

25
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,920
doesn't talk much.

26
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Please

27
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,060
Please take care of me.

28
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,160
Don't worry.

29
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,120
He is now

30
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,880
a classmate of Class 3, Grade 3.

31
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you.

32
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Zhen Zhen.

33
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,880
Qiu Qiu.

34
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,320
I want to tell you

35
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,600
something horrible.

36
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,640
I think I had hallucinations

37
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,170
I think I'm hallucinating.

38
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
When I looked up,

39
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
I found

40
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
in the classroom.

41
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,850
When I looked up,

42
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,600
Liu Yaru looked at me

43
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,880
on the stage.

44
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
So scary.

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,760
Indeed.

46
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,090
It's a little scary.

47
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,760
But I think

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,720
you

49
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,680
Are you confused?

50
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,140
Why are you so mysterious?

51
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,660
Three jumpers.

52
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,570
When are you leaving

53
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,520
Brother.

54
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,360
You're going to repeat your senior year.

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
Why bother?

56
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,600
What's wrong with me?

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
Qianqian, what do you mean?

58
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,480
It'd be nice if you were a mute.

59
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,410
What do you mean?

60
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
I don't think you'll make it next year.

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,240
Stop.

62
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,200
I think

63
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,240
it's better to pick another day.

64
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,120
Let's go now.

65
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
What do you think?

66
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,240
Let's go.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
Let's go.

68
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,540
Monitor

69
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
We're going to the wishing tree.

70
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,480
Do you want to join us?

71
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,000
You guys.

72
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,200
If you have time,

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,680
do more tests.

74
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Yes monitor

75
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,540
Goodbye, monitor.

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,040
Let's go.

77
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,570
Let's go.

78
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,520
Qi Shuo, you're doing it again.

79
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,400
That's enough.

80
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,920
Stop!

81
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,920
Here we are.

82
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,240
So beautiful.

83
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,690
Let's start.

84
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,040
Start.

85
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,890
I'm done.

86
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
What about you?

87
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,400
Done.

88
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,480
Let's talk about

89
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
our wishes.

90
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,920
Okay.

91
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,240
If you say your wish,

92
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,300
it won't come true.

93
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,800
How shameful is your wish?

94
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,720
You're the shameful one.

95
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,680
How about this?

96
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
I'll go first.

97
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
My wish is

98
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,040
[I hope]

99
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,640
Maya's prophecy failed.

100
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,400
[In 2012,]

101
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,840
is not the end of the world.

102
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,640
All creatures

103
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,400
can

104
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,760
and liven.

105
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,600
World peace.

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,360
Zhen Zhen.

107
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
If you say so,

108
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,860
what do you want me and Qianqian to do?

109
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,159
I won't do these useless things.

110
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:45,920
I hope

111
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,640
I can marry a good man.

112
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,409
Youqian,

113
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,159
He treats me well.

114
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,760
Handsome.

115
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,480
Long legs

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,400
Just like Lee Min-ho

117
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,120
I must get into the film academy

118
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,360
I want to be an actress.

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,020
Superstar.

120
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,640
Superstar Qi Shuo.

121
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,240
Wait.

122
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,200
I found it.

123
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,080
none of us

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,320
about the college entrance exam.

125
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,450
I have another wish.

126
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,080
I hope

127
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,240
we can pass the college entrance exam successfully.

128
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,120
Have a good college entrance exam.

129
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,920
Wish you success in the college entrance exam.

130
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,080
Wish you success in the college entrance exam.

131
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,680
Good luck!

132
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,560
Do you think

133
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,640
be together forever?

134
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,560
Of course.

135
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
We meet every day.

136
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,640
Of course.

137
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,640
No.

138
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,400
Future.

139
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,560
I think you are all good.

140
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,800
At least you know

141
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,200
what you want to do in the future.

142
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,760
I think

143
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,480
I'm quite talented

144
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,000
in literature.

145
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,290
You want to be a poet?

146
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
What did you find?

147
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,500
Do you know him?

148
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,400
Handsome.

149
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,800
Is he coming towards me?

150
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,640
Thank you.

151
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,240
How did you...

152
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,680
Hey.

153
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,440
Can I have your number?

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,130
Her name is Ahn Jin-jin too.

155
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,800
What do you think?

156
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,240
Do you think his name is Ahn Jin-jin?

157
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
Why did he pick up my name tag?

158
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,080
Huh?

159
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,580
I remember there's money.

160
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,440
Where is it?

161
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,960
It's not here.

162
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,200
This phone...

163
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,560
It's been three days, Jiang.

164
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,450
You've been in debt for three days.

165
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,600
Come out.

166
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,280
Don't hide in there without making a sound.

167
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,040
I know you're home.

168
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,240
Let me tell you.

169
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,930
Even if you hide to the end of the world,

170
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,480
I will

171
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,600
out.

172
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,300
Editor-in-Chief.

173
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,650
You'll pay the payment next month, right?

174
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,120
Thank you, Chief Editor.

175
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,800
I've been waiting for that.

176
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,040
Bye.

177
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,880
I knew you were at home.

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,680
You hid in there without making a sound.

179
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,280
Bro. Xing.

180
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,400
We'll get married next month.

181
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Did you hear that?

182
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,840
Like this?

183
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,960
Guys.

184
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,560
Stop.

185
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Mr. Jiang said

186
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,720
to pay back the money next month.

187
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,330
Let's go.

188
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,580
Do you think I'm a fool?

189
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
Is this the first time I'm here to collect debts?

190
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,200
Bro. Xing.

191
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,320
I'm done talking.

192
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,040
Try again.

193
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,920
Again.

194
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,880
Hit me.

195
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,720
Right away.

196
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
I found it.

197
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,300
My phone is too old.

198
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,500
Editor-in-Chief.

199
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,120
Thank you so much.

200
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,000
I...

201
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,960
That voice...

202
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,600
Let me tell you.

203
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,720
Don't care who I am.

204
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,080
I have your friend now.

205
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,520
If you want his safety,

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,440
give me the money.

207
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,400
Zhen Zhen.

208
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,890
You owe me money.

209
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,960
Do you think it's possible?

210
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,360
Why would I owe you money?

211
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,520
Let me tell you.

212
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,640
He can't escape.

213
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,760
If you don't transfer the money,

214
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,820
you won't get away.

215
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,680
Voice phishing.

216
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,080
Let me do it.

217
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,680
Let me try.

218
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,520
Hello.

219
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,800
Brother.

220
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,320
We meet again.

221
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,200
I love you.

222
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,720
What is this?

223
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,580
Which country?

224
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,760
It could be his.

225
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,520
What?

226
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,240
My wife and daughter have it.

227
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,440
Let me do it

228
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Hello

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,560
Hello.

230
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,000
Uncle.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,120
Hurry up.

232
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
Hurry up.

233
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,360
Bye.

234
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,600
Sure.

235
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,400
Thank you.

236
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,760
Bye.

237
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,760
What are you talking about?

238
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,680
It's weird.

239
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,920
It looks like it's going to rain.

240
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,650
Let's go.

241
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,330
Let's go.

242
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,120
I haven't packed my clothes.

243
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,540
Let me tell you.

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,240
Whether you're Korean

245
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,320
or anywhere.

246
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,520
Next week,

247
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,360
I can't see the money.

248
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,680
and your family.

249
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,970
Impossible.

250
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,400
I saw

251
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,720
a super handsome guy today.

252
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,320
Really

253
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,120
Super handsome.

254
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,780
Where is it?

255
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,090
A place outside the school.

256
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,800
Gosh.

257
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,600
How handsome is he?

258
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,720
Super handsome.

259
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,200
Qiu Qiu.

260
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,320
Don’t you think

261
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
what happened today?

262
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,400
It's like filming a movie.

263
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,120
Is it weird?

264
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,560
Don't you think

265
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,840
a Korean guy today?

266
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,760
My Mr. Right is here.

267
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,000
My wish is finally fulfilled.

268
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,480
What Mr. Right?

269
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
Let's think about today's exam.

270
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,400
He's really handsome.

271
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,160
His ratio is

272
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,560
Super good.

273
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,050
You want handsome guys?

274
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,640
Forget it.

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,160
I think I got nothing today.

276
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,360
I think so too.

277
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,160
Today's math is very difficult.

278
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,360
The choice question is OK.

279
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,080
The big question is too perverted.

280
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,360
The college entrance exam is coming.

281
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,960
Have you decided where to go?

282
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,480
No, I haven't decided which school to go.

283
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,880
Who are you?

284
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,760
I told you

285
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,120
I don't owe you money.

286
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,250
Don't call me again.

287
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,450
Ahn Jin-jin.

288
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,240
410.

289
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,400
Call the roll.

290
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Hurry up.

291
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,840
Song Jun.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,600
Han Jin

293
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,890
Qiu Qian.

294
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,570
An Zhenzhen.

295
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,880
Pack up.

296
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,040
Get ready to rest.

297
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,360
You haven't hung up yet.

298
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,760
Are you really Ahn Jin-jin?

299
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,200
No.

300
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,880
Before you called someone,

301
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,440
before you called someone?

302
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,080
Just now...

303
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,180
Who's calling you?

304
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,320
Housekeeper.

305
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Are you at school?

306
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,640
What's wrong with you?

307
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:02,900
Bye.

308
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,339
This is Jiangling.

309
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,010
Have you forgotten?

310
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,859
Jiangling.

311
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,079
What Jiangling?

312
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,240
No. You got the wrong number.

313
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,970
We are Gao...

314
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
You're crazy.

315
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,800
Guys,

316
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,400
I have something to tell you.

317
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,000
We have a transfer student today.

318
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,080
will officially

319
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,140
will officially join our big family.

320
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,960
Please

321
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,290
take care of each other.

322
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,440
Come in.

323
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,120
Introduce yourself.

324
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,640
Look, look.

325
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,220
I'm Jiangling.

326
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,300
I'm Jiangling.

327
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,250
Have you forgotten?

328
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,240
Jiangling.

329
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,360
What Jiangling?

330
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,960
You've got the wrong number.

331
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
Let's welcome our classmate in Jiangling.

332
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,380
Jiangling?

333
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,700
You can sit in the last row over there.

334
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,960
We have four options.

335
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,160
This is an intro guided by iff.

336
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,520
What's that sound?

337
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,050
Who is it?

338
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,320
Ahn Jin-jin.

339
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,440
Are you playing with your phone again?

340
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,640
Give me your phone.

341
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,760
I muted it.

342
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,200
Ahn Jin-jin, can you hear me?

343
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,280
No.

344
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,040
Mr. Liu

345
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,140
Because...

346
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,800
Let me see.

347
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,960
It's not because...

348
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,680
Stop denying it.

349
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,240
Someone gave it to me.

350
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,960
Why?

351
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,000
I caught you again.

352
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

353
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,840
OK.

354
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,450
Let's continue.

355
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,800
If

356
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,320
the first sentence is in the past,

357
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,440
Then you can use any timeline at the back.

358
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,200
If it's in the past,

359
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,200
Excuse me.

360
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,440
I don't think we have a reason.

361
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,040
What do you think of me today?

362
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,640
Pretty.

363
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,160
It seems that

364
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,880
How is your makeup?

365
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,080
Qiu, let me talk to him first.

366
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,640
Do you know what you just said?

367
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,560
I think my lipstick

368
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
the color is not right.

369
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,040
What do you think?

370
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
I think the color is nice.

371
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,680
Really.

372
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,840
Help me find my lipstick.

373
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,200
Forget it.

374
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Get my phone back.

375
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,600
Phone.

376
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,930
You want a phone, right?

377
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,680
Mr. Liu

378
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,400
Please give me another chance.

379
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,860
I swear.

380
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,000
I swear.

381
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,900
there will be no next time.

382
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,960
Do you think

383
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,320
can be solved so easily?

384
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,040
If I give it to you today,

385
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,760
do you think

386
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,320
you can go back like this next time?

387
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,720
No, no.

388
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,080
I never thought that.

389
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
There was a reason this time.

390
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,780
It's all his fault.

391
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,240
What?

392
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,960
Nothing.

393
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,930
Ahn Jin-jin.

394
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,540
You really disappoint me.

395
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,400
If you want your phone, ask your parents to come and get it.

396
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
There's no room for discussion.

397
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,730
Go back to class.

398
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,960
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,120
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,920
Sports news.

401
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,320
Beijing Time 2012

402
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
early in the morning on February 24.

403
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Why didn't the new student

404
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
didn't come to eat?

405
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,880
Zhen Zhen.

406
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,280
Do you know where he went?

407
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,000
Of course not.

408
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
If I knew, I would have caught him.

409
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,250
You still want to catch him?

410
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,480
Qiu Qiu.

411
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,640
Do you know

412
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,400
If it weren't for him...

413
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,130
Look at this.

414
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,770
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

415
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,520
So funny.

416
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,040
The food in the canteen

417
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,500
to ensure your nutrition.

418
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,210
I didn't let you eat out.

419
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,660
because of safety.

420
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,280
Eat up.

421
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,320
Go back to study after eating.

422
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,480
Yes monitor

423
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,240
Is this cooked

424
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,160
I don't feel like eating.

425
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,620
Look at him.

426
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,800
Again.

427
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,240
The food in the canteen is terrible

428
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,600
I want to eat the chicken out there.

429
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,520
It would be nice if someone bought it for me.

430
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,400
Qianqian.

431
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,060
Your voice control

432
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,410
So annoying.

433
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,960
I can't even drive him away.

434
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,400
Mr. Glasses

435
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,600
is really obedient to Qianqian.

436
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,760
Qiu Qiu.

437
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,040
I have something to discuss with you.

438
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,880
Can you

439
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,560
get my phone back?

440
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,080
I dare not.

441
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,530
I don't think so.

442
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,880
My phone

443
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,520
because my dad came.

444
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,920
Besides,

445
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,840
your phone

446
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,600
your phone

447
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,320
How nice.

448
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,520
Safe.

449
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,320
Is there no room for discussion?

450
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,840
No.

451
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,400
Okay.

452
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,120
But

453
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
when Liu Yaru confiscated my phone,

454
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,240
on the screen of my phone

455
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,160
the three of us

456
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,400
in QQ yesterday.

457
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,160
in QQ.

458
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,200
What?

459
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,600
Did you watch the American professional basketball game yesterday?

460
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,640
Koby was so good.

461
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,480
Yes.

462
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,520
It's mainly a double tower explosion.

463
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
and defeated Niu.

464
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,520
Novez got

465
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,050
25 minutes and 12 rebounds.

466
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,320
Why hasn't Liu Yaru come out to the toilet?

467
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,680
How would I know?

468
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,210
He's coming out.

469
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,400
It's out.

470
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:42,920
Yes.

471
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,640
Let's go.

472
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,420
What are you doing?

473
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
Go now.

474
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,200
Zhen Zhen.

475
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,480
Liu Yaru accepted your phone.

476
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,360
Aren't you worried?

477
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,160
I am.

478
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,080
I was so worried.

479
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,080
But I had no choice.

480
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,120
She didn't give it back to me.

481
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,000
Why is Ms Liu so annoying?

482
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,920
Qiu Qiu.

483
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,540
How could you say that?

484
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,120
Ms Liu is a responsible teacher.

485
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,400
I was wrong about the phone.

486
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,320
So you think so too.

487
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,000
I didn't dare to say that.

488
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,400
I can only complain about the teachers with them.

489
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,960
They don't know Ms Liu.

490
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,840
That's right.

491
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,920
She keeps staring at us

492
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,850
from morning study to night study.

493
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,530
You know?

494
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,080
She has a three-year-old son.

495
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,160
She couldn't take care of him.

496
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,880
I can only put it at my grandma's.

497
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,920
Oh my god.

498
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,960
Mr. Liu is so dedicated

499
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,680
so nice.

500
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,370
Can we do something for her?

501
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Then buy a bouquet of flowers.

502
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,640
Nene.

503
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,680
Rose.

504
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,840
Ms Liu.

505
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,560
What are you two talking about?

506
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,440
We didn't say anything.

507
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,200
Nothing.

508
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,960
Don't talk about the teacher behind his back.

509
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,600
Got it?

510
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,320
Yes.

511
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
And the class is about to start.

512
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,370
What are you two doing here?

513
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,480
Go back to the classroom.

514
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,680
I think our plan

515
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,760
is perfect.

516
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,290
Shuo will get the phone.

517
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,560
But I'm afraid

518
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,960
if Liu Yaru finds out

519
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,240
her phone is not in the drawer,

520
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,040
She asked me.

521
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,900
How should I...

522
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Why do you have it?

523
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,920
You are...

524
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,040
Guess.

525
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,120
My phone.

526
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,520
Did I get it?

527
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,280
Of course not.

528
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,220
Because Gangneung gave me the phone.

529
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,760
I guess he feels guilty.

530
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,330
Whose phone is this?

531
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,800
Be brave.

532
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,320
Don't go.

533
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,760
I caught you.

534
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,800
You said you didn't call me.

535
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,080
Why do you have my number?

536
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,610
I just want to ask you

537
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,920
Why did you call me?

538
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,600
You're so strange.

539
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,400
You look the same on the phone.

540
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,560
in real life.

541
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,260
Division of personality?

542
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,160
You're crazy.

543
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,520
You're sick!

544
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Stop right there!

545
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,660
I just want you to explain the reason.

546
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,720
If you're done,

547
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I'll forgive you.

548
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,560
We're classmates after all.

549
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,220
I don't want to embarrass you.

550
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,610
Ahn Jin-jin.

551
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,370
Ahn Jin-jin.

552
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,920
Is that you?

553
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,410
Ahn Jin-jin.

554
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,080
Ahn Jin-jin!

555
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,940
Can you hear me?

556
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,560
Listen.

557
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,840
Why is this your voice?

558
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Can't you hear me?

559
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,650
Ahn Jin-jin!

560
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,050
Ahn Jin-jin!

561
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,330
Are you still there?

562
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,960
Don't hang up.

563
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,640
Zhen Zhen.

564
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,960
Why are you two together?

565
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,400
Ahn Jin-jin.

566
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,980
I’m talking to you.

567
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,160
What's wrong?

568
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:26,920
Qiu Qiu.

569
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,420
I’ll talk to you later.

570
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,800
Ahn Jin-jin.

571
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,700
Why can't I remember anything about you?

572
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,820
I only remember

573
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Sun Storm.

574
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,000
Electromagnetic storm.

575
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,800
Parallel time call.

576
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
No way.

577
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,720
Sun Storm!

578
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,760
Electromagnetic storm.

579
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,000
Ahn Jin-jin is really weird these days.

580
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,560
She ignores me as soon as she appears in Jiangling.

581
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,080
Do you think it's weird

582
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,560
Is it strange?

583
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,410
You're the same.

584
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,640
Do you want a beating?

585
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,300
There must be something between her and Jiangling.

586
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,560
Mr Zhou Chuan,

587
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,000
I have an important question

588
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,600
to ask you.

589
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,850
Which question?

590
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,240
Can you tell me

591
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,580
the parallel time call

592
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,880
and butterfly effect?

593
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,610
What is this?

594
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,040
I searched online.

595
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,520
The butterfly effect means

596
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
In the power system,

597
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,240
the slight changes in the initial conditions

598
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,700
will lead the whole system

599
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,320
which will lead to

600
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,180
for a long time.

601
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,600
This is a chaos.

602
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,360
In real time and space,

603
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,800
the butterfly effect

604
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
because of the parallel time call?

605
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,520
For example,

606
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,960
I've only seen

607
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,560
in math.

608
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,040
The rest sequence
