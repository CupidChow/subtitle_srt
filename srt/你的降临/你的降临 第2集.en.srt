1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,200
Time: 8:30 to 11:00.

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,240
Gosh.

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Sun Storm!

4
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,920
Electromagnetic storm.

5
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,320
Parallel time call.

6
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,320
No way.

7
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,240
Sun Storm!

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,560
Electromagnetic storm.

9
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,000
Ahn Jin-jin is really weird these days.

10
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
She ignores me as soon as she appears in Jiangling.

11
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,600
Do you think it's weird

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,040
Is it strange?

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,840
You're the same.

14
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
Do you want a beating?

15
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,680
There must be something between her and Jiangling.

16
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,760
Mr Zhou Chuan,

17
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,440
I have a very important question

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,079
to ask you.

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,920
Which question?

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,760
Can you tell me

21
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,079
the parallel time call

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,960
and butterfly effect?

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,960
What is this?

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,560
I searched online.

25
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,840
The butterfly effect means

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,880
In the power system,

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,720
the slight changes in the initial conditions

28
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
will lead the whole system

29
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,840
which will lead to

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,640
for a long time.

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,120
This is a chaos.

32
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,880
In real time and space,

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,320
the butterfly effect

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,840
because of the parallel time call?

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,040
For example,

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
I've only seen

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,079
in math.

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,960
the remaining sequence.

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,040
But if we use it

40
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,560
to physics,

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
how can you show the butterfly effect?

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,880
How do you present the butterfly effect?

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,640
Most importantly,

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,800
if we accidentally

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,080
change its original track,

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
will it affect the real time and space?

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,000
Ahn Jin-jin.

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,200
As a teacher,

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,160
I'm glad you're so interested in physics.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,440
But

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm a high school physics teacher.

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,840
If I could understand,

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,760
I'll hang it here.

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,040
(1879 - 1955)

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,280
It seems to rain.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,720
I want to live next door to you.

57
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,360
Standing at your house like a fool.

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,560
Hello?

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,079
This is Jiangling.

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,800
Jiangling, 2024.

61
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,720
You mean

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm

63
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,080
calling Jiangling in 2024.

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,360
Times?

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,600
If you really

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,720
in 2012,

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,200
In 2012,

68
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,040
Didn't humanity perish?

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,440
I've figured it out.

70
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
The one that appeared at your place

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
was Jiangling in 2012.

72
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,960
He and I

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,840
the same person.

74
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm Jiangling, 2024.

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
Am I dreaming?

76
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,600
It's not a dream.

77
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,480
I can tell you everything that will happen in the future.

78
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,360
In 2012,

79
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
September 30,

80
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,440
China's Good Voice will live in the Final.

81
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,960
The champion is Liang Bo.

82
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,880
November.

83
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,400
What is not a good voice in China?

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,160
Or...

85
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,120
What are you?

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,640
A reality show.

87
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,000
A human show, right?

88
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,480
I forgot.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,480
You...

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
It's the end of February.

91
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,560
Wait a minute.

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,600
Let me see.

93
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
The All-star Game

94
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
It's about to start, right?

95
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,160
Kobe!

96
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,800
In one attack,

97
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,320
Waid broke his nose.

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,040
I don't care

99
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,840
what you said.

100
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,880
I don't care either.

101
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
If this is not a dream,

102
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,360
you're a liar.

103
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,240
I suddenly remembered

104
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,520
You...

105
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,360
That thing

106
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,240
will happen soon.

107
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,360
What is it?

108
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
That's impossible.

109
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,720
Okay, everyone.

110
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,720
The poem evaluation question yesterday

111
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,600
is about expressing skills.

112
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,360
We just said

113
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,960
how to express it.

114
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,680
You...

115
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
That thing

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,159
will happen soon.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,760
Things

118
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,080
to express our feelings.

119
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,520
It's called

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,760
a will.

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
And

122
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,880
Let's talk about our current situation.

123
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,600
We use some ancient things

124
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,200
to refer to the slope of the closer line.

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,160
The slope

126
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,840
Its slope is 1.

127
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,200
The diagonal rate here is two.

128
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,480
Louder.

129
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,440
The first half of this double curve

130
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
is intersected.

131
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,360
Let's see.

132
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,680
That thing

133
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,520
will happen soon.

134
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,320
Everyone,

135
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,280
In this class,

136
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,040
we have a reaction

137
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,080
High school oxygen oxidation.

138
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,280
Combination price.

139
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,880
After class,

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,360
according to the teacher's knowledge frame,

141
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,360
Copper oxide.

142
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,760
In this reaction,

143
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,880
It's happening.

144
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,520
Hyoxide reaction.

145
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,680
Third,

146
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,600
Rehabilitation reaction.

147
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,200
Based on

148
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
and integration prices.

149
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
That's all for today.

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,560
Okay, class is over.

151
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,880
Thank you. Stand up.

152
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,320
Goodbye.

153
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,240
Goodbye, students.

154
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,800
It's Beijing time now.

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,760
2012.

156
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,920
February 26th.

157
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,200
[12:30 p.m.]

158
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,200
Welcome to the weather forecast.

159
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,280
Jin-jin.

160
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,960
Aren't you hungry?

161
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,120
You ran to the canteen first.

162
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,760
Why aren't you eating?

163
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,400
Stop looking.

164
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
He rarely comes to the canteen.

165
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,640
Jiangling.

166
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,000
The guy with glasses.

167
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,040
No food is allowed at school.

168
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,520
Why is he here again?

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,720
If something goes wrong, you'll be responsible.

170
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,000
Just come and eat.

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,560
Time to eat.

172
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,040
I'm talking about you.

173
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,159
What are you doing?

174
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,040
It hurts, you know?

175
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,600
What?

176
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,600
Chicken

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,480
Do you want some?

178
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,520
No.

179
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,800
I heard that the chicken he bought

180
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,159
was thrown away by a lady in the canteen.

181
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,880
He directly quarreled with the lady in the canteen.

182
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,000
The one you cook every day.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
Fried eggs with tomatoes.

184
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sick of it.

185
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,280
We eat this every day.

186
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,000
It'll be weird if we don't eat it.

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,680
Guys,

188
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,640
Am I right?

189
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,240
Yes.

190
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,600
There are eggs all day long.

191
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
No wonder I didn't do well in the exam.

192
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,560
And hair.

193
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
So much hair

194
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,440
I've had a lot of hair

195
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm full.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,520
Yes.

197
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,720
Qianqian.

198
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,200
That's not hair.

199
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,680
It's hair

200
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,560
I told you not to eat.

201
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,640
Why did you snatch my chicken?

202
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,520
Give it back!

203
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,040
You snatched me!

204
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,280
Come here.

205
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,559
He paid for it.

206
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,720
What's wrong with him?

207
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,159
Why can't you buy it yourself?

208
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,520
What a waste.

209
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,080
I get scolded every time I take it out.

210
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,200
This is too much.

211
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Get down!

212
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,440
Which class are you in?

213
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,400
Who is the head teacher?

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Call him here.

215
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,680
and your parents.

216
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,360
I don't want to eat in the canteen.

217
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,960
I'll make you

218
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,000
you can't stay in school.

219
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,080
Don't eat in the canteen for the rest of your life.

220
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,200
What are you looking at?

221
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,680
Get down.

222
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,200
Get down!

223
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,680
Stop!

224
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Smash it!

225
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,000
Seok.

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,960
Is he crazy?

227
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,440
Back off!

228
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,200
Step back.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,960
Be quiet.

230
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,200
Come down.

231
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,360
Come down.

232
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,840
Hurry up.

233
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,880
Come down

234
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,480
Come down.

235
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
The whole war has been upgraded.

236
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,600
Until...

237
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,320
Come down.

238
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
What are you doing?

239
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Are you rebelling?

240
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,120
Do you all want to be punished?

241
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,680
Then...

242
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,440
Mr. Glasses

243
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,920
Next, the punishment

244
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,440
of Class 8, Grade 12.

245
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,760
Considering yesterday,

246
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,000
Shi Xiaoxin from Class 8, Grade 3

247
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,720
in the canteen

248
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,320
in the canteen.

249
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,840
Therefore,

250
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,880
a serious warning.

251
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,920
I hope you can learn from it.

252
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,840
For 12th grade students

253
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,320
the college entrance exam is coming.

254
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,840
The school has decided the lunch time.

255
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,520
All 12th grade students

256
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,200
can choose to eat at school.

257
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,200
Let's go eat.

258
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,360
Finally.

259
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,600
Without me,

260
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,160
Impossible.

261
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,800
Great!

262
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,240
Sit down and be quiet.

263
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,440
We want fried chicken.

264
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,560
What are you doing over there?

265
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,240
Class begins.

266
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,080
Mom, I'm home.

267
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,920
You're back.

268
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
So many delicious food.

269
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,000
One, two, three, four.

270
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,360
Where's my dad?

271
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,760
Your dad is working overtime.

272
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Where is he working overtime?

273
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,320
He's a grown man.

274
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,640
I don't know where he works overtime.

275
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,520
He can't get lost.

276
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,960
But I want to have dinner together.

277
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,120
Let's not talk about this.

278
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,240
Well...

279
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,560
Look.

280
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,320
I think I'll cook some vegetables for you.

281
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,840
And

282
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,920
I'll cook shrimp for you.

283
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,360
Okay?

284
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,800
Is this enough?

285
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,200
Please.

286
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,480
Wash your hands and get ready for dinner.

287
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,640
Can I watch TV first?

288
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,480
You can't watch TV.

289
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,560
I'll just watch for a while.

290
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
Let me relax.

291
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
This kid.

292
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,080
On a rainy night,

293
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,600
the mysterious woman died under the withered tree.

294
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,440
But there was no smoke within ten miles.

295
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,560
What are they hiding

296
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,120
behind the murder?

297
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,680
hidden?

298
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,760
It's complicated

299
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,920
It's hard to tell if it's true or not

300
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,240
Ambush chasing the murderer

301
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,840
or time travel?

302
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,880
Who is it?

303
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,600
Who?

304
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,640
Who?

305
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,320
Who?

306
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,360
Who is it?

307
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,040
Surprise!

308
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,080
You're back.

309
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,560
I came back as soon as the meeting was over.

310
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,800
I want to spend more time with you.

311
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,720
Great.

312
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,080
Let's go eat.

313
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,800
Let's go.

314
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,120
Dad, sit down.

315
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,040
We haven't eaten together for a long time.

316
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,000
Thank you, mom.

317
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,360
Thank you, Mom.

318
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,640
Eat this.

319
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,480
Good boy.

320
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,040
Eat this.

321
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,160
Thank you.

322
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,720
Eat up.

323
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,400
Let me ask you.

324
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,520
how did you do this time?

325
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,840
If I do well,

326
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,960
is there any reward?

327
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,040
A reward for the mock exam?

328
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,280
What about the college entrance exam?

329
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,160
Can you do something practical?

330
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,040
Tell me

331
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,480
4S.

332
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,840
My phone is too low.

333
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,800
And it's stuck.

334
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,720
As long as you pass the exam,

335
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,800
I promise you.

336
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,040
All right.

337
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,640
Try it.

338
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,640
Is the shrimp cooked?

339
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,720
Thank you, mom.

340
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,880
Try this.

341
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,920
And this dish.

342
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,120
are all your favorite.

343
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,640
I must have made them for you.

344
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,000
You can't even shut up with so many dishes.

345
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,480
Eat up.

346
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,600
I think this is delicious too.

347
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,960
This soup looks really good.

348
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,040
Why isn't he online yet?

349
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,720
I'll ask you again.

350
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,880
Please interact.

351
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,840
Is there a big shot who knows about time communication?

352
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,680
I read a post about time call this morning.

353
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,840
I caught a cold.

354
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,880
But it was deleted.

355
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,560
So I reopened a post.

356
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,040
Do you have a friend who has the same cold?

357
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,119
You should

358
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,240
to Zhen Zhen's school.

359
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,960
At least meet her class teacher.

360
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,319
Why should I meet the class teacher?

361
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,880
Aren't you going to see your homeroom teacher?

362
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,680
and care about her study?

363
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,960
You can go.

364
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,079
Do I have to go?

365
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,599
An Jianhua.

366
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,599
Really study

367
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,920
You don't worry at all

368
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,079
Can you keep it down?

369
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,600
I dreamed of a ghost.

370
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,600
Nice.

371
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,760
Good morning, dad.

372
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,320
You didn't sleep late today.

373
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,560
Seize it.

374
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,720
Dad.

375
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,720
What are you looking at?

376
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,480
All-star in the American professional basketball tournament.

377
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,800
Let me tell you.

378
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,760
Kobe's nose is broken.

379
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,400
Okay.

380
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,760
He is handsome.

381
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,920
But I think

382
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,240
he'll get hurt soon.

383
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,600
What are you talking about?

384
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,880
You don't know.

385
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,400
Your dad is a fan of Kobe.

386
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,520
In this attack,

387
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,360
Kobe's nose was broken by Wild.

388
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,040
Stop looking.

389
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,400
Hurry up and pack up and go to school.

390
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,200
It's raining today.

391
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,680
Give her a ride when it rains.

392
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,480
Mom.

393
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,200
Don't go.

394
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,040
Let's do it together.

395
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
I want you two to do it together, Mom.

396
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,160
Let's go, Dad.

397
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,680
Let's go.

398
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,560
Stop looking.

399
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,160
Let's go.

400
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,280
Together.

401
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,480
Breakfast.

402
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,360
Eat it while it's hot.

403
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,400
Freshly cooked.

404
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,920
Fill it up.

405
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:13,840
Okay.

406
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,640
Wait a minute.

407
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,520
Take the umbrella.

408
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,640
The weather forecast says it'll rain today.

409
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,920
I'm leaving, Aunt.

410
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,200
Don't tire yourself out.

411
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,160
Take care.

412
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,960
Dad.

413
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,880
Stop at the intersection ahead.

414
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,800
I can walk by myself.

415
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,480
Walk by yourself.

416
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
Don't buy snacks.

417
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm not buying.

418
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,760
I won't buy it.

419
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,360
I'm full for breakfast.

420
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,680
Jiang.

421
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,160
Is that you?

422
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,680
Are you still there?

423
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,360
It's me.

424
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,120
I'm still here.

425
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,880
Did what I told you last time

426
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,400
come true?

427
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,600
Yes.

428
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,560
All come true.

429
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,280
So,

430
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,040
these things

431
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,360
in your time and space.

432
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,200
How do you remember so clearly?

433
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,600
The principal was hit.

434
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,480
for the rest of your life.

435
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Ahn Jin-jin.

436
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,520
Listen to me.

437
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,640
I can't talk to myself.

438
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,200
There's something

439
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
I need your help.

440
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm publishing a book.

441
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,440
I was scammed.

442
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,840
He's always hiding.

443
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,680
I had no choice.

444
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,360
But we

445
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,040
are not in the same timeline.

446
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,120
I can't help you.

447
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,960
I have an idea.

448
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,440
What about you?

449
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,960
let me in 2012

450
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,280
buy a lottery ticket

451
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,600
and let him go to the bank to keep his name.

452
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,400
With it,

453
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,520
it can solve my urgent problem.

454
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,400
Don't worry.

455
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,680
I'll pay you back

456
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,160
I just need to pay my debt.

457
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,120
I'll give you the rest of the money.

458
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,480
I only need a chance to change myself.

459
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,120
Okay.

460
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,840
But...

461
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,000
I have something

462
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,960
to ask you for help.

463
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,160
Go ahead.

464
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,520
as long as I can do it,

465
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,040
I will do it.

466
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,760
Can you

467
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,800
help me

468
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,240
what the future me is doing.

469
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,560
Are you happy?

470
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,360
Whether you have money or not,

471
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,200
Most importantly,

472
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,760
how my parents are doing.

473
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,360
I promise you.

474
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,320
Remember this number.

475
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,680
Wait.

476
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,800
Go ahead.

477
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,760
Do you remember?

478
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,680
Yes.

479
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,480
Tomorrow,

480
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,360
we must let Jiangling buy this lottery ticket.

481
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,320
Besides,

482
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,800
I found that

483
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,480
I can only call you

484
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,840
when it rains.

485
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,320
I...

486
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,680
It's thundering here too.

487
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,720
So,

488
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,920
we need to thunder at the same time

489
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,400
at the same time.

490
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,720
Not necessarily.

491
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm still

492
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,040
I'm still trying.

493
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,040
Currently,

494
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,960
I only know that

495
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,320
it's related to the thunderstorm.

496
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,480
By the way,

497
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,120
about what you told me,

498
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,920
there's another big problem.

499
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,800
Gangneung is too cold now.

500
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
I don't think it's possible

501
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,000
to buy a lottery ticket.

502
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,200
Listen.

503
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,800
Back then,

504
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,400
had a huge weakness.

505
00:24:59,440 --> 00:24:59,880
Guys.

506
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,080
That's all for today.

507
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,760
Class dismissed.

508
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,320
Stand up.

509
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,000
Goodbye, teacher.

510
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,720
Goodbye.

511
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,680
Actually,

512
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,280
I have a special hobby.

513
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,520
I like noodles.

514
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
There's a small noodle shop

515
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,120
there's a small noodle shop.

516
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,760
Go buy a bowl of noodles after class.

517
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,520
There are so many people.

518
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,680
How long do I have to wait?

519
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,880
In our city,

520
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,240
in this city.

521
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,640
But only the red specialty place put the most chili

522
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,440
The noodles are flexible. Line up.

523
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,960
Back then,

524
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,640
I often went there.

525
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,680
Great!

526
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,240
It's my turn.

527
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,080
Auntie.

528
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,240
Give me a bowl of noodles.

529
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,400
Excuse me.

530
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,480
Our noodles are sold out.

531
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,640
Come at night if you want to eat.

532
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,840
Sorry.

533
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,520
That's all.

534
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,560
It tastes terrible.

535
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,520
There's no oil or water. Why didn't you buy it?

536
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,360
No.

537
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,560
How could I not?

538
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,840
Why can't I?

539
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,320
I'm already in line.

540
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,120
Why is it gone when it's my turn, Zhen Zhen?

541
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,120
Where have you been?

542
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,840
You didn't even eat.

543
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,560
Yes.

544
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,000
Excuse me.

545
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,200
Excuse me.

546
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,440
Excuse me.

547
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,920
Excuse me.

548
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,600
Excuse me.

549
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,080
Great.

550
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,360
Why is he so quiet?

551
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,120
Yeah.

552
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,680
He's so cold.

553
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,480
Jiang.

554
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,480
Good evening.

555
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
I'll buy you noodles.

556
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,040
Here's the thing.

557
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,840
I observed the sky at night.

558
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,560
I think

559
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,640
like the noodles here.

560
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,040
You're not hungry, right?

561
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:38,960
It's okay.

562
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,560
The noodles are here anyway.

563
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,520
Are you hungry?

564
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,720
What are you doing?

565
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,080
I'll eat.

566
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,960
I'll eat it.

567
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,360
You...

568
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,560
Why?

569
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,760
Did I buy the wrong one?

570
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,120
Lower your voice.

571
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,240
It doesn't make sense.

572
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,840
I know.

573
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,320
Why are there so many people here?

574
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,480
Line up.

575
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,800
Jiang,

576
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,000
I bought

577
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,800
must be your favorite brand.

578
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,000
How did you get it?

579
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,240
I've been queuing for a long time.

580
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,800
And I've never seen you before.

581
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,080
Are you...

582
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
Zhen Zhen.

583
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,120
Why are you eating noodles again?

584
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,880
Don't you feel upset eating so much?

585
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,360
Jiangling.

586
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,920
You also eat noodles here?

587
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,040
You two bought them together?

588
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,360
Monitor.

589
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,480
You've worked hard.

590
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
I bought you some noodles.

591
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:42,920
Come on!

592
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,880
The monitor is studying.

593
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,960
Look.

594
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,600
It's affecting.

595
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,480
I should study too.

596
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,960
Study

597
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,760
Abandon

598
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,480
abandon

599
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,280
I've never seen

600
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,240
such a difficult man.

601
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,080
Have you heard of

602
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,520
Maya's doomsday prophecy?

603
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,480
I know.

604
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,720
It would be great if it was before the college entrance exam.

605
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,560
I don't want to take the college entrance exam.

606
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,760
Me too.

607
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,800
Let me tell you something.

608
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,960
About this Mayan prophecy,

609
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,200
I have a new understanding.

610
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,720
Something happened to me recently.

611
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,800
It's very scary.

612
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,280
Let me tell you.

613
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,760
Look.

614
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,520
That guy...

615
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,760
is going public.

616
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,040
Who's the woman next to you?

617
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,840
No way.

618
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,920
Accept the reality.

619
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,800
This should be photoshopped.

620
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,760
The photos are out.

621
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,920
It's photoshopped.

622
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,120
This face is different.

623
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,040
Is this the end of the world?

624
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,520
Jiang,

625
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,680
I'm not blaming you.

626
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,720
Do you really know yourself?

627
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,640
These days,

628
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,760
I did everything you said.

629
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,320
You didn't give me any hint.

630
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,360
No wonder he likes noodles so much.

631
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,960
He's completely crippled.

632
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,200
Like this.

633
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,880
If it doesn't work,

634
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,120
there's another way.

635
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,160
What is it?

636
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,640
There is a bookstore on Wanhong Road.

637
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Go find a book there.

638
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,400
Speaking of

639
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,960
Zhuge Liang caught the Mengmeng.

640
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,680
Why do you look so familiar?

641
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,920
Have you been captured by me?

642
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,000
I have a public face.

643
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,400
A public face?

644
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,080
Where are you going so late?

645
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,600
To admire the moon.

646
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,720
BA091.

647
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,920
You even look up at the moon.

648
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Lower your head and think about your hometown.

649
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,800
Nice receive!

650
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:06,640
BA091.

651
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,560
Stay inside.

652
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,920
I'll go to your dorm keeper.

653
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,520
to work together.

654
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,240
Are you playing 36 strategies with me?

655
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,400
Are you trying to divert us?

656
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,200
Ask your dorm keeper.

657
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,720
She can't run away.

658
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:36,960
Boss,

659
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,800
Do you have

660
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,600
Kim something?

661
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,280
What version?

662
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,920
Juicis.

663
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,160
There seems to be something behind.

664
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,280
Look for it yourself.

665
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,280
Okay.

666
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,040
Thank you, boss.

667
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,160
I'll go find it.

668
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,160
Hurry up.

669
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,960
We're closing.

670
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,800
Foreign literature.

671
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,520
Where are you?

672
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,120
Foreign literature.

673
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
None.

674
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,200
It's not here either.

675
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,440
It's not.

676
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,560
Dust.

677
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,280
Resurrection.

678
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,600
Foreign literature.

679
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,719
Paris Holy Mother Hospital.

680
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,920
Wuthering Villa.

681
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,159
Where is the boss?

682
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,320
I've searched everywhere.

683
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,760
Go to the back and look for it.

684
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,560
Inside.

685
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,600
The innermost.

686
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,880
How much inside?

687
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,400
Let me see.

688
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,320
Why are there so many books?

689
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Juicis.

690
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,480
You're not only difficult to understand,

691
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,280
but also hard to find you.

692
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,120
Juicis.

693
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,560
Do you like it?

694
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,240
Jiang.

695
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,240
These two books are

696
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
are my treasures.

697
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,280
I dare say

698
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,040
I'm the only one

699
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
in the city.

700
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,840
Here you go.

701
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,240
How much?

702
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,640
I don't want money.

703
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,760
I take money as a piece of shit.

704
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,720
Actually,

705
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,520
I just want to make friends with you.

706
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,400
Look.

707
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,240
I've been

708
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,160
these days.

709
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,000
I gave you your favorite noodles.

710
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,600
I gave you books you like.

711
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,800
Can't you see

712
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,120
the sincerity I want to make friends with you?

713
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,920
I took a look.

714
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,400
The money is just right.

715
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,840
I just want to be friends with you.

716
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,680
I don't mean anything else.

717
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,040
Take it.

718
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,640
We are friends.

719
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,720
Let me treat you to noodles.

720
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,280
No need.

721
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Let's go, good friend.

722
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,680
I'll buy you noodles.

723
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,400
Let’s go.

724
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,800
Jiang.

725
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,320
I brought my new friend here for noodles.

726
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,800
Mister.

727
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,920
You know each other?

728
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,760
We’ve known each other for years.

729
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Jiang

730
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,960
is warm

731
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,760
and kind.

732
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
You should make more good friends.

733
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,400
Get back to work.

734
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,320
Enjoy your meal.

735
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,960
I'll get back to work.

736
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,400
He's warm and kind.

737
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,600
He's so funny.

738
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,320
I helped him

739
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,280
I helped him.

740
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,960
You're different

741
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,360
from what I imagined.

742
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,120
You like reading novels like that?

743
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,520
Don't you boys

744
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,000
watch Doolo Continent?

745
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,040
That's literature.

746
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,480
Since you like literature so much,

747
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,520
why don't you apply for liberal arts?

748
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,440
Let me in 2012

749
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,720
to buy a lottery ticket.

750
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,560
I only need one chance to change myself.

751
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,920
Actually...

752
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,760
Actually,

753
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,800
I need your help.

754
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,600
Do you remember

755
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,400
the phone call I received yesterday?

756
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,080
What I'm going to say next

757
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,680
may change your views.

758
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,920
Be prepared.

759
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,160
The call

760
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,640
that called me yesterday

761
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,240
was from the future you.

762
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,560
You like noodles.

763
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,680
and read that kind of novel.

764
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,640
He told me everything.

765
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,520
See for yourself.

766
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,120
The day before you transferred,

767
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,960
the day before you transferred.

768
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,840
At that time,

769
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,360
I didn't even have your number.

770
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,240
So...

771
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,160
What do you want?

772
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,560
The future you

773
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,920
was cheated.

774
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,520
He's a terrible liar.

775
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,400
He asked me to take you to buy lottery tickets.

776
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,600
Otherwise, the future you

777
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,840
even dare not go out.

778
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,880
That's your only purpose.

779
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,400
My goal is to help you.

780
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,600
So...

781
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,280
Let's go to the lottery store.

782
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,360
Let's go.

783
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,600
I'll go after eating.

784
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,720
Fine.
