1
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,120
Sky.

2
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,920
Here I come, claw machine!

3
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,720
I'm here.

4
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,840
Okay.

5
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,920
Move that way,

6
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,759
like this,

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,729
to the right,

8
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,009
that's about right.

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,280
This machine doesn't work,

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,539
let's try another one.

11
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,280
One last time.

12
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,440
This time it'll work for sure, right?

13
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,100
This time it's definitely going to work, right?

14
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,280
That claw machine is definitely rigged.

15
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,079
The claw must be loose.

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,120
So many coins

17
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,040
and look at them,

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,360
they got one right away.

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,480
Why couldn't I get even one?

20
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,320
Bad luck.

21
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,000
Noodle Champion Challenge!

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,320
Come if you can eat!

23
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,440
Dear customers,

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,000
show your enthusiasm!

25
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,760
I just ate.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,680
Not eating?

27
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,140
Everyone, please join in!

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,880
Here!

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,000
Over here!

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
What's going on here?

31
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,200
Here, we have one.

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,240
We have one here.

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
There's another one here.

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,720
No.

35
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Here's another one.

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
You're the chosen one.

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,600
I've decided on you.

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,250
This is the last one.

39
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,960
I think

40
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,500
we've reached your place.

41
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,520
Yes, we have.

42
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Why don't I

43
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
walk you home first,

44
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,580
it's getting late.

45
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,800
No need, you're already here.

46
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
Just go on up.

47
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
See you tomorrow.

48
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,760
Let me walk you.

49
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,420
Jiangling!

50
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,610
Why are you coming home so late?

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Isn't this Zhenzhen?

52
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,520
It's been so long since we've seen you!

53
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,600
Our Jiangling has been

54
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
talking about you all the time at home.

55
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,000
No, I haven't.

56
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,040
Go help me bring back

57
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,900
the food stall,

58
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,890
don't just stand there.

59
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,880
Zhenzhen,

60
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,700
come in and sit for a while.

61
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,720
It's been so long since we've seen you.

62
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,850
Where have you been?

63
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:45,980
Auntie.

64
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,920
Jiangling, you know,

65
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,450
doesn't have many friends.

66
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
He was always so quiet as a child,

67
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,120
not good at expressing himself.

68
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,640
When you were around before,

69
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,700
he was a bit better.

70
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,600
Lately

71
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,930
he's been gloomy again.

72
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,680
Look,

73
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,840
now that you're here,

74
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,640
this boy

75
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,780
is happy again.

76
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,560
I don't think

77
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,520
it's because of me.

78
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,240
Actually, his personality

79
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,760
is quite adorable.

80
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,900
Are you two hungry?

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,360
Go upstairs and make yourself comfortable.

82
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
Today I'll show you my cooking skills.

83
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,620
No, thanks.

84
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,400
Jiangling probably isn't very hungry.

85
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,360
Go on, it'll be ready soon.

86
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,240
Go on!

87
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Auntie, I'm done.

88
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,490
Where is she?

89
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,440
She's upstairs in your room.

90
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,090
You let her go up?

91
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:28,960
No.

92
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,680
So this is a boy's room.

93
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,360
You have quite a lot of books.

94
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,080
I guess so.

95
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,440
Have you read

96
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,490
all these books?

97
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,640
Most of them, yes.

98
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
What about this one,

99
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,090
have you read it too?

100
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,160
The Lover?

101
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,480
This one

102
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,240
is quite good.

103
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,810
It's written by a famous French novelist.

104
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,840
It's about a poor French girl

105
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,900
and her love story with a wealthy Chinese young master.

106
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,880
Sounds interesting.

107
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,370
What about this one?

108
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,650
The Castle of

109
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,080
Crossed Destinies.

110
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,039
Do you know about tarot cards?

111
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,570
Yes, I do.

112
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,520
This book uses the structure

113
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,320
of tarot cards to tell its story.

114
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
It's really

115
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,040
special.

116
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,920
This.

117
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,010
Why does this look so familiar?

118
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,770
I think you sent it to me before.

119
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,680
Right?

120
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,500
It's not finished yet.

121
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,160
Faces in amber light,

122
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,240
yet somehow time stands still,

123
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,360
on the ground,

124
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,960
windows drawn everywhere.

125
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,620
Let time peel away endlessly,

126
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,860
years passing, days flowing,

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
keeping connections, preserving light,

128
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,860
like a lifetime apart,

129
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,780
just like the morning sun.

130
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,370
Morning sun.

131
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,420
I've never seen a sunrise before.

132
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,360
I think your writing is really good.

133
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,000
Actually,

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,930
you have a real talent for writing,

135
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,050
why don't you keep writing?

136
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,800
I believe

137
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,360
in taking everything

138
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,480
slowly.

139
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,000
So modest.

140
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,560
Now I finally understand

141
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,200
why

142
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,780
you don't make friends with us mere mortals.

143
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,840
It is quite annoying.

144
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,600
What about me?

145
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Do I annoy you too?

146
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,800
No.

147
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,360
It's getting late.

148
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,800
I

149
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,000
should head back now.

150
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,940
I'll walk you back.

151
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,860
Jiangling.

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
I can't sleep,

153
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,100
let's go watch the sunrise together.

154
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,880
Then you need to get up early,

155
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,210
go back to sleep for now.

156
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,120
Should we walk faster?

157
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,040
I feel like

158
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,730
the sun is about to rise.

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,080
No way.

160
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,760
Yes, it is.

161
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,900
Look, the moon is still in the sky.

162
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,040
When the moon sets,

163
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
the sun will rise.

164
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,000
Hurry, hurry,

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,060
let's go, let's go.

166
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,080
This child.

167
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,610
Let's go.

168
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,520
Look.

169
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,160
See, I told you we could see it.

170
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,800
There's another layer,

171
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,730
and another one.

172
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
Can you see it?

173
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,520
Yes, I can.

174
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,800
What a beautiful sunrise,

175
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,660
exactly as I imagined it would be.

176
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,850
I never asked you

177
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,520
what your dream

178
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,160
is?

179
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,080
My dream

180
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,800
is world peace.

181
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,880
Let's talk about something practical.

182
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,890
Actually...

183
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,920
I've always struggled to find my direction in life,

184
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,580
not knowing

185
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
what I could do in the future.

186
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,520
But now,

187
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,640
I think I've found it.

188
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,400
I feel like...

189
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,440
Well...

190
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,720
I could become an editor.

191
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,360
Why?

192
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,920
Didn't you say

193
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,050
you'll become a great writer someday?

194
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,250
So I'll be that great writer's editor,

195
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,440
and I'll chase you for manuscripts.

196
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,600
Keep you on track with your writing.

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
If you don't submit your work,

198
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
I'll come knocking at your door.

199
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,890
How impressive!

200
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,250
Then I better wish you success,

201
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,610
you absolutely must become an editor.

202
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,700
When that happens,

203
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,920
I'll

204
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,260
hide somewhere you can't find me.

205
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,600
So you, the great editor,

206
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
will be left

207
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
frustrated when trying to chase me for work.

208
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,640
No way,

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,460
I'll definitely find you.

210
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,840
But you know,

211
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,320
compared to when I first met you,

212
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,250
you're completely different now.

213
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,580
How am I different?

214
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
When I first met you,

215
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
you were so aloof.

216
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,720
Keeping everyone at a distance.

217
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,240
My name is Liu. I'm their English teacher

218
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,000
and also their homeroom teacher.

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,660
He can start school tomorrow.

220
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,920
That's great.

221
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,200
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

222
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
This child

223
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,610
doesn't talk much usually.

224
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,760
On the day I transferred,

225
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
I was actually feeling really down.

226
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,600
For the college entrance exam,

227
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,260
I transferred to a new school.

228
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,940
Everything here felt so unfamiliar.

229
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,080
Only 100 days left

230
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,680
and our high school years

231
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,210
will be over just like that.

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
In the end,

233
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,210
what will I have gained?

234
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,840
This name tag that fell at my feet

235
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
instantly

236
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
reminded me of the beginning of many novels.

237
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,760
Somehow

238
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,620
I felt it was some kind of sign,

239
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,800
or

240
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,020
perhaps a mission.

241
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,640
I don't know who gave me this

242
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,680
strange feeling.

243
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,800
I took it

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
and made my way to the wishing tree,

245
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,010
trying to find answers.

246
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,170
That's when I saw

247
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,640
you appear here too.

248
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,920
I didn't know

249
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,640
how to start the conversation.

250
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,800
I'm afraid I might affect the plot of this novel.

251
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,660
Do you know him?

252
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
He's handsome.

253
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,160
Is he coming toward me?

254
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,840
I think so.

255
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,360
What are you...?

256
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,960
Excuse me,

257
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,900
could I get your phone number?

258
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
That afternoon,

259
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,640
you bought me noodles.

260
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,480
Good evening.

261
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,170
Let me treat you to noodles.

262
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,850
You probably don't know

263
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,130
how terrified I was at that moment.

264
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,720
In my mind,

265
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,140
except for my aunt,

266
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,140
no one in my life

267
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,560
would bring me food for no reason.

268
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,530
Maybe I've been studying too much,

269
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,540
and that's why I overthink things

270
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,060
and my brain just crashed.

271
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,330
I instinctively

272
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,810
rejected you again.

273
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,280
Why is this place so crowded too?

274
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,820
We need to wait in line.

275
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Later I thought

276
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,120
that maybe

277
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,840
you really do love noodles,

278
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,080
that we share the same interest,

279
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,400
which I found amazing.

280
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,440
I never thought

281
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,580
we'd have so many conversations.

282
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,440
I usually avoid all contact.

283
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,240
Because...

284
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,560
I've never opened up

285
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,360
my inner world to anyone,

286
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,800
and I'm afraid to do so.

287
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,520
Do you like it?

288
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:36,840
Jiang.

289
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,000
But your presence,

290
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,320
your every move...

291
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,000
Yet somehow it made me

292
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,640
lower my defenses without realizing it.

293
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
My life

294
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,280
also became happier.

295
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,320
That day

296
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,960
when you told me about the cross-time calls,

297
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,040
I didn't believe it.

298
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,680
What's with that expression?

299
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
See for yourself.

300
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,680
But I realized

301
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,770
that this matter

302
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,720
deeply affected your emotions.

303
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,320
It led you step by step

304
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,840
toward the abyss.

305
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,099
What about him?

306
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,619
Did anyone tell you

307
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
about the future?

308
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,720
I died,

309
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,560
before the college entrance exam.

310
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,960
Making you give yourself

311
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,040
increasingly negative psychological suggestions.

312
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
I don't want to see you feeling down.

313
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,760
I don't know why,

314
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,079
but I want to heal you.

315
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,760
Even if this world

316
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,680
truly has predetermined fate,

317
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,940
I still want to help you fight against it.

318
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,080
I don't want your doomsday

319
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,440
to come true.

320
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,760
If there really is a deity

321
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,200
using this world

322
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,440
to write a novel,

323
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,440
and we are its characters,

324
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,040
using its invisible hand

325
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,160
to lead you step by step into the abyss.

326
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,020
Against death,

327
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
I will definitely help you fight it.

328
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,240
So,

329
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,200
I wrote a novel too,

330
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,760
to be your savior.

331
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
To prevent fate

332
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,340
from ever taking you away.

333
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,680
I never expected

334
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,520
that someone would make copies of my novel

335
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,240
and cause you new troubles.

336
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,280
Wait a minute.

337
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,160
She's just called Zhenzhen,

338
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,960
and her 'Zhen' is the 'Zhen' from 'pearl.'

339
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,280
My name is the 'Zhen' that means 'real,'

340
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
they're completely different characters.

341
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,000
How did you associate that with me?

342
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,060
Do you know why I called you both here?

343
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,160
No idea.

344
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,960
I've recently heard some things

345
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,420
about you and An Zhenzhen.

346
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
I had to call you both

347
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,920
to have a talk about this.

348
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,160
They say you're dating too young.

349
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,040
Us dating?

350
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,760
That's completely ridiculous.

351
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
To me, you're just

352
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,400
like a dim star.

353
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,800
Your energy is getting weaker

354
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,080
and to keep those around you

355
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,280
from seeing you fade,

356
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,500
you've been burning yourself up.

357
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,960
While I

358
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,400
am like a glacier.

359
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,930
No matter how much sunlight and fire comes in,

360
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,080
it still can't change my nature.

361
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,000
But this time,

362
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,640
I actually felt your warmth.

363
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,280
For me,

364
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,760
if your light goes out,

365
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,480
my world

366
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,130
will return to eternal cold darkness.

367
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,760
I can't let that happen.

368
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,680
What right do they have to talk about me like that?

369
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
I paid too,

370
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,930
and my money was stolen as well.

371
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
I feel wronged too.

372
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,040
No matter what they say,

373
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,320
I believe you.

374
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,000
So,

375
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,600
no matter what criticism you face,

376
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,440
I will always believe in you.

377
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,220
No matter what crisis you encounter,

378
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
I will always come

379
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,840
to save you.

380
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,160
Now

381
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,260
that the dust has settled,

382
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,220
you're still standing in front of me.

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,480
So Old Jiang's call

384
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,280
was just a nightmare.

385
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,000
The story we wrote together

386
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,080
is the real one.

387
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,220
Alright

388
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,760
we'll discuss this problem in the next class.

389
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,290
By the way

390
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,480
we'll be taking graduation photos the day after tomorrow.

391
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,680
The school will organize everyone

392
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,040
to take a group photo.

393
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,120
The afternoon self-study sessions for these two days will be canceled.

394
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
Canceled!

395
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,720
You can find your classmates

396
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,320
and teachers to take photos as keepsakes.

397
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,960
So

398
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,000
you can use your phones during this time.

399
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,560
However

400
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,080
you're not allowed to do anything else

401
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,540
just taking photos, okay?

402
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,320
I knew it,

403
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,880
as soon as I mentioned using phones,

404
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,210
you all got so excited you could barely contain yourselves.

405
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,500
Break it up now.

406
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,560
What's up?

407
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,760
Let's go get something to eat.

408
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,600
Let's go.

409
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,920
Look at you two fighting

410
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,450
and dragging me into it too.

411
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,720
You two weren't fighting

412
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,360
about me?

413
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,440
That was a misunderstanding.

414
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,680
The wedding photos weren't good to begin with,

415
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,560
and now there's no chance for divorce photos either.

416
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,290
You're talking as if you two didn't get divorced.

417
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,840
What?

418
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,040
As it happens,

419
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,960
I just found out

420
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,400
several girls in our class

421
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,000
want to take photos with you,

422
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,560
so I thought I'd get ahead of them,

423
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,760
being in a privileged position and all.

424
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,660
You certainly did,

425
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,240
there's no one else here.

426
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,240
Because I came prepared.

427
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,680
Jiangling.

428
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,440
I want to take a photo too!

429
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,040
Hurry up

430
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,760
and take our picture!

431
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,940
Take it now!

432
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,530
Let's make a peace sign!

433
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,960
Oh no.

434
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,770
An Zhenzhen.

435
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,680
What?

436
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,500
Gu Ming, get them in position.

437
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,240
Hurry up!

438
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,960
They're coming, run!

439
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,760
Hurry!

440
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,840
No, what is this?

441
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,400
Guess.

442
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,120
What?

443
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,400
Hurry up.

444
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,040
Stop talking nonsense.

445
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,800
Listen to me.

446
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,000
I've

447
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,400
planned something special

448
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,080
for our class graduation photo.

449
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,280
When the shutter clicks,

450
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,800
we'll toss something

451
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,760
up in the air,

452
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,410
and it'll look amazing.

453
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,480
Save some green for me.

454
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,040
Green.

455
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,330
Save some green.

456
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,400
What's taking so long?

457
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Hurry up, Qi Shuo.

458
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,240
Did you get my green?

459
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,560
Wait for her to press the shutter and throw it.

460
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,800
Come on, hurry up.

461
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,730
Move in quickly.

462
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,840
Stand still.

463
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,130
Did you get my green?

464
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
That tall person in the back.

465
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,370
Yes, you.

466
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,610
Switch places with that girl in front.

467
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,720
I mean you.

468
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,930
Stand still now.

469
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,490
Squat down a bit.

470
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,600
Alright, students, time for the photo.

471
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,600
Our two timelines

472
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,040
actually cannot influence each other.

473
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,520
Hawking once said

474
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
the universe has an invisible energy

475
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,600
that prevents

476
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
any attempt to alter its natural course.
