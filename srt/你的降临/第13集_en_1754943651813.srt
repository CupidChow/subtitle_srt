1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,160
Day.

3
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,240
Did you see that 10 yuan at the noodle stand?

4
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,880
Yes, I saw it.

5
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,450
Qiu Qian's name.

6
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,480
Qiu Qian.

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,000
Whose name?

8
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,080
Qiu Qian.

9
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,440
So I don't think

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,640
it was An Zhenzhen.

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,570
I don't think it was her.

12
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,320
She wouldn't erase it.

13
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,640
Why wouldn't she erase the name?

14
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,280
Exactly.

15
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,060
Quiet down.

16
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,600
Class is starting.

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,130
Stand up.

18
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,400
Good morning, teacher.

19
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,280
Good morning, students.

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Please be seated.

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,000
Now turn to

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,280
page 13 of the Five Three textbook.

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,800
Look at this.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
Why is Qiu Qian's name written on it?

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,760
Wow, it really is.

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
Qiu Qian's name.

27
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,079
Zhenzhen.

28
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,890
Dinner's ready.

29
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,920
Zhenzhen.

30
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,560
Breakfast is ready.

31
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,040
Zhizhi.

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,400
Zhenzhen.

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,800
Zhenzhen.

34
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,579
Don't scare Mom, okay?

35
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,880
Zhenzhen.

36
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,800
What's the matter?

37
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,520
Why are you looking for me?

38
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,720
Did you tell someone?

39
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,640
You're crazy.

40
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,240
Qianqian.

41
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,159
Don't go.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,640
Come here.

43
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Listen to me.

44
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,800
Did you tell anyone

45
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,880
about what happened in the classroom

46
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,760
this morning?

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,210
No, I didn't.

48
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,850
No, wait.

49
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,810
Don't come looking for me anymore.

50
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,240
Why is it you?

51
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,130
What are you doing here?

52
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Borrowing a ball.

53
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,600
Go ahead then.

54
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,920
It's you.

55
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,720
Let me go!

56
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,980
That hurts!

57
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,880
You stole the milk money, didn't you?

58
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,610
It wasn't me.

59
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,000
What evidence do you have?

60
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,600
Evidence?

61
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,320
I asked around.

62
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,900
The noodle stand owner told me

63
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,560
he remembered

64
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,080
who gave him that 10 yuan.

65
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Still denying it?

66
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,410
It was me.

67
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,320
I did it.

68
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,080
I framed An Zhenzhen,

69
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,730
but I didn't take the money.

70
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,560
Zhenzhen,

71
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,480
calm down.

72
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,530
An Zhenzhen.

73
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,800
Make way!

74
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Little kid.

75
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
It's not that serious.

76
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
Come on now.

77
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,800
You're in the prime of your life!

78
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,480
Think about your parents.

79
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
Don't jump,

80
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,409
An Zhenzhen!

81
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,200
An Zhenzhen, don't jump!

82
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,290
An Zhenzhen!

83
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,690
An Zhenzhen.

84
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,080
Zhenzhen.

85
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,260
Zhizhi.

86
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,000
Zhenzhen, can you hear me?

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,480
Whatever it is, please come down first,

88
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:00,960
okay?

89
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,920
Please come down and we can talk, alright?

90
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,520
Zhenzhen!

91
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,880
Zhenzhen, don't stand up there,

92
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,240
come down and we can talk properly.

93
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,000
Quick, call the fire department!

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,440
Hurry!

95
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,120
Zhenzhen!

96
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
We believe you didn't steal the milk money.

97
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,680
Listen to me,

98
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,120
I've always believed in you.

99
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,380
Please come down first, okay?

100
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
I've always believed in you.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,200
I've always believed in you, Zhenzhen.

102
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,920
No!

103
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,640
Zhenzhen!

104
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,840
Please come down, Zhenzhen.

105
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,320
It's not worth it!

106
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,720
Think about your parents.

107
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,039
We know you didn't steal the milk money.

108
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,760
We believe you.

109
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,800
Please come down and we can talk, okay?

110
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
That's right, Zhenzhen.

111
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,080
We can talk this through.

112
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,280
An Zhenzhen!

113
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,640
An Zhenzhen!

114
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,040
Zhizhi!

115
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,530
An Zhenzhen!

116
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,360
An Zhenzhen!

117
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,960
Calm down!

118
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,120
We were just trying to scare you before.

119
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,080
We believe you.

120
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,720
Yes,

121
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,440
we believe in you.

122
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,560
Don't do anything stupid,

123
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,160
Zhenzhen.

124
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,120
That's right, don't do this.

125
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,850
An Zhenzhen,

126
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,920
come down.

127
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,800
Zhenzhen!

128
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,080
Zhenzhen!

129
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,720
Zhenzhen, come down,

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,760
please come down.

131
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
We know it wasn't you.

132
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,160
We trust you,

133
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,400
we all believe in you.

134
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Don't jump, An Zhenzhen,

135
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,280
come down.

136
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,880
Zhenzhen, please come down now!

137
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,930
An Zhenzhen.

138
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,360
We believe you.

139
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,000
Please come down now.

140
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
Come down, Zhenzhen.

141
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,440
Don't jump.

142
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,410
An Zhenzhen.

143
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,200
Let me ask you,

144
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,130
shouldn't people admit when they've made mistakes?

145
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,040
How can you not admit when you've done something wrong?

146
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,800
A mistake is a mistake,

147
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,480
what's so hard about admitting it?

148
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,610
What should I admit?

149
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
I already told you.

150
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
I didn't steal anything.

151
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
Is that how you talk to your mother?

152
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,560
You're getting more and more disrespectful.

153
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
You're my best friend.

154
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,440
You're my best friend,

155
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,960
go back

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,130
and tell your sister

157
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,520
to stay away from my dad,

158
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
stay away from our family.

159
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
How can you be so scheming?

160
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,640
You're so manipulative.

161
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
You're still pretending to be innocent in front of me.

162
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,320
You're the most disgusting

163
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,520
and shameless person I've ever met.

164
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,120
Found it.

165
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,130
Take it away.

166
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,800
Zhenzhen stole it.

167
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,860
You didn't take it.

168
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,960
Who took it?

169
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,880
Why is it in your pencil case?

170
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,120
Give me back my money!

171
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,880
You have no future, An Zhenzhen.

172
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,440
What damn future?

173
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,980
I'm already dead before the college entrance exam.

174
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,440
An Zhenzhen!

175
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,640
Zhenzhen!

176
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,960
Don't jump!

177
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,690
The money's been found.

178
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,290
The money's been found.

179
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,720
Tell me

180
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,560
what else you did.

181
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,720
I don't know.

182
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know why things

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,130
turned out this way.

184
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,360
You don't know about

185
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
your own actions?

186
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,840
Money.

187
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,800
Hasn't the money already been returned?

188
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,480
So what?

189
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,760
I didn't steal the money.

190
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,920
I just...

191
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,810
Equipment room.

192
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,040
Shoelaces.

193
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,960
Milk money.

194
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Sometimes I really don't understand

195
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,960
aren't you two friends?

196
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,080
But

197
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I didn't steal it.

198
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,800
I didn't steal anything,

199
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
why would you do this?

200
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,420
Qi Shuo,

201
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,060
you don't have to tell me your motive.

202
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm giving you three days

203
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,060
to explain everything to her.

204
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,360
Zhenzhen.

205
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,080
Since we've found the money,

206
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,640
let's not think about it anymore,

207
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,770
and focus on preparing for your exams.

208
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,320
As for school,

209
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,160
I've asked for a few days off for you.

210
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,040
We won't go there for the next few days.

211
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,440
And I've already spoken to your father about it.

212
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,880
It's just that recently,

213
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,610
you didn't believe me, did you?

214
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,010
That's not true.

215
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,480
Mom has always believed you.

216
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,880
Don't say anything more.

217
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,500
I saw everything clearly.

218
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:20,920
Zhenzhen.

219
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,140
This money,

220
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,680
mommy will save it for you

221
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
for your graduation trip later,

222
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,880
okay?

223
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,160
Zhenzhen.

224
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,200
Zhenzhen.

225
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,200
No matter what they say.

226
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,080
I believe you.

227
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,100
How was it resolved in the end?

228
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,120
I don't know,

229
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,720
someone returned the money,

230
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,370
so it has nothing to do with me anymore.

231
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,620
Does the teacher know?

232
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,330
I don't know.

233
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,290
An Zhenzhen is just a teenager,

234
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,210
facing this kind of situation,

235
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,570
it's quite pitiful.

236
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,880
Besides,

237
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,690
when she was running last time,

238
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,250
the problem with her shoes,

239
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,840
I really didn't do it.

240
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,540
Now they all suspect it was me.

241
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,600
She really doesn't know

242
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,800
that her parents are already divorced,

243
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,650
saying those things to you,

244
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,440
don't blame her too much.

245
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,480
But now you dare to do anything,

246
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,120
Qi Shuo.

247
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,960
I just can't stand people talking bad about you.

248
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,280
You don't know what her attitude was like,

249
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,480
I had to make her taste

250
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,860
what it feels like to be falsely accused.

251
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,290
When she comes back,

252
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
go help her out.

253
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,760
I'm running out of time, sis.

254
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,440
Jiangling gave me three days

255
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,220
to come clean with her.

256
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,650
If she finds out,

257
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,760
I'm done for.

258
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,960
You'll only be with your high school classmates for a few more days.

259
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
You'll all be going your separate ways soon,

260
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,450
not seeing each other anymore.

261
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,360
But I still have that connection with An Zhenzhen's father,

262
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,490
that relationship,

263
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,020
so you and Zhenzhen will inevitably meet again.

264
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,160
Those truths

265
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,240
might need to come to light now.

266
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Better a moment of pain than prolonged suffering.

267
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
One day,

268
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,960
when she accepts the reality,

269
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
she'll naturally stop blaming you.

270
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,880
Zhenzhen.

271
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,080
Zhenzhen.

272
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,770
Mom's coming in, Zhenzhen.

273
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,530
Teacher Liu.

274
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,880
Hello.

275
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,520
Yes.

276
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,600
She's resting now.

277
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,800
Okay.

278
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,040
I understand the school's position,

279
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,800
I really do.

280
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,280
Alright.

281
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,560
Thank you for your trouble,

282
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,490
I appreciate it.

283
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,560
Okay.

284
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,180
Goodbye, Teacher Liu.

285
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,280
Zhenzhen.

286
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,370
Don't space out.

287
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,600
Noodles are here!

288
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:53,900
Thanks.

289
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,490
Enjoy your meal.

290
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You two have been coming here for noodles a lot lately?

291
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,760
That's because your noodles are delicious, Kong.

292
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,730
I love hearing that.

293
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,660
Take your time.

294
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,660
Please eat something.

295
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,040
I'm sorry, Mom.

296
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,490
I really don't have much appetite.

297
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,200
No appetite?

298
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,560
You still need to eat something.

299
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,720
Here.

300
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,530
Chopsticks.

301
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,840
The number you have dialed is powered off.

302
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,210
Hello, the number you have dialed is powered off.

303
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,690
I can't run anymore.

304
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,040
What kind of hellish training is this?

305
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,560
Why do you get to ride a bike

306
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,900
while I have to run?

307
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,280
Riding a bike isn't tiring for me.

308
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,340
But I'm exhausted.

309
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,850
I can't go on.

310
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,720
I quit.

311
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,400
Whoever stops moving

312
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,480
gains 3 pounds.

313
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,760
3 kilograms

314
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,840
10 kilograms.

315
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,920
Eating hotpot with an ulcer.

316
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You're hardcore.

317
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,600
Jiang,

318
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,060
help me deliver this takeout.

319
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,480
Be careful when riding your bike.

320
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,080
Got it.

321
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,930
Look who's here.

322
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,120
Zhenzhen.

323
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,080
Zhenzhen.

324
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,800
Teacher Liu.

325
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,120
Zhenzhen.

326
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,740
The class monitor and I came to see you on behalf of everyone

327
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,880
and brought you some study materials.

328
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,280
And some small gifts too.

329
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,720
Everyone

330
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
misses you so much

331
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,680
and hopes you'll come back soon.

332
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,240
Thank you.

333
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,700
Take a look.

334
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,410
Teacher Liu.

335
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Why don't you stay for a simple meal?

336
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,020
No need, Mrs. Zhen.

337
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,760
We still have a lot to do at school,

338
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,690
so we can't stay.

339
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,920
Don't worry, Zhenzhen,

340
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,680
all the exam prep materials

341
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,040
have been organized for you.

342
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,000
You can just check my notes when you return.

343
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,440
Zhenzhen,

344
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,720
the teacher is leaving.

345
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,380
Zhenzhen, we'll be going now.

346
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,380
Then let me see you out.

347
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,240
This way, please.
