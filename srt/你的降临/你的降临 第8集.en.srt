1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,410
I passed!

3
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,810
I made it.

4
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
I passed the exam.

5
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,080
I got through.

6
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,920
I made it.

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,840
I passed.

8
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,170
Hey, what about my results?

9
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,000
Can someone help me out?

10
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,090
I'm happy today,

11
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,880
my treat for noodles.

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,860
Noodles again?

13
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,040
I think

14
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,760
hot pot would be nice too.

15
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Let's get hot pot.

16
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Cheers!

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,660
We've worked hard.

18
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,720
So it's just during this period,

19
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,560
thank you.

20
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
If it weren't for you,

21
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,520
I wouldn't have improved so much.

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,450
Right, good job.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,640
Anyway,

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,640
I just hope

25
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,800
we both pass the minimum score,

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,860
and get into our dream universities.

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,800
If you eat this much, you need to exercise more,

28
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,560
don't just eat without working it off.

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,620
Because I think...

30
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,340
What are you trying to say?

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,720
You're not...

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,400
An Zhenzhen.

33
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,160
Aren't you always

34
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,890
asking about what she's doing?

35
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,320
Is there something between you two?

36
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,520
I've told you before,

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,640
I'm writing a

38
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,400
novel based on

39
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,360
her.

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,920
These unrealistic ideas of yours.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,260
Guess what,

42
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
I passed by

43
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,960
An Zhenzhen's house today,

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,290
and guess who I ran into?

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,160
Definitely not An Zhenzhen.

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,480
I ran into that

47
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,620
class monitor.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,970
What was he doing at Zhenzhen's place?

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,600
Acting like her adopted son.

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,280
He was being so attentive.

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,600
Meat,

52
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,760
vegetables,

53
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,560
oil, rice, and everything else -

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,760
he took care of it all.

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,820
That's our class monitor for you.

56
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,680
Whenever someone has an issue,

57
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,880
he's there in no time.

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,820
Good people

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,320
get rewarded.

60
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
You know what,

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,280
help me

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
polish

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,440
this

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,840
screenplay.

65
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,280
A screenplay, really?

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,480
If it's good, it could be bought

67
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
for film or TV.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,959
Don't you want to be an actor?

69
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,320
I'll give you a role.

70
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,959
I'm taking you seriously then.

71
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,440
Wait,

72
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,240
we haven't signed a contract yet.

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,040
Hurry up, stop dawdling.

74
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,540
Hold on, let me think about it.

75
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,960
What exactly happened that day?

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,020
You know, that day.

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,580
I remember.

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,460
What happened?

79
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,800
Tell me.

80
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,640
I remember.

81
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:40,960
No.

82
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,920
Come on, Qi Shuo, tell us.

83
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
On your marks.

84
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,880
I won!

85
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
I won, Dad!

86
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,600
Did you see?

87
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
I came in first!

88
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,040
That's my girl!

89
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,080
Really impressive.

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
I didn't disappoint you, did I?

91
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,280
Wonderful!

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Amazing!

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,159
I won!

94
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,400
This is my daughter.

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
Indeed.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,600
Lao Jiang,

97
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,760
is that you?

98
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,240
Finally got through.

99
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,440
Zhenzhen.

100
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,220
I have some breaking news.

101
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
Need to sync with you.

102
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,330
What did you say?

103
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,490
Look at this.

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,050
It can even talk.

105
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
You scared me.

106
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,280
Let's go.

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,080
Bye.

108
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,360
You still haven't told me

109
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,290
what happened during that PE exam?

110
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,380
Nothing happened.

111
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,400
Do you need a drink to tell the truth?

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,040
I've told you

113
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,240
everything I know.

114
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,440
Xiao Li.

115
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,160
Come.

116
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,320
Take over my shift.

117
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,250
I have something

118
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,180
to do later.

119
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,920
I really have something to do.

120
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,640
I'm leaving.

121
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,480
Bye.

122
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,960
Class monitor.

123
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,560
The bus is about to leave,

124
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,620
hurry up and get on.

125
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,420
Class monitor,

126
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,160
are you also applying for the sports program?

127
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm not participating.

128
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,840
The homeroom teacher asked me to organize things.

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,560
So we can look after each other

130
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,760
and feel more at ease.

131
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,340
Class monitor.

132
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,120
That's so touching.

133
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,920
Get on quickly.

134
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,400
Qi Shuo.

135
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,120
Why are you here?

136
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,250
I brought you shoes,

137
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,240
wear these,

138
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
and you'll definitely make the cut.

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,640
Sis, you're always reliable.

140
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
Where did it go?

141
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,080
It's not here?

142
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
How can it not be here?

143
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,360
This one's empty too.

144
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,559
Nothing anywhere.

145
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,970
An Zhenzhen!

146
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,680
How could they be gone?

147
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,440
An Zhenzhen!

148
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,540
What are you doing?

149
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,440
Jiangling,

150
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,240
what should I do?

151
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,370
I can't find my exam admission ticket.

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,380
Think about it,

153
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,530
where did you put it?

154
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
I've looked everywhere,

155
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
but I can't find it.

156
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,120
Under the bed,

157
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,650
did you check your pockets?

158
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,040
I already checked under the bed.

159
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,700
My clothes.

160
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,680
My jacket.

161
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,200
You two go to the equipment room

162
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,660
and leave the water with the security guard.

163
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,480
I know where to go.

164
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,560
Why isn't An Zhenzhen here yet?

165
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,440
Teacher, could you wait a little longer?

166
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,280
Look at the time,

167
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,880
she's about to miss the test.

168
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,890
I'll go find her.

169
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,960
I'll go

170
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,120
to the girls' dorm

171
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,050
since it's more convenient for me.

172
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,400
Thank you for your help.

173
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,060
No problem.

174
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,400
Go on up.

175
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,690
Teacher,

176
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,200
may I use the restroom?

177
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,260
Okay, but be quick.

178
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,520
Did you find it?

179
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,200
No,

180
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,560
I remember it was in a basket.

181
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,480
I found it.

182
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Why is it locked?

183
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,640
Who locked it?

184
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,370
Is anyone there?

185
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,080
Help!

186
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
There are people in here!

187
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,200
Mr. You Lifeng!

188
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,880
Someone!

189
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,040
Help us!

190
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,420
There's another door.

191
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,000
I checked that door.

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,930
It's locked too.

193
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,900
Use your phone.

194
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,040
It's over.

195
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,600
I left my stuff in the dorm.

196
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,730
Where's your phone?

197
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,020
It's in the car.

198
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,290
We're definitely not going to make it.

199
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,040
Don't give up.

200
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,320
Let's think of another way.

201
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,580
There must be a way out.

202
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,040
Teacher.

203
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,170
Is An Zhenzhen here?

204
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,240
No, she's not.

205
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,280
I just went to An Zhenzhen's dorm,

206
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,480
but she wasn't there.

207
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,920
We're out of time.

208
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,240
We can't wait anymore.

209
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,300
We're leaving now.

210
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,920
Are you getting on?

211
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,180
If not, we're leaving.

212
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Let's go, driver.

213
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,360
Old Jiang was right.

214
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,320
He said

215
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,840
there was an accident on our physical test day.

216
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,780
You believe whatever he says?

217
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,420
But I'm really stuck here now.

218
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Don't lose heart,

219
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,210
we'll find a way out.

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,400
Okay.

221
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,730
Alright.

222
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,500
Come on.

223
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,900
Come where?

224
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,860
Get up here.

225
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,200
Up here.

226
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,620
I won't have an accident here, will I?

227
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,180
Come on.

228
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,290
Careful.

229
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,090
Take it slow.

230
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,970
How is it?

231
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,920
Can you reach it?

232
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,560
No,

233
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,040
I'm still short.

234
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,880
Try knocking

235
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,520
to see if anyone's there.

236
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,080
I can't

237
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,170
I can't reach it.

238
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,680
The glass is too high.

239
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,280
Stand steady,

240
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,920
I'll come up and support you.

241
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,090
I'll lift you up.

242
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,240
You.

243
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,560
Is that okay?

244
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,520
Wait.

245
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,740
What are you two doing?

246
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,880
Which class are you from?

247
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,810
Come out.

248
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,380
What are you doing?

249
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Stop right there!

250
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,920
I'll remember all of you.

251
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,210
Stop!

252
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,320
The car.

253
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,700
The car's gone.

254
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,570
What do we do now?

255
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,020
Let's get another cab.

256
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,240
It's rush hour.

257
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,480
Where are we going to find a taxi?

258
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,680
And we don't have our phones.

259
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,610
So what can we do?

260
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,000
Don't panic.

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,600
Come here.

262
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,520
Mr. You.

263
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,560
Does the school have any other vehicles?

264
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
What kind of vehicle?

265
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,760
Meet at 8 o'clock,

266
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,640
what are you guys doing?

267
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,120
I left my exam admission card in the volleyball room.

268
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,000
Is it that hard to find something in the volleyball room?

269
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,600
Looking for the card while hugging each other?

270
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,640
You guys locked the door,

271
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,480
so we had to climb out.

272
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,120
You two were hugging each other.

273
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,840
How could I get out if he didn't help me?

274
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,760
Are you two dating?

275
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,600
We're not dating,

276
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,560
I was just helping her down.

277
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:55,960
No.

278
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,120
This has nothing to do with dating,

279
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,440
I'm going to tell your homeroom teacher.

280
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,120
Looking for the card,

281
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,880
hugging while searching for it,

282
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
I saw everything.

283
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,560
Hurry,

284
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,480
come over here!

285
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,040
Quick!

286
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,680
Hurry!

287
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,160
Hurry up.

288
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,720
Let's go.

289
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,280
Get up,

290
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,850
hurry up!

291
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,040
Let's go.

292
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,050
Let's go.

293
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,560
Hurry!

294
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,860
Be careful!

295
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,280
Watch out.

296
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,520
Slow down.

297
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,960
Can you drive any faster?

298
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm already going fast.

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,680
I'm afraid we'll run out of time.

300
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,080
This is as fast as it gets.

301
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,880
Gu.

302
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,600
Um...

303
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,920
Where's Zhenzhen?

304
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,770
Zhenzhen...

305
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,920
Ma'am, Zhenzhen has been missing since early morning.

306
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,240
Didn't Teacher Liu call you?

307
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,040
Teacher Liu?

308
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,560
Yes.

309
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,560
My phone...

310
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,080
Ma'am.

311
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,880
I'll go in first.

312
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,920
Go ahead.

313
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,960
This feels like a sightseeing tour.

314
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,480
Tricycle ahead, pull over!

315
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
You're speeding!

316
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,080
Pull over now.

317
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,160
Pull over.

318
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,359
Officer.

319
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,079
We're in trouble.

320
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,010
Something went wrong as expected.

321
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,300
Thank you, sir.

322
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,740
Thank you, sir.

323
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,600
You're welcome.

324
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,130
Go on now.

325
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,320
You guys.

326
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,000
W-what's going on with you two?

327
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,720
It's too complicated to explain in a few words.

328
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,400
Wait, wait.

329
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,960
Grab the food.

330
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,890
I'll go in first.

331
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,520
I'll try my best, Mom.

332
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,900
This...

333
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
I forgot my shoes.

334
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,000
Your aunt asked me to give these to you,

335
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,400
she said she prepared them specially for you.

336
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Thank you, class monitor.

337
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,060
No problem,

338
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,850
hurry up now,

339
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,000
good luck!

340
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,960
On your marks,

341
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,160
get set.

342
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,040
Go, Jiang Ling!

343
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,360
Go, Qi Shuo!

344
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,240
You can do it!

345
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,440
Faster!

346
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,720
Jiang Ling,

347
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,560
go!

348
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,720
Qi Shuo.

349
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,560
Come on!

350
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,160
I'm first!

351
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,020
I'm number one!

352
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,920
What do you mean first?

353
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,480
We won!

354
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:38,800
Idiot.

355
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,860
It's 1,000 meters!

356
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,980
What are you doing?

357
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,160
You were running the 1,000 meters,

358
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,320
not the 800.

359
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,040
Oh no!

360
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,240
I thought it was 800 meters.

361
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,480
I'm finished!

362
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,960
Is this the accident Lao Jiang was talking about?

363
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,640
So I should be fine now, right?

364
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,880
Zhenzhen,

365
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,080
you can do it,

366
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,010
I believe in you.

367
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,460
Be careful.

368
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Aren't you going to cheer for me?

369
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,090
Go for it.

370
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,760
Don't worry.

371
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,480
Women's 800 meters first group, please. I'm going now.

372
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,010
Contestants, please take your positions at the starting line.

373
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,120
On your marks.

374
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,800
Get set.

375
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,600
Go, Zhenzhen!

376
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,360
Zhenzhen!

377
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,570
Are you okay?

378
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,680
I'm fine.

379
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,800
What's wrong?

380
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,200
My foot.

381
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,360
My foot really hurts.

382
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,890
Bear with me while I take a look.

383
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,760
Is it here?

384
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
I can barely move.

385
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,450
I'll take you to the infirmary.

386
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,920
Zhenzhen.

387
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,120
Zhenzhen!

388
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,560
What...

389
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,600
What happened?

390
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,880
I'm fine.

391
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,560
Mom.

392
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
She was fine this morning.

393
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,010
How did this happen?

394
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,960
Ma'am,

395
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,660
she was running and

396
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,290
her shoelace broke.

397
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,290
The shoelace broke.

398
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,880
Aren't these new shoes?

399
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,300
How could the shoelace break?

400
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,440
Zhenzhen.

401
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,850
Is everything okay?

402
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,160
Wasn't it a running race?

403
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,820
How did you end up here?

404
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,090
How did you get here?

405
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,410
The child's shoelace broke

406
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,580
and they fell down.

407
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,090
The shoelace broke?

408
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,440
That's impossible.

409
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,170
These shoes.

410
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,980
I just bought them,

411
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,160
I bought them myself.

412
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,400
You bought them yourself

413
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,660
and didn't check them.

414
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,960
The child's shoelaces broke

415
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,720
on the day of the exam.

416
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,120
Now there's no ranking

417
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,660
and the child got injured.

418
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,160
And you still think you're right.

419
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,080
You bought those shoes yourself.

420
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,680
Mom, Dad.

421
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,340
I'm exhausted.

422
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,520
Could you please leave

423
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,290
so I can be alone for a while?

424
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,880
I'm sorry.

425
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,240
You rest for a bit

426
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,080
and we'll step outside.

427
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,680
We'll be right outside the door

428
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,880
if you need anything.

429
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,960
This has been cut by someone.

430
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,760
How did that old Jiang know about the accident?

431
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,640
Could it

432
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,640
really be my future self?

433
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,920
Ma'am.

434
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,120
Hello.

435
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,840
These are Zhenzhen's shoes.

436
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,960
Thank you.

437
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,360
And you are?

438
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,020
I'm her classmate,

439
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,640
my name is Jiang Ling.

440
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,600
Thank you so much for your help today,

441
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,530
I appreciate it.

442
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,020
I should get going now.

443
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,860
What's going on with these shoes?

444
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,480
The laces are broken.

445
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,890
You gave me these shoes,

446
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,440
so I have to ask you about it, right?

447
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,100
If it weren't for these shoes,

448
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,760
Zhenzhen could have qualified in today's race.

449
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,090
I don't mean it that way,

450
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,170
but I need some explanation when I go back.

451
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,000
Lao Jiang,

452
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,540
everything is just as you predicted.

453
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,840
I feel danger

454
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,080
getting closer and closer to me.

455
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
I was just running

456
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,930
and nearly died.

457
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,130
An Zhenzhen,

458
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,480
calm down.

459
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,280
I just

460
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,080
followed Qi Shuo

461
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,040
for a while.

462
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,160
He went to a kindergarten

463
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,440
and picked up a child.

464
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,880
I think he's acting

465
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,260
quite strange.

466
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,480
Really weird.

467
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,720
Be careful.

468
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,440
Lao Jiang,

469
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,580
I asked you earlier

470
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,400
to help me

471
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,800
check on my parents.

472
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,900
Did you go see them?

473
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,940
How are they doing?

474
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,640
They're fine.

475
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,500
What happened?

476
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,640
Actually,

477
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,720
it's nothing.

478
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,200
It's just that

479
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,440
they always argue

480
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,800
because of me.

481
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,360
I'm afraid

482
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,880
that someday

483
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,850
they'll stop caring about each other,

484
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,650
stop looking after each other.

485
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,640
You shouldn't think like that.

486
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,960
Your parents' issues

487
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
are between them,

488
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,880
they have nothing to do with you.

489
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,010
Don't overthink it,

490
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,480
okay?

491
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,800
So can you tell me the truth?

492
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I want to know how they're doing now.

493
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Do you really want to know the truth?

494
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,040
I don't know why,

495
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,370
but I have this feeling.

496
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,280
I feel like in the future,

497
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,210
they probably won't be together anymore.

498
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
I haven't told you

499
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,120
before now.

500
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,920
I was afraid you'd worry.

501
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,680
When I went to your house,

502
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,140
I only saw your mother.

503
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,000
Both times

504
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,880
I didn't see your father.

505
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,440
I knew it,

506
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,080
I just knew it.

507
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,500
Please don't overthink this.

508
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,800
I believe

509
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,050
this has nothing to do with you.

510
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,540
Don't blame yourself.

511
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,640
What does it have to do with then?

512
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,480
Zhenzhen.

513
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Mom's coming in.

514
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,900
Why are you crying?

515
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,400
Zhenzhen.

516
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,120
Mom understands you.

517
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,400
It's okay.

518
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,320
It doesn't matter if you didn't get good results,

519
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,880
we'll do well on the college entrance exam,

520
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,680
just the same.

521
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,660
This is actually my fault,

522
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,560
I should have checked

523
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,760
those shoes before giving them to you.

524
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,400
Mom, it's not your fault.

525
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,860
Really.

526
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
It's all over now.

527
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,580
You really don't blame me?

528
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,680
No, I don't.

529
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,250
Where's Dad?

530
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,580
He went back to the office,

531
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,440
he's busy working overtime.

532
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,840
Dad.

533
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,920
Why?

534
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,000
Why is he always so busy?

535
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,040
You.

536
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,290
You're still young,

537
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,320
when you grow up

538
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,560
and start working, you'll be just as busy,

539
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,080
really.

540
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,360
But...

541
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,620
Actually, I...

542
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,560
I think...

543
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,640
Dad doesn't have to

544
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,760
make so much money,

545
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,840
he doesn't need to be

546
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
so busy with work.

547
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,300
If our family could just be together,

548
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,220
I'd already be very happy.

549
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,440
Mom,

550
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,580
do you think

551
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,100
Dad still cares about our family?

552
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,260
Of course he cares!

553
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,720
How could he not?

554
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,440
What are you

555
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,300
talking about?

556
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,360
He cares.

557
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
That's good then.

558
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,050
Let's not talk about this anymore.

559
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,520
What do you want to eat when we get home?

560
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,960
Mom will cook something delicious for you,

561
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,360
okay?

562
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,180
I want to eat

563
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,330
hairy crabs.

564
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,280
Sure,

565
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,720
what else would you like?

566
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,200
I'll make anything you want.

567
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,400
I also want crayfish.

568
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,240
These are all inflammatory foods,

569
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,040
can you think of something else?

570
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:08,880
As long as it's not

571
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,540
spare ribs.

572
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Spare ribs are fine too.

573
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,960
Are spare ribs okay?

574
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,480
Yes.

575
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,720
Should we have rice or steamed buns?

576
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,490
How about porridge?

577
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,960
Let's have porridge.

578
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,380
Who exactly

579
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
is the real culprit behind her harm?

580
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,720
I must find the answer.
