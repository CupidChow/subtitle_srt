1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,240
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,120
Day

3
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,039
That's a lot of money.

4
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,020
Since we're already here.

5
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,800
Go in.

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,640
Over 400,000.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,039
That's a fortune.

8
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,370
This number,

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,440
Five tickets each for both of us.

10
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,039
I checked,

11
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,440
in 2012,

12
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,560
late February's lottery,

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,640
this was the winning number.

14
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,600
Go buy some tickets.

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,530
Thank you, boss.

16
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,200
Take it.

17
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,120
With all this money,

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,480
first I want to

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,240
donate to various charities.

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,680
Then,

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,720
I'll help my father

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,600
expand and strengthen his company.

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Most importantly,

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,520
I want to build a private amusement park.

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,600
So it can run 24 hours,

26
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
without any power outages,

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,329
and I can go play anytime I want.

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,400
Oh, right.

29
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,880
Old Jiang asked me to remind you

30
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,560
that tonight

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,880
you absolutely must pay the electricity bill.

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,320
Why?

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Don't worry about why,

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,329
it's definitely going to help you.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,680
What else did he tell you?

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,520
Where is he?

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Can he tell me

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,560
what my parents will be doing in the future?

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,520
Can he also tell me

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,250
what I'll be doing in my future?

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,720
Just that.

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,640
What do you mean 'just that'?

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,520
Don't you want to know

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,450
what you'll be doing in the future?

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,880
No.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,090
Are you serious?

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,880
I've told you so many times,

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,040
my mouth is dry from talking,

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,079
and you still don't believe me.

50
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,079
This is a call across time and space.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,460
I don't believe it.

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,520
Why not?

53
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
There is no why.

54
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,320
The future

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,080
only exists in

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,970
the next choice we make.

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,720
I've been transferred to work out of town these past few years

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,720
and might need to trouble you again.

59
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,090
It's no trouble, brother-in-law.

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
I've always treated Xiao Jiang

61
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,480
as my own child,

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
so just leave him with me from now on.

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,770
I'll send you money regularly.

64
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,519
Dad!

65
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,920
Son,

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
have you been listening to your aunt lately?

67
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,040
Dad,

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
I have so much good news to tell you.

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,520
Wait until I get home

70
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,680
to tell me, okay?

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
Daddy's a bit busy right now.

72
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,120
Okay.

73
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,890
Bye-bye,

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,290
hanging up now. Bye.

75
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,490
Do you see what I have in my hand?

76
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,440
Can you see it?

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,440
The future.

78
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,380
As long as I believe

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,640
that my future

80
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,840
is in my own hands,

81
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,570
then everything

82
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,000
can be changed.

83
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Even if it's a choice,

84
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,770
it's still my own decision.

85
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,060
After all, life

86
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,840
itself is a miracle.

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,090
Isn't it?

88
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,520
Hundreds,

89
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,180
thousands,

90
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,840
hundred thousands,

91
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,200
millions,

92
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,080
tens of millions.

93
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,680
Zhenzhen.

94
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,440
What's wrong?

95
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,970
What have you been up to lately?

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,960
Nothing much.

97
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,760
What's up?

98
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,640
I have something to tell you.

99
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,160
What is it?

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,260
You know I like Jiangling, right?

101
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,480
I can tell a little bit.

102
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,640
I don't know why you've been looking for him lately,

103
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,920
but I hope

104
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
you'll keep your distance from him.

105
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,520
Qiuqiu.

106
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,640
Some things

107
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,840
aren't what you think.

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,920
If you still consider us friends,

109
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,720
please stop pursuing him.

110
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,000
Qiuqiu.

111
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,720
Qiuqiu.

112
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,040
Qiuqiu.

113
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,900
Qiuqiu.

114
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,810
A male beauty who brings disaster.

115
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,200
Einstein said that if you put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, it feels like an hour,

116
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,860
but sitting next to a pretty girl for an hour feels like a minute. That's relativity.

117
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm never coming back to this rice noodle place again.

118
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,320
The flavor is so bland,

119
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,960
and they barely give any chili sauce.

120
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,090
You can ask for more.

121
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,280
I think it's fine.

122
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,240
It's okay.

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,320
I'm very particular about food.

124
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,650
This place is really...

125
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,600
Tell me.

126
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,740
How should I confess my feelings?

127
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,040
Jiangling.

128
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,080
Confess.

129
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,560
Princess,

130
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,480
maybe you should reconsider?

131
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,800
Do you really like him?

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,800
Of course!

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
He's so handsome,

134
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,410
and his smile is beautiful.

135
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,640
Who's handsome?

136
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,960
Exactly.

137
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,720
A male beauty who brings trouble.

138
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,050
The Chicken Cutlet Guy?

139
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,050
Go ahead.

140
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,120
Qi Shuo.

141
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,320
Cover me, quick!

142
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,760
What for?

143
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,440
Hurry up!

144
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,420
Go quickly!

145
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,540
Come on, hurry!

146
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,600
Get going!

147
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,919
Hey, Xiaoxin.

148
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,760
Long time no see.

149
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,440
I think you should go for it.

150
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,840
Qiu Qian.

151
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm eating alone.

152
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,140
How did you see her?

153
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,679
I got her some chicken cutlet.

154
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,480
I brought it for Qiu Qian.

155
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,679
That's great!

156
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,010
He's trouble with that handsome face.

157
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
Go on!

158
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,280
He's there all alone.

159
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,880
I can't go while you guys are here.

160
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,410
Let's go.

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,160
Let's go.

162
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,000
Go now!

163
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,200
Good luck!

164
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,300
Jiang Ling.

165
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,180
Have you had lunch yet?

166
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,520
I know this incredibly good restaurant,

167
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,850
want to go there with me?

168
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,200
Or

169
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
I could buy some for you instead.

170
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,300
No, thanks.

171
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,680
Why would Jiang Ling write

172
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,280
a novel about An Zhenzhen?

173
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,080
Could it be

174
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,560
he likes her?

175
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,000
In this class,

176
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,000
we'll study

177
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,920
the properties of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate.

178
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,200
We'll examine these two substances'

179
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,130
first property.

180
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,880
We will

181
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,060
take separate samples first.

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,240
Add sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate

183
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,400
to two separate test tubes.

184
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,320
Add

185
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,360
a small amount of

186
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
purple litmus solution.

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This is to verify

188
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,960
how these two substances

189
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,880
react with the acid-base

190
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,160
indicator.

191
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,200
The purple litmus solution reacts with them.

192
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,330
Stop passing notes.

193
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,160
You're using me like a messenger app,

194
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,600
just talk directly since you're so close.

195
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,080
Qi Shuo,

196
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,680
what are you doing?

197
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,800
Pay attention to the class.

198
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,930
Go stand at the back.

199
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,920
Tell me.

200
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,680
Qiuqiu,

201
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,600
you've got it wrong.

202
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,330
It's really not what you think.

203
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,460
Then what is it?

204
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,040
Do you think he would like

205
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
someone like me?

206
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,400
If he likes anyone,

207
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,460
he should definitely like your type.

208
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,520
Of course.

209
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,160
You're beautiful,

210
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,200
adorable,

211
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,640
have a great personality,

212
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,920
and you're talented too.

213
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,720
If I were a guy,

214
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,440
I'd definitely go after you.

215
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,960
Really.

216
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,680
Alright then.

217
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,800
Tonight,

218
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,380
invite him out for dinner.

219
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,200
We can

220
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,860
get to know each other better.

221
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,740
Where's your lottery ticket?

222
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,090
Your ticket.

223
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,720
Keep it safe.

224
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,640
Don't lose it.

225
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,300
I just remembered something.

226
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,820
Let's have dinner together tonight.

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,560
It's like this.

228
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,880
I have a friend named Qiu Qian,

229
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,960
who is really nice and beautiful.

230
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm not going.

231
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,930
She wants to.

232
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,740
Come on,

233
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
more friends means more opportunities.

234
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,520
I'll treat you to noodles.

235
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,720
Any brand is fine.

236
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm not hungry.

237
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm begging you,

238
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,160
I'll die if you don't go.

239
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
Just help me out,

240
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,680
kind-hearted Jiangling.

241
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,520
I'm begging you.

242
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,800
Most generous Jiangling,

243
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,260
warm-hearted Jiangling.

244
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,960
Here's the noodles

245
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,280
The last two bowls.

246
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,140
Thank you, sir.

247
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,040
Jiang.

248
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
You've made new friends so quickly.

249
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,880
Eat before they get cold,

250
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,410
hurry up,

251
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,740
while they're hot.

252
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,500
Jiangling.

253
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,940
Let me introduce you to

254
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,840
my good friend

255
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,600
Qiu Qian.

256
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,000
Hi, I'm Qiu Qian,

257
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,040
Zhenzhen told me you wanted to know more about me.

258
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,570
So let me introduce myself.

259
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,200
My favorite color is pink,

260
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,920
and my favorite flower is gardenia.

261
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,720
He already knows all that, Qian.

262
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Need chopsticks?

263
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,640
Qi Shuo.

264
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,370
Chopsticks.

265
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,360
Chopsticks.

266
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,960
Here.

267
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,000
I suddenly feel

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
we really have a connection.

269
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,920
So...

270
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,090
We should cherish this connection

271
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,560
that fate has given us.

272
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,680
Holding hands until graduation

273
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,810
and into the future.

274
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,120
That's right.

275
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Love each other.

276
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,520
Eat up.

277
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,530
Go ahead.

278
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,450
That's true.

279
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,000
Why are you always alone?

280
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,240
Don't you feel lonely?

281
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,600
Actually, I...

282
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,960
So now we're friends,

283
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
and you won't be on your own anymore.

284
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,680
No need.

285
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,580
What's wrong with him?

286
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,960
He has a cold

287
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,940
and doesn't want to infect us.

288
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,770
Actually...

289
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,900
He's a warm-hearted and kind person.

290
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,720
Come on, eat up.

291
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
It's delicious, right, Shuo?

292
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,520
Eat.

293
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,440
Let me read this.

294
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,000
No.

295
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,920
What are you guys talking about?

296
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,250
What is that?

297
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,560
The dismissal bell

298
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,840
rings clearly.

299
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,730
I hurriedly walk out of the classroom.

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,720
Zhenzhen.

301
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,120
Zhenzhen.

302
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,600
Wait, stop.

303
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,040
What are you guys talking about?

304
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,400
No,

305
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
in this novel,

306
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
the character is just called Zhenzhen,

307
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,280
and her 'Zhen' is from the word for pearl,

308
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,640
while my name uses the 'Zhen' that means 'real',

309
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
they're completely different characters,

310
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,100
so how could you possibly connect that to me?

311
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,440
Wait a second.

312
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,520
This is a prank, isn't it?

313
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,370
This is definitely a prank.

314
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,120
Who did this?

315
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,560
How childish is that?

316
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,540
Stop looking at it.

317
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,970
What do you mean it's me?

318
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,080
The content isn't even correct.

319
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
This girl's name

320
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,320
is Zhenzhen.

321
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,880
Zhenzhen, I look at your eyelashes.

322
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,920
How's it going?

323
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,780
Did you find anything?

324
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,200
Hello, sir.

325
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

326
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,360
I've just checked for you,

327
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,960
you have a fixed deposit account

328
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,360
with 200,000 in savings.

329
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
The interest has accumulated for 12 years,

330
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,560
totaling 53,354.30 yuan.

331
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,160
Due to long-term inactivity,

332
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,840
the account is currently deactivated.

333
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,500
How would you like to proceed?

334
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,720
Activate it,

335
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,400
activate everything,

336
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,960
and transfer it all to my account.

337
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,890
Certainly, sir.

338
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,500
Thank you for your years of trust in our Rural Commercial Bank.

339

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,060
three for ten yuan!

353
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,100
Auntie.

354
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Why are you here, Jiangling?

355
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,370
I came to see you,

356
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,480
brought you some things,

357
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,680
I'll leave them here.

358
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,160
Every time you visit, you bring so many things,

359
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,420
I can't eat all of this,

360
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,450
don't buy so much next time.

361
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,920
My health

362
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,920
is just fine.

363
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
How's your book coming along?

364
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,440
My book is

365
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,780
going well,

366
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,290
don't worry.

367
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,000
I've got

368
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,600
the money now,

369
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,000
it'll be published soon.

370
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,600
You have to pay

371
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,360
to publish your own book?

372
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,880
Well, the publishing business

373
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
is quite complicated,

374
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,800
can't explain it in just a few words,

375
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,880
I'll tell you all about it later.

376
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,540
Have a seat.

377
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,090
Take it easy.

378
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Oh, my back.

379
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,080
Don't get scammed again.

380
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
At times like this,

381
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,320
you can't just try any remedy out of desperation.

382
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,000
If

383
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
you get tricked

384
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,120
into doing something illegal,

385
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,370
things won't be so simple anymore.

386
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,960
Stop dreaming about becoming a writer.

387
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
Find a proper job soon.

388
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,560
I know, Auntie.

389
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,680
These things,

390
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,080
I can handle them myself.

391
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
Please don't worry about me.

392
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,940
I don't care about you,

393
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,650
what are you going to do?

394
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,720
Your mother passed away early,

395
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,120
if I don't take care of you,

396
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,960
who will?

397
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,440
I know,

398
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,600
it's you.

399
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,060
Please stop repeating these things.

400
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,200
Look,

401
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,570
what am I doing with my life?

402
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
Ever since I was little,

403
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,440
you've always opposed everything I do.

404
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Whether it's school

405
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,640
or my current job.

406
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,520
Like before,

407
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,440
when I said I wanted to study liberal arts,

408
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,320
you insisted I choose science instead.

409
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,650
I told you I want to write

410
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,480
articles and stuff,

411
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,000
but you never agreed.

412
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,360
Perhaps I was wrong.

413
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,280
After your mother,

414
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,520
the physics teacher, passed away,

415
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,250
I always hoped you would follow in her footsteps.

416
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
Now you're grown up,

417
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,520
and you can make

418
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,530
your own decisions about your future.

419
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,010
I'm getting old too.

420
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,100
I'm sorry, Auntie.

421
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,960
I shouldn't have talked back to you.

422
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,480
Oh, child.

423
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,120
I didn't take this job

424
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,440
just for your sake.

425
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,280
I needed something to keep myself busy too.

426
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,160
Is your back bothering you again?

427
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,960
It's nothing.

428
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,490
By the way

429
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,440
I've put

430
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,140
200,000 in the bank for you

431
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,020
and never told you about it

432
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,720
afraid you'd spend it recklessly.

433
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,920
If you need it now

434
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,160
go ahead and withdraw it.

435
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,450
Have a seat for a moment.

436
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,780
Auntie.

437
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,970
You're back,

438
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,220
Xiao Jiang is back.

439
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,100
Let me do it.

440
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,920
It's fine, I'll handle this.

441
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,980
You should go rest.

442
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,360
About the electricity bill I reminded you of,

443
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,160
did you pay it?

444
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,080
Yes, I did.

445
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,520
Don't worry about it.

446
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,440
Also, Auntie,

447
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,160
you can't use all these appliances at once,

448
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,800
it might trip the circuit breaker.

449
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,400
Alright, alright.

450
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,530
Go get some rest now,

451
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,850
hurry along.

452
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,700
Be careful.

453
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,480
Go on now.

454
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,440
Take care of yourself then.

455
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,370
I'll call you when dinner's ready.

456
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,480
Mr. Jiang.

457
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm in class.

458
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,840
The electricity bill,

459
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,480
don't worry about it.

460
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,810
I've reminded him several times already.

461
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,880
What happened?

462
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,120
Nothing happened.

463
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,700
The lottery ticket

464
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,680
is with me.

465
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,920
Why did he hang up?

466
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,720
Is the lottery drawing tonight?

467
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,560
There are never any miracles,

468
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,960
never.

469
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,440
Auntie.

470
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,520
Don't

471
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,760
move.

472
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
I hurt my back.

473
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,920
Take it easy.

474
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,250
Here.

475
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,280
Lean on me.

476
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,700
Come on.

477
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,210
Don't strain yourself.

478
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,460
It's that serious?

479
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,060
I need to take you to the hospital.

480
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,600
04.

481
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,560
12.

482
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,240
273003:

483
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,480
How come none of the numbers matched?

484
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,940
Did Lao Jiang get it wrong?

485
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,410
When is it going to rain?

486
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,840
Listen, you three,

487
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,800
I brought you here today

488
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,730
to make sure we get that money back.

489
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,640
Lao Jiang.

490
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,040
Lao Jiang.

491
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,120
Lao Jiang.

492
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,360
Lao Jiang.

493
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Go check the back.

494
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,680
Where is it?

495
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,320
What is that?

496
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,650
He seems to be upstairs.

497
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,440
Lao Jiang!

498
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,920
What are you doing?

499
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
Are you trying to jump off the building?

500
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,120
Get up there!

501
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,200
Lao Jiang, what are you doing up there?

502
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,930
Copying others by jumping off?

503
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,820
Don't move!

504
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,980
If you come closer,

505
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,960
I'll jump.

506
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,130
Nobody move!

507
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,960
Stay still!

508
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,760
Stay back!

509
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,100
Not moving!

510
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,240
If you come closer,

511
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,640
just calm down,

512
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,240
I'll jump.

513
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
If he jumps, who's gonna pay me back?

514
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,920
There's no miracle left.

515
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,000
None.

516
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,120
Back!

517
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,440
Back off!

518
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,480
Lao Jiang,

519
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,140
you finally answered my call.

520
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,080
It finally rained here.

521
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,010
All the numbers you gave me were wrong,

522
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,130
not a single hit.

523
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,400
Did you remember them wrong?

524
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,600
It doesn't matter anymore, An Zhenzhen,

525
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,660
none of it matters.

526
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,250
Understand?

527
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,600
What's that noise?

528
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,000
Why is it so windy?

529
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,780
I'm on the rooftop,

530
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,880
on the roof.

531
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,730
Getting some fresh air,

532
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,010
looking at the moon.

533
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,130
The moon is so full tonight.

534
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,480
Rooftop?

535
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,520
What are you doing on the roof?

536
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,280
Don't jump, Lao Jiang,

537
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,940
don't jump!

538
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,300
The money really doesn't matter.

539
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,780
As long as you stay with us.

540
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,460
Don't jump!

541
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,480
Jump what?

542
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,640
Are you crazy?

543
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,680
You're not planning to jump, are you?

544
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,840
If I jump from here,

545
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,320
I...

546
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
I can restart my life.

547
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,240
Everything.

548
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,080
I can start over,

549
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,160
wouldn't that be great?

550
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,280
That's an incredibly stupid idea.

551
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,360
You just made one mistake, didn't you?

552
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,490
I can help you again.

553
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,800
I can't change my situation

554
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,400
through you.

555
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,730
What do you mean?

556
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,090
I can't save you.

557
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,440
And you can't save me either.

558
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,020
Don't jump!

559
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,960
Please don't jump!

560
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,720
Let me tell you.

561
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,320
Lao Jiang.

562
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,000
Lao Jiang.

563
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Call me Lao Jiang,

564
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,360
or Brother Jiang.

565
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
Brother Jiang.

566
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Kneel down when you say it.

567
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,840
Brother Jiang.

568
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,440
Lao Jiang.

569
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,920
Is that enough?

570
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,520
Lao Jiang.

571
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,780
Can you hear me?

572
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,890
Listen to me,

573
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,060
please don't jump.

574
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,960
You promised me

575
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,480
that you would tell me about my future.

576
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,320
You can't break that promise.

577
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,960
It doesn't matter anymore.

578
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,010
It doesn't matter anymore,

579
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,160
you have no future,

580
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,920
An Zhenzhen.

581
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,140
What the hell kind of future is there anyway?

582
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,130
You'll be dead before the college entrance exam.

583
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,730
What did you say?

584
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,840
I'll be dead before the college entrance exam?

585
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,760
That's right.

586
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,560
You mean

587
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,200
I have less than 100 days to live?

588
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,560
I lied to you.

589
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,420
I don't know anything about your future.

590
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,840
Dead.

591
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,200
I'm dead.

592
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,440
Are you crazy?

593
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,760
You're the one who's going to die,

594
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,640
how could I possibly die?

595
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,700
You must be joking.

596
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,180
What reason would I have to joke with you?

597
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,080
Fine.

598
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,080
You said I'll die before the college entrance exam,

599
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,200
so how will I die?

600
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,820
Does it matter?

601
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,680
It matters,

602
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,520
it's very important.

603
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,580
This is important.

604
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,000
Haven't you already changed things?

605
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
Everything you told me has changed.

606
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,640
All I know is

607
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,360
I'm about to be reborn.

608
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,130
An Zhenzhen.

609
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,920
Goodbye.

610
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,520
Lao Jiang!

611
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,520
Lao Jiang!

612
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,440
Lao Jiang!

613
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,360
Lao Jiang!

614
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,560
Don't jump!

615
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,680
Zhenzhen,

616
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,490
why are you back?

617
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,880
What's wrong?

618
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,200
Zhenzhen?

619
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,720
Say something.

620
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,540
This child.

621
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,120
Don't scare Mom.

622
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,210
What's going on?

623
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,360
I miss your shrimp dishes.

624
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,480
I'll make you shrimp in a bit.

625
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,530
First tell me what's wrong.

626
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,580
This child.

627
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
I don't want to leave you.

628
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,960
You won't leave.

629
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,720
It's okay.

630
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,720
What's wrong with you?

631
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,580
Are you under too much pressure from school lately?

632
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,100
You scared me to death.

633
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,080
I used to scold you

634
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,520
because you weren't taking your studies seriously.

635
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,280
If I had known

636
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,080
that you would be

637
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,200
so hard on yourself now,

638
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,000
I wouldn't have criticized you.

639
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,480
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

640
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,920
Let's study well together,

641
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,880
and you'll definitely get good results.

642
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,320
Okay?

643
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,480
Let's not worry about it anymore.

644
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,410
Let's eat first.

645
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,680
I made shrimp for you.

646
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,260
Don't cry anymore.

647
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,410
Let's go now.

648
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,480
Eat up.

649
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
You have no future, An Zhenzhen.

650
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,560
What fucking future is there anyway?
