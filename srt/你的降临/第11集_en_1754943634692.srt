1
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,160
Sky.

2
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,759
Zhenzhen.

3
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,720
Zhenzhen,

4
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,880
what's wrong?

5
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,210
Nothing.

6
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,920
Let me get your backpack for you,

7
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,450
let's go.

8
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,600
Slow down.

9
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,420
Be careful.

10
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Let me take a look.

11
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,970
Does it hurt?

12
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,760
You need to be more careful.

13
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,160
Next time you really need to be careful with

14
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,120
your foot.

15
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,120
What's wrong?

16
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
You're mumbling.

17
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,040
Do you get lonely?

18
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,200
I'm often at school,

19
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,640
and Dad's never home either.

20
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,930
You seem to be

21
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,480
alone every day.

22
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,740
I'm not lonely.

23
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,680
Mom has her own life.

24
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,920
When you're all away,

25
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,920
I go out and have fun.

26
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
Besides, I have my own work too.

27
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,160
You know,

28
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,440
don't worry about me.

29
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,090
As long as you study hard at school,

30
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
that makes me happy.

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,930
Alright.

32
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,040
Come.

33
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,160
These days

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,220
you really need to be careful.

35
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,480
How old are you now?

36
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,159
Everyone, please put your milk money

37
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:52,880
on the desk.

38
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,840
I'll come around to collect it now,

39
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,159
and record each payment.

40
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,159
Remember to write

41
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,240
your name on it.

42
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,659
Write your name on each sheet.

43
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,100
Don't bother looking.

44
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,480
Class monitor!

45
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,340
Class monitor!

46
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,370
I've finished writing.

47
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Everyone,

48
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,800
there's an emergency morning assembly.

49
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
The principal has an important announcement to make.

50
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
Everyone must wear their school uniforms

51
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,180
and gather at the playground.

52
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Even the seniors have to attend meetings.

53
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
What's there to talk about?

54
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,200
They could just make an announcement over the PA system.

55
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,130
I'll take a book down to read later.

56
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,600
Zhizhi.

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,330
Let's go. I'll help you.

58
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,250
No need, class monitor.

59
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm actually feeling much better now,

60
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,170
I can walk by myself.

61
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,720
Teachers,

62
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,120
students.

63
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,260
The year's plan starts in spring,

64
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,800
the day's plan starts at dawn.

65
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,160
Is everyone here for the annual meeting?

66
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,120
We're still missing two people.

67
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,560
The city-wide school discipline evaluation

68
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,640
is about to begin.

69
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,050
At that time,

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,520
the key officials

71
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
from the City Education Committee

72
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
will be visiting our school.

73
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,640
They will inspect

74
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,660
our educational management.

75
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,320
Moral education management

76
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,800
will undergo comprehensive evaluation, Zhenzhen.

77
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
And assessment. Zhenzhen,

78
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,840
can you still hold on?

79
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,640
Everyone, please.

80
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,320
It's okay.

81
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,120
Let me help you back to the classroom.

82
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,880
Teacher Liu, that's not necessary.

83
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,740
Class monitor.

84
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,560
An Zhenzhen's foot injury hasn't healed yet,

85
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,620
I'll help her back.

86
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Go ahead then.

87
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,240
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

88
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,800
Let's go.

89
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,520
Thank you, class monitor.

90
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:39,880
No problem.

91
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,400
Take it easy. The student council

92
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,200
will inspect classroom hygiene

93
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,880
and

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,260
classroom discipline

95
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,770
through random checks.

96
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,200
In a week,

97
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,280
outstanding individuals and classes

98
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,040
will receive recognition and rewards.

99
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,680
If there are any disciplinary violations.

100
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,170
Alright.

101
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,280
Zhenzhen, you get some rest.

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm heading back now.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,330
Thanks, class monitor.

104
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,140
No problem,

105
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
get some rest.

106
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,960
Class begins.

107
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,600
Stand up.

108
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Good morning, teacher.

109
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,920
Good morning, students. Please be seated.

110
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,520
Turn to page 63

111
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,880
in your workbook. We're about to begin.

112
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, right.

113
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
The third mock exam will start soon,

114
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,840
but today's morning self-study...

115
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,640
There have been some students

116
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,170
who are late and whispering to each other.

117
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,280
I won't name names here.

118
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,050
I hope everyone takes this seriously.

119
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,970
Alright, let's look at question five now.

120
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,520
Gu Ming,

121
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,260
what are you doing?

122
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,730
Teacher,

123
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,890
I need to talk to you.

124
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,330
Teacher,

125
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,240
the milk money

126
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,260
is missing.

127
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Are you sure you put it in this envelope?

128
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,800
I'm certain.

129
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,200
I put it there myself, so I definitely know.

130
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,400
Is there any chance

131
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,860
you put it somewhere else?

132
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,090
I've searched my entire seat area.

133
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,120
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
I was going to count it and give it to you,

135
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
but then we suddenly had a morning meeting.

136
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,640
I said I'd give it to you after the meeting,

137
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,300
but then...

138
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,330
I'm sorry, teacher.

139
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
Alright, alright.

140
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,500
You go in first.

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What should we do?

142
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,560
What now?

143
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,920
I need to tell you something.

144
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,160
The money for this morning's milk has gone missing.

145
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,760
It's gone.

146
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
I hope none of you students

147
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,680
are involved in this matter.

148
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,760
But if anyone was involved,

149
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,840
I hope you'll return the money quickly,

150
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,300
so we don't have to make a big deal out of this.

151
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,100
Everyone be quiet!

152
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,600
Sports representative,

153
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,060
can you tell me who was late

154
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,540
or left early from this morning's assembly?

155
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,640
Teacher Liu,

156
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,800
I've been thinking about it,

157
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
and this morning,

158
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,320
Gu Ming,

159
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,760
An Zhenzhen,

160
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
Qiu Qian and Qi Shuo

161
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,080
weren't with the rest of us.

162
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,100
Gu Ming'an, Zhenzhen, I know.

163
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
Qi Shuo, Qiu Qian,

164
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,480
what's going on with you two?

165
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,400
Teacher Liu, I have diarrhea

166
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,730
and I'm in the bathroom.

167
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,960
Teacher, I forgot my school uniform jacket,

168
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,820
so I went back to the dorm to get it.

169
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,980
The rest of you stay in the classroom.

170
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
You four,

171
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,250
come with me.

172
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,560
Class sports rep,

173
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,220
you're in charge of the class.

174
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,760
Director Sun.

175
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,760
One at a time, please.

176
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,520
Teacher,

177
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,280
wasn't there supposed to be a uniform inspection today?

178
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,320
I forgot to wear my school jacket today,

179
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,120
so I went back to my dorm to get it.

180
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,920
I had a stomachache this morning,

181
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,320
so I went to the bathroom.

182
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,160
I might have been there a bit too long,

183
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,360
and by the time I came out,

184
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,890
everyone had already left for the formation.

185
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,320
Teacher,

186
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,080
I injured my foot,

187
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
so the class monitor brought me back to the classroom.

188
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,820
An Zhenzhen hurt her foot,

189
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,720
so I took her back to the classroom.

190
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,580
I asked around,

191
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,880
but no one had an extra school jacket,

192
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,960
so I had to go back to the dorm to get mine.

193
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,490
The dorm supervisor saw me.

194
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,560
If you don't believe me,

195
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,600
you can ask them.

196
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
There were students from other classes in the bathroom,

197
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,320
they can vouch for me.

198
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,680
I returned to the classroom with the class monitor.

199
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,640
After getting back to the classroom,

200
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,520
I fell asleep.

201
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,880
Then I didn't know anything else.

202
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,040
After taking her back, I returned to the formation.

203
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,200
An Zhenzhen and the teacher

204
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,260
can testify for me.

205
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,360
Of course not.

206
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,360
I definitely wouldn't dare to steal.

207
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,960
I couldn't possibly have taken that money,

208
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,280
I absolutely couldn't have taken it.

209
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,840
Teacher,

210
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,040
I didn't do it.

211
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,000
Academic probation,

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,680
expulsion,

213
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,920
disqualification from college entrance exam,

214
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,800
or being handed over to the police.

215
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,760
Take your pick.

216
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,840
If you tell the truth now,

217
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,970
there's still time.

218
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,460
No one's going to speak up?

219
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,840
If no one talks, you'll all be expelled.

220
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,970
Liu Yaru.

221
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,920
Come with me for a moment.

222
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,520
Director Sun.

223
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,720
About this incident,

224
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,160
how do you plan to handle it?

225
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,960
Director Sun,

226
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,280
I believe in my students.

227
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,040
They definitely didn't steal the money.

228
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,200
At a time like this,

229
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,320
you're still trying to cover for your students?

230
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,120
Do you even want to keep your job?

231
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,320
You're also responsible for this incident.

232
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,720
If the money isn't found,

233
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,160
you'll have to pay for it.

234
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
Paying the money is the least of your concerns.

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,240
Your Outstanding Individual Award this year

236
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,370
is definitely gone.

237
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
And forget about your intermediate professional title evaluation

238
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,720
as well.

239
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,500
Don't question me.

240
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,160
The citywide evaluation of

241
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
school conduct and discipline is coming up soon.

242
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,120
Principal Liu just finished a meeting this morning

243
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,720
conveying instructions from above.

244
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,980
And then this happens.

245
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,800
This is absolutely disgraceful for Hongyang School.

246
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,660
Let me tell you.

247
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
If this matter isn't resolved properly,

248
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,440
punishing you alone won't be enough.

249
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,080
All the teachers in the senior class

250
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,880
will face disciplinary action.

251
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
I understand, Director Sun.

252
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,920
Go ahead and search then.

253
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,490
Pockets.

254
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,290
Pockets.

255
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,970
Pockets.

256
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,130
Pockets.

257
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,560
Is this yours?

258
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,640
No.

259
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,200
Qiu Qian.

260
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Sneaking behind our backs, huh?

261
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,210
Found it.

262
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,730
It wasn't me.

263
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
Did you take it?

264
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,440
Did you take it?

265
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,359
No.

266
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,240
I didn't take it,

267
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
I wasn't the one who took it.

268
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,170
I don't know when

269
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,260
it was put in there.

270
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,610
I really didn't take it.

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,320
No,

272
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,160
teacher, please believe me,

273
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,720
it really wasn't me.

274
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,650
I didn't take it.

275
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,210
I just...

276
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,300
Principal Liu,

277
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,840
we found it.

278
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,280
It's not true,

279
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,610
I really didn't take it.

280
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,500
Take them away.

281
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,160
Zhenzhen...

282
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,170
Is it really her?

283
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
The money was taken out of her pencil case,

284
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,290
who else could it be?

285
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,040
Could there be a mistake?

286
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,320
Didn't Qiu Qian arrive late too?

287
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,450
It could have been Qiu Qian who took it.

288
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,640
She's clearly the one who stole the money,

289
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,040
so why accuse me?

290
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,490
I never said it was definitely you.

291
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,680
But the money was found in her pencil case,

292
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,940
so who else could it be?

293
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,160
Please have a seat, parents.

294
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,320
Parents,

295
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm sorry,

296
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,460
such a serious incident happened today,

297
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,680
I had to ask both of you to come in.

298
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,380
As the saying goes,

299
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,800
failure to teach children

300
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,060
is the father's fault,

301
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,120
and lax teaching

302
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,640
is the teacher's negligence.

303
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,840
With this incident,

304
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
as the principal,

305
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,720
I also bear responsibility.

306
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
Our school is currently

307
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
facing a citywide education system

308
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,020
inspection

309
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,490
and evaluation.

310
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,280
Well...

311
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
The situation is,

312
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,850
you need to consider

313
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,720
how this matter

314
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,780
should be handled.

315
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,040
An Zhenzhen is already an adult,

316
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,880
if she still refuses to admit it,

317
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,800
we'll have no choice but to refer the case to the police.

318
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,760
It's not that serious.

319
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,360
About

320
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,450
the money issue,

321
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,500
I think it can be easily resolved.

322
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,330
I didn't take the money.

323
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,880
I didn't take it,

324
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,560
I didn't take that money.

325
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,880
Teachers,

326
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,080
I understand how you feel.

327
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,480
But I believe there must be

328
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,140
some misunderstanding here.

329
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,810
Our Zhenzhen is not that kind of child.

330
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,080
Since she was little,

331
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,480
we've given her more allowance

332
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,040
than other children.

333
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,840
This child has always focused

334
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,640
all her attention on studying,

335
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,970
and has never had issues like this before.

336
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,240
I beg you all

337
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,170
to investigate more carefully

338
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,200
what actually happened.

339
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,400
This couldn't possibly be Zhenzhen's doing.

340
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,040
Of course.

341
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,480
I also don't believe

342
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,440
that our student

343
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,040
would do such a thing.

344
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,160
But...

345
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,440
The money was found

346
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,100
in An Zhenzhen's pencil case.

347
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,520
The amount of money missing

348
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,650
is over 10,000 yuan.

349
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,440
Cases can be filed for just 3,000 yuan.

350
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,880
If we really send An Zhenzhen

351
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,080
to the police,

352
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,960
then what happens afterward

353
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,100
will be beyond the school's control.

354
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,200
Of course.

355
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,320
This matter hasn't reached that point yet.

356
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
I also believe

357
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,760
in our students.

358
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,440
But the money

359
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,360
hasn't been completely recovered,

360
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,280
and we need further investigation.

361
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
We also can't completely rule out

362
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,160
the possibility that other students

363
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,840
or a group were involved.

364
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,730
When we handle matters,

365
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,360
we always ensure they're

366
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,960
reasonable,

367
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,400
legal,

368
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
and appropriate.

369
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,560
We live in a society governed by law now.

370
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,360
Let's do this.

371
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

372
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,010
would this work for you?

373
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,540
Regardless of whether

374
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,080
the child took the money or not,

375
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,320
I believe there must be some misunderstanding.

376
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,250
As for the money,

377
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,360
we'll

378
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,840
replace it for the students first,

379
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,240
so it won't affect their exam preparation.

380
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,960
I've told you

381
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,480
I didn't take the money,

382
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm innocent,

383
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,080
you have to believe me!

384
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,920
Zhenzhen.

385
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,000
Dad believes you,

386
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,240
but we need to resolve this matter first.

387
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,280
What about me if you replace the money?

388
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,040
If you pay it back,

389
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,600
everyone will think I took it,

390
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,960
that I'm a thief.

391
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,760
Zhenzhen,

392
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,520
mom believes you.

393
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,680
But that doesn't solve our problem now,

394
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,440
we need to address this issue first.

395
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:34,760
Right,

396
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,840
how do we solve this problem?

397
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,520
They haven't even found the money.

398
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,400
It's ridiculous,

399
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,680
they found 200 yuan in my bag

400
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,040
and automatically assumed I took it.

401
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,280
Isn't that absurd?

402
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,010
An Zhenzhen,

403
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,480
stop making excuses.

404
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,090
Alright.

405
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,800
There are still classes to attend.

406
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,520
You're in senior year,

407
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,200
we should

408
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,280
prioritize your studies.

409
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,010
Teacher Liu,

410
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,600
please take An Zhenzhen

411
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,880
back to the classroom.

412
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,200
As for the remaining issues,

413
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,160
I'll discuss with the parents

414
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,040
to decide how to proceed.

415
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,040
I've already explained clearly

416
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,640
that I didn't take the money.

417
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,800
You didn't take the money?

418
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Then who did?

419
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,920
An Zhenzhen,

420
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,220
say something!

421
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,890
Weren't you so talkative earlier?

422
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,640
How were you defending yourself just now?

423
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,300
What did you tell the teacher?

424
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,600
This is everyone's money,

425
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
that everyone paid for themselves.

426
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,400
Not everyone is as rich as your family.

427
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,760
Qiu Qian, that's enough!

428
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,240
I'll say it one more time.

429
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,720
I did not take that money.

430
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,100
You didn't take it?

431
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,840
Then who did?

432
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,600
Why was it in your pencil case?

433
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,280
Give me back my money, An Zhenzhen!

434
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,540
You weren't even at the morning meeting.

435
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,080
You have no right to suspect me.

436
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,720
You should ask yourself,

437
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,040
how did you put it in there?

438
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,080
Well, I could say that this money

439
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,160
was planted by you to frame me.

440
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,400
Then search my things,

441
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,040
go ahead, search!

442
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,920
If I find it now, you'll apologize to me.

443
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,650
Search then,

444
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,400
come here.

445
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,480
Search, An Zhenzhen.

446
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,280
Zhenzhen, come here.

447
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,520
Calm down.

448
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,900
Zhenzhen, sit down first.

449
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,290
Do you know what?

450
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,000
The class next door gets milk

451
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,880
but we don't.

452
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,200
Exactly!

453
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,680
Right, we've already paid for the milk.

454
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,000
We paid the money.

455
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,460
Yet I can't even drink any.

456
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,520
If I were Qiu Qian,

457
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,780
I'd join the fight too.

458
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,010
This is so annoying.

459
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,640
Did An Zhenzhen really steal it?

460
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,080
Yeah,

461
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,800
I think it was definitely her.

462
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,260
She's never had any behavior issues before.

463
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,290
Everyone's quietly studying.

464
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,080
How much is it?

465
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,720
140.

466
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,900
I'll pay for it.

467
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,240
Jiangling,

468
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,560
what's the big deal about you buying two boxes of milk?

469
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,120
If you want to drink, use what we all paid for.

470
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,600
What should be perfectly normal

471
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,320
is suddenly turned into someone's generosity?

472
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,000
So what about the money

473
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
that we all spent?

474
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,450
I wasn't planning to treat you anyway.

475
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,530
I don't have to drink it,

476
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,320
but

477
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,840
you're just showing off with these boxes of milk.

478
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,770
If you have time,

479
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,960
you should ask her

480
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,320
to return the money.

481
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,520
That's everyone's money.

482
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,970
She should face the consequences.

483
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,240
I didn't ask you to drink it,

484
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,120
so just leave

485
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,740
and stop talking here.

486
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,020
I can stop talking,

487
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,060
but she's the one who stole the money.

488
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,050
Isn't that right, An Zhenzhen?

489
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,960
Qiu Qian,

490
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
shut your mouth.

491
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,160
If you really think I stole it,

492
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,160
then come at me.

493
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,490
Just focus on me and that's enough.

494
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,280
Jiangling,

495
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,920
look,

496
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,340
she's feeling guilty.

497
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,160
Everyone agrees, right?

498
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,880
She ran away.

499
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,320
Everyone.

500
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,500
What are you all doing?

501
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,480
You've been classmates with An Zhenzhen

502
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,000
for three years.

503
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm just a transfer student.

504
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,280
You should know her character better than I do,

505
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,040
and her family background too.

506
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,300
Would she steal money?

507
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
You need to be fair in your judgment.

508
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,920
Song Jun,

509
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,960
you sit next to her.

510
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,680
You should understand better

511
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,940
how she's treated you.

512
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,640
Qi Shuo.

513
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,580
Qi Shuo.

514
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,380
Aren't you two close friends?

515
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,640
You're gossiping about her too.

516
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,820
Gu Ming.

517
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,000
You're the class monitor.

518
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,320
Why aren't you speaking up

519
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,180
and letting these rumors spread?

520
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,490
What kind of class monitor are you?

521
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,240
Everyone.

522
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,000
I hope that all of you

523
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,920
won't judge anyone

524
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,760
without solid evidence,

525
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
and that includes

526
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,560
An Zhenzhen.

527
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,380
I hope everyone can be more rational,

528
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,240
okay?

529
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,280
Why did you go buy milk?

530
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,330
I wanted to help you.

531
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,840
Help me?

532
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,080
Why would you help me?

533
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,080
They were insulting me,

534
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,940
what does that have to do with you?

535
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,120
Do you realize

536
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,530
if you get involved with me now,

537
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,520
what everyone will think of you?

538
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,140
Why are you apologizing to me?

540
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,660
You didn't say anything bad about me.

541
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,400
What gives them the right to talk about me like that?

542
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,460
I paid my share too.

543
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,370
My money was stolen as well.

544
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,440
I feel wronged too.

545
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,400
No matter what they say,

546
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,000
I

547
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,010
believe you.

548
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,200
Everyone thinks I'm a thief now.

549
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,250
If you act like this,

550
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,410
they'll think you're covering for me.

551
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,960
You should stay away from me,

552
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,330
or you might not be able to clear your own name.

553
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,810
An Zhenzhen.

554
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,360
The school administration has decided

555
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,290
that your parents should take you home first.

556
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,260
Let me show you something.

557
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,570
Look at what's stuck on the envelope seal.

558
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,130
What is this?

559
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,610
Does it look like

560
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,480
nail polish?
