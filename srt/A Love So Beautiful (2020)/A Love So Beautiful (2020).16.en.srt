1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,454
WE CAN'T DELAY
MY WEDDING OR YOUR UNIVERSITY

2
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,621
I'M YOUR ENERGY DRINK
CHEER UP!

3
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,956
THERE'S STILL TIME
TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL

4
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,259
CSAT! D-100

5
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,598
LEVELS 1, 2, AND 3 ORDER FRIED CHICKEN

6
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,309
GOOD LUCK
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

7
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,775
DROOL TODAY,
CRY TOMORROW

8
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,407
Please write down

9
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,868
the university and major of your choice.

10
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,745
- Okay.
- Okay.

11
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,581
DESIRED UNIVERSITY SURVEY

12
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,093
Should we do the other ones first?

13
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,806
Yes. Actually, I'm really bad at math.

14
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,557
Should we study English?

15
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,228
No, let's do Korean.
At least, we can read the questions.

16
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,688
Yes, you have a point.

17
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,030
By the way, Dae-sung,

18
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,741
did you write down your career prospects?

19
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,453
No, not yet.

20
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,872
What are your career prospects, then?

21
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,084
I didn't write them yet, either.

22
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,629
What do you like to do?

23
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,968
I like to draw,

24
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,055
and…

25
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,354
Let's solve the questions.

26
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,193
"The natural sciences of Epicurus

27
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,488
enable a non-deterministic understanding

28
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,576
of the universe and the human world."

29
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,452
"The natural sciences of Epicurus…"

30
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,998
What does this mean?

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,543
It's in Korean, but I don't understand it.

32
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,795
I'll take a look.

33
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,632
All right. Let's see.

34
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,218
You guys are brave.

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,054
Both the teacher

36
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,931
and the student.

37
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,169
Hi, Ha-young.

38
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,505
Long time no see.
How did you know I was back here?

39
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:39,177
I was discharged a few days ago,
then I got admitted again yesterday.

40
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,892
Ms. Moon told us to submit
the university and major of our choice

41
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,310
with our career prospects.

42
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,645
DESIRED UNIVERSITY SURVEY

43
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,316
I don't need it.

44
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,781
This is a math worksheet.

45
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,367
We'll cover one more course
with this for CSAT.

46
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,787
I even wrote down the processes and notes,
so take a look.

47
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,539
I don't need it.

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,376
I'm studying plenty of stuff
with my tutor.

49
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,672
You really don't need it?

50
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,634
No, I don't.

51
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,532
Jeez.

52
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,578
That temper of hers.

53
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,250
I'm the only one who put up with it.

54
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,963
What did you just say?

55
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,340
I won't go to KEIST.

56
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,052
I applied there
because you wanted it so badly.

57
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,804
Even if I get accepted,

58
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,015
I won't go there.

59
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,684
Then what do you want to do?

60
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,478
It will be nice to major in Mathematics
and be a professor.

61
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,771
I want to go to medical school.

62
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,359
Heon.

63
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,863
Don't you know what your dad went through?

64
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,281
It's my life.

65
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,452
I'll decide what to do with it.

66
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,040
Heon.

67
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,267
God, this is exhausting.

68
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,783
Why are you here?

69
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,702
What are you doing?

70
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,288
Ha-young ripped this to pieces

71
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,874
because I made her angry.

72
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,375
Will you give up like this?

73
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,672
Give up what?

74
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,965
Ha-young.

75
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,684
How can I like someone like this?

76
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,229
I could faint any moment.

77
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,397
- I can't be with her.
- That's--

78
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,732
What about you?

79
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,069
Do you know how much time
Sol-i spent whining here?

80
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:47,532
She whined as if KEIST was in the States,
not in Daejeon.

81
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,911
- How was the early admission interview?
- I'll probably pass.

82
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,538
You're so full of yourself.

83
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,916
I won't go there.

84
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,502
What? You won't go there?

85
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,212
Really? Why not?

86
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,047
I'll go to medical school.

87
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,758
You're something else.

88
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,927
Also,

89
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,097
I want to be by Sol-i's side.

90
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,516
What?

91
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,518
You're not Heon. Who are you?

92
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,145
Bring Heon back.

93
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,731
So you shouldn't avoid Ha-young, either.

94
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,083
Trigonometric functions
are variations of formulas.

95
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,963
It seems difficult, but it's easy
when you think of the law of cosines.

96
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,506
Okay.

97
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,550
Solve it on your own.

98
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,302
Okay.

99
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,166
Tell me when you're done.

100
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,502
Okay.

101
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,806
What are you doing?

102
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,808
Well…

103
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,435
I…

104
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:27,817
Will you believe me if I say
I was only trying to wipe the sweat?

105
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,111
off your face?

106
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,084
If you stop chewing your pencil,

107
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,627
I'll believe you.

108
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,050
Hey, Dae-sung.

109
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,721
Hi, Brother.

110
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,181
Did you just finish training?

111
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,558
Yes.

112
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,269
One second.

113
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,104
SAEMAEUM NURSING HOME

114
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,023
Hello?

115
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,359
Grandma disappeared?

116
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,612
I'll be right there.

117
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,364
Let's go.

118
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,617
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

119
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,454
We'll go this way.

120
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,538
- Thanks.
- No problem.

121
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,374
Grandma!

122
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,628
Grandma!

123
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,758
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

124
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,887
Did you see an old lady around here
by any chance?

125
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,640
She's about my height
and her hair is bobbed.

126
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,766
No, we haven't.

127
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,894
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

128
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,898
Grandma!

129
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,109
Gran…

130
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,162
Is that her?

131
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,207
What? Yes!

132
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,610
Grandma. Put these on.

133
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,951
Thank you.

134
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,454
By the way, young man,

135
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,249
when will my Dae-sung get here?

136
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,509
He'll be here soon.

137
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,554
He must be hungry.

138
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,056
I'm hungry, too.

139
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,060
Grandma, I want to have kimchi stew.

140
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,149
My Dae-sung likes kimchi stew, too.

141
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,527
I want to make it for him often,

142
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,614
but he's too busy
with his swimming practice,

143
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,492
so I rarely see him.

144
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,996
He is

145
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,000
going to become a world champion.

146
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,008
What's wrong, young man?

147
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,010
Are you starving?

148
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,722
I'll prepare a meal for you.

149
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,320
Thanks.

150
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:45,824
Are you okay?

151
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,869
Yes.

152
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,958
Heon,

153
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,086
I'm

154
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,298
going to start over.

155
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,515
Swimming. I'm talking about swimming.

156
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,059
I see.

157
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,523
Anyway,

158
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,150
I'll make Grandma's wish come true.

159
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,820
Okay.

160
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,197
Good luck.

161
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,036
What will you do?

162
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,708
I won't go to KEIST.

163
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,212
Honestly, I hoped you'd go there.

164
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:42,882
What?

165
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,842
Anyway, that's good news.

166
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,178
Take good care of Brother.

167
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,895
Don't lower your guard.

168
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,939
If you give Sol-i a hard time,
I'll come running.

169
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,901
Then we won't see each other.

170
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,697
Because I won't give her a hard time.

171
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,785
Man, what a jerk.

172
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,175
MILKY SKIN WOO DAE-SANG

173
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,098
Meet me in the school backyard.

174
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,766
I'll wait for you.

175
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,685
Sol-i.

176
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,478
Hey.

177
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,358
This is

178
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,527
where we first met.

179
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,112
Do you remember?

180
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,991
Yes. You're right.

181
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,620
Who knew this school was so scary?

182
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,123
Must one be ready to offer up a leg?

183
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,210
That's right. This school is the scariest

184
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,378
and so am I.

185
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,341
Sol-i.

186
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,219
I like you

187
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:53,971
a lot.

188
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,936
- Dae-sung--
- One more thing.

189
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,981
Ths.

190
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,573
Look. Saved by my t-shirt, right?

191
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,743
When I first saw you,

192
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,912
I just thought you were cute.

193
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,750
But before I knew it,
I started having feelings for you

194
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,504
ever since you came to watch me swim.

195
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,381
Dae-sung, good job!

196
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,675
You're the best!

197
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,510
I loved the way you smiled.

198
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,849
So I wore the bear costume
and ran alongside you.

199
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,060
I sprayed snow on Christmas Day.

200
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,453
Sol-i.

201
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,581
Look at me.

202
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,168
Dae-sung.

203
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,921
From now on…

204
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,049
I won't like you anymore.

205
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,470
I'm sorry.

206
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,348
Don't be.

207
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,267
I was happy every day.

208
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,977
Truly.

209
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,150
Thank you

210
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,486
for everything.

211
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,287
Goodbye,

212
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,748
Sol-i.

213
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,233
I like Shin Sol-i.

214
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,407
NOVEMBER 2008, WINTER OF NINETEEN

215
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,452
Don't forget your identification slip,
your ID, or your pen,

216
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,996
especially your computer marking pen.

217
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,206
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

218
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,000
Do your best on your exam.

219
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,126
- Okay.
- Okay.

220
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,087
All right. We can't put it off any longer.

221
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,130
My wedding!

222
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,882
- Our university!
- Our university!

223
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,886
2009 COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST
VENUE 43-8

224
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,721
IDENTIFICATION SLIP

225
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,774
Number five.

226
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,486
Listen to the conversation
and choose one that doesn't match.

227
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,918
Eighy-eight.

228
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,522
- We'll both do well. Good luck.
- Okay. Good luck.

229
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,232
Sol-i's not answering her phone.

230
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,901
What do I do?

231
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,529
Isn't it obvious? I'll help.

232
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,990
By the way, when will you write it?

233
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,368
That's only for people
who will be parting ways.

234
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,080
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

235
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,583
Make sure to head home separately tonight.

236
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,751
All right?

237
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,336
Sol-i.

238
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,963
Would you be able to remember

239
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,049
what happened tonight?

240
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,305
