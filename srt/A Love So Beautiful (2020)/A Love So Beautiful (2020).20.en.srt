00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:43,043
JULY 2019, SUMMER OF THIRTY

2
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,220
DAE-SUNG

3
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,685
Hi, Dae-sung. Are you here?

4
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,395
Yes. I'll wait on the first floor.

5
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,480
Okay.

6
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,948
I have high hopes for both of you.

7
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,951
I've told everyone in this hospital

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,204
all about you two for three years.

9
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,915
The States wanted you,

10
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,376
but I managed to convince them
to send you back to my hospital.

11
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,712
Thank you.

12
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,131
- Dr. Heo.
- What?

13
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,966
I mean, Director Heo.

14
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,385
Are you happy to have us here?

15
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,263
- I am.
- Director Heo, let's go!

16
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,474
Let's go.

17
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,989
Be careful.

18
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,741
What's the rush?

19
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,368
Dae-sung, what should I do?

20
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,829
I'm so sorry,
but I need to go to the hospital first.

21
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,831
The hospital? Are you sick?

22
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,958
No, it's my dad. He got hospitalized.

23
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,252
- Get in.
- Okay.

24
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,023
You can go downstairs
to get the blood test results.

25
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,775
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

26
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,695
Hello. I have a question.

27
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,946
- Where is…
- What's up?

28
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,322
…the Orthopedics Department?

29
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,532
You go first.

30
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,326
The Orthopedics Department is over there.

31
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,245
I see.

32
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,454
- Okay.
- Thank you.

33
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:51,087
Those who are in charge
of patient Kim Ji-suk in Room 151,

34
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,965
please return to the ward.

35
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,402
Heon, it's been a while.

36
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,240
Yes.

37
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,618
What brings you here?

38
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,580
Dae-sung.

39
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,708
Let's go.

40
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,928
See you.

41
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,206
He's your friend
that's always on TV, right?

42
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,792
Thank you.

43
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,592
I should have said hello sooner.
I'm Woo Dae-sung.

44
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,430
You look better in person than on TV.

45
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,225
Have some juice.

46
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,518
Okay.

47
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,150
By the way, what brings you here?
I know you're very busy.

48
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,234
I saw you on TV.

49
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:04,113
You're always on commercials
with half-naked women.

50
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,448
- Mom.
- Honey.

51
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,616
Don't.

52
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,078
- What?
- Still, I'll always be here for Sol-i.

53
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,499
Open this for me.

54
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,167
Open it.

55
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,629
Great job.

56
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,255
Here. Take it.

57
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,050
- What? Why--
- Yes, thank you.

58
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,720
Come on. What's wrong?

59
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,680
You get on my nerves.

60
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,475
Did you eat?

61
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,684
No, not yet.

62
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,857
Dr. Seo.

63
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,445
- Are you busy?
- Have you been looking for me?

64
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,406
Who will do the surgery
on patient Shin Gi-heon, Room 1504?

65
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,409
So you were looking for me for a reason.

66
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,162
Solve this riddle if you want the answer.

67
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,540
Which martial arts
does Winnie the Pooh practice?

68
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,460
- Kung "Pooh."
- What? That was fast.

69
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,003
Who will perform the surgery?

70
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,090
Dr. Kim Hyeon-gi will,
and I'll be assisting him.

71
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,550
Why are you asking?

72
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,969
Please do your best.

73
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,430
What? That's unlike you
to ask for a favor.

74
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,849
Is that all?

75
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,850
Bye.

76
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,727
What's it about?

77
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,563
Damn it.

78
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,357
Why didn't Sol-i tell us the room number?

79
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
I know, right?

80
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,235
She's not answering her phone either.

81
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,904
- Which room is it?
- Thank you.

82
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,906
Where is she?

83
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,492
Jin-hwan.

84
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,081
What am I looking at?

85
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,835
Ha-young, I think
I need to be hospitalized again.

86
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,253
I'm seeing things.

87
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,713
Cha Heon is in front of me.

88
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,839
Your eyes are fine.

89
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,215
It's been a while.

90
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,800
It's you.

91
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,678
It really is you, Heon.

92
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,973
What? Weren't you going to settle
in the States?

93
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,517
Right. Why didn't you even give us a call?

94
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,811
Sorry.

95
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,358
It's good to see you again.

96
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,693
I'm glad you're back.

97
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,404
I missed you, my friend.

98
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,712
Get in. I'll drive you home.

99
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,299
I'll take a cab.

100
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,762
It's hard to get a cab here at this hour.

101
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,895
Excuse me! Aren't you going to get in?

102
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,720
Where to?

103
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,432
Just drop me off at the nearest station.

104
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,435
Sol-i.

105
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,527
Chiamun Junction.

106
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,930
SURGERY STATUS
SHIN GI-HEON, FINISHED

107
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,890
Mom, it's over.

108
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,278
The operation was successful.

109
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,781
Thank you, Doctor.

110
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,867
- Thank you.
- Good job.

111
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,369
You're welcome. You asked me a favor.

112
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,582
Heon, how considerate of you. Thank you.

113
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,499
You're welcome.

114
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,126
By the way,

115
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,588
how do you know each other?

116
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,299
We're just colleagues.

117
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,886
Dr. Cha barely had any friends
in the States.

118
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,888
So I became his friend.

119
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,556
"Colleagues."

120
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,393
But you're too pretty
to be just a colleague.

121
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,355
- Do you have--
- Mom.

122
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,689
We should go see Dad.

123
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,074
She said they're colleagues.

124
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,786
Is she's the one?

125
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,497
See you.

126
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,672
Excuse me.

127
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,758
Did I scare you?

128
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,053
Yes. A little.

129
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,305
Sorry. My apologies.

130
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,851
Here.

131
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,436
Sit down.

132
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,440
You're Shin Sol-i, right? I'm Seo Ji-su.

133
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,401
Okay.

134
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,611
I have a lot of questions. Can I ask you?

135
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,572
I won't take no for an answer.

136
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,366
Okay.

137
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,701
How did you and Dr. Cha meet?

138
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,372
Why do you ask?

139
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,958
I was wondering if you know her.

140
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,460
Dr. Cha's long-time girlfriend.

141
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,088
"Girlfriend"?

142
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,092
But why do you want to know?

143
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,554
Isn't it funny?

144
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,973
What is?

145
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,809
Who dates such a bore like him?

146
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,940
I don't think he's that boring. Is he?

147
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,320
When he was in the States,
he talked about her a lot.

148
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,574
I think he still loves her very much.

149
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,910
That's why I was curious.

150
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,328
Do you know who she is?

151
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,498
No.

152
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,800
What's all this?

153
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,808
All right. Ta-da.

154
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,603
Bring this to Heon.

155
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,316
He asked the surgeons for extra care
for your dad's surgery.

156
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,151
I was so grateful,

157
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,778
so I woke up early in the morning
to pack this.

158
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,032
And eat this with him
after you deliver it.

159
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,326
I prepared two portions in total.

160
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,039
Mom, it's okay. It's past lunchtime.

161
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,125
Be more empathetic, will you?

162
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,419
Didn't you see how skinny Heon got?

163
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,422
It seems that he doesn't have time
to have a proper meal.

164
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,340
Go.

165
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,800
Hurry.

166
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,395
Seriously.

167
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,072
What are you doing?

168
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,281
What?

169
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:45,950
You scared me.

170
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,375
Mom told me to give this to you.

171
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,756
Let's share.

172
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,216
I just ate.

173
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,562
Ha-young! Jin-hwan!

174
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,272
- You're here!
- Ha-young!

175
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,232
I missed you.

176
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,400
Hey, Sol-i.

177
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,404
Jeong Jin-hwan.

178
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,782
Why are you still so overprotective
when it's been ten years?

179
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,243
She's right. Jin-hwan, take it easy.

180
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,789
It's been a while
since we gathered together. Right?

181
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,083
Not everyone's here though.

182
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,668
One person is missing.

183
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,380
So I called him over.

184
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,594
- Why did you call him?
- Heon is our friend, too.

185
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,606
Sorry I'm late.

186
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,087
It's okay. I'm not drunk.

187
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,345
Sol-i, you're drunk.

188
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,098
I said I'm not drunk.

189
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,601
Drink this.

190
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,822
I thought you don't drink.

191
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,157
I was thirsty.

192
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,372
Stop. That's enough. Let's go.

193
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,874
Whatever. I'm upset.

194
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,628
So you guys should buy gifts
for our wedding.

195
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,339
Sol-i, buy us an air purifier.

196
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,049
Heon, a fridge.

197
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,344
Dae-sung, buy a washing machine.

198
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,305
Also, the TV that you endorse.

199
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,808
A hot celebrity can handle that, right?

200
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,978
Hey, Jin-hwan,
are you trying to rip me off?

201
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,938
He called me a cheat.

202
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,732
Dae-sung, we're running late.

203
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,693
I told you we have a photoshoot tomorrow.

204
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,445
It's okay. You should go.

205
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,989
I'm sober now.

206
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,282
- Will you be all right?
- Of course. I'm fine.

207
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,450
Go home now.

208
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
See you.

209
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,093
You should go, too.

210
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,137
We're going to walk home to sober up.

211
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,389
What? From here?

212
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,684
Let Heon give us a ride.
He didn't drink anyway.

213
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,185
Let's just walk.

214
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,937
Heon, take Sol-i home.

215
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,356
Okay.

216
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,484
- Sol-i. Go home safe.
- Okay.

217
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,029
Ha-young, my legs hurt.

218
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,155
Jin-hwan!

219
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,246
I'll go now.

220
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,044
Get in.

221
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,129
I won't annoy you.

222
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,254
A wish bracelet and a Christmas card.

223
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,507
Are you sure it's a bracelet?
Isn't it a necklace?

224
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,637
Gosh, it's so pretty!

225
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,416
Sol-i.

226
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,718
did you ever regret your decision?

227
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,559
No. I haven't.

228
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,185
Don't you want to know

229
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,355
why I came back?

230
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,609
Don't you really know

231
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,156
who I came back for?

232
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,872
I don't want to know.

233
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,432
Get in. I'll drive you home.

234
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,328
I don't know why you did that to me
last night.

235
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,580
You made a big mistake.

236
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,708
Ms. Shin. Something did happen last night.

237
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,878
I'm sorry to give you all this trouble,
Mr. Superstar.

238
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,463
It's okay, Mr. Shin.

239
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,465
What's that huge diamond? Tell me later.

240
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,134
…met in this vast universe
by a special chance

241
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,260
and became one.

242
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,636
- Kiss the bride!
- Kiss the bride!

243
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,929
- Kiss the bride!
- Kiss the bride!

244
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,556
- Kiss the bride!
- Kiss the bride!

245
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,392
I never once thought

246
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,478
that we broke up.

247
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,897
We're going to make up.

248
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:42,402
