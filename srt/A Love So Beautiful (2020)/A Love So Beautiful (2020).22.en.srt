1
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,290
SOL-I

2
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,303
Dr. Cha.

3
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,265
What? You can't get a hold of Ms. Shin?

4
00:00:58,975 --> 00:00:59,893
No.

5
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,313
Just be honest with me.

6
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,397
She just keeps

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,691
avoiding me.

8
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,070
I guess she finally came to her senses.

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,404
What?

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,948
If I were her,
I'd be dating someone else already.

11
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,367
Besides, she's adorable.

12
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,497
I'm sure she already has
a lot of great guys around her.

13
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,718
Cheer up.

14
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,016
1 NOTIFICATION

15
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,813
Dae-sung's having an autograph event.

16
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,525
WOO DAE-SUNG'S AUTOGRAPH EVENT
WITH TITAGONIA

17
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,029
Go back to your seat.

18
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,491
- What?
- Silent mode, please?

19
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,411
This notice put me in a good mood,
so I'll just let it slide.

20
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,455
He hasn't had an event in Korea
in so long.

21
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,005
PUBLISHING CONTRACT
A LOVE SO BEAUTIFUL

22
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,098
KIM HYEON-JUN
SHIN SOL-I

23
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,273
Thank you so much.

24
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,567
Thank you.

25
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,947
Hey.

26
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,449
Do you think I have a lot of free time?

27
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:43,163
I'm an idol star to my auntie fans.

28
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,956
I missed a gig because of you.

29
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,508
What is it this time? Just tell me.

30
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,051
I can't get a hold of Sol-i.

31
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,928
Is that why you're here?

32
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,514
- Sol-i is busy now.
- Why?

33
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,392
She won a webtoon contest
and got hired by a huge company.

34
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,227
She's a real writer now.

35
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,522
She’s not the old Sol-i who used to
sit around and wait for you.

36
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,071
Don't expect me to help you
like I did back in the day.

37
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,448
Help me.

38
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,909
No.

39
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,911
I know it's all in the past,

40
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,079
but do you know how tough it was for her?

41
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,956
She was ridiculed at every interview,

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,084
kicked out of the dorm when she was sick,
sexually harassed by--

43
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,587
What did you just say?

44
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,631
That was supposed to be a secret.

45
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,882
Whatever.

46
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,052
If you want to get back with her,
take care of this yourself.

47
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,908
Sol-i. Is the finalization going well?

48
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,078
No. I'm stressed out.

49
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,373
Can you get it done by the weekend?
We'll have a housewarming party.

50
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,542
I'm not sure.

51
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,629
- If I can't go, just count me out.
- Come on, Sol-i.

52
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,131
How can we have
a housewarming party without you?

53
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,427
By the way, the air here is terrible
because it's a new house.

54
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,637
Be quiet.

55
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,021
Make sure to bring an air purifier.

56
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,606
Okay, okay.

57
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,527
I feel like I'm living with a kid.
He hasn't changed at all.

58
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,072
What is it?

59
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,616
I'll go to the party!

60
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,285
Cheers!

61
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,869
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

62
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,836
Ha-young,

63
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,423
your new home is so nice.
You even have a rooftop patio.

64
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,091
Isn't the night view amazing?

65
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,095
I wore out my vocal cords
to earn lots of money.

66
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,848
Do you have a spare room for me?

67
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,057
Hey.

68
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,060
How dare you try to spend a night
at a newlywed's love nest?

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,327
Did you get here on a time machine?

70
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,580
You told me to dress up
like we did in high school.

71
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,958
Didn't you mean "dress casually"?

72
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,046
Did you still have your school uniform?

73
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,436
You're cute, Heon.

74
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,980
Get ready.

75
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,107
One, two, three.

76
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,025
So cute!

77
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,740
Please accept my love.

78
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,658
One, two, three.

79
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,494
Two, three.

80
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,121
Next is Dae-sung.

81
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,337
One, two, three.

82
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,423
You're next, Heon.

83
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,390
Since you're wearing a uniform anyway,

84
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,476
strike a cute pose.

85
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,894
Come on.

86
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,027
Go home.

87
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,244
Here we go.

88
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,620
One, two, three.

89
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,560
Three.

90
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,646
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I ONCE DRANK PLUM WINE AND GOT WASTED

91
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,940
- REALLY? WHEN? WHERE?
- YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW

92
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,151
IS IT MY TURN NOW? MINE'S NOT SERIOUS.
MY DAD ONCE GAME ME ATHLETE'S FOOT

93
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,821
Here are your pig's trotters.

94
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,703
Isn't that webtoon hilarious?

95
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,079
Do you read this, too?

96
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,332
Of course. I stay up all night reading it.

97
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,210
Honey, buckwheat noodles on the house
for Table Three.

98
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,336
On the house.

99
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,840
I see why your business is thriving.

100
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,884
You have great marketing skills.

101
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,135
It's nothing.

102
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:53,806
By the way, this webtoon artist
is really pretty in person.

103
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,892
Do you know her?

104
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,603
Of course. She's my daughter.

105
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,689
I see.

106
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:05,109
Back then, I didn't imagine
you'd become Korea's Marine Boy.

107
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,820
I should have been nicer to you then.

108
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,406
You should have known I'd make it.
I certainly did.

109
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,035
I love your confidence.
You're so cool, my friend.

110
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,092
I have to go.

111
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,469
What? Already?

112
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,304
Did you get a call from the hospital?

113
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,388
Yes.

114
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,857
I'll take Sol-i home.

115
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,076
Bye.

116
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,391
Thank you.

117
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,315
Thanks for the ride.

118
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,026
Sol-i, give me a second.

119
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,570
What?

120
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,926
Shin Sol-i,

121
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,012
be my girlfriend.

122
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,432
I was going to wait,

123
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,727
but I can't stay patient anymore.

124
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,650
- Dae-sung.
- Think carefully.

125
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,986
This is your last chance.

126
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,299
Not anyone can give you
a huge diamond like this.

127
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,718
Do you still say no?

128
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,682
Dae-sung.

129
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,437
I think of you

130
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,191
as a good friend.

131
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,869
You have really low standards.

132
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,835
You still have low standards, too.

133
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,771
My goodness.

134
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,779
It's Woo Dae-sung.

135
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,616
If Dr. Cha the social recluse knows him,

136
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,911
my baby is a real superstar indeed!

137
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,540
"Baby"? Why is he your "baby"?

138
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,501
Anyone handsome and rich is my baby.

139
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,840
What? Get lost and don't bother me.

140
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,803
- Why do you like him?
- Can't you see?

141
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,223
He's talented, handsome, and rich.

142
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:08,102
Plus, he has a magnificent personality.

143
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,856
How do you know his personality?

144
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,359
I'm sure he's better than you
in every way.

145
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,945
There are lots of good stories
about him online.

146
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,370
He's so handsome.

147
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,331
Hey, isn't that Woo Dae-sung?

148
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,376
How can he look
exactly like he does in that poster?

149
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,796
- He's so handsome.
- Right. He's so handsome.

150
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,718
They probably think
you walked out of that poster.

151
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,179
Drink slowly.

152
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,848
Why did you call me?

153
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,059
Leave me alone tonight.

154
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,694
Whatever you say.

155
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,420
Heon.

156
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,173
You said you were too busy to come,

157
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,382
but here you are.

158
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,687
- Have a drink.
- Bottoms up.

159
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,941
I have to go back.

160
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,363
Sure.

161
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,657
You're always busy.

162
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,421
What did you do for the last three years?

163
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,469
You're drunk.

164
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,182
What kept you too busy
to stay by Sol-i's side?

165
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,403
And why did you come back?

166
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,280
Why are you playing with her heart?

167
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,741
You don't

168
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,619
take her seriously, do you?

169
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,299
You guys think

170
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,927
she likes me more than I like her.

171
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,679
- Doesn't she?
- I like her more.

172
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,306
More than she does.

173
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,726
You know that.

174
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,106
Then why did you leave?
You should have stayed by her.

175
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,190
I thought

176
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,028
she'd come to me if I left.

177
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,407
Because she always did.

178
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,538
But she didn't.

179
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,001
So,

180
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,630
I've been regretting it
for the last three years.

181
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,442
I can't live without Sol-i.

182
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,247
SOL-I

183
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,586
Sol-i.

184
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,254
Did you hear that?

185
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,494
I've never seen you

186
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,871
talk so much.

187
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,958
Cut it out!

188
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,292
You're so loud.

189
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,669
Are you done?

190
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,714
That's enough.

191
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,176
Let's go home.

192
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,928
Ha-young's waiting for me.

193
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,014
My wife.

194
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,565
Let's go.

195
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
I'll go now.

196
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,573
Ha-young.

197
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,283
My wife, Ha-young.

198
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,660
You reek of alcohol. Get in.

199
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,537
Bye.

200
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,791
Ha-young, go home safely.

201
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,126
I will.

202
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,878
Heon, take Sol-i home safely.

203
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,880
Okay.

204
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,676
- Wise Village, Hannam-dong, please.
- Okay.

205
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,378
I'm sorry.

206
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,589
It's my fault.

207
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,390
Will you please forgive me?

208
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,933
Give me

209
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,686
some time.

210
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,486
Dr. Cha!

211
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,905
Did you see?
Woo Dae-sung came to our hospital!

212
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,074
My heart is racing!

213
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,617
Woo Dae-sung?

214
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,789
Hey, Heon.

215
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,332
You're here.

216
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,211
It seems like you had a good sleep.

217
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,837
Your skin is glowing.

218
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,465
I was born with it.

219
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,468
Don't just swim. Take care of your skin.

220
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,594
My skin?

221
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,721
I'm a celebrity.

222
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,512
- I'm a huge fan.
- Hey, Sol-i.

223
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,930
I think we're the only ones here.

224
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,141
Incredible, Brother. I'm so proud of you.

225
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,227
I never thought you'd be home with Heon.

226
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,354
Father, please marry me.

227
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,190
It's you, right? The hospital.

228
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,443
- Here.
- Here.

229
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,528
Are you asking me to marry you?

230
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,988
Will you marry me?

231
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,407
I guess you really like me.

232
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,243
Why do you always forget that I love you?

233
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,953
I love you.

234
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:15,042
