1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,829
1. LOVERS IN PARIS
2. WHAT HAPPENED IN BALI, 3. FULL HOUSE

2
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,790
My daughter!

3
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,752
There you are.
Did you see the new bike I got you?

4
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,921
Anyway, what's up?

5
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,799
Dad, which do you think will suit me best?

6
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,343
- What?
- Full House, perhaps?

7
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,555
Don't I remind you of Song Hye-kyo?

8
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,728
A family of three bears live together

9
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,814
You must think I'm blind, jeez.

10
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,233
Unbelievable.

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,444
Then how about What Happened in Bali?

12
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,072
Don't I remind you of Zo In-sung?

13
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,448
Let me see.

14
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,076
"I'm a bit…"

15
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,536
"Busy."

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,788
Dad,

17
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,373
I'm not blind, either.

18
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,670
How about this then?

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,881
"'That man is mine.

20
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,634
He is my boyfriend.'
Why can't you say that?"

21
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,178
"How can I, when I look like this?

22
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,139
How can I say that amid those people?"

23
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,974
Stop fooling around.

24
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,434
He's my man.

25
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,644
Go to your room and study.

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,855
- You…
- Don't!

27
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,944
I will tell you carefully

28
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,364
I will muster up the courage

29
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:59,035
Starting from today, can I love…

30
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,662
Stop ruining a masterpiece.

31
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,957
Aren't I perfect for the Han Gi-jun role?

32
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,167
Please let me do it, Ms. Shin!

33
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,170
I can portray Han Gi-jun with perfection.

34
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,382
No, you can't.
The male lead is already taken.

35
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,260
What? Already?

36
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,930
- Who is it?
- Can't you take a hint?

37
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,194
Is the drama festival preparation
going well?

38
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,529
- Yes.
- Yes.

39
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,531
We'll choose the class representative
this Saturday,

40
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,324
and everyone's to participate.

41
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

42
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,536
Hui-ji, bring me the list of groups.

43
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,246
- Yes, Ms. Moon.
- Dismissed.

44
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,082
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

45
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,210
- Heon!
- Cha Heon.

46
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,046
Would you like to join my group
for the school play?

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,757
Our group will do Romeo and Juliet.

48
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,802
You'll be joining me, Su-jin,
Mi-nyeo, and Se-hyeong.

49
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,349
No.

50
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,143
Don't.

51
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,645
I'll think about it.

52
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,617
Heon, you know Lovers in Paris, right?

53
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,494
"'That man is mine.

54
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,164
He is my boyfriend.'
Why can't you say that?"

55
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,833
That's what we chose.

56
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,376
So? Sounds fun, right?

57
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,836
I bet you want to join us.

58
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,050
"Let's go, baby."

59
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,969
I'm not a baby.

60
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,026
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY THAT?

61
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,071
"You taught me of love that doesn't change

62
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,615
even in light or darkness.

63
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:05,912
However, the moment
when darkness switched to light,

64
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,039
your face went on and off.

65
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:12,001
That's how unstable your face is."

66
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,588
What I just read was Love
by the poet Kim Soo-young.

67
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,800
Then which statement about this poem
is true?

68
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,386
"That man is mine. He is my boyfriend."

69
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,887
Why can't you say that?

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,226
Number one.

71
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,239
"THAT MAN IS MINE. HE IS MY BOYFRIEND."
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY THAT?

72
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,956
"Let's go, baby."

73
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,272
Baby's not here.

74
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,049
LOVERS IN PARIS
EOULLIM DRAMA FESTIVAL

75
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:52,018
I will tell you carefully

76
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,229
I will muster up the courage

77
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,483
Starting from today…

78
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,527
- Can I love you?
- Can I love you?

79
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:18,211
LOVERS IN PARIS
EOULLIM DRAMA FESTIVAL

80
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,708
Your script…

81
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,254
You're joining us? Will you?

82
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,509
You drooled on it.

83
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,483
DRAMA FESTIVAL GROUP LIST

84
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,527
Let me see.

85
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,697
I see one person is missing.

86
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,867
- Who is it?
- It's Cha Heon.

87
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,704
Ms. Moon, our group happens
to be short of one member.

88
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,621
Is that so?

89
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,082
Then Heon can join Hui-ji's group.

90
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,710
Get practicing, guys.

91
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

92
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,647
Mr. Lee.

93
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:03,900
Hi.

94
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,237
It's the cardigan
I borrowed the other day.

95
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,739
Oh, right.

96
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,533
Thank you for helping me that day.

97
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,619
I got it dry-cleaned, too.

98
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,329
Thanks.

99
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,292
CARL SAGAN

100
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,857
Ha-young, are you all right?

101
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,652
- Sure.
- Is your leg better?

102
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,278
Of course.

103
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,823
It is.

104
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,508
- Are you all right?
- Sure.

105
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,927
I'm fine.

106
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,720
No, I'm not.

107
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,932
You see…

108
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,393
Well, I'm Ha-young's classmate.

109
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,648
I have a heart condition.

110
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,234
You see…

111
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,028
It's been like that since birth,

112
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,031
and I was rushed off
to the ER several times.

113
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,908
I mean, I'm not ill right now,

114
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,035
but it could relapse in the future.

115
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,621
We'll get going now.

116
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,750
- Sure.
- Bye.

117
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,767
What? You heard the Bells of Destiny?

118
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,020
Yes, I heard it in my head.

119
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,231
Ding-ding-ding.

120
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,192
Are you sure it wasn't the school bell?

121
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:15,406
The ringing in your head
that went ding-ding-ding.

122
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,991
Come on!

123
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,828
Anyway, promise me you won't tell anyone.

124
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,413
- It's our little secret.
- Deal.

125
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,170
What are you doing after class?
Got any plans?

126
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,921
Not really. Why do you ask?

127
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,923
Great. Let's practice together.

128
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,635
Oh, you look really enthusiastic.

129
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,428
Ha-young, join us.

130
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,305
I have math class today.

131
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,099
I'll memorize my lines
by tomorrow morning. Sorry.

132
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,144
That's too bad.

133
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,439
It sure is.

134
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,493
CELL PHONE? KEYS?
GAS VALVE? CHECK WHO'S AT THE DOOR

135
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,792
GRANDMA, DID YOU TURN OFF THE TV?

136
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,171
My grandma keeps forgetting things.

137
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,131
Sometimes, she doesn't,

138
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,676
but I still put up notes here and there.

139
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,594
I see.

140
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,098
It's a very clever idea, though.

141
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,351
I should do the same
with the things I keep forgetting.

142
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,771
Goodness, is my Dae-sung home?

143
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,314
Yes, Grandma. I'm home.

144
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,150
Hello, I'm his classmate, Shin Sol-i.

145
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,819
I see. Well, it's a pleasure.

146
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,655
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

147
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,824
I'll get you something to eat.

148
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,326
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

149
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,664
What about your parents?

150
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,503
It's just my grandma, my dad, and me,

151
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,964
but my dad must be busy today.

152
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,509
I see.

153
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,221
Want to see my room?

154
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,848
Sure.

155
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,359
Thanks.

156
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,361
For what?

157
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,407
I have been a swimmer since I was little,

158
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,784
so I couldn't go to school often.

159
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,538
But here, I got to make
friends like you guys,

160
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,167
go to karaokes,
and even work on a school play.

161
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,169
Every day is exciting.

162
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,796
Right? Are you having fun with me?

163
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,715
Yes. You're the best, brother.

164
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,942
- What the…
- Move!

165
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:01,989
Wang Se-hyeong!

166
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,533
Watch it. And take it outside.

167
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,994
There's no need to get angry about it.

168
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,501
Get lost.

169
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,299
Wait for me!

170
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,012
PRESCRIPTION
JEONG JIN-HWAN

171
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,764
I have a heart condition.

172
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:29,850
Was it true?

173
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,320
"Goodness.

174
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,239
I just bought this, you know.

175
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,824
How can I go home wearing this?"

176
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,451
"I'm sorry. Let me have it dry-cleaned--"

177
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,453
"Lady, can't you see my baby's outfit?

178
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,081
Dry-cleaning won't cut it!"

179
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,128
"Sir! Can't you see my baby's scared?"

180
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,256
"Baby, are you all right?

181
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,258
Let's go, baby."

182
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,523
"Am I invisible to you?

183
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,234
How do you think I felt?

184
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,236
The woman I love was crying,

185
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,197
but I didn't have the power to help her.

186
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,616
How do you think I felt

187
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,077
asking another man to help you?"

188
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,829
What the hell?

189
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,043
"You are…

190
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,171
inside my heart."

191
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,719
Jin-hwan, that was hilarious!

192
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:55,978
That was great.

193
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,537
Why weren't we chosen?

194
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,625
It's because Ha-young wasn't the lead!

195
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,835
Sol-i, answer me.

196
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,671
"Why can't you say that?"

197
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,549
Don't spit on me.

198
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,177
Jin-hwan.

199
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,057
I sometimes wish…

200
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,434
you couldn't talk.

201
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,690
- Ha-young.
- Shut it.

202
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,276
Come on. Let's go.

203
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,785
15TH EOULLIM DRAMA FESTIVAL
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL

204
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,497
- Okay, let's place it here.
- All right!

205
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,710
Sol-i, what took you so long?
Where's the MP3 player?

206
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,795
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,005
Ha-young and I used it
for our practice sessions.

208
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:05,965
Here you go.

209
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,675
The files are in order,

210
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,051
so just press play.

211
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,595
- I'll buy you snacks next time.
- Sure, got it.

212
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,554
- See you!
- Sure!

213
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:23,607
15TH EOULLIM DRAMA FESTIVAL
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL

214
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,624
Is everything here?

215
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,793
Se-hyeong, do you have the cup?

216
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,004
- It's right here.
- Is it?

217
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,008
- What about the poison?
- It's right here!

218
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,512
"I will always be with you,

219
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,807
and will never leave this castle

220
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,977
that's enveloped in darkness."

221
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,620
Are they going to kiss?

222
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,622
- I'm so jealous.
- They're about to kiss.

223
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,583
They're going to kiss!

224
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,043
No way.

225
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,629
I'm so jealous.

226
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,467
Mi-nyeo, come on.

227
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,015
"'Dear God,
please bless this holy matrimony…'"

228
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,226
"Why must I bless this wedding, though?

229
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,228
I'm fiercely against it."

230
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,898
Then, speak from your heart this time.

231
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,442
Guys, that's my voice!

232
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,860
- "Oh, Romeo."
- Damn it, Sol-i.

233
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,278
"Why did it have to be you?"

234
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,905
"My Romeo."

235
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,074
- "Why are you so handsome?"
- No, please don't.

236
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,950
"Oh, Romeo."

237
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,578
- "Please accept my love!"
- Goodness, Shin Sol-i.

238
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,997
- You'll make a perfect Juliet.
- Right?

239
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,332
Aren't I the best?

240
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,293
- What the hell is going on?
- Don't ask!

241
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,504
- Damn it. Get out of the way.
- Move!

242
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,172
Get out of my way!

243
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,343
Oh, no…

244
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,979
Wow, that was cool.

245
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,817
That was a unique ending.

246
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,194
Good job, class 1-7.

247
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,586
Nicely done!

248
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,261
What kind of a play was that?

249
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,930
Shin Sol-i messed it up, didn't she?

250
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,266
- It was completely ruined.
- I know.

251
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,227
Shin Sol-i's always the problem.

252
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,812
She never does anything right.

253
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,481
- What?
- Have you seen Sol-i?

254
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,276
She's backstage, cleaning up.

255
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,535
Are you feeling better?

256
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,706
DRESSING ROOM

257
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,877
Heon.

258
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,103
Shin Sol-i.

259
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,981
You're a total loser.

00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,333
"That man is mine."

262
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,337
"He is my boyfriend." Why can't you say…

263
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,635
Isn't it like this?

264
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,804
"Let's go, baby!"

LOVERS IN PARIS

If anyone makes fun of you again, tell me.

267
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,055
Is Woo Dae-sung your bodyguard?

268
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,308
Shin Sol-i,
don't you have any self-respect?

269
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,350
Don't mind me.

270
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,186
Are you sure
you don't have a crush on anyone?

271
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,646
Hey, Dae-sung.

272
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,647
Ta-da!

273
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,525
Just trust me and hop on.

274
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,651
What happened?

275
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,529
Your homeroom teacher
called during the day.

276
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,698
Shin Sol-i.

277
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,200
Don't go.

278
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,543
