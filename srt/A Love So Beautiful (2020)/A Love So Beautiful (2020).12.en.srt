00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,164
MARCH 2008, SPRING OF NINETEEN

2
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,106
Mi-nyeo. You've gotten so much prettier.
Did you lose weight?

3
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,610
Do you want to sit here? Hey, move.

4
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,154
- Where will I sit then?
- I don't know. Move.

5
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,282
What's wrong with Se-hyeong?

6
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,742
Did his eyesight get worse?

7
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,036
Poor guy.

8
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,039
Guys!

9
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,792
Breaking news.

10
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,294
Ms. Moon will be
our homeroom teacher again.

11
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,632
Jin-hwan,
you can't call that breaking news.

12
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,218
- Yes, you can. There's one more thing.
- What is it?

13
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,346
After the mock exam,
we're doing community service.

14
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,264
and go on a picnic.

15
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,102
I should've delivered the breaking news.

16
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,938
- Jin-hwan stole my spotlight.
- You are no match for me.

17
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,274
Community service and a picnic?
We should be taking that time to study.

18
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,276
We're seniors now.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,029
Hey, Su-jin. Study hard by yourself then.

20
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,988
- Okay?
- What?

21
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,493
He's so annoying.

22
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,538
What should we do at the picnic?

23
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,249
- Anything. As long as we're out of school.
- Me, too.

24
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,044
Hi.

25
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,671
- Hello.
- Hello.

26
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,966
I see so many familiar faces.

27
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,884
It's good to see you again.

28
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,595
Let's not be at the end
of the ranking this year, please.

29
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,097
- Okay.
- Okay.

30
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,934
Ms. Moon, are we really going
on a picnic after community service?

31
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,771
Yes.
But, don't get too excited before then,

32
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,231
and study hard.

33
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,274
- Okay.
- Okay.

34
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,860
Ms. Moon, after community service,

35
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,195
can we go camping
and have a barbecue party?

36
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,114
- I'm in.
- Ms. Moon.

37
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,283
Let's have fun for the last time.

38
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,785
Ms. Moon.
We'll place first on the mock exam.

39
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,123
- Barbecue!
- Barbecue!

40
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,793
- Barbecue!
- Barbecue!

41
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,044
- Barbecue!
- Okay.

42
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,963
I'll ask for permission.

43
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,364
Heon, I prepared this for you.

44
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,911
Goodness.
Nobody has ever proposed to me like this.

45
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,496
To hell with it. Sol-i, be my girlfriend.

46
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,445
Dae-sung.

47
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,156
What are you thinking about?
Look up when you're walking.

48
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,574
Right.

49
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,078
Anyway, how much money do you have?
You're still counting it.

50
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,414
Not much.
I won't be able to buy snacks this month.

51
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,415
Why not?

52
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,543
That's because…

53
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,188
Isn't this scary?

54
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,524
No, it isn't.

55
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,236
It's not scary. I see.

56
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,654
It's cute. What is it?

57
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,574
It's not scary.

58
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,368
It's cute.

59
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,004
What's your name?

60
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,235
- Hello.
- Hello.

61
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,153
Ta-da.

62
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,863
- Ta-da.
- It's so cute.

63
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,116
Candles.

64
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,543
How pretty.

65
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,969
- Hello?
- Dae-sung, where are you?

66
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,304
PARTY SUPPLIES SHOP

67
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,723
I'm in front of the school.

68
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:52,268
Come to the pool right now then.
The national team coach is here.

69
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,856
Okay.

70
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,486
What is it? Is something wrong?

71
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,532
I have to go first,
so I can't walk you home. I'm sorry.

72
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,576
No, it's okay. You should go.

73
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,079
You'll come to the picnic, right?

74
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,207
Yes, of course.

75
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,793
I'll get going. Get home safe.

76
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,752
Okay.

77
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,134
- Bye.
- Bye.

78
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,680
Go.

79
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,922
What are you doing here?

80
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,590
What's that?

81
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,217
This?

82
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,636
It's a secret.

83
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,221
Why are you out here?

84
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,557
Can't you see?

85
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,270
I'm taking out the trash.

86
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,606
You've been taking out the trash
when the bag isn't full yet.

87
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,776
Since when?

88
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,489
I mean, I thought you were waiting for me.

89
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,784
Me? Why would I?

90
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,497
I mean, I just wish you were.

91
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,674
I must be out of my mind.

92
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,970
Heon, I didn't hear you. What did you say?

93
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,014
Heon!

94
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,767
Payment by card.

95
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,605
Enjoy the movie.

96
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,522
Thank you.

97
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,865
Please give me a ticket
for the movie he's watching.

98
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,201
- Do you want the same movie?
- Yes.

99
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,579
Can I get the seat next to him?

100
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,748
Then, I'll take the one next to her.

101
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,293
What? How did you know I was here?

102
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:26,005
All I did was follow you.
And I ended up here.

103
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,507
Go home. Hurry.

104
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,010
It's dangerous at night.
I'll take you home after the movie.

105
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,136
Excuse me.

106
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,888
Are you going to pay?

107
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,181
- Yes, please.
- No, don't.

108
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,641
- Yes.
- No.

109
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,894
Ha-young and Jin-hwan?

110
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,480
Hello.

111
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,233
Hello.

112
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,626
Ha-young. Say, "Ah."

113
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,586
Just keep your eyes on the movie.

114
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,841
The popcorn is really good.
It's the best snack for movies.

115
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,264
This is the first movie
we're watching together. It will be fun.

116
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,682
Don't talk to me.

117
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,234
Ha-young, isn't this a horror movie?

118
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,319
My heart is pounding.

119
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,491
If it gets too scary,

120
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,285
can I hold your hand?

121
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,494
Stop bothering me!

122
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,674
I'm on a diet.

123
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,265
This is great.
It's not cold at all, is it?

124
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,892
- No.
- It's nice.

125
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,936
- The weather is perfect.
- Great.

126
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,813
- Goodness.
- It's so nice.

127
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,398
- I love it.
- Perfect.

128
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,734
What? Both of you have this?

129
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,737
- Yes. It's really good.
- Really? I should buy one, too.

130
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,030
It's the best.

131
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,159
Be quiet, guys. Are you here to have fun?

132
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,370
- Why are you so noisy?
- Yes, we're here for fun.

133
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,372
Why else would we be here, for a test?

134
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,668
Why is he so tough on us?
Is he a drill sergeant or something?

135
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,379
"Depending on your attitude,
today could be heaven--"

136
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,173
"Or hell."

137
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,549
We're getting along today.

138
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,550
Nice.

139
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,620
I'm not following you.

140
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,331
I know. Who cares?

141
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,480
Hey, Mi-nyeo.

142
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,315
Can I have a bite? I'm hungry.

143
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,068
- Yes. Sit down.
- Really?

144
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,698
Say, "Ah."

145
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,576
- Isn't it yummy?
- It is.

146
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,592
Ha-young. Drink this.

147
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,803
No, thanks.

148
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,765
Ha-young, are you mad at me?

149
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,602
Yes. Totally.

150
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,230
Why? What did I do wrong?

151
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,608
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,446
- You're so stupid.
- I won't do it again.

153
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,950
- Hold this.
- Yes, ma'am.

154
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,164
"Collect the trash."

155
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,405
It's Heon.

156
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,931
I'm exhausted.

157
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:15,062
Ms. Moon, you should've added
sliced ham instead of tomato.

158
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,818
- Lean on me.
- What?

159
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,695
I'll be your backrest.

160
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,117
It's comfortable.

161
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,495
You aren't mad at me anymore, right?

162
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,331
Your back is vibrating. Don't talk.

163
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,666
Okay.

164
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,961
By the way,

165
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:44,049
sitting back to back like this
makes my heart race.

166
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,136
Stop disturbing me and be quiet.

167
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,975
Thank you, Ms. Moon.

168
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,935
I appreciate it.

169
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,628
What song was this again?

170
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,383
You…

171
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,094
You're

172
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,764
too dangerous.

173
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,822
Based on what I saw
for the last two days, he's doing great.

174
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,660
It's only natural
for a young swimmer to have ups and downs.

175
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,912
He has potential.

176
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,456
- Can he make the national team?
- Yes.

177
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,000
If he keeps up,
he'll make the Olympic team too.

178
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,921
Dae-sung, I'll see you
at the National Training Center soon.

179
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,550
Thank you!

180
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,366
- Really?
- Yes.

181
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,283
Heon.

182
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,327
I can't open this.

183
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,329
Can you help me?

184
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,248
Okay.

185
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,292
- Look at that.
- Give me that.

186
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,838
- Thanks.
- Put it down.

187
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,923
Put it down!

188
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,134
What should we do?

189
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,772
- Oh, Sol-i!
- Oh, Sol-i!

190
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,609
All right.

191
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,989
Let's do our best this year.

192
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,073
- Okay.
- Okay.

193
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,700
"We can't put it off any longer.

194
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,661
My marriage, your university!"

195
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,788
What?

196
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,124
What are you doing?

197
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,834
My marriage!

198
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,754
- Our university!
- Our university!

199
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,757
Thank you.

200
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,718
- I'm starving.
- It's really delicious.

201
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,386
It's really good.

202
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,061
Heon.

203
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,822
Meet me at the trail over there
in five minutes.

204
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,718
Thank you, my friends.

205
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,637
Why isn't this lighting?

206
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,683
I finished my community service,
but why am I doing this again?

207
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,561
Hey, stop whining and just do it.

208
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,064
Got it.

209
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,902
Everything looks so romantic.

210
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,571
Everything looks so excessive.

211
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,618
Hey, Heon is coming.

212
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,204
- Hurry.
- There are still a few more to light.

213
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,163
Just go, idiot.

214
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,082
- Sol-i, good luck.
- Thanks.

215
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,042
Good luck.

216
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,632
Hey, Heon.

217
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,892
Why did you wrap this around yourself?

218
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,185
I was in a hurry.

219
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,314
Ha-young, if you like romantic events,
shall I prepare one for you?

220
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,734
Be quiet. I'm still mad at you.

221
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,821
Why are you mad at me?
We had fun watching a movie yesterday.

222
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,157
Quiet. I think Heon is almost here.

223
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,158
- Get ready.
- Okay.

224
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,664
What about your family? Do they know?

225
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,294
No.

226
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,091
One, two, three.

227
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,939
TODAY IS OUR DAY 1

228
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,394
Don't look.

229
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,096
Did you like Sol-i, too,
but played hard to get?

230
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,015
You did. You played hard to get.

231
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,141
That's not it.

232
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,393
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

233
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,603
Why are you always causing trouble?

234
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,730
Stop. Go in first.

235
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,231
What are you doing right now?

236
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,608
Heon. You're such a jerk.

237
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,533
I had a lot of fun today. Thanks.

238
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,951
So did I.

239
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,203
Is this yours?

240
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,246
No.

241
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,750
- I like Sol-i.
- So what?

242
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,959
Don't hurt her feelings.

243
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,925
