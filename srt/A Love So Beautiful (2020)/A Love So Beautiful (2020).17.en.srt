00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:40,123
NOVEMBER 2008, DAY OF CSAT EXAM

2
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,249
There she is.

3
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,584
- How did you do?
- Over here!

4
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,794
- You must be exhausted.
- Actually, I'm good.

5
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,130
- Good job.
- Did you do well?

6
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,298
Yeon-hae, over here!

7
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,175
Heon, did you wait long?

8
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,011
- Not really.
- Did you do well on your test?

9
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,223
I don't know. What about you?

10
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,391
Me?

11
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,977
I'm just thrilled that it's over.

12
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,188
Let's have some fun!

13
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,296
- Did you do well on your test?
- What?

14
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,840
I guess.

15
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,065
- Aren't you coming?
- What?

16
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,401
I'm coming.

17
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,834
Well, the CSAT is finally over.

18
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,545
We'll be 20 years old soon.

19
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,799
When will I get myself a girlfriend?

20
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,679
As if I stand a chance.

21
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,348
Why do you say that?

22
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,476
Because I'm…

23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,355
You know how I am.

24
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,191
You can say…

25
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,986
you have a girlfriend now.

26
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,739
What do you mean?

27
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,992
Tell everyone you have a girlfriend now.

28
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,916
Tell them that I'm your girlfriend.

29
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,753
Really? Are you sure?

30
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,676
I finally have a girlfriend!

31
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,554
- Kang Ha-young is my girlfriend!
- Jin-hwan!

32
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,473
Sorry.

33
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,101
Are you going to take it back?

34
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,937
No, that's not it.

35
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,481
Don't jump around.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,610
What if you hurt yourself?

37
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,450
Wait for me!

38
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,494
My girlfriend.

39
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,038
Ha-young!

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,212
What fine weather we have.

41
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,882
You think?

42
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,803
DECEMBER 2008
CSAT RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT DAY

43
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,013
CSAT RESULTS

44
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,600
- Good job.
- Thank you.

45
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,686
- Gwak Yu-jin.
- Yes?

46
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,940
- Heon, I can't believe it.
- Good job.

47
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,900
- What is it?
- Sol-i.

48
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,193
- What's wrong?
- Kang Sang-hun.

49
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,569
I got…

50
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,781
Compared to all the mock exams I took…

51
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,285
- Ha Dae-yun.
- This is my highest score yet.

52
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,372
- Lee Ji-won.
- Yes.

53
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,958
No way. Sol-i, congratulations!

54
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,294
- Could this be a system error?
- Kim Seong-jae.

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,131
- Heon.
- Thank you.

56
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,592
- Kang Ji-yeon.
- Yes.

57
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,722
- Good job.
- I can't believe it.

58
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,062
What?

59
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,607
How's yours? Is it good?

60
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,239
It's sweet.

61
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,783
I see.

62
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,670
It's too sweet. You can have it.

63
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,839
Are you sure? Nice!

64
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,680
No way.

65
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,518
Heon, we just kissed.

66
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,663
By the way, when will you write it?

67
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,457
- Write what?
- The relay letter.

68
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,667
You're the only one
who hasn't written in it.

69
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,631
Are you done?

70
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,262
When will you write it?

71
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,647
That's only for those
who will be parting ways.

72
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,239
Heon, wait for me!

73
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,075
HANKUK UNIVERSITY ADMISSION RESULT

74
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,253
YOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED
TO HANKUK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL

75
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:24,050
Heon, you got in. Mom, he was accepted!

76
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,844
Good job.

77
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,701
SHIN SOL-I

78
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,087
The person you called cannot be reached…

79
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,015
Ta-da!

80
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,101
Ta-da! I got in as well.

81
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,146
I'll visit you often on campus.

82
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,814
Heon was also accepted there.

83
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,192
What about Sol-i?
She's not answering my calls.

84
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,403
Right. She hasn't replied
to my texts either.

85
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,081
Sol-i, are you all right?

86
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm the only one who didn't get in.

87
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,421
It's all right. Don't be too upset.

88
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,132
Your mom and I weren't
the smartest in school either.

89
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,135
University isn't everything.

90
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,429
You can take over
one of our pork trotter places.

91
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,638
How does CEO Shin sound?

92
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,348
We're opening another branch store.

93
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,061
And get her accused of nepotism?
She can't start off as a CEO.

94
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,356
- A manager sounds better.
- Right, I guess that can be an issue.

95
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,943
Then why not have her
as the manager of our Mapo branch?

96
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,362
That sounds great.

97
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,781
You've got to be kidding me!

98
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,624
Hi, Heon. What brings you by?

99
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,417
Sol-i's not answering her phone.

100
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,407
Everyone got in, but not me.

101
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,868
What do I do?

102
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,079
Isn't it obvious?

103
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,665
Take the test again.

104
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,001
Next year?

105
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,880
As if that's easy, you jerk.

106
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,591
I'll help.

107
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,928
- How?
- Study for art university.

108
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,975
- Art university?
- You like art.

109
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,728
Would I be able to do it?

110
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,356
Shin Sol-i,

111
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,609
do you know what my CSAT score is?

112
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,947
I do. Are you bragging?

113
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,158
You colossal jerk!

114
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,921
That's why I can help you.

115
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,174
What?

116
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,051
Let me tutor you.

117
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,804
Take the CSAT next year
and get into my university.

118
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,556
Your university?

119
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,142
- It has an art program.
- Really?

120
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,852
Besides, medical school lasts six years.

121
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,730
We can still graduate together.

122
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,399
What if I never get to graduate?

123
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,234
I hear it's not that easy.

124
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,739
You're worrying before even getting in?

125
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,034
Yes. I'd be able to get in
with your help anyway.

126
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,786
Think about getting in first.

127
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,707
Got it. So what should I start with?

128
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,210
Art school requires a performance test.

129
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,324
Will you be all right?

130
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,202
Take it easy on the preliminaries.

131
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,663
Don't worry.

132
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,457
I'm going to win the finals too.

133
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,002
Don't overwork yourself.

134
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,392
WOO DAE-SUNG

135
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,437
Hey, Dae-sung.

136
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,608
The final round starts soon. Wish me luck.

137
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,362
Of course. You've got this.
You'll win for sure.

138
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,367
Thanks. I feel confident now.

139
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,995
So, how did it go for you?

140
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,959
I'm retaking the CSAT next year.
You'll root for me too, right?

141
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,461
Of course, I will.

142
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,423
Thanks. We'll both do well. Good luck.

143
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,091
Okay. Good luck.

144
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,397
The men's 400m freestyle event begins!

145
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,691
Lane Three, Four, and Five
are neck and neck.

146
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,402
Woo Dae-sung seems
to be in good shape today.

147
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,571
He and Gu Hwan-su are neck and neck.
Come on, Woo.

148
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,407
Woo Dae-sung has taken the lead.

149
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,452
Woo Dae-sung is the first
to make his flip turn.

150
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,954
He now picks up his final pace.

151
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,665
Who will win the gold medal today?

152
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,167
It is still up for grabs.

153
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,543
Only 15m remains.

154
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,253
Will it be Woo Dae-sung?

155
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,881
Woo Dae-sung touches the finish line.

156
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,257
Woo Dae-sung wins the gold!

157
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,508
The gold medal

158
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,594
goes to Woo Dae-sung as expected!

159
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,013
- Korea wins a gold medal again.
- Nice!

160
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,141
Dad, he won the gold medal!

161
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,560
He did it!

162
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,188
Dae-sung!

163
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,939
Dae-sung,

164
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,775
despite suffering a slump
from your shoulder injury,

165
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,277
you won the gold medal.

166
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,612
Can you give us a comment?

167
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,033
I mustered up the courage
and decided to start over.

168
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,620
As it turns out, it could be done.

169
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,957
That is why I'd like to tell my friend
to hang in there as well.

170
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,877
WOO DAE-SUNG

171
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,378
Shin Sol-i, you can do it.

172
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,130
Good luck on retaking the CSAT!

173
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,052
Sol-i, he just mentioned you.

174
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,513
My daughter was mentioned on TV!

175
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,681
Dad, I'm doomed.

176
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,852
- Why?
- The whole nation knows now.

177
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,775
That I'm retaking the CSAT next year!

178
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,907
FEBRUARY 2009, GRADUATION DAY

179
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,497
GRADUATION

180
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,165
DIPLOMA

181
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,671
I'm graduating high school for real.

182
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,280
JUNE 2009, SUMMER OF TWENTY

183
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,046
I don't know if you've heard this,

184
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,549
but there's a myth that eating the prop

185
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,176
will prevent you
from getting into university.

186
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,305
- Really?
- No way. That's a lie.

187
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,435
When the iliopsoas contracts,

188
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,688
they pull the spine toward them.

189
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,899
As the spine is pulled forward,

190
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,486
pressure is applied, causing back pain…

191
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,955
Who's there?

192
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,834
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,004
- You should have told me in advance.
- I'll get going.

194
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,798
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,189
Hello?

196
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,567
What's up?

197
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,904
What? You're the one who called me.

198
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,364
Did you dial the wrong number?

199
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,617
I'll hang up then. I'm busy studying.

200
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,534
Okay.

201
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,713
SHIN SOL-I
CALL ENDED

202
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,716
DECEMBER 2009, WINTER OF TWENTY

203
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,636
Sol-i, we're here to see you.

204
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,012
How are you doing?

205
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,556
Jin-hwan! Ha-young!

206
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,308
Ha-young's mine.

207
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,900
Heon!

208
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,446
When did you last wash your hair?

209
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,367
Yesterday?

210
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,286
The day before that?

211
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,622
What brings you all here?

212
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,999
We came to wish you luck.

213
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,335
- Tomorrow's your test day.
- Let our energy give you strength.

214
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,088
I'm here too!

215
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,590
Dae-sung!

216
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,395
Seriously? After the hours
it took for me to fly here?

217
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,815
You can't treat me this way.

218
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,319
I guess I have no choice then.
I should just head back.

219
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,204
Seriously? You won't stop me from going?

220
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,248
You especially, Jin-hwan.

221
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,127
Sol-i, you've got this, right?

222
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,046
You'll get accepted this year.

223
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,714
Good luck, Sol-i!

224
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm sure you'll do well.

225
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,390
Please.

226
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,817
YOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED…

227
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,069
- Honey!
- What?

228
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,737
- Sol-i!
- "Accepted"!

229
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,906
- I got in!
- Yes!

230
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,075
- I can't believe it.
- I'm so proud of you.

231
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,785
You did it!

232
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,036
Cheers.

233
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,704
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

234
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,503
Who knew that this day would come?

235
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,255
Shin Sol-i was accepted
into Hankuk University?

236
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,009
- Sol-i, congratulations on making it in.
- Yes, congratulations.

237
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,761
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

238
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,931
Thank you so much, guys.

239
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,518
All right. Let's be the college students
that we are and party all night.

240
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,769
Cheers!

241
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,187
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

242
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,774
Mi-nyeo.

243
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,153
For some reason,
you seem exceptionally pretty today.

244
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,697
I've always been pretty.

245
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,994
My mom calls me a lottery ticket
that hasn't been scratched off yet.

246
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,834
Can I be the one to give it a try?

247
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,836
My gosh!

248
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,008
You two. Make sure
to head home separately tonight.

249
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,052
All right?

250
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,267
Ha-young, let's go.

251
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,728
I'm not drunk.

252
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,273
Of course. I'm fully aware of that.

253
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,608
Hold on.

254
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,527
All right.

255
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,203
Sol-i.

256
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,831
Sol-i, are you all right?

257
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,796
Cha Heon, you prick.

258
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,384
What?

259
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,184
Let's go.

260
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,498
Heon, watch me walk in a straight line.

261
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,542
Walking like a model.

262
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,760
Thanks, Heon.

263
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,637
For what?

264
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,016
I was able to get into university
thanks to you.

265
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,560
Heon.

266
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,021
You know…

267
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,402
that I like you a lot, right?

268
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,075
I've liked you since…

269
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,663
- Since…
- Sol-i.

270
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,706
Yes?

271
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,126
Would you be able to remember

272
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,545
what happened tonight?

273
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,798
Yes!

274
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:57,065
Heon, did you really just
call me your girlfriend?

275
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,401
- Take us with you.
- It's just for two people.

276
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,070
You disloyal jerk.
When did you become a romantic?

277
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,364
Hi, Dae-sung. I'm a huge fan.

278
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,658
Dae-sung is on a roll!

279
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,160
He's a superstar now.

280
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,870
Hey! Who do you think you are?

281
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,830
- Who are you?
- He's my boyfriend.

282
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,082
Heon! You and your girlfriend
are famous now.

283
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,542
What are you doing tonight?

284
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,919
Don't go back to your dorm tonight.
Stay with me.

285
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,173
All night? But I'm not mentally prepared.

286
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:30,724
