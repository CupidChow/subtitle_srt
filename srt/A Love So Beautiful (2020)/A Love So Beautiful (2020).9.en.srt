1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,246
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME

2
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,498
I LIKE SHIN SOL-I

3
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,711
What do I do?

4
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,434
Sol-i, Shin Sol-i!

5
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,230
Do you have something on your mind?
Why the glum face?

6
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,524
Did you skip your morning pooping hour?

7
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,111
Don't tell me you have
a bad case of constipation.

8
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,366
Why aren't you talking?
You're boring me, you know.

9
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,037
Shin Sol-i was never the quiet type.

10
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,082
No way, it can't be!

11
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,668
Did you get into a lovers' quarrel
with Dae-sung?

12
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,462
I'm right, aren't I?

13
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,546
Good morning.

14
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,258
What the hell? I guess I'm wrong.

15
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,971
I need to poop.

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,848
- Don't tell.
- See you.

17
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,479
He's busy from early in the morning.

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,488
Oh, right. Hi.

19
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,999
- Bye.
- Bye.

20
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,967
You've been listless all day.

21
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,552
What's wrong? What's going on?

22
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,644
I LIKE SHIN SOL-I

23
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,189
You have to keep it secret, okay?

24
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,649
No way.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,568
Was it Cha Heon?

26
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,238
That's what I thought, but it wasn't.

27
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,614
Who was it, then?

28
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,242
Woo Dae-sung?

29
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,286
What should I do?

30
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,542
What else? Just go out with him.

31
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,210
- What?
- My friend.

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,379
Just think about it.

33
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,840
You never noticed
because you kept your eyes on Heon,

34
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,925
but Dae-sung is pretty handsome, too.

35
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,637
Let's be honest.
Dae-sung is sweet and handsome.

36
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,473
Also, what about the prize money
he wins at tournaments?

37
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,103
He could buy everything
from here to there.

38
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,689
No, he could buy the entire snack bar.

39
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,650
Sure, snack bars are nice.

40
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,238
The class starts soon. Hurry up.

41
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,456
But Heon's like a department store to me.

42
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,171
Heon,

43
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,049
can you lend a hand?

44
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,801
I need to bring the class notes
from the staff room.

45
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:46,976
Cha Heon,

46
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,772
I gave up the snack bar for you.

47
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,399
Dae-sung, you see…

48
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,616
The thing is…

49
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,578
What's going on? Just tell me.

50
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,502
The Game of Truth note

51
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,880
you wrote that day.

52
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,758
I saw it!

53
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,570
Oh, that?

54
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,531
That was just a joke.

55
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,491
Did you believe that?

56
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,869
What?

57
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,996
Who takes that game seriously?

58
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,914
Goodness.

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,835
Brother, you're something else.

60
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,836
Are you sure?

61
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,089
Of course.
Once a brother, always a brother.

62
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,094
Exactly. We're brothers!

63
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,058
You better watch out of con men.

64
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,142
You'll be in trouble.

65
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,897
Sorry about that.
I was worried for no reason.

66
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,501
Yes, Coach. Got it.

67
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,921
Coach is looking for me.

68
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,798
- I should go now.
- Sure.

69
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,549
Bye.

70
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,695
Hey, Heon.

71
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,030
Are you taking out the trash?

72
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,450
Yes.

73
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,206
- What is it?
- Where have you been?

74
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,167
Oh, I was with Dae-sung.

75
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,014
Don't stay out so late.

76
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,307
What?

77
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,693
Okay. I won't stay out late.

78
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,737
I'll always come home early!

79
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,829
MILK

80
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,710
Exactly. We're brothers!

81
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,545
I was worried for no reason.

82
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,187
- Did you do your homework?
- No, I'm going to copy yours.

83
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,487
Chocolate milk delivery.

84
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,658
Don't want to lose you

85
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,659
Ha-young.

86
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,993
Thanks.

87
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,833
Wang Se-hyeong.

88
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,758
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

89
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,401
I don't get this topic at all.

90
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,195
Of course, it's essential. Right?

91
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,074
Why else are we studying our butts off?
To go to university.

92
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,617
By the way,

93
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,953
a certain member of our group
seems out of place.

94
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,663
How annoying.

95
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,915
I like the lineup, though.

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,336
I'm glad we're in
the same group, too, Hui-ji.

97
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,215
She's the issue here.

98
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,011
Come on. Sol-i will do a good job.

99
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,473
Sol-i, how do you think
we should prepare this debate?

100
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,809
What? Me?

101
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:05,813
Come to think of it, you can relate
the most to the opposing side.

102
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,482
You're the one who's least likely
to graduate from university.

103
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,777
Well, I think…

104
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,907
You see… Well…

105
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,996
This is my first time preparing a debate.

106
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,707
Sol-i, have some confidence.

107
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,667
I'll help you out.

108
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,464
Okay. I'll make sure
to practice this weekend.

109
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,732
After all that running around,
my feet are begging for some air.

110
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,359
I'm taking off my shoes.

111
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,200
Never mind. I'll just keep them on.
I think that's better.

112
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,160
What do you mean?

113
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,038
Nothing. Never mind.

114
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,959
Then just take them off.

115
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,803
No!

116
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,057
I don't have athlete's foot.

117
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,643
See? The other one is a normal sock.

118
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,728
I don't normally wear socks like this.

119
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,981
My mom matched one of mine with my dad's,

120
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,733
and I didn't have time to change.

121
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,527
Who asked?

122
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,321
Don't take it the wrong way, okay?

123
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,739
I don't have athlete's foot.

124
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,133
The weather's terrible today.

125
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,718
It could rain any second.

126
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,720
Let's go home before it does.

127
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,556
But it's sunny.

128
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,729
Heon, you believe me, right?

129
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,731
I don't have athlete's foot.

130
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,156
Hello.

131
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,075
- Ghost Walk, please.
- Sure.

132
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,413
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

133
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,831
Enjoy the movie.

134
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,338
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

135
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,549
I'd like a ticket
for the movie he's watching.

136
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,594
- I'm sorry, but--
- I'll explain.

137
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,473
He's actually my older brother.

138
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,185
All the hard studying
has been messing with his head,

139
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,354
so my mom asked me
to keep an eye on him today.

140
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,065
Got it. Which seat?

141
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,610
I'll sit a few rows behind him.

142
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,652
Sure.

143
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,197
- Here.
- Okay.

144
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,742
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

145
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,713
Why is this only money you have?

146
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,882
Right, Jin-hwan.

147
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,134
This isn't even close
to the amount from before.

148
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,637
You were so generous that day, remember?

149
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,473
Jin-hwan, as your best friend,
I'm disappointed.

150
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,434
I never gave you the money.
You took it from me.

151
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,853
What did he just say?

152
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,148
Do you even know
what kind of trouble you put me in?

153
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,944
Why should I give you my money?

154
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,863
Jin-hwan, keep it down, will you?

155
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,491
- Don't raise your voice.
- I guess we have no choice.

156
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,784
Hey.

157
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,994
Who are you?

158
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,205
What the hell?

159
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,706
- What?
- Who the hell are you?

160
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,916
Hold on.

161
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,168
Why are you bullying him?

162
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,254
Gosh, Jin-hwan,

163
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,506
- Is she your girlfriend?
- Wow, damn.

164
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,133
Jin-hwan, nice going.

165
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,301
Hey!

166
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,515
- Leave her alone.
- You've lost your mind, haven't you?

167
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,351
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

168
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,228
I said… I'm fine.

169
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,231
Look, being a girl doesn't give you
a free pass.

170
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,233
- What makes you so cheeky?
- The police.

171
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,278
- I already called them.
- "I called them."

172
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,988
- What a liar.
- So where are they?

173
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,155
- Officer?
- Where?

174
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,157
See? No one's around--

175
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,660
Are you guys all right?

176
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,578
You little…

177
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,749
Take that!

178
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,627
Run!

179
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,432
Jeong Jin-hwan, where did you go?

180
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,310
Hey, let's go that way.

181
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,728
You check over there.

182
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,105
I need to run again? Damn it.

183
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,865
God, that was scary as hell.

184
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,620
Hey.

185
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,331
Is this how you lost your money before?

186
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,499
Yes.

187
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,545
Those bastards.

188
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,301
Are you all prepared for the debate?

189
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,721
Well… Yes.

190
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,766
I prepared the best I could.

191
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,896
I mean, I…

192
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,273
Shin Sol-i, do better, will you?

193
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:45,027
If you speak like that in class later,
our team will be screwed.

194
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,489
Then, will you make up for my grades?

195
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,671
Many celebrities don't
go to university these days.

196
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,632
Right.

197
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,468
Not many athletes
graduate from university, either.

198
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,179
The same goes for entrepreneurs.

199
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,307
Right, I guess that's true.

200
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,448
According to the affirmative team,

201
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,492
the most basic tool for finding success

202
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,286
is a university diploma.

203
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,622
I believe the statement
to be contradictory.

204
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,376
I'd like to ask them in return

205
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,171
if everyone who's considered successful
actually has a degree.

206
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,590
AFFIRMATIVE

207
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,051
NEGATIVE

208
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,852
Me?

209
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:08,944
I'd like to give an example
by mentioning someone we all know.

210
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,198
It's Woo Dae-sung.

211
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,910
Me?

212
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,290
Dae-sung hasn't even
entered university yet,

213
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,002
but he's already an acknowledged swimmer

214
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,672
both domestically and internationally.

215
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,469
Just like Dae-sung,
many athletes and celebrities

216
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,721
didn't go to university after graduating.

217
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,141
I believe we all have
our own goals or dreams

218
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,269
that will bring us happiness or success.

219
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,440
One may want to be a chef.

220
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,192
Another may want to become a writer.

221
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,487
yet another may even
dream of becoming a singer.

222
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,323
Who are we to measure one's success

223
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,410
based solely on whether
they have a university diploma?

224
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,846
"Who are we to measure one's success

225
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,183
based solely on whether
they have a university diploma?

226
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,310
What you all think?"

227
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,437
I never said that!

228
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,649
Sol-i, how did you come up with that?

229
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,609
I'm amazed.

230
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,277
You can thank me later.

231
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,530
Nonsense. How did you help me?

232
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,658
"Yet another may even
dream of becoming a singer."

233
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,911
Who would that be? Me, of course.

234
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,789
You always talk the talk.

235
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,332
Then why weren't you able

236
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,668
to do so in front of
those money-stealing bullies

237
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,545
until Ha-young showed up?

238
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,672
- Hey, that's a secret!
- Who were they?

239
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,966
Let's go. I'll teach them a lesson.

240
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,425
I wasn't bullied.

241
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,803
Besides, they didn't take much.

242
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,346
How long has it been going on?

243
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,606
Back in seventh grade,

244
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,235
they locked me in a storage room

245
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,531
and forced me to sing a song.

246
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,909
I was so scared at the time.

247
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,954
- Without knowing--
- You wet yourself?

248
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
They had me wrapped around their fingers
since then.

249
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,548
I embarrass you, don't I?

250
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,967
Of course not.

251
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,219
When I first learned how to swim,

252
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,514
I wet myself too in the swimming pool.

253
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,146
I was an outcast in middle school.

254
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,284
When I was a kid,

255
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,037
I once drank plum wine and got wasted.

256
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,830
- What? No way.
- No way.

257
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,707
When? Where?

258
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,542
You don't need to know.

259
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,506
My dad once gave me athlete's foot.

260
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,759
No way. That's shocking.

261
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,135
Very shocking.

262
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,554
What? Isn't this the least shocking one?

263
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,265
- I don't think so.
- What?

264
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,101
But those toe socks from before--

265
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,438
That's not the case. I'm completely cured.

266
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,232
My feet are fungus-free now.

267
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,816
Ms. Shin Sol-i,

268
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,361
athlete's foot can recur anytime.

269
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,157
Jeong Jin-hwan, you…

270
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,243
Ha-young, do something!

271
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,328
Stop. That's enough, you guys.

272
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,665
- You jerk.
- Yes, you jerk.

273
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,291
Which socks are you wearing today?

274
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,591
YEAR 1999, SOL-I'S HOUSE

275
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,218
Block underneath…

276
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,928
and punch!

277
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,806
Block underneath and punch!

278
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,141
Is this drunken boxing or tawkwondo?

279
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,768
Did you drink all that?

280
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,895
- Heon, are you all right?
- Goodness.

281
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:16,275
Slice with the right, slice with the left.

282
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,861
Slice with the right and block.

283
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,700
My goodness.

284
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,120
He has a bright future, don't you think?

285
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,163
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

286
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,082
Gosh.

287
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,769
Heon, you could be a singer.

288
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,438
Here, use mine.

289
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,897
Are you okay?

290
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,984
- Some people already died overseas.
- Am I going to die?

291
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,777
It'll be all right. Nothing will happen.

292
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,696
Heon, aren't you going to see Sol-i?

293
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,323
By the way, where's Heon?

294
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,782
Could you give this to her?

295
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,409
Heon asked me to give this.

296
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,244
Who in the world did this?

297
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,581
I wish I was sick for a bit longer.

298
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,916
Sol-i. Don't worry.

299
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:21,048
