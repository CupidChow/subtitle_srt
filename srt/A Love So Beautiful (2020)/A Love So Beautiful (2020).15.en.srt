1
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,872
I'll draw some blood.

2
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,500
Raise your arm, please.

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,729
Darn, it hurts!

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,814
It hurts!

5
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,526
It doesn't hurt at all.

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,987
Are you done already?
I didn't feel a thing.

7
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,532
I haven't even inserted the needle yet.

8
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,618
Here I go.

9
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,333
That hurts!

10
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,959
Are you feeling better now?

11
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,253
Of course. I'm as good as new again.

12
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,965
Guys, don't I look cooler
in this hospital gown?

13
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,719
He's back to his old self again.

14
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,146
Ha-young will be here soon.

15
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,774
I think.

16
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,403
You're high school seniors.
Aren't you busy?

17
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,323
Is it okay for you to be here?

18
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,828
Ha-young!

19
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,004
These are class notes.

20
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,215
I figured you'd need them.

21
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,719
It's okay.

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,681
My mom hired a tutor for me.

23
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,601
Really?

24
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,153
- Dae-sung!
- Yes?

25
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,864
Why does it seem
like you lost some muscle?

26
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,240
Have you been slacking off?

27
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:41,411
Let's see. You were slacking off!
Practice harder!

28
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,873
Cha Heon! Are you studying hard?

29
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,375
Help Sol-i study from time to time

30
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,128
and lend a helping hand. Okay?

31
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,338
Right. Study hard, guys.

32
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,718
By the way, swimmers are more muscular
in the shoulders and back.

33
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,011
Feel my shoulders--

34
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,096
- What's wrong? Are you all right?
- Seriously?

35
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,141
Seriously, swimming student?

36
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,060
Sorry. But you know what?

37
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,521
Swimmers tend to have slimmer arms.

38
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,815
Heon!

39
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,191
- Hello.
- Hi.

40
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,903
- Hi, Geon.
- Hi, Sol-i.

41
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,947
Heon, are you going to be a math teacher?

42
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,742
- "Math teacher"?
- Not a math teacher.

43
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,118
A mathematics professor.

44
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,828
That's right, a professor.

45
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,873
Heon, I heard you'll become a professor
if you go to KEIST.

46
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,541
KEIST?

47
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,462
Yes, my mom said
he'll be studying at KEIST.

48
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,506
I see. KEIST.

49
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,678
You have to be really smart
to get in there.

50
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,556
Anyway, Sol-i,
which university will you go to?

51
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,143
I'm not sure.

52
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,439
- Ms. Moon, I'll head inside first.
- Sure.

53
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,025
- See you again, Geon.
- Bye, Sol-i!

54
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,444
- Go home and get some rest.
- Okay.

55
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,072
Heon, I'll get going.

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,199
Sure.

57
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,298
It will depend on the major you select,

58
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:21,427
but with your current grades…

59
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,470
ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT STATUS

60
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,349
You'll have a shot at a local college.

61
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,104
It's not too late
to start studying harder now.

62
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,942
Ms. Moon, in that case…

63
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,487
- What about KEIST?
- Where?

64
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,118
No. Never mind.

65
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,079
If you study really hard,
you will get good results.

66
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,914
Try your best.

67
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,167
Sure.

68
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,507
KEIST?

69
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,885
I must've heard wrong.

70
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,312
I clearly warned you before.

71
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,939
It's no longer
about your swimming career now.

72
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,816
At this rate,

73
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,570
you might not be able
to move your shoulders anymore.

74
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,364
Doctor,

75
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,868
prescribe me some painkillers
to handle the pain for a few days.

76
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,453
I can't.

77
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,623
I'll handle my pain.

78
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,793
I can't give up
right before the national team selection.

79
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,421
Coach, I mean…

80
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,133
Dad.

81
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,763
I can do this. You know that.

82
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:03,047
Making you my lady became a dream of mine

83
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,632
I will…

84
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,392
What on Earth? What's going on?

85
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,645
I'm sorry,
but I desperately need your help.

86
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,652
See that girl over there
right in front of my ward?

87
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,655
Can you please tell her

88
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,409
that I was discharged
and I'll never be back here again?

89
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,328
I can't, Mr. Jung.
Please go back to your room now.

90
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,414
Please. I'm begging you.

91
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,834
Just this once.

92
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,297
You're Jin-hwan's friend, right?

93
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,215
Yes.

94
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,343
He asked me to tell you
that he's been discharged.

95
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,032
Mr. Jung,
go back to your room immediately!

96
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,661
Just give me one minute.
No, thirty seconds.

97
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,041
Please go back to your ward.

98
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,417
Fifteen seconds, please.

99
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,687
Your friend is leaving.

100
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,121
Thank you.

101
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,002
Mr. Lee, thank you for all you've done.

102
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,632
Visit us from time to time
when you're back in Korea.

103
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,092
Sure.

104
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,679
Thank you for everything.

105
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,182
Keep us updated every now and then.

106
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,269
Thanks a lot.

107
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,835
Remember how I said I'm quite capable?

108
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,755
I was immediately offered a job,
so I accepted it.

109
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,799
Mr. Lee.

110
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,093
I've always wanted to live in the US.

111
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,055
Make sure to call me
if you ever come to the US.

112
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,850
I'll be there at the airport
to pick you up.

113
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,814
Promise me.
I'll definitely visit there someday.

114
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,482
Sure.

115
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,822
We'll greet each other with a smile
when that day comes.

116
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,660
- Okay.
- Keep studying hard.

117
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,121
Take care.

118
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,464
Bye, Mr. Lee.

119
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,460
Did he leave? Did you say goodbye?

120
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,546
Yes, I did.

121
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,096
Doesn't it feel like something is missing?

122
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,015
I guess.

123
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,185
But we'll probably get used to it soon.

124
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,439
Would we?

125
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,566
I highly doubt it.

126
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,486
Why's that? Is something going on?

127
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,864
One question.

128
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,535
How long will it take
to get from Suwon to KEIST?

129
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,412
Over two hours?

130
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:46,997
Probably.

131
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,793
Do you think

132
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:55,047
there's a possibility
that Heon doesn't make it into KEIST?

133
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,676
If we don't go to the same university,
we'll have a long-distance relationship.

134
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,388
Still, two hours is short.

135
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,141
I'll need a twelve-hour trip to the US.

136
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,026
Did you buy this for me? Thanks.

137
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,406
No, I bought that for Heon…

138
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,326
That's really delicious.

139
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,579
I only finished half of it.

140
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,789
What? There's only half a carton left.

141
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,503
Heon, this is for you.

142
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,573
Beginners

143
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,742
can start first.

144
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,037
You first.

145
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,581
No, you.

146
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,338
Hurry up and start.
I'm on the winner's side.

147
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,466
Good luck.

148
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,362
That was awesome!

149
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,089
Good luck, Heon.

150
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,471
That was so close.

151
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,682
That was close.

152
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,522
You're so cool!

153
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,649
You must be good at every sport.

154
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,817
Right?

155
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,237
I do look cooler when I'm playing sports.

156
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,573
What do you say?
Do you want me to teach you?

157
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,742
- Yes, teach me!
- Okay, here.

158
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,161
Sol-i, let's go.

159
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,747
What? Already?

160
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,874
But I want to give this a shot.

161
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,668
- All I did was watch.
- Aren't you going to study?

162
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,338
Just a little. Please.

163
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,257
I'll get going, then.

164
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,014
- Hold the cue.
- All right.

165
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,642
Place your hand here

166
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:39,188
and make a circle with your thumb
and index finger like that.

167
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,272
Palm on the table.

168
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,732
- The table?
- Yes.

169
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,233
And the elbow at a right angle.

170
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,235
- Right angle.
- Bend down a little lower.

171
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,155
One, two…

172
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,160
- Teach me some other time. Bye!
- Okay.

173
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,388
Heon, that wasn't your first time, right?

174
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,015
It was.

175
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,727
You're good at everything!

176
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,895
Well…

177
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,731
Anyway, don't be intimidated.

178
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,818
You didn't lose today
because you're bad at playing pool.

179
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,529
It's because Dae-sung's too good at it.

180
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,156
He's an all-round sportsman.

181
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,200
I bet there's no sport he's bad at.

182
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:37,204
So if you played against someone else,
you might have won.

183
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,228
Hey! Take it outside.

184
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,147
Get out of here.

185
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,652
How's the cleaning coming along?

186
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,112
Good. Why?

187
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,992
You must've cleaned really hard.

188
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,494
What's this on your face? Let me see.

189
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,830
- Sol-i.
- Yes?

190
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,832
Ms. Moon wants to see you.

191
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,292
What? Me?

192
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,297
Why would she?
I don't think I caused any trouble.

193
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,883
I didn't doze off in class

194
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,761
and I did all my homework.
What could it be?

195
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,638
- Hurry up and go.
- Right.

196
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,193
Heon,

197
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,279
I didn't know you could lie.

198
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,667
Hello.

199
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,005
Ms. Moon, why did you want to see me?

200
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,551
- I wanted to see you?
- Sorry?

201
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,887
That's what Heon said.

202
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,014
Did I?

203
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,728
I'm in the middle of a consultation,
so I'll talk to you later.

204
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,271
Sure.

205
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,901
So how's Dae-sung?

206
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,905
His old shoulder injury
hasn't been getting better.

207
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,992
If he doesn't take precautions,
his career will be in danger.

208
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,370
He might

209
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,997
have to give up swimming.

210
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,877
You must be devastated.

211
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,101
I haven't had junk food for ages.

212
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,520
Now that I'm eating this,

213
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,648
I feel like crying.

214
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,820
Dae-sung,

215
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,573
do your shoulders

216
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,616
hurt a lot?

217
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,993
What?

218
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,744
Will you have to quit swimming?

219
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,999
No, Brother. I'm Marine Boy Woo Dae-sung.

220
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,793
It will be as good as new
when I get treated. Don't worry.

221
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,213
Are you sure you're okay?

222
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,631
Of course.

223
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,011
Maybe I'll take up studying
in the meantime.

224
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,638
Hey, it's not for everyone, you know.

225
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,016
You're the coolest when you're swimming.

226
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,728
No, I'm not I'm good at everything.

227
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,106
I bet you didn't know
that sports require intelligence too.

228
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,651
What? I don't think
I've ever heard of that before.

229
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,362
Anyway, starting tomorrow,
we'll study together.

230
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,657
Got it.

231
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,376
Heon!

232
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,172
Are you taking out the trash again?

233
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,799
Geon wanted to eat this.

234
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,346
Where have you been?

235
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,765
I grabbed a bite to eat with Dae-sung.

236
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,141
- Just the two of you?
- Yes.

237
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,519
Dae-sung and I decided that
we'll study really hard.

238
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,313
That's out of the blue. Why?

239
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,731
Why?

240
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,943
I have my reasons.

241
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,489
By the way, why are you asking
so many questions today?

242
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,991
Am I?

243
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,912
Never mind.
Heon, good luck on the interview tomorrow.

244
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,415
I'm sure you'll be accepted
to the university you want to attend.

245
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,297
I might

246
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,174
not be accepted.

247
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,784
Ninety degrees, forty-five degrees.

248
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,516
What do you like to do?

249
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,478
Do you know how much time
Sol-i spent whining here?

250
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,480
- What about you?
- I won't go there.

251
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,898
I want to be by Sol-i's side.

252
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,567
Sol-i.

253
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,902
I like you a lot.

254
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,195
You guys are brave.

255
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,407
Heon, I'm going to start over.

256
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,491
Grandma disappeared?

257
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,035
Grandma!

258
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,288
When will my Dae-sung get here?

259
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,751
What are you doing?

260
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,463
Will you believe me if I say
I was only trying to wipe the sweat?

261
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,756
off your face?

262
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,844
