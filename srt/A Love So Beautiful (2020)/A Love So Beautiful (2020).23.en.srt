When did you get here?

00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,711
About an hour ago.

12
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,593
I'm sleepy.

13
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,096
Go back to sleep.

00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,846
Hi, there. What's your name?

23
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,723
Seo Ji-su.

24
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,975
TO SEO

00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,354
- Sorry?
- It's Seo Ji-su.

26
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,609
It's you, right? The hospital.

27
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,236
Hi.

28
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,696
It's good to see you.

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
Me too. Thank you.

30
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,912
You look different
without your doctor's gown.

31
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,206
Thank you.

00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,720
Okay!

00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,305
Thank you.

44
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,977
Heon, I'm here. When will you be here?

45
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,562
Can you wait there for a second?

46
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,188
Sure.

47
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,487
- Here.
- Here.

48
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,493
Thanks.

49
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,040

- Let's go over there.

50
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,383
Thanks.

51
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,014
Heon.

52
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,099
What's all this?

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,101
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

54
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,979
Are you asking me to marry you?

55
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,190
Yes.

56
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,329
Ta-da.

57
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,796
Sol-i.

58
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,842
My life has no meaning without you

59
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,596
because I'm nothing without you.

60
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,681
So…

61
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,018
let me be by your side forever.

62
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,524
That's cheesy!

63
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,901
Are those song lyrics?

64
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,822
No.

65
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,323
What is it?

66
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,408
Did Jin-hwan coach you?

67
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,579
No.

68
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,801
Will you marry me?

69
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,024
Sure.

70
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,864
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

71
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,533
Thank you. Thank you so much.

72
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,786
- I wish you happiness.
- Thanks.

73
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,080
- Be happy.
- Congratulations!

74
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,040
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

75
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,253
Congratulations!

76
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,259
Congratulations!

77
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,055
Thanks, Heon.

78
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,019
- Congratulations.
- Be happy!

79
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,938
- Congratulations!
- I envy you!

80
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,776
Heon, look at this. Isn't it stunning?

81
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,904
I bought that ring for you.

82
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,282
That's why it's more beautiful.

83
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,160
It's sparkling. So pretty.

84
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,832
Heon.

85
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,251
Let me pinch my cheek.

86
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,713
That really hurts.

87
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,179
Sol-i, you're not a puppy.

88
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,097
Sorry.

89
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,395
Heon, wait for me. I won't bite you again!

90
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,566
Heon, get back here.

91
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,360
Don't.

92
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,820
Give me a hug.

93
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,000
Go home now.

94
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,712
Tomorrow's my day off.

95
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,765
- What are you doing?
- Taking a nap.

96
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,457
MOM

97
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,756
- Mom?
- Shin Sol-i!

98
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,425
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

99
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,261
Mom, I must have fallen asleep.

100
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,304
What's the matter?

101
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,682
Do you remember Jin-su whom I mentioned?

102
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,437
- Who?
- My friend's son. Sun-nam's son.

103
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:09,108
- I turned down that blind date, Mom.
- Don't be shy.

104
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,693
I got a look at him.

105
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,530
He's really tall and quite handsome.

106
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,200
Also, he's a general manager
at a big company.

107
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,162
Sun-nam and I checked your compatibility

108
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,206
and you guys are a match made in heaven.

109
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,335
Why did you check that already?
I said I'm not interested!

110
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,797
Hi, Ms. Lee. This is Cha Heon.

111
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,633
What? Heon?

112
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,384
Yes, Sol-i and I got back together.

113
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,847
I'll pay a visit soon
and greet you properly.

114
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,062
Here. She has something to say.

115
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,487
Yes, Mom.

116
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,824
Hey, Sol-i! You just said you were asleep.

117
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,453
Mom, I think
my phone's running out of battery.

118
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,997
I can't hear you. Can you hear me?

119
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,499
I can't hear you.

120
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,798
You should go home now.

121
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,780
What's that sound?

122
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,408
Upstairs.

123
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,035
A newlywed couple moved in recently.

124
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,788
Got it. Good night.

125
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,708
Heon.

126
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,586
I can't sleep.

127
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,095
Close your eyes.

128
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,639
I'll be here with you
until you fall asleep.

129
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,754
Heon.

130
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,550
I was touched by your proposal today.

131
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,223
I guess you really like me, though,

132
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,683
seeing that you proposed to me.

133
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,736
Sol-i.

134
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,488
Yes?

135
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,700
Why do you always forget that I love you?

136
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,001
I love you.

137
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,755
I love you too.

138
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,323
Wake up. Have some breakfast.

139
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,453
I want to sleep some more. I'm tired.

140
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,540
You slept enough.

141
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,585
I was exhausted last night.

142
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,221
- Heon.
- Yes?

143
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,432
You're blushing.

144
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,602
You too.

145
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,524
Last night, you…

146
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,474
Hold on.

147
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,434
Is that the delivery man?

148
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,440
Sol-i, it's me. Open the door!

149
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,400
Hey! Open the door!

150
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,152
- I'm doomed. Darn it.
- It's your dad.

151
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,738
- What's going on?
- Goodness.

152
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,865
- What is she up to?
- Heon, hide!

153
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,285
- Sol-i!
- Hey, Sol-i.

154
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,965
Sol-i, I never thought

155
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,718
you'd be home with Heon today as well.

156
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,222
Oh, he left after the call last night,

157
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,433
but he came back this morning.

158
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,770
Oh, is that so?

159
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,854
Yes.

160
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,820
I hear you and Sol-i are back together.

161
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,905
Yes, sir.

162
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,784
Do you drink?

163
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,744
Let me pour you a glass.

164
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,789
- Sure.
- Thank you, Mr. Shin.

165
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,874
- You're welcome--
- Honey!

166
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,087
- Let me pour you a glass too.
- Sure.

167
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,465
Thanks.

168
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,135
All right. Let's drink.

169
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,144
- Father.
- Yes?

170
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,772
- Please marry me.
- All right.

171
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,108
When should we have the wedding?

172
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,445
What are you talking about?
Come back to your senses, both of you!

173
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
You'll marry each other?

174
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,617
Instead of saying,
"Father, please marry me,"

175
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,953
you should say
"I'd like to marry your daughter."

176
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,248
Honey, are you all right?

177
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,001
Honey, I'm not drunk.

178
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,628
Sol-i, I'm perfectly fine.

179
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,256
All you can manage
is half a bottle of soju.

180
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,383
Why would you test how much he can drink?

181
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,510
Heon, you had enough too.

182
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,554
Heon, are you all right?

183
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,473
Of course.

184
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,932
- Honey.
- Yes?

185
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,477
Sol-i, I should take your dad home.

186
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,103
- I…
- Take care of Heon, okay?

187
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,106
- Come on.
- I'll stand up on my own.

188
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,483
- Seriously?
- Gosh.

189
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,903
Heon, I love you.

190
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,905
- What? "I love you"?
- I love you too.

191
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:53,864
Sure.

192
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,213
EDITOR

193
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,177
Ms. Shin, a date's been set
for your autograph event.

194
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,267
Guys, I'm holding an autograph event!

195
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,522
- Oh! Brother, that's great!
- I knew you'd make it.

196
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,066
- Congratulations, Sol-i.
- I'm proud of you, my friend.

197
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,234
Congratulations, Sol-i.

198
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,070
Gwanghwamun Kyopung Book Centre,
next week at 3 p.m.

199
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,279
Will you guys be there?

200
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,116
Darn it! I'll be training
rookie pop band trainees all day.

201
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,494
I have a car commercial
lined up at the crack of dawn.

202
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,123
I'm afraid I have a meeting
with my professor that day.

203
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,293
Sorry. I have a seminar
out of town that day.

204
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,090
Does that mean none of you can come?

205
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,429
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

206
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,430
Thanks.

207
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,599
AUTHOR SHIN SOL-I'S AUTOGRAPH EVENT

208
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,437
A LOVE SO BEAUTIFUL

209
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,814
I'm a huge fan.

210
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,991
Guys!

211
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,994
Hey, Sol-i.
I think we're the only ones here.

212
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,329
No. Others already came by and left.

213
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,832
Jin-hwan, can you please stop teasing her?

214
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,626
Incredible, Brother. I'm so proud of you.

215
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,214
- I'd like an autograph.
- Sure.

216
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,926
- What's your name?
- It's Cha Heon.

217
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,803
What a pretty name.

218
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,641
A LOVE SO BEAUTIFUL, BY SHIN SOL-I
CHA HEON

219
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,216
Your hands.

220
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,841
Hi, Sol-i.

221
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,010
It's me, Heon.

222
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:07,099
So when did I start to like you?

223
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,605
Heon, what are you up to?

224
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,651
Nothing.

225
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,321
- Let's go.
- What? Already?

226
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,885
