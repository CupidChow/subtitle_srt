1
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,594
Sol-i. You're a total loser.

2
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,731
Sol-i, I made naengchae jokbal,
your favorite.

3
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,319
She's been in her room all weekend.
She won't come out.

4
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,489
What's wrong with her?
Was she dumped by the boy she likes?

5
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,908
Sol-i got dumped?

6
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,201
Who would dare--

7
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,703
I don't know if she actually was.

8
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,915
She'll hear. Don't make a fuss and go.

9
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,731
Shin Sol-i.

10
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,026
Why are you so late?

11
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,612
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:20,158
You wrote a love letter
on the answer sheet,

13
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,828
and you ruined the theater festival.

14
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,540
Do your parents know
how you've been behaving at school?

15
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,085
Hello.

16
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,172
Your student, Shin Sol-i,
is such a troublemaker.

17
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,842
Ms. Moon, shouldn't you supervise
your students better?

18
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,928
I'm sorry, Mr. Cho.

19
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,055
I'll warn her.

20
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,849
Sol-i, go on in.

21
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,564
Behave yourself.

22
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,954
Sol-i, Sol-i, Shin Sol-i!

23
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,082
How did it feel
to ask someone out in public?

24
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:13,503
Oh, Shin Juliet,
who's the Romeo you're madly in love with?

25
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,130
Can't you please tell me who it is?

26
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,300
Se-hyeong. That's enough.

27
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:24,180
Come on. Why don't you
just ask him out in public?

28
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,682
Ask him out.

29
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,272
Who are you? Let go of me.

30
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,233
Se-hyeong, if you're that bored,
want to hang out with me?

31
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,610
Let me go, Dae-sung. Let go.

32
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,196
- What?
- I can't breathe. Let me go.

33
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,073
Sorry, Sol-i.

34
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,659
I'm sorry, Sol-i.

35
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,254
If anyone makes fun of you again, tell me.

36
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,299
Okay, thanks.

37
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,343
I have to go to practice. See you.

38
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,100
Is Dae-sung your bodyguard?

39
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,352
I'd transfer to another school
if I were you.

40
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,478
I'd be too embarrassed.

41
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,731
It's embarrassing that you're in my class.

42
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,441
How could you say that to a friend?

43
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,777
Ha-young, what did you just say?
I'm an embarrassment?

44
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,738
That's right. It's so embarrassing.

45
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,367
Go back to your seat
while I'm asking nicely.

46
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,411
Whatever.

47
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,334
Are you okay?

48
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,211
Yes, I'm okay.

49
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,088
Thanks for worrying about me.

50
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,549
Excuse me for a minute.

51
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,511
Sol-i. Class will start soon.
Where are you going?

52
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,077
Sol-i. Sit here.

53
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,796
Come on. Let's study together.

54
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,593
Okay.

55
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,670
You calculated this wrong.

56
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,631
Don't mind me.
I can just refer to the answer sheet.

57
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,897
Sol-i. Eat this and cheer up.

58
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,025
Thank you.

59
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,613
By the way, Sol-i, are you sure
you don't have a crush on anyone?

60
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,909
No, I'm not interested in anyone.

61
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,662
I see. I'm sorry.

62
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,164
I'll study in the classroom.

63
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,838
I think she's telling the truth.
Isn't she?

64
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,786
Heon!

65
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,163
I missed you.

66
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,414
You're home.

67
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,875
What happened?

68
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,919
Geon wanted to surprise you.

69
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,171
Goodness, my son.

70
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,674
You've gotten more handsome and taller.

71
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,971
Here. It's for you.

72
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,515
Mom and I bought MUFC merch for you.

73
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,197
Eat up, Heon.

74
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,454
You, too.

75
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,333
LITERATURE

76
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,635
Geon, brush your teeth and go to bed.

77
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,679
I want to stay up a little more.

78
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,140
No, it's late. Hurry up.

79
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,559
Just a little more, please.

80
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,852
Come on.

81
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,896
Let me just finish this.

82
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,997
WRITE MESSAGE
SHIN SOL-I

83
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,081
Are you asleep?

84
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,963
What are you doing?

85
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,259
Shin Sol-i.

86
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,644
2006 CSAT
JUNE MOCK EXAM REPORT CARD

87
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,069
Sol-i.

88
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,113
We need to have a talk.

89
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,707
Ms. Moon called this afternoon.

90
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,878
- Why?
- Well, she said

91
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,924
you haven't been able to focus
on your studies these days.

92
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,635
She asked if everything was all right.

93
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,262
We were wondering the same thing.

94
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,396
Mom.

95
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,190
Dad.

96
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,900
- What?
- Yes?

97
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,069
Should I

98
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,405
transfer schools?

99
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,534
What do you mean?

100
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,869
Is someone bullying you?

101
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,579
Why transfer all of a sudden?

102
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,623
Well, it's just…

103
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,836
Everyone at Yuil High School
is so academic.

104
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,091
Lately, I've been thinking
I'm not qualified to study here.

105
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,818
Hey, hop on.

106
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,240
You aren't sick, are you?

107
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,910
No, I'm not.

108
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,038
Then why are you feeling so low?

109
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,291
Do you want to grab a bite after school?

110
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,459
Or a karaoke?

111
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,711
No.

112
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,548
By the way, Dae-sung,

113
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,092
how would you feel
if I transferred schools?

114
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,182
What? You're transferring? To where?

115
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,767
- Do they accept swimming students?
- No.

116
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,645
I was just kidding.

117
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,355
Let's go.

118
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,650
That really surprised me.

119
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,862
Hold tight.

120
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,946
Okay.

121
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,253
BYE, TAKE CARE

122
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,851
WOO DAE-SUNG

123
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,606
Yes, Dae-sung.

124
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,734
Why?

125
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,278
Okay.

126
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,545
Ta-da!

127
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,132
What's all this?

128
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,137
Get on this float.

129
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,767
Just trust me and hop on.
You'll feel better.

130
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,783
Isn't it fun?

131
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,037
I'll go faster.

132
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,415
That's freezing!

133
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,584
Take this.

134
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,011
Behind you.

135
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,515
Isn't it fun?

136
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,686
It's so fun, isn't it?

137
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,064
Stop. Hey.

138
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,609
I can't see.

139
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,944
I can't see.

140
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,821
What are you doing? Get out!

141
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,858
How is Sol-i?

142
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,526
She was so cute when she was little.

143
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,903
She's still cute, isn't she?

144
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,405
I'm really worried about Sol-i these days.

145
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,284
Unlike Heon,
she has no interest in studying at all.

146
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,244
And she'll be a senior soon.

147
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,206
I don't know if she'll be able to
go to any university in Seoul.

148
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,001
She must be worried, too.
She asked if she could transfer schools.

149
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,253
- Transfer?
- Yes.

150
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,341
She never said so,
but she must have been frustrated.

151
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,760
My husband and I
looked into several schools.

152
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,012
We found a nice boarding school.

153
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,014
We're thinking of sending her there.

154
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,058
What do you think?

155

SHIN SOL-I

156
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,609
Are you really going to transfer?

157
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,337
You're getting lazy
after winning a few gold medals.

158
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,340
Who is she?

159
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,634
Answer me!

00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,519
Do 500 more push-ups.

161

Hey, Sol-i.

162
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
Ms. Moon wants to see you
in the staff room.

163
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,850
I wonder why.

164
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,478
- What do you think it's for?
- I'm not sure.

165
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,271
I think Sol-i's parents are here.

166
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,316
- Let's go to the snack bar.
- Okay.

168
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,831
might transfer schools.

169
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,209
- What?
- What?

170
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,512
We haven't decided yet.

171
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,681
We'd like to hear your opinion first.

172
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,893
In my experience,

173
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,355
the first-year scores don't
necessarily affect CSAT results.

174
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,024
Some students improve later. Besides,

175
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,236
Sol-i made many good friends here.

176
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,155
If she transfers schools abruptly,

177
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,034
I'm worried she might
have a hard time adjusting.

178
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,870
Sol-i.

179
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,670
Sol-i, what do you think?

180
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,215
Do you really want to transfer?

181
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,177
Well…

182
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,555
I…

183
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,973
Say no.

184
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,309
Well…

185
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,645
I…

186
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,449
I'm here to pick up
the literature performance assessment.

187
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,243
Oh, right.

188
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,665
I think it's too heavy
for one person to carry, though.

189
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,376
Shin Sol-i.

190
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,295
Help him out.

191
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,881
- Pardon?
- Help him.

192
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,418
Shin Sol-i.

193
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,880
Don't go.

194
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:50,207
A FEW DAYS LATER

195
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,255
Heon, you waited for me!

196
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,507
- Who said that?
- Come on.

197
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,425
Why don't you tell me honestly?

198
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,136
Why did you tell me not to go that day?

199
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,722
You really didn't want me
to transfer schools, did you?

200
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,227
Shin Sol-i,
don't you have any self-respect?

201
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,396
No, I gave it all to you.

202
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,017
Heon, I'm going to give up on liking you.

203
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,145
- A neighborhood dog licked it.
- There's a dog in our neighborhood?

204
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,396
- Is it cute?
- Yes, it is.

205
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,314
I'll be making my debut.

206
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,277
Making you my lady

207
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,070
Why don't we spend the night here?

208
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,739
Let's find a place to sleep first.

209
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,408
- This is awesome!
- Awesome!

210
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,952
A shooting star! Guys, make a wish!

211
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,662
Heon, did you not make a wish?

212
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,080
What did you wish for?

213
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,248
For you to like me.

214
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,500
Truth or dare at this hour?

215
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,503
You must keep these secrets.
Don't tell anyone.

216
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,297
Heon, what should I do?

217
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:27,846
