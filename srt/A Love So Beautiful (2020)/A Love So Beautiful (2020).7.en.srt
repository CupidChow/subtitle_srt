00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,581
MARCH 2007, SPRING OF EIGHTEEN

2
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,665
Come on.

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:42,792
Hey, guys.

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,086
- Se-hyeong, why are you here?
- Are you in this class too?

5
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,005
Are you guys stalking me?

6
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,549
Am I still in class 1-7 or what?

7
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,259
I'm sick of it.

8
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,304
I'm more shocked
that you're in the natural sciences class.

9
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,681
Don't you suck at math?

10
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,768
Su-jin, don't be mean.
We're all friends here.

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,986
No, you can't sit here. The seat's taken.

12
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,738
By whom? You?

13
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,408
No, not me, but--

14
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,118
Then step aside.

15
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,828
This seat gets a lot of sunlight.

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,331
It'll make me look super handsome.

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,875
The sun has nothing to do with it.

18
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,086
It's because Heon, who sat here, is hot.

19
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,880
Your dull face doesn't stand a chance.

20
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,340
"Dull"?

21
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,258
Hey, Heon!

22
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,727
Good morning.

23
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,606
That hurt, Ha-young.

24
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,485
Oh, Sol-i. My loyal friend saved my seat.

25
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,695
Guys, the bell just rang. Let's sit down.

26
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,990
Why is she still acting
like the class leader?

27
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,576
I know. Why did we have
to be in the same class again?

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,662
- Hi, guys!
- Hi, Dae-sung.

29
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,247
- Gosh.
- Hi.

30
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,088
Greetings, everyone!

31
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,218
It turns out that I'll be
your homeroom teacher.

32
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,889
But majoring in natural sciences
doesn't mean you can neglect Korean.

33
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,224
- Got it!
- Got it!

34
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's try our best this year!

35
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,527
CARL SAGAN

36
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,500
You must love flowers.

37
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,210
It's about the universe.

38
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,090
How can a book title be so pretty
like you, Ha-young?

39
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,967
You're distracting me. Go away.

40
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,678
No, this is distracting you
from seeing me,

41
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,388
so take this away.

42
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,348
Hey.

43
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,475
- Give it back!
- I won't.

44
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,561
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

45
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,438
Hello, Mr. Lee.

46
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,482
Hey, Ha-young. Is your leg okay?

47
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,318
Yes, of course!

48
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,570
Be careful, and don't run too much.

49
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,280
I won't.

50
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,455
Ha-young, are you done?

51
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,540
Then, I'll get going again.

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,626
Catch me if you can!

53
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,878
What is that idiot saying?

54
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,047
Hey.

55
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,343
Don't run.

56
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,597
She's charismatic as hell.

57
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,432
Ha-young!

58
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,440
Ta-da!

59
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,068
Mr. Song Hae's show! "Korea…"

60
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,527
- "Sings!"
- "Sings!"

61
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,495
Wait. Are you going to apply?

62
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,622
Yes, it's this Saturday.
Come with me, guys.

63
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,165
I'll give you the chance to support me.

64
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,833
Count me out. It's too far away.

65
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,460
But Ha-young…

66
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,213
The show hasn't come
to Gyeonggi Province in a while.

67
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,298
Besides, Osan isn't that far away.

68
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,259
It only takes an hour by bus.

69
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,177
Really? It's that close?

70
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,598
Yes, although we'll have to transfer
three times.

71
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,102
I'll showcase my hidden talent
and become a superstar.

72
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,562
Agencies will be after me
to make me their trainee.

73
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,731
Jin-hwan, you have a big dream.

74
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,359
That's good. The bigger, the better.

75
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,696
Your comment is irrelevant.
You're a swimmer.

76
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,407
You guys will come with me, right?

77
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,328
Count me in. It will be fun.

78
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:48,955
Shin!

79
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,417
Did you even pass the preliminary round?

80
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,460
No.

81
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,555
- When is it?
- This Saturday.

82
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,140
- Saturday?
- Okay…

83
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,101
- Seriously?
- Can you please put that down?

84
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,728
You always wield it as a weapon.

85
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,396
Mom, this Saturday--

86
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,190
You, get the money back tomorrow.

87
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,234
If you don't, you're dead meat!

88
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,947
The thing is, Ji-sun left for Macau
on a business trip today--

89
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,074
Wait, the Gye Ji-sun I know of?

90
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,910
Hey, Shin Gi-heon! You…

91
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,791
What the hell?

92
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,627
Did you just throw jokbal
into my handsome face?

93
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,921
I don't want to talk to you, so leave.

94
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,298
Get out right now!

95
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,967
Why must I be ashamed
of lending someone my money?

96
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,553
How is that yours?
I gave you that pocket money.

97
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,221
I can no longer

98
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,349
live like this anymore!

99
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,644
Dad?

100
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,025
Fine, I can't stand it, either!

101
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,487
Mom?

102
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,078
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood
to hear you singing.

103
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,164
I need all of you here to stay motivated,
so sit tight.

104
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,340
Hello?

105
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:26,302
Yes, this is number 178, Jeong Jin-hwan!

106
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,722
Should I start singing? Yes, sir!

107
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,153
Excuse me. Start from the refrain.

108
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,531
The refrain? Got it, sir.

109
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,533
I'll start over then.

110
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,704
It's love, it's love

111
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,291
Even if I erase it, it's still love

112
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,129
I try to let go of you

113
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,590
But you're the only one living in my heart

114
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,302
Only you, only you

115
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,056
You're the one I yearn and long for

116
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,893
I take out a photo of you

117
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,898
And gaze at it as I fall asleep

118
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,484
You made the first cut.

119
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,492
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Have a good day.

120
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,164
Yes. I made it!

121
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,084
Guys! I'll be making my debut.

122
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,171
Do you have to go to Osan
for the second round, though?

123
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,213
Of course.

124
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,925
Ha-young, I'll promise
to say your name out loud on TV.

125
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,052
You'll all come with me, right?

126
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,931
Well, I can't say for sure.

127
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,809
If my Brother can't say for sure,

128
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,811
then neither can I.

129
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,273
Come on, Sol-i.
You have to come over. What's wrong?

130
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,528
I'm home.

131
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,124
I'm going to another city.

132
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,543
Don't wait up for me, and go to bed.

133
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:44,982
What's up?

134
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,569
Heon.

135
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,035
What's wrong?

136
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,830
Heon, what should I do?

137
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,792
My parents had an argument,

138
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,670
and my dad hasn't been home for two days.

139
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,466
I tried calling him, but his phone's off.

140
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,928
And my mom isn't home today, either.

141
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,475
What if my parents get a divorce?

142
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,686
What do I do?

143
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,776
Hey.

144
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,828
Okay.

145
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,138
That sleeve turned wet.

146
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,493
I'm sure it's nothing serious.
Don't worry.

147
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,121
WRITE MESSAGE
SHIN SOL-I

148
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,873
SEND

149
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,958
SEND TEXT MESSAGE?
1. YES, 2. NO

150
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,215
Heon!

151
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,383
SEND MESSAGE

152
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,179
Mom told me to collect laundry.

153
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,100
Over there. Take them.

154
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,487
By the way, why are the sleeves wet?

155
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,325
A neighborhood dog licked it.

156
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,202
There's a dog in our neighborhood?

157
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,871
I don't think I've seen one. Is it cute?

158
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,710
Yes, it is. But…

159
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,755
it's a little loud.

160
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,758
Take me with you
when you see it next time.

161
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,636
Sure.

162
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,309
Sol-i! Sol?

163
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,020
Sol-i.

164
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,606
Dad!

165
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,568
Where have you been?
I was worried about you!

166
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,153
Wait, is this a dream?

167
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,823
It's not.

168
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,533
You should get up if it is a dream.

169
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,410
Mom!

170
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,744
Did you go with Dad?

171
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,248
Yes, we went to Pohang
to look into a store to branch out.

172
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:52,169
So, does this mean the two of you made up?

173
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,506
Why would we even need to make up?

174
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,801
Look. No husband and wife
love each other as much as we do.

175
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,928
- Honey…
- Stop that.

176
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,888
Go have some king crabs.

177
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,266
I know how much you guys love king crabs.

178
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,309
Hurry up, all right?

179
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,562
King crabs. I love them!

180
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,479
Mom!

181
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,204
KOREA SINGS
OSAN, 2ND PRELIMINARY ROUND

182
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,330
BECOME AN IDOL
HANDSOME JIN-HWAN

183
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,796
Making you my lady

184
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,382
became a dream of mine

185
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:44,638
I will make it happen
No matter the obstacles

186
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,271
My dream used to be

187
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,939
Becoming the President, my dad's favorite

188
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,692
A friend of mine shared that dream…

189
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,111
Thank you for coming. Next.

190
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,448
I have another song prepared.
Please give me another chance.

191
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,827
Please love me

192
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,455
Don't bring tears to my eyes

193
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,253
Damn it.

194
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,714
The judges have no eye for talent.

195
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,925
How can they disqualify a genius like me?

196
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,094
Cheer up. You can try again
when they come to Suwon.

197
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,097
He's right.
Just think of it as our little picnic.

198
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,850
Since we're here,
why don't we spend the night here?

199
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,270
Hey, is it because you want
to spend some time with Heon?

200
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,357
Come on. It will be fun.

201
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,652
Sounds good.
Let's have some fun while we're here.

202
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,738
I can't. My mom will be worried.

203
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,908
Come on, Ha-young.
We rarely get a chance like this.

204
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,576
Then, let's vote on it.

205
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,496
- I'm in.
- Me too.

206
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,789
Me three.

207
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,883
Let's find a place to sleep first.

208
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,096
Shall we go over there?

209
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,808
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

210
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,810
- Have a good night.
- You, too.

211
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,231
Hold on. Shouldn't we call home first?

212
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,775
Right, let's do that.

213
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,321
- Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

214
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,948
I'm spending the night at Sol-i's.

215
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,034
Ha-young offered to tutor me today
at her place.

216
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,786
- Put her on?
- Put her on?

217
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,789
- Hi.
- Hi, Mother.

218
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,249
We won't stay up too late.

219
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,876
We'll study for a few more hours.

220
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,294
Don't worry.

221
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,129
Sure, good night.

222
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,341
- Hey, Mom.
- Mom, it's me. Good night.

223
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,678
Nice!

224
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,096
Hello?

225
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,390
Mom, I'll sleep over
at my friend's place today!

226
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,436
Please.

227
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,854
Just this once.

228
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,823
Hello, ma'am.
I'm Jin-hwan's classmate, Cha Heon.

229
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,618
Right.

230
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,580
Yes, thank you. Sure.

231
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,082
Are we good?

232
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,260
HEAD COACH

233
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,431
- Hello?
- Woo Dae-sung!

234
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,517
Why did you skip training today,
and where are you?

235
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,730
I'm at a friend's house.

236
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,525
What? Then put that friend's father
on the phone!

237
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,111
Take it.

238
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,413
Yes,

239
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,333
I'm Jin-hwan's father.

240
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,001
Who are you trying to fool?

241
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,628
Put your father on!

242
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,298
What the…

243
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,926
Sorry.

244
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,303
Don't answer your phone tonight.
That's better.

245
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,393
Then I'll be dead once I get back.

246
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:20,896
Thanks.

247
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,900
Wow, that's a lot of stars.

248
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,444
I know. They're really pretty.

249
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,781
I've kept my nose
in my textbooks for so long,

250
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,950
I didn't know how pretty the sky is.

251
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,952
Hey, Jin-hwan.

252
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,415
When did you bury your nose in your books?
You always dozed off in class.

253
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,751
Can't you shut it
when I'm trying to be sentimental?

254
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,670
Be quiet, both of you.

255
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,881
Those stars may all look the same,

256
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,093
but some are planets,
while others are satellites.

257
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,596
I wonder if Rosetta and Philae
are up there too.

258
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,558
Rosetta and Philae? What are they?

259
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,812
In 2004, the European Space Agency
launched a space probe named Rosetta

260
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:06,150
along with a robotic lander called Philae.

261
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,153
Guys, are you listening to me?

262
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,120
Anyway, Philae landed safely,

263
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,497
but lost communication with Rosetta.

264
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,626
A shooting star! Guys, make a wish!

265
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,671
A shooting star? Wait, my wish.

266
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,842
Who was I talking to?

267
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,515
Don't you have a wish? Come on.

268
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,350
Meteors are just stone or dust.

269
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,104
They have no power to grant wishes.

270
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,287
Is everything okay with your parents now?

271
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,622
Oh, yes.

272
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,000
Their love for each other
helped them make up quickly.

273
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,835
I see. That's a relief.

274
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,507
By the way, thanks for listening to me.

275
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,053
Wait, Heon, did you not make a wish?

276
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,933
I didn't. What did you wish for?

277
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:21,934
Me?

278
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
I wished…

279
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,731
for you to like me.

280
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,568
But I took it back.

281
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,698
- Why?
- What do you mean, "Why?"

282
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,325
It's too heartbreaking

283
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:44,164
My love for someone is growing
when he doesn't love me back.

284
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,127
So I'd rather not wish
for any reciprocation.

285
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,295
That way, I can keep crushing on you.

286
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,006
Anyway, Heon,

287
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,386
someday in the future,
if I ever get angry with you

288
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,639
and say, "Heon, I'm going to give up
on liking you."

289
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,641
Even if I say something like that,

290
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,269
don't say anything back.

291
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,270
What?

292
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,565
Because I won't mean it. All right?

293
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,785
What? The Game of Truth at this hour?

294
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,746
Come on, it'll be fun. Write yours down.

295
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,288
I want Rosetta and Philae  to be happy.

296
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,500
I like the girl
with the longest hair here.

297
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,587
I LIKE SHIN SOL-I

298
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,141
You must keep these secrets.
Don't tell anyone.

299
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,100
Okay?

300
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,293
What do you think? Isn't it great?

301
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,672
You were right. It's super pretty.

302
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,890
There's no echo.

303
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,312
Let's still go for it. Who's next?

304
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,897
Is it me?

305
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,027
Jeong Jin-hwan is an idiot!

306
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,613
Go on.

307
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:31,873
Guys, come and see me
win the gold medal next week!

308
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,167
Okay, your turn.

309
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,799
I wish Heon would say something!

310
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,394
Go, Park Ji-sung!

311
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,649
That's new. He really spoke up.

312
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,863
Heon, are you sure you're all right?

313
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,707
This is awesome!

314
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,084
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

315
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,211
Awesome!

316
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:22,841
Guys, I like Ha-young the most!

317
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,155
What's the secret you wrote down that day?

318
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,115
You know it's Sol-i's birthday
this Saturday, right?

319
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,201
Sol-i, hi.

320
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,202
Do you have plans tomorrow?

321
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,496
Sol-i, what's tomorrow's lunch menu?

322
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,289
Where are you? I'll be there.

323
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,834
- The secret you wrote down.
- That's supposed to stay secret.

324
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,586
So it's not a lie, is it?

325
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,796
It's all thanks to her.

326
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,715
Dae-sung, are you going public
