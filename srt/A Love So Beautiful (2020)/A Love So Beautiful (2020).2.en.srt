1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,554
You can have this.

2
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,930
You don't want it?

3
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,766
I have to watch my weight.

4
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,476
I see. Okay.

5
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,730
There's an excellent way to burn calories.

6
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,524
- What is it?
- Karaoke.

7
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,027
What do you think?
Let's skip self-study class.

8
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,445
No. I have to study.

9
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,238
I'm busy with practice.

10
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,119
Jeez, look at these poor
Korean high school students.

11
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,955
You didn't go last time
even when I said I'd pay.

12
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,791
How can you do this to your friend?

13
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,044
Let's just go sing for an hour.

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,506
Even if they give us extra minutes,
I won't take them.

15
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,924
Come on, what do you say?

16
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,176
- Will you, Ha-young?
- No.

17
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,971
KARAOKE ROOM

18
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:45,480
Even if you're late every time
I'll understand

19
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:51,528
I won't ask who you're seeing first

20
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:57,200
- I'll wait for you even if we fall out
- I'll wait for you even if we fall out

21
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:01,746
- I'll try to smile even if it hurts
- I'll try to smile even if it hurts

22
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,585
- My heart can bear it when it wants you
- My heart can bear it when it wants you

23
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,171
- I cry every day
- I cry every day

24
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,924
- But I'm happy whenever I see you
- But I'm happy whenever I see you

25
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:18,429
You're lovely from head to toe

26
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:22,392
I'm proud that you're my man

27
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,102
Shin Sol-i!

28
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,563
- I used to be gruff
- I used to be gruff

29
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,065
- Now I smile all the time
- Now I smile all the time

30
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,278
- What have you done to me?
- What have you done to me?

31
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,197
- Promise me one thing
- Promise me one thing

32
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,200
- Until the end of the world
- Until the end of the world

33
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:46,708
- Be lovely only to me
- Be lovely only to me

34
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,419
What's the score? Is it 100?

35
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,420
Is it really 100?

36
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,672
- Yes!
- We did it!

37
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,011
TIME

38
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,721
We have a minute left.

39
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,773
KARAOKE ROOM

40
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,276
- Hello?
- Where are you? What are you doing?

41
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,069
The meet is only a few days away.

42
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,530
Don't worry. I'm going home now.

43
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,494
What is it? Is something wrong?

44
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,330
It's nothing.

45
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,041
This was actually
my first karaoke experience.

46
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,751
Really?

47
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,086
The coach never let me
because of training.

48
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,715
Now you'll ask me to take you
to karaoke all the time.

49
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,762
I have a swim meet this weekend.
Do you want to come?

50
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,679
What?

51
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,392
How much will it cost me?

52
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,519
It's free, of course.

53
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,480
Just come. I'll even buy you dinner.

54
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,024
That's unfair.
Are you only treating Sol-i?

55
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,193
Of course not. You're invited, too.

56
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,361
You should all come.

57
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,988
Okay. We'll go and cheer for you.

58
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,618
By the way, why do I feel chilly
all of a sudden?

59
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,328
What? What do you mean?

60
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,288
It's the dean.

61
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,343
What was the combination?

62
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,554
Why can't I remember it?

63
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,348
My bike is gone.

64
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,354
Oh, no.

65
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,898
Just leave it.

66
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,360
Let's go.

67
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,237
Brother, hop on.

68
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,133
You lost your bike?

69
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,303
I bought you that bike recently.
How many have you lost now?

70
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,013
Come here.

71
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,307
Mom, that's a weapon.

72
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,934
If you aren't careful,
you can kill someone with that.

73
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,603
Don't worry. I'll be careful. Come here!

74
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,771
- Mom.
- Come over here.

75
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,231
Dad, save me.

76
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,984
How did you lose it this time?

77
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,695
I was buying a workbook at a bookstore.

78
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,823
Mom, a lot of other kids
lost their bikes there, too.

79
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,618
She was at a bookstore
buying a workbook for studying.

80
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,288
The father-and-daughter team
always make me the bad guy.

81
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,665
What's the point in working
on new recipes day and night

82
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,542
when you two keep spending all the money?

83
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,878
Come on, we don't spend all of it.

84
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,504
Plus, I help you a lot.

85
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,215
Buy a new bike this weekend.

86
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,718
- Don't whine about taking the bus.
- What?

87
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,512
No.

88
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,477
I should've just let her buy me
a new bike.

89
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,564
Why am I going through this trouble
to ride on the back of Heon's bike?

90
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,233
My legs hurt.

91
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,700
Hey, Brother.
It's tough without a bicycle, isn't it?

92
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,454
I can't complain. I brought it on myself.

93
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,623
I can take you to school
until you get a new bike.

94
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,291
No, it's okay.

95
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,336
I have a question.

96
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,756
What do you want others to do for you
when you're sad?

97
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,299
Well, I don't know.

98
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,885
When I'm sad,

99
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,013
wouldn't it mean the most
to just keep that person company?

100
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,057
Oh, really?

101
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,183
Yes.

102
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,610
I'LL HELP YOU!

103
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,575
Everyone did a great job.

104
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,913
So many of your assignments touched me.

105
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,291
Especially Hui-ji's and Cha Heon's.

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,212
It didn't seem like
they were written by students.

107
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,047
I almost thought you were writers.

108
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,298
Speaking of which,

109
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,510
Sol-i, would you mind reading this?

110
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,472
- Pardon?
- Read it out loud.

111
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,059
Okay.

112
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,230
NAME: CHA HEON

113
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,362
"One day when I was eight,

114
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,198
I got lost in an unfamiliar place.

115
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,743
I felt like crying,

116
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,580
but I held back my tears,
saying I would never cry.

117
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,166
After some time passed,

118
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,002
- my father came to look for me."
- Heon!

119
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,336
Dad!

120
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,214
"I burst into tears and ended up crying."

121
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,842
- "My father simply looked at me."
- It's okay.

122
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,136
- "He gave me a warm hug."
- It's all right.

123
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,973
"Then, my father and I
went to a Chinese restaurant

124
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,143
and ate jajangmyeon, my favorite dish.

125
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,937
My father's hand,

126
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,983
which I held all the way back home,
was very warm.

127
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,869
It was the longest day
I spent with my father,

128
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:19,916
who was always busy with work."

129
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,716
Do you still have jajangmyeon with him?

130
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,853
Heon, my mom will make bulgogi tomorrow,
do you want to come?

131
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,564
No.

132
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,817
Then, can I ride this bike with you?

133
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,904
I'll be quiet and won't bother you.

134
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm super light like a feather.

135
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,324
What do you say?

136
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,203
You can take the bike, then.

137
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,539
Where are you going?

138
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,959
Can't I come with you?

139
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,836
Don't follow me.

140
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,253
All right.

141
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,715
It'll be hard for Heon
to prepare everything on his own.

142
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:55,720
And I don't think it's a bad idea
to be in his mom's good books.

143
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,100
What does it feel like to like someone?

144
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,185
Well…

145
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,523
When he shows up,
everything around him becomes dark,

146
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,984
and he's the only thing that lights up.

147
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,362
Hmm, like the halo effect idols have?

148
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,614
Halo effect.

149
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,719
I didn't order this.

150
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,309
Heon.

151
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,687
I ordered it for you.

152
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,989
25TH PRESIDENTIAL
NATIONAL SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS

153
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,160
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Today is the high school group finals

154
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,246
for the 25th Presidential
National Swimming Championships.

155
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,833
After three days of close competition,
six athletes, including

156
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,629
promising swimmers Woo Dae-sung
and Park Min-woo,

157
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,714
- will compete for medals.
- I'm nervous.

158
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,965
Me, too.

159
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,011
A strong favorite, Woo Dae-sung,
is walking in now.

160
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,474
Woo Dae-sung won a gold medal last year
in the men's 100-meter freestyle.

161
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,101
He's on a roll.

162
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,310
- Woo Dae-sung!
- He's expected…

163
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,562
- Woo Dae-sung, you're hot!
- …to perform well

164
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,855
at today's event.

165
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,107
Woo Dae-sung.

166
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,072
Milky skin, Woo Dae-sung!

167
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,700
Woo Dae-sung! Come in first!

168
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,451
He isn't like plain milk, though.

169
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,830
He's somewhere between banana milk
and chocolate milk.

170
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,956
MILKY SKIN WOO DAE-SANG

171
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,750
- Don't hurt yourself.
- Get whatever medal you can!

172
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,544
Ready.

173
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,547
Set.

174
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,264
Woo Dae-sung!

175
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,356
Chocolate milk skin!

176
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,067
- Woo Dae-sung!
- Woo Dae-sung!

177
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,958
Just a bit faster.

178
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,348
1ST: PARK MIN-WOO
2ND: WOO DAE-SUNG

179
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,730
Woo Dae-sung,

180
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,648
you've always placed first.

181
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,611
How do you feel about missing the gold
and winning the silver medal?

182
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,408
- I'm sorry.
- Dae-sung, good job!

183
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,077
You're the best!

184
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,579
You did awesome!

185
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,168
You're hot!

186
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,718
Second place is still great.

187
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:52,081
Don't you want to be a national athlete?
Why haven't you stayed in shape?

188
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,959
And you said
you're happy with second place?

189
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,890
Heon.

190
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,478
Geon isn't well.
I don't think we can make it to Korea.

191
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,565
Can you hold the memorial service
on your own?

192
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,651
I'll come to Korea next month
no matter what.

193
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,579
Dae-sung, great work.

194
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,289
Jin-hwan and Ha-young left

195
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,333
because they had to go to the academy
and a family dinner.

196
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,836
It's okay. You're here, Brother.

197
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,379
Thanks a lot for coming.

198
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,381
Don't mention it. We're friends.

199
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,134
I'll buy you dinner today.

200
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,052
What do you think about pork belly?

201
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,472
I'm sorry. I'd love to have pork belly,

202
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,765
but I have something to do.

203
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,559
Wait.

204
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,645
HOW IS IT GOING? I'LL BE THERE SOON!

205
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,815
I have to go now.

206
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,943
That's too bad. We can catch up next time.

207
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,862
Let's have pork belly when I place first.

208
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,448
Sorry. I have something
really important to do today.

209
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,492
Second place is super great, too.

210
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,828
I don't know why
people only care about the first place.

211
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,829
Thanks.

212
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,416
Give me that before you go.

213
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,376
This?

214
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,420
It says "Dae-sang", not "Dae-sung".

215
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,963
I'll make it properly next time.

216
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,214
I like Dae-sang better.

217
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,509
If you give me that, I'll give you this.

218
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,055
Gosh! No, thanks. That's too precious.

219
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,105
I'll upgrade that to a gold medal
when I win one.

220
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,315
All right?

221
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,570
I'm fine. Don't worry.

222
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,659
Okay. I'll get going.

223
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,702
- Okay.
- Sorry. See you in school.

224
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,002
MILKY SKIN WOO DAE-SANG

225
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,033
Heon!

226
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,995
You haven't started, right?

227
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,329
What are you doing here?

228
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,331
What?

229
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,626
You prepared everything already?

230
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,753
I bought fruit.

231
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,130
It's okay. Go home.

232
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,592
Well, I didn't know
you'd get it ready so soon.

233
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,720
Your mom and Geon said
they'd come home after seven.

234
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,765
I'm really okay, so just go.

235
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,854
You're so mean.

236
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,023
Can't you just ask for help?

237
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,399
I don't need it.

238
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,338
I understand that Geon is sick,
but Heon is still a kid.

239
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,757
How can she leave him on his own?

240
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,760
Speaking of which,
I know she's busy with work,

241
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,762
but she shouldn't leave him alone
for this long.

242
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,097
She must have her reasons.

243
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,099
I'm just worried.

244
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,851
Wait.

245
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,272
Sol-i, bring this to Heon later.

246
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:50,277
Right. The intelligent Ms. Lee Chan-hui
bought this just for Heon.

247
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,780
Okay. I will.

248
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,706
Excuse me. Heon?

249
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,919
I guess you left the door open
because of the memorial service.

250
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,884
I'm here because my mom
asked me to give this to you.

251
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,348
Also, I'm really sorry
about earlier today.

252
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,602
I didn't know your mom wasn't coming.

253
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,692
Leaving you behind

254
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,613
Around every corner of the mountain

255
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:46,286
Time is telling me to let you go already

256
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:52,668
I've embraced a voice

257
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,963
that resembles yours in my heart

258
00:20:56,046 --> 00:21:02,636
But why couldn't I ask you
to come with me?

259
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,138
Leaving you--

260
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,976
Yes!

261
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,063
Sorry.

262
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,732
I was supposed to press "applause."

263
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,875
Time's up. Let's go.

264
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,855
Heon. Help me.

265
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,273
Why should I?

266
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,357
Hey, Cha Heon.

267
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,152
You kicked Heon? You kicked him hard?

268
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,237
Why are you so down today?

269
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,114
Where's your spirit, Brother?

270
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,533
- Here.
- Don't refuse. Just take them.

271
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,160
Hui-ji made it for you.

272
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,202
Where did it go?

273
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,913
- This is crazy.
- Try to think.

274
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,834
Especially Oh Hui-ji and Lee Su-jin.

275
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,252
What are you doing?

276
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,345
