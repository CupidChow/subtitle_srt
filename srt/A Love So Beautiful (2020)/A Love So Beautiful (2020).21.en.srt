1
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,624
CHA HEON

2
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,428
Hey, Heon, listen carefully.

3
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,139
I don't know why you did that to me
last night.

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,018
But that thing we did, you know?

5
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,103
You made a big mistake.

6
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,149
You can't do that without my permission!

7
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,321
I mean,
we're not even in a relationship anymore!

8
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,994
I guess she fought with her boyfriend.

9
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,041
Why aren't you saying anything?

10
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,210
Ms. Shin.

11
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,420
Sorry? Who is this?

12
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,172
This is Seo Ji-su.

13
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,467
Dr. Cha's phone kept ringing,
so I answered.

14
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,516
You should have told me sooner, then.

15
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,476
You didn't give me a chance to.

16
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,896
Anyway, I'll tell him that you called.

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,483
Okay. Thanks.

18
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,870
Dr. Cha.

19
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,581
Haven't you forgotten something?

20
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,041
You left this behind.

21
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,127
I forgot.

22
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,713
What?

23
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,174
Ms. Shin called a second ago.

24
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,510
What did she say again?

25
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,221
Last night…

26
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,561
Something did happen last night.

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,980
I'll get going.

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,567
Come on. What is it? Tell me.

29
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,118
We'll open the curtains.

30
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,880
How do I look?

31
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,219
I must have saved
my nation in my past life.

32
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,848
Or maybe I saved the universe.

33
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,019
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Ha-young.

34
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,481
Truly incredible. You're really gorgeous.

35
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,360
Let me see. Where are the wings you hid?

36
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,237
You won't fly back to heaven, right?

37
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,282
You look like an angel.

38
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,117
Stop it.

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,494
Angel Ha-young, let me take a photo.

40
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,371
One, two…

41
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,555
I'm been blinded
by the beauty of this angel.

42
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,398
- Is it good?
- It is.

43
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,110
What's this? I picked up lunch for you.

44
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,363
Heon already brought one for me.

45
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,199
- He says it's good.
- Really?

46
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,202
Nice. Since you bought it anyway,
give that to Heon.

47
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,580
Forget it. Why should I?

48
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,750
She's right. Just leave it here.
I can eat more.

49
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,752
It will look like she bought it for me.

50
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,712
Right?

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,093
You already had enough.

52
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,262
This is a hospital, not a buffet.

53
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,889
I didn't eat that much.

54
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,476
- Leave it here.
- Heon said he's on call tonight.

55
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,980
He'll be too busy to grab a bite.
Why not give it to him?

56
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,315
- Hurry up.
- Dad.

57
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,568
Let go.

58
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,529
- But--
- Hands off.

59
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,992
Come on. Hurry up. Run along.

60
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,869
Honey, Sol-i…

61
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,415
You embarrass me. Just finish your lunch.

62
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,333
- I've lost my appetite.
- What?

63
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,763
What are you doing?

64
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,521
What's that?

65
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,066
Nothing.

66
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,360
Is that for me?

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,905
No. That's not it.

68
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:27,327
I was passing by
and got curious about the on-call room.

69
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,704
Come in.

70
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,971
It's a packed meal.
My mom told me to bring it to you.

71
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,184
I'll get going.

72
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,664
Let's share.

73
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,420
It will only take ten minutes.

74
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,824
Are you still angry at me?

75
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,286
I'm not angry.

76
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,460
Sol-i.

77
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,673
Can we make up now?

78
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,766
"Make up"?

79
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,570
We already broke up three years ago.

80
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,946
I never once thought

81
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,616
that we broke up.

82
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,121
I did.

83
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,540
Sol-i.

84
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,510
We're going to make up.

85
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,491
- Be gentle, will you?
- Does that hurt? Sorry.

86
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,245
I'm sorry to give you all this trouble,
Mr. Superstar.

87
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,622
It's okay, Mr. Shin.

88
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,832
I'd do anything to help Sol-i out.

89
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,128
Why would you do anything for her?

90
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,174
That's her way of saying she's grateful.

91
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,098
Are you leaving already?

92
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,059
I thought it was tomorrow.

93
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,353
Hi, Heon. We moved it up a day.

94
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,485
You must be busy.
There's no need to see us off.

95
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,111
It's okay.

96
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,906
Mom, I'll go pay the bill.

97
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,669
YEAR 2019, AUTUMN OF THIRTY

98
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,178
Ha-young, you're stunning.

99
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,014
Kang Ha-young,
congratulations on the wedding.

100
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:17,932
Congratulations.

101
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,643
Thanks, guys. Let's take a photo together.

102
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,686
- Sure.
- Got it.

103
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,773
Jin-hwan!

104
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,651
Stop staring at her and greet your guests.

105
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,781
You.

106
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,659
Go ahead.

107
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,415
Sol-i, doesn't this dress
look better on me?

108
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,959
Yes, it suits you way better.

109
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,711
You look gorgeous.

110
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,464
I'm in deep trouble. What do I do?

111
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,507
What is it?

112
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,219
- What's wrong?
- The wedding rings.

113
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,679
They're gone.

114
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,474
I'm such an idiot! What do I do?
Where did they go?

115
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,101
Is there a hole in my tuxedo?

116
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,562
I don't know where they went.

117
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,730
I mean,

118
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,065
Where else would they be, you idiot?

119
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,986
Don't remind me.
I know I'm the world's biggest idiot!

120
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,491
- You handed them to me earlier.
- What?

121
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,870
That's right!

122
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,877
Okay. Where are they?

123
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,712
Here they are.

124
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,134
The diamond's too big.

125
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,261
It's not mine.

126
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,602
Yours is here.

127
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,564
Yes, these are mine.

128
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,276
Hurry up and go.

129
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,487
Okay, I'll get going.

130
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,404
- Sure.
- Sure.

131
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,366
Hey.

132
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,909
What's with that diamond ring?

133
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,203
- Tell me about it later.
- Just go!

134
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,846
Jin-hwan, congratulations on the wedding.

135
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,556
Mi-nyeo, thank you for coming.

136
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,933
Say hello to Uncle Jin-hwan.

137
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,894
- Hello.
- Hello.

138
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,773
- Motherhood looks great on you.
- Oh, please.

139
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,274
She was always stunning.

140
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,111
- Dad!
- My son!

141
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,115
Wang Se-hyeong, the Super Dad.

142
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,991
Congratulations on welcoming twins.

143
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,619
Come to me for tips
on a successful marriage.

144
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,288
Thanks for being the host.

145
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,873
Boom.

146
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,875
- Shall we go see Ha-young?
- Sure.

147
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,793
Good luck.

148
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,339
Jin-hwan, congratulations on the wedding.

149
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,383
Su-jin! Thank you for coming.

150
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,761
Jin-hwan, congratulations.

151
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,598
Hui-ji! I thought you wouldn't make it
since you were in the States.

152
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,100
Thanks for coming.

153
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,853
- Ha-young's over there.
- See you later.

154
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,896
Jin-hwan.

155
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,108
Look at you.

156
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,655
- Guys, it's been a while.
- Hi, Sol-i.

157
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,616
- See you later.
- Sure.

158
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,245
- How have you been?
- Great.

159
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,790
I heard you'll be getting married
in the States soon.

160
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,084
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

161
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,253
You and Heon should visit sometime.

162
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,841
- Are you catching the bouquet today?
- Yes.

163
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,885
To be honest, I thought it would be you.

164
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,262
Actually…

165
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,016
This reminds me of high school.

166
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,901
What about your family? Do they know?

167
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,696
No.

168
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,916
Please don't tell anyone
I'm suffering from depression.

169
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,572
Heon.

170
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,785
I like you.

171
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,791
I like Sol-i.

172
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,467
I was too young back then,

173
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,803
and I only cared about my feelings.

174
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,182
Heon asked me to give this to one of you.
Whose is this?

175
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,393
But that's Heon's.

176
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,189
Give it to me, sir.
I asked him to lend it to me.

177
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,857
Okay.

178
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,909
Sol-i.

179
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,162
I have something to tell you
about the flu.

180
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:38,168
Flu literally causes symptoms
which are much worse than a cold.

181
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,172
In other words, it's like a severe cold.

182
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,843
Symptoms of the flu are just like a cold.

183
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,013
Usually, you get better
after several days.

184
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,560
I think Heon liked you a lot
even back then.

185
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,451
Next, the bride and groom

186
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,622
will say their vows
to promise they'll be together forever.

187
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,214
Jin-hwan,

188
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,802
you wrote a love letter
to all the girls in our high school.

189
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,264
Actually, not all of them.

190
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,267
I never wrote one for you.

191
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:43,400
Instead, you gifted me the only star
that was named after me.

192
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,445
And you gave me
a cute cell phone accessory.

193
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,864
Actually, it was for someone else.

194
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,378
I, Jeong Jin-hwan,
take Kang Ha-young as my wife

195
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,046
as I say these vows.

196
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,590
"Until I take my last breath,

197
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,218
I will be the universe

198
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,429
that protects the planet
known as Kang Ha-young."

199
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,891
"I, Kang Ha-young, whether happy or sad,

200
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,727
will be your one and only fan

201
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,438
that will always listen to your songs.

202
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,359
The two of us met in this vast universe

203
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,611
by a special chance and became one.

204
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,865
We vow before you
that we will love each other more tomorrow

205
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,909
than we do today.

206
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,329
Groom, Jeong Jin-hwan.

207
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,165
Bride, Kang Ha-young.

208
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,198
Kiss the bride!

209
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,825
- Kiss the bride!
- Kiss the bride!

210
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,452
- Kiss the bride!
- Kiss the bride!

211
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,621
- Kiss the bride!
- Kiss the bride!

212
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,123
- Kiss the bride.
- Kiss the bride.

213
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,666
Kiss the bride!

214
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,335
Ha-young.

215
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,963
I love you.

216
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,271
The bride will now throw the bouquet.

217
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,231
- Throw it as hard as you can.
- Sure.

218
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,660
What?

219
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,224
Don't expect me to help you
like I did back in the day.

220
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,060
- Help me.
- Did you get here on a time machine?

221
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,853
Strike a cute pose.

222
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,605
Shin Sol-i, be my girlfriend.

223
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,275
Not anyone can give you
a huge diamond like this.

224
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,860
- You can't get a hold of Ms. Shin?
- She keeps avoiding me.

225
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,530
If I were her,
I'd be dating someone else already.

226
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,700
She’s not the old Sol-i who used to
sit around and wait for you.

227
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,619
- That was supposed to be a secret.
- What did you just say?

228
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,205
I'll take Sol-i home.

229
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,083
I'm sorry. Will you please forgive me?

230
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:41,049
