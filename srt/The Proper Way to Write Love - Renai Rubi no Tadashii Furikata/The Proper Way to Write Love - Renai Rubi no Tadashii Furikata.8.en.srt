1
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,600
Hey, what the hell is going on?

2
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,360
Why didn't you tell me?

3
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,430
Why don't you get it?

4
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,400
I couldn't stand you.
I absolutely hated you.

5
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,540
You've always made a fool of me.

6
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,210
Do you have any idea what I went through

7
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,250
to become a hairstylist just to prove you all wrong?

8
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,870
Have you ever even considered it?!

9
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,720
And then you just waltz back into my life...

10
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,460
So that's what you thought...

11
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,590
- Then why did you go out with me?
- I figured I'd just mess around with you and dump you.

12
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,770
Revenge. It's revenge.

13
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,820
Look at that. That mark.

14
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,810
I was planning to do it in one month.

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,120
So... that's what that meant...

16
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,850
- I'm leaving.
- What?

17
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,750
Are you going to ruin my plan?

18
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,390
Hey, Natsuo.
Let's do it one last time.

19
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,610
- No!
- Isn't that what you want?

20
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,720
Stop it! Ugh...

21
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,200
Natsuo!

22
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,690
- Ugh...
- Don't move!

23
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,280
Hurry up and take it off!

24
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,690
- No!
- Shut up!

25
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,660
I said shut up! Natsuo...

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,140
- No...
- Take it off!

27
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,160
No...

28
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,440
- Mmm...
- Natsu... Take it off!

29
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,540
Ah, ah... I said no...

30
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,220
Natsuo!

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,920
- Stop it...
- Shut up!

32
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,970
No...

33
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,240
Natsuo!

34
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,270
This is it.

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,530
This is the look I wanted to see.

36
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,850
And yet...

37
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,570
"The Proper Way to Write Love"

38
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,050
(Episode 8: The Way to Write Proper Love)

39
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,790
Everyone, can I have a minute?

40
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,710
We're currently in talks with RaMu
about coming to our salon.

41
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,750
What, RaMu?

42
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,900
That's right. Apparently,

43
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,700
she sent a DM yesterday saying she'd love to get her hair cut here.

44
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,400
Wait, RaMu, as in "the" RaMu?

45
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,860
- The famous influencer.
- Yep.

46
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,360
It seems Haruyo-san's last post
went viral.

47
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,390
- Whoa.
- Wow.

48
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,900
- 100,000 followers?
- I heard she's actually a businesswoman.

49
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,210
No way!

50
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,940
So that's the deal, Hiro. I'm counting on you.

51
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,010
This is a big chance for both you
and the salon.

52
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,850
- Yes, I understand.
- Good.

53
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,890
Yes.
Yes.

54
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,330
- Yes.
- Yes.

55
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,880
Let's do this!

56
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,150
- Good luck.
- I'm looking forward to it.

57
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,100
- Oh? Drinking a bit too much?
- Yeah.

58
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,740
- Had a gathering yesterday.
- I see.

59
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,540
But enough about me.

60
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,180
- Hmm?
- What's up with you?

61
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,510
- Huh?
- You're actually working seriously.

62
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,590
What's that supposed to mean? I'm always serious.

63
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,110
Right...

64
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,970
But, boss...

65
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,870
Have you ever hurt someone without realizing it?

66
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,760
- Huh?
- Well...

67
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,760
I've always been the one who gets dumped.

68
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,300
I've never even lasted a month with anyone.

69
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,730
Well, that's... kind of bad.

70
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,070
Really bad.

71
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,920
I always get made fun of
and then dumped. It's the same cycle...

72
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,190
I see.

73
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,500
But this time, it feels different somehow...

74
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,390
I bet it does.

75
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,220
Huh?

76
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,020
It's the first time I've ever seen it.

77
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,690
You, worrying about someone else like this.

78
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,030
So of course you're going to struggle.

79
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,430
It's the first time you've ever tried
to grow a relationship with someone.

80
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,610
- Ugh.
- That's a good sign, isn't it?

81
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,010
Grow...

82
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,210
Ahh...

83
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,920
Nope, I'm full...

84
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,580
- Huh? Hey, wait...
- Here you go.

85
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,790
- I can't eat that much either.
- It's fine.

86
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,480
- When you're worried, you just gotta eat.
- Seriously...

87
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,020
- Isn't this way too much macaroni salad?
- I said it's fine.

88
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,220
My wife made it, so it's delicious.

89
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,010
Huh?

90
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,040
- Mmm.
- Mmm?

91
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,710
It's good.

92
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,910
- Right?
- Yeah.

93
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,120
No way.
Does a guy this handsome really exist?

94
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,290
I'm Hiro, your stylist. It's a pleasure to meet you.

95
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,340
- I'm RaMu. Nice to meet you too.
- Right this way, please.

96
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,110
Look at the wall! It's so textured!

97
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,200
- That's our signature touch.
- Wow. A textured signature touch?

98
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,870
So, what are we doing today?

99
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,310
Today, um, let's see...

100
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,530
Do whatever you think looks best.

101
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,470
Let me see... Hmm.

102
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,130
Got it. You can count on me.

103
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,060
I'm counting on you.

104
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,420
Alright.

105
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,290
Hey!
Here we go.

106
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,110
Hey!

107
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,460
Break time.

108
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,220
Yeah.

109
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Alright.

110
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,720
Ugh...

111
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,140
Ah...

112
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,240
- Boss.
- Yeah?

113
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,610
Still hurts?

114
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,640
Yeah, a little...

115
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,630
You alright?

116
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,200
Ugh...

117
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,480
I hope this does the trick...

118
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,290
Oh, yeah. What time is it?

119
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,820
Don't you think they did a great job with the cut? Look.

120
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,830
So cute!

121
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,030
(Breaking News: Pedestrian struck by car in Tokyo.
The accident occurred near a construction site.)

122
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,770
Huh?

123
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,000
Hmm? Shiina...?

124
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,370
- Hiro-kun, one second...
- What?

125
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,010
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

126
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,150
This phone...

127
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,920
This has to be Natsuo's, right?

128
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,530
Apparently, he got hit by a car...

129
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,220
I'm going to go look for the hospital.

130
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,220
- Wait, what...?
- Hiro-kun, you just wait here.

131
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,810
I'll call you later.

132
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,320
Shiina! It's okay, I'll go.

133
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,530
RaMu-san. It seems a friend of mine was taken to the hospital.

134
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,380
What?! Is he okay?

135
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,740
Shiina will take over from here.

136
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,700
What?

137
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,330
Manager, I'm really sorry, but...

138
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,460
is that okay?

139
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,820
Can't be helped.

140
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,800
Shiina.

141
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm sure you know this,
but this is being broadcast worldwide.

142
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,860
If you screw this up, I'll...

143
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,720
- Whoa!
- I'm leaving the rest to you.

144
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,160
Same here. Heh, you'll be fine!

145
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,930
- Okay.
- Right.

146
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,530
Good luck.

147
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,260
This is Shiina, I'll be taking over.

148
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,800
- Pleased to meet you.
- You too.

149
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,680
- Okay, I'm going to start cutting now.
- Okay.

150
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,520
Is it okay if I make the layers
a little shorter here?

151
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,280
- Mhm, yes. Please do.
- Okay, got it.

152
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,860
Natsuo...!

153
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,110
Hiro, what are you doing here?

154
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,590
The truth is... it's my first time cooking.

155
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,020
You need to have more faith in these hands.

156
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,690
And your heart, too.

157
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,410
Otherwise, your hands and your heart...
what a pathetic waste!

158
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,880
It's nice, having someone next to me.

159
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,310
Huh?

160
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,810
It's strangely comforting.

161
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,900
Hiro.

162
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,990
Hey, can you hear me?

163
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,180
Hiro!

164
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,210
Come on, get down here.

165
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,600
Natsuo... Natsuo...!

166
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,420
Natsuo... Natsuo... Natsuo...

167
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,270
Hiro.

168
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,220
Huh? A stomach exam?

169
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,520
Yeah. The boss.

170
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,940
I was at the hospital with him.

171
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,120
Then what about that phone?

172
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,210
I freaked out and dropped it.

173
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,990
A car suddenly came rushing right at me.

174
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,830
I'm glad you're here.

175
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,780
Oh, right.
I heard the victim only has minor injuries.

176
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,410
And by the way, the boss just has gastritis.

177
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,310
- I see.
- Yeah.

178
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,040
- What about you, Natsuo?
- Me?

179
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,130
I'm totally fine.

180
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:10,910
That's a relief.

181
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,230
I...

182
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,810
I really hated you back in high school...

183
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,610
No need to bring that up again.

184
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,520
You were always bugging me, and I was such a loser.

185
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,910
I always thought
you were making fun of me.

186
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,920
But...

187
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,220
you were the only one.

188
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,380
The only one who talked to me for all three years.

189
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,660
So...

190
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,300
the truth is, I wanted to talk to you more.

191
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,410
But I had no self-confidence...

192
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,810
I... I was always running away.

193
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,610
From facing myself.

194
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,930
You haven't changed at all.

195
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,110
Huh?

196
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,610
That earnest side of yours, Hiro...
I always really liked that about you.

197
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,120
You'd be out there all by yourself,
taking care of that filthy courtyard.

198
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,320
And you'd always listen to everything
I had to say until the very end.

199
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,500
You even wrote the furigana for me.

200
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,530
That's why I was so happy the other day.

201
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,100
When I realized that Hiro was that Suzuki.

202
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,910
Honestly, I couldn't tell at all just from your looks.

203
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,300
That's when I realized I'd fallen for Hiro all over again.

204
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm sure of it.

205
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,540
No matter how much your looks or appearance might change,

206
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,810
I know I'd fall in love with Hiro over and over again.

207
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,670
Natsuo...!

208
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:28,940
I...

209
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,380
Without you,

210
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,760
nothing I eat tastes good,

211
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,110
and I always wake up at seven in the morning.

212
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,190
I was totally fine before,

213
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,000
but now it hurts so much not having Natsuo next to me...

214
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,840
Hiro...

215
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,480
I love you.

216
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,810
I...

217
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,920
Somewhere along the line, I seriously fell for you.

218
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,330
Don't I stink of sweat?

219
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,110
Should I go take a shower?

220
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,940
No. It's fine like this.

221
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,120
Huh...?

222
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,610
You can do what you did the other day.

223
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,250
I'll be still.

224
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,600
You like that, don't you? When it's rough.

225
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,720
No, I don't.

226
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,040
Of course I don't.

227
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,950
Natsuo.

228
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,320
- Hmm?
- Are you okay?

229
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,800
It might be a little heavy...

230
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,390
Oh, sorry.

231
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,100
Hiro.

232
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,400
Natsuo...

233
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,880
Hiro...

234
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,320
- Ah, it's a beautiful day.
- Yeah.

235
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,180
I hear Shiina's doing amazing.

236
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,320
Huh? In what way?

237
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,930
She's totally going viral. Look!

238
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,910
Her follower count has skyrocketed, too.

239
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,800
- That's all my doing.
- What are you going to do?

240
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,180
What if Shiina is chosen as
the representative for the next competition?

241
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,520
- I'm fine with it.
- You are?!

242
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,520
What should we do?

243
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,070
Hey, what about this spot?

244
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,420
- Yeah.
- Okay.

245
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,400
- All right.
- Okay, okay.

246
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,110
Here.

247
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,000
- Okay. Gently.
- Right.

248
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,130
Okay, here.

249
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,900
- Slowly.
- Easy does it.

250
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,430
- Gently.
- Yeah.

251
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,430
Oh, looking good.

252
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,520
- Mission complete.
- Right.

253
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,680
- Your turn, Hiro.
- Mission complete.

254
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,820
Heh heh. All right, let's go.

255
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,510
What's next?

256
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,700
- I'm hungry.
- Oh.

257
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,410
We've applied first aid for now,

258
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,800
but we should probably
put it somewhere with good airflow.

259
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,720
Yeah.

260
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,710
What about outside?

261
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,780
Huh?

262
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,130
It might recover outside, right?
Out in the wide-open land.

263
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,210
The airflow is perfect, and it'll get
all the rain and sun it could want.

264
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,200
Natsuo.

265
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,350
- You're smart.
- Hmm?

266
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,210
You always know what's most important.

267
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,420
You think so?

268
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,330
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

269
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,060
Okay, but first.

270
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,340
- Huh? What?
- Up we go.

271
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,710
All right, I get it.

272
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,410
Mmm.

273
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,620
This is nice.

274
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,070
- Am I heavy?
- No, you're fine.

275
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,000
