1
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,840
That was really nice.

2
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,760
What you said earlier.

3
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,330
Here.

4
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,470
Hm?

5
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,830
Oh, it's nothing...

6
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,500
- Mmm, this is good.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,950
If you haven't eaten yet, we could...

8
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,360
See? Aren't you all better now?

9
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,480
I don't want that.

10
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,680
I don't want you to go back...

11
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,540
Hiro...!

12
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,500
I'm so glad.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,160
Natsuo...

14
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,350
I... about you...

15
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,320
Mmm... good morning.

16
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,740
- Yeah...
- Natsuo.

17
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,980
It's rare for you to wake up
before me, Hiro.

18
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,850
Mmm, once in a while.

19
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,100
No way. Are you making me breakfast?

20
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,300
- It's for me.
- No way! This is awesome!

21
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,990
- I said, it's for me.
- It's like Christmas came early.

22
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,520
- I'm telling you, it's for me.
- I'm taking this.

23
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,520
Ready, and...

24
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,650
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,300
Oh, right.

26
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,710
Mmm.

27
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,380
You're like a high school girl.

28
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,560
Hey, what's wrong with that?

29
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,460
Alright, for real this time. Let's eat.

30
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,470
Whoa.

31
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,270
Mmm.

32
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
So good!

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,030
Glad you like it.
Yeah.

34
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,550
- Oh, right.
- Hmm?

35
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,010
Natsuo, you have work today?

36
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,720
Mmm, I get off at 4:00 p.m., why?

37
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,490
Then, here.

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,870
- Huh...?
- A spare key.

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,150
Yeah, I know that, but...

40
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,500
That's not what I mean.
Are you sure I can keep it?

41
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,730
Yeah.

42
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,330
Really?

43
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,840
Come over whenever you want to see me.
You can even come by today.

44
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,860
- Today?
- If you don't want to, it's fine.

45
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,010
Of course I want to!

46
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,920
Ta-da! Washizawa Natsuo scores a spare key!

47
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,570
I've leveled up as a boyfriend again.

48
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,610
What's that supposed to mean?

49
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,520
- Thanks.
- Huh?

50
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,750
Thanks, Hiro.

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,290
Yeah.

52
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,380
Let's eat.

53
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,310
- This is so good.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,660
- How is it?
- Mmm, it's cooked perfectly.

55
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,330
Delicious!

56
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,910
Yeah, it is.

57
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,680
But isn't the portion a bit small?

58
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,250
You always make way too much.

59
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,940
- No way, it's definitely too small.
- I'm cooking tomorrow.

60
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,660
We're going to the botanical garden
tomorrow, so you don't have to.

61
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,270
Oh right, you said we'd eat at that
café that was closed last time.

62
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,350
- This is insane.
- Want one?

63
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,450
- Really!?
- For 10,000 yen.

64
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,250
Still, for these things...
the luck of the draw is everything.

65
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,710
The luck of the draw?
It's completely... random.

66
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,470
Dude, you have no idea.
I seriously never get anything good.

67
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,130
Nah, I already have this one.

68
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,120
I just got these guys yesterday.

69
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,080
Seriously?

70
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm not getting any
good items at all.

71
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,030
- Isn't that sick?
- Yeah, for real.

72
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,780
- Where should we go today?
- Hmm, what should we do?

73
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,630
- Oh, what about karaoke?
- Yeah, totally.

74
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,000
- The one by the station?
- Yeah.

75
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,230
Alright, to the arcade then...

76
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,280
What are you looking at?

77
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,810
Who's that?

78
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,620
What a pain. What are you doing here?

79
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,370
Suzuki.

80
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,110
Natsuo, did you need something from this guy?

81
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,890
Come on, say something!

82
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,830
Your glasses are so cute, too.

83
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,660
So, what's the “point” of the buttons?

84
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,050
Tell us about everything, including the buttons
and the glasses, please.

85
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,020
- The sleeves are cute too.
- The sleeves are really cool.

86
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,820
How do you even come up with
something like that?

87
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,420
Come on, come on.
Tell us the “point”.

88
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,730
Umm, let's see...

89
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,730
How about the batting cages? The batting cages.

90
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,600
- Sounds good.
- I wanna get moving.

91
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,570
Oh, the arcade is fine too. The arcade.

92
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,190
The arcade works.

93
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,200
- I heard they got some fun new games recently.
- Oh, yeah, I heard that too.

94
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,520
Who even goes to

95
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,700
those things?

96
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,040
"The Proper Way to Write Love"

97
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,720
(Episode 7: The Way to Face the Past (Nightmare))

98
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,900
Whoa! This is amazing!

99
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,230
Wow, it's so beautiful!

100
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,810
- Right?
- Yeah.

101
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,190
Whoa. That's so cool.

102
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,370
Oh! From the other day.

103
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,420
- Oh.
- Wow.

104
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,710
I'm so glad. You came back.

105
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,420
Yeah.

106
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,080
A sight for sore eyes.

107
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,070
That's my line.

108
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:11,910
Huh?

109
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,700
Oh, no, no, no... That's too much.

110
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,840
My eyes are for you!

111
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:18,900
Huh?

112
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,920
You even have such rare flowers here.

113
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,930
You really know your flowers.

114
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,480
Yeah, I guess.

115
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,890
- Enjoy your time here today.
- Yeah.

116
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,830
Right. Well, I'll excuse myself.

117
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,200
- Thank you.
- Yep.

118
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,460
Man, Hiro, you really know your stuff.

119
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,480
You must really love plants, huh?

120
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,320
You've got a lot more in your room now, too.

121
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,320
That's just because they look good as decor.

122
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,920
Why won't you just admit it?

123
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,640
What does it matter?

124
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,780
- Anyway, let's go over there.
- What is it?

125
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,480
- Where? Where?
- Over there.

126
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,220
I heard you can see a jade vine.

127
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,170
I found something cool earlier, too! Look!

128
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,830
Here it comes, here it comes!

129
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,680
Woo-hoo!

130
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,850
Look, I see something. It's a bird.

131
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,800
- So cool!
- But what about the jade vine?

132
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,330
All right. Let's just stay on!

133
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,970
Choo-choo-choo!

134
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,480
By the way, I'm going to a class reunion this Sunday.

135
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,490
- What?
- Yeah. I got a postcard from my high school.

136
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,960
- What for?
- Hmm?

137
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,840
There's someone I want to see.

138
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,500
Don't tell me it's...

139
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,420
Yep. The one I told you about. My first love.

140
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,750
Hey, don't get the wrong idea.

141
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,070
I just want to see if they're doing okay, that's all.

142
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,940
There's no way they'll show up.

143
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,380
- Why not?
- Because...

144
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,220
You said you and your friends all dissed them.

145
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,120
No, it wasn't like that.
I didn't mean to...

146
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,410
Even so,

147
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,550
what matters is how the other person took it, right?

148
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,670
If I were them, I definitely wouldn't go.

149
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,450
- You think so?
- Yeah.

150
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,500
One hundred percent.

151
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,110
I see...

152
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,140
I guess that's just how it is...

153
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,620
Hmm...

154
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,020
Yes, understood. Thank you.

155
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,380
Sorry about that. Okay, for the bridal fair
on Sunday, Hiro will be in charge.

156
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,320
- Asahi, you'll be his assistant.
- Yes, sir.

157
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,700
And for regular hours, Kiryu and Aoi.
I know you'll be two people short,

158
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,630
but I'm counting on you.

159
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,410
- Yes.
- Right.

160
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,630
All right. That's all for today.

161
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,500
Great work, everyone!

162
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,610
- Okay, you're dismissed.
- Right.

163
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,970
- Everyone, head home early today.
- Okay!

164
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,130
- That's a huge responsibility.
- Hm?

165
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,650
Yeah. It really is.

166
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,910
Well, it just means the boss
has a lot of faith in you.

167
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,070
I'm so jealous. We started at the same time,
but he's pulling so far ahead.

168
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,630
Aoi, you need to make more of an impression on the boss.

169
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,070
I am! I ask her to go to mixers with me every week.

170
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,000
That's not what I mean.

171
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,890
Anyway,

172
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,900
Hiro-kun, you have changed since you
met Natsuo, don't you think?

173
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,560
Don't tell me the person you like is...?

174
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,990
What? Knock it off.

175
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,390
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

176
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,610
All right, I'm heading out.

177
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,240
Okay. Take care.

178
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,050
- Natsuo.
- Yeah?

179
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,110
What are your plans for today?

180
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,930
- Oh, slaying the demon lord.
- The demon lord?

181
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,480
- Yeah.
- Oh, you mean in a game.

182
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,370
- Well, have fun with that.
- I will.

183
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,120
- Later.
- Yeah.

184
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,840
Okay, see you later.

185
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,080
Be careful. Bye-bye.

186
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,360
Here we go...

187
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,620
All right, time to beat this thing!

188
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,140
Bridal Fair staff member, Ms. Yamada.

189
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,970
- Please report to the third-floor venue immediately.
- Wow...

190
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,450
Oh, Hiro-san.

191
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,210
- Oh, Asahi-san.
- Glad to be working with you today.

192
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,040
Right. Eight couples, correct?

193
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,110
I'll do my best not to be outshone by these gorgeous outfits.

194
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,720
Yeah. It's a battlefield out there, so be prepared.

195
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,180
- Right. I'm ready for it.
- Okay, let's get to it.

196
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,620
Right.

197
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,020
All right...

198
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,830
Go, go! All right.

199
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,200
Ugh...

200
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,870
What?

201
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,910
Ugh, you've gotta be kidding me.

202
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,470
Ah, seriously? It's dead already...?

203
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,930
Ugh...

204
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,730
Huh?

205
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,570
What's this? There we go.

206
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,760
One week from now?

207
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,850
Is something happening then?

208
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,850
Oh!

209
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,240
It'll be one month since we started dating.

210
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,320
He's something else.

211
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,990
Leaving little marks like this...

212
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,790
So cute.

213
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,880
Right, I need to water the plants.

214
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,390
Almost a month, huh?

215
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,000
Time flies.

216
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,150
Oh. It's blooming again.

217
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,550
That's incredible.

218
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,520
It's so beautiful.

219
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,540
Whoa!

220
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,300
Oh, crap!

221
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,750
Nooo...

222
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,320
Damn it... What do I do?

223
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,290
At times like these...

224
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,220
Ugh, right...

225
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,660
What am I supposed to do?

226
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,810
Isn't there anything I can use?

227
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,530
Hmm...

228
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,840
Hmm?

229
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,320
Oh! There's one right here.

230
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,540
He's really into this, huh?

231
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,780
Huh...?

232
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,800
Gardening... for Beginners.

233
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,640
Oh.

234
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,850
What? The furigana are written in.

235
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,860
Suzuki did this?

236
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,710
Engei nyumon.
(Gardening for Beginners)

237
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,810
So this reads as "en".

238
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,810
Why is this in Hiro's room...?

239
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,580
Man, that was a real war zone.

240
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,770
Yeah... you were a lifesaver.
I'm glad you were here, Asahi-san.

241
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,930
Not at all. I'll work harder
so I can be more helpful.

242
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,820
You've done enough for today. Go on home.

243
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,450
What? But what about you, Hiro-san?

244
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,830
I have to report to the manager.

245
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,880
Oh, I see.

246
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,440
- Then I'll head out first.
- Okay. Get home safe.

247
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,800
- Right, thank you. Have a good night.
- You too.

248
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,080
Hello? Is this the manager?

249
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,900
This is Suzuki. Yes.

250
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,280
Yes, we wrapped everything up.

251
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,570
Ah, I understand.

252
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,570
In that case, I'll be heading home, too.

253
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,490
Okay, thank you.

254
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,640
Right.

255
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,380
Excuse me...

256
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,810
- Don't tell me... you're Suzuki?
- Huh?

257
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,060
I knew it! That's Suzuki's voice.

258
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,810
I just heard someone say "Hiro" and "Suzuki," so...

259
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,150
I thought it might be you.

260
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,990
It's me, Kai! From high school.

261
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,040
Don't you remember me?

262
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,050
So you came to the reunion, too!

263
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,210
I... don't think so.

264
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,090
- My name is Tanaka.
- Huh? Tanaka?

265
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,560
- Hey, Kai, what's taking you so long?
- My bad.

266
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,420
- Seriously, what were you doing?
- Give it a rest.

267
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,200
Oh! Hey... This is Suzuki.

268
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,650
Suzuki Hiromu.

269
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,760
What?

270
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,790
Wait, you mean "that" Suzuki? The loner?

271
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,970
- Yeah, yeah, that's him.
- No way! Seriously?

272
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,630
Wow, you've really changed.

273
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,860
You're so handsome now!

274
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,410
- Seriously, you look amazing.
- You came to the reunion?

275
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,110
- The party's over there. Come on, hurry up.
- Huh.

276
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,740
- This way, this way.
- This is insane, right?

277
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,770
- Talk about making a grand entrance.
- I know, he's changed so much.

278
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,250
- This is... crazy.
- Isn't it amazing?

279
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,570
So, what do you do for work?

280
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,530
- What's your job now?
- I'm a hairstylist.

281
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,720
- A hairstylist?
- Whoa! That's so cool!

282
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,110
- Oh, me, me, me!
- I wanna be your hair model.

283
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,670
A hair model?

284
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,990
Why? It would be a shame to cut hair this beautiful.

285
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,150
- Hm?
- Nothing.

286
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,170
Then I'll do it instead.

287
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,160
As if you could be a model.

288
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,780
- Amazing!
- Whoa!

289
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,490
Suzuki...

290
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,060
Seriously, you've got magic hands.

291
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,910
Man. Back in high school,

292
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,950
you should've been playing with hair
instead of digging in the dirt.

293
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,500
So true.

294
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,290
- Seriously.
- Yeah.

295
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,390
- Want some?
- Huh?

296
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,830
- Not you.
- For me?

297
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,860
- Yeah. It's carpaccio.
- Thanks.

298
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,220
- It's a little different today.
- Ooh.

299
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,390
- Oh, I'm so happy.
- You always liked carpaccio, right?

300
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,620
- Yeah. Wow, this looks delicious!
- Look, over there...

301
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,910
- Can I really have some?
- Go ahead. Here.

302
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,700
- Hey!
- Oh... Natsuo?

303
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,290
What's up?

304
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,320
- Huh?
- Oh, it's nothing.

305
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,230
It's just that, as always...

306
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,370
I was noticing what a... unique T-shirt you're wearing.

307
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,850
It's cool, right?

308
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,110
- Oh, where's Hiro?
- He's on a job.

309
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,960
Doing hair and makeup for a bridal fair at the Hotel Niikura.

310
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,340
- The Hotel Niikura?
- Yeah.

311
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,810
He should be done by now, though.

312
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,670
So I really has changed...

313
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,330
Did you see that transformation?

314
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,070
Yeah. His post-grad glow-up?

315
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,230
So gross.

316
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,600
But seriously, I think he's actually hot...

317
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,920
I'd totally sleep with this version of Suzuki.

318
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,850
I know, right? You think so too?
What?

319
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,330
No matter how he looks, he's still that same
loner on the inside.

320
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,120
Even if he's a loner, I'd rather he was good-looking
and loaded, you know?

321
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,880
You really think so?

322
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,540
He wasn't even on the B-team.
He was a C-lister, a D-lister. A total nobody.

323
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,690
I'm telling you, that was the old him. He's different now.

324
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,620
Well, he definitely looks like he's got money.

325
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,760
So, shall we continue to butter him up?

326
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,040
Hey there, superstar stylist.

327
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,790
- Natsuo...!
- Hiro.

328
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,830
Crap... did he hear us?

329
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,680
What are you doing here?

330
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,910
Whoa, whoa... Suzuki. Don't take it the wrong way, man.

331
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,320
Suzuki Hiromu.

332
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,850
From the gardening club.

333
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,370
So "Suzuki" was you all along, Hiro?

334
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,450
What the hell is this? Why would you lie to me...?

335
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,860
That's kinda pathetic, isn't it?
- Were they just fighting?

336
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,110
Damn it...

337
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,920
(Next Episode: The Way to Write Proper Furigana)

338
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,070
What the hell is going on?

339
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,990
Why didn't you tell me?

340
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,520
Do you have any idea what I went through

341
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,270
to become a hairstylist just to prove you all wrong?
