1
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:07,484
Hey, what's this flower?

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,202
Huh?

3
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,978
It's so cute. Is it edible?

4
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:13,997
Uh... well...

5
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:16,492
Suzuki?

6
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:19,586
- Ngh!
- Whoa!

7
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:22,989
What the heck? So you can talk.

8
00:00:23,383 --> 00:00:24,441
- Hmm.
- You can't eat it.

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,330
Oh.

10
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:28,773
Hmm... Then what about that one!

11
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:30,785
- Not edible.
- How about that one?

12
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:31,331
Not edible.

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,984
- Okay, then this one.
- That one either.

14
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,673
Jeez. Seriously.

15
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:44,010
Then plant tomatoes next time, okay?

16
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,981
Oh! And over there, let's have
choco-mint, choco-banana, and choco ice cream.

17
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,983
Sounds good, right?

18
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,543
- Awesome, a chocolate parade.
- Huh?

19
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,780
Mmm...

20
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:09,592
Ugh, it was a dream.

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,013
Seriously...

22
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,769
Why was I with a guy like him...

23
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:26,653
- A competition?
- That's right.

24
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,989
Our parent company is holding a big competition soon.

25
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:34,994
So next week, we're holding a test
to select our shop's representative.

26
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:38,706
You two, please be ready for it.

27
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:40,865
- What?
- What?

28
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,670
Me and Kiryu?

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,673
Yes. The winner will be our rep.

30
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,009
Now then,
let's have a great day, everyone!

31
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,311
Let's do it!

32
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,650
Wow, you're really moving up.

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,652
Getting nominated for the competition.

34
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,655
- Hmph.
- Don't you "hmph" me.

35
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,991
Are you sure you should be so relaxed?

36
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,993
Hey, now.

37
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,995
Just because your coworker got chosen first.

38
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:13,833
Listen, this is a chance for a promotion.
Do you get it?

39
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,169
You don't have to tell me, I know.

40
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,171
Well, as long as you know.

41
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,674
Still, I can't believe the manager is making you
compete with someone like Kiryu.

42
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:25,812
- Ow!
- Sorry.

43
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:30,819
Who knows.

44
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:33,005
"The Proper Way To Write Love"

45
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:36,112
Alright, let's do this!

46
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:38,317
(Episode 3: The Way to Competition (Jealousy))

47
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:41,487
That looks delicious!

48
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,989
I've got a competition coming up against Kiryu.

49
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,942
Huh?

50
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,528
Company?

51
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,339
What company? It's a com-PE-tition.

52
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:54,996
Oh, with a Pi?

53
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:56,454
- PE!
- PU!

54
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:58,383
- Pe!
- Pe?

55
00:03:58,486 --> 00:03:59,918
Yes. A com-PE-tition.

56
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,441
Oh, "pe."

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,590
Well, then you'd better practice.

58
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:06,337
You gotta make sure you don't lose to that rival, Kiryu!

59
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:08,069
No need.

60
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:10,483
Perfection isn't achieved in a day.

61
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,485
- Huh?
- You see...

62
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,487
It means cramming at the last minute
is pointless.

63
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,086
In a test, it's the work you put in
every day that matters.

64
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:21,107
So you're saying you've been putting in the
work, Hiro?

65
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:25,664
Yeah. I work twice as hard as anyone else.

66
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,815
Thank you very much.

67
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,484
I want Hiro-kyun again next time!

68
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,049
Of course. I'll take you to the checkout.

69
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,471
This way, please.

70
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,304
Well, I don't see myself losing.

71
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:58,884
So you can still hang out with me like usual?

72
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:00,891
Yeah.

73
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:04,653
Great! Then you've got this in the bag.

74
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:07,374
Alright, let's eat.

75
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:12,478
Here. A large one for you, Hiro.

76
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:13,913
Hurry up.

77
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:17,402
I'm digging in.

78
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,951
Mmm, this is actually pretty good.

79
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:25,599
Hmm?

80
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:27,185
- Oh...
- You don't like it? The rice omelet.

81
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,326
Oh, no.

82
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,480
Good.

83
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,968
Oh, right! If you win next time...

84
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,860
I'll make you a fancy meal to celebrate.

85
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:39,956
Start thinking about what you want.

86
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:41,805
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

87
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,054
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

88
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,771
Eat some fish, too.

89
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,193
- Righ... Okay.
- Yeah.

90
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:53,421
I put green onions in this, too! Vegetables.

91
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:56,481
- Just a sec.
- It's healthy, right?

92
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,437
- Is this right?
- It's right.

93
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,979
See? The lotus root adds a nice crunch.

94
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,814
You should try the fish, too.

95
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:06,853
- Me?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,162
Let's eat together.

97
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:13,733
- Alright, I'm digging in.
- Let's eat.

98
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:23,154
Man, I'd love to eat out every once in a while...

99
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:26,661
This looks delicious.

100
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,411
Huh, where is this place?

101
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:35,787
This looks amazing.

102
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:41,028
Whose is this?

103
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:43,380
Jeez...

104
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:57,508
This sketchbook...

105
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,775
Whew.

106
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,648
What do you think?

107
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,723
Does it look good?

108
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:27,684
How do you like it?

109
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,507
It looks fantastic!

110
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:33,492
Thank you. It suits you very well.

111
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:36,119
Excuse me.

112
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,715
Ah, Hiro. Could you take care of this?

113
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:47,225
Yes.

114
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:21,816
Ugh...

115
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:25,355
What the hell?

116
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,447
So noisy.

117
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:31,871
Jeez...

118
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,285
Hey, Hiro!

119
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:37,184
Let's grab a beer together.

120
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,353
Ah, wai-wai-wait... Hey! H-Hiro!

121
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,742
Hey, Hiro, wait up!

122
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,273
I'm leaving it here.

123
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:51,789
Just wait a second!

124
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:56,079
What the hell? I thought you weren't gonna
do the last minute cramming.

125
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:57,324
Shut up.

126
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,395
Whoa!

127
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:03,436
This is nice. This hairstyle is great, too.

128
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,910
Hey, hey, do my hair like that.

129
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,945
Jeez.

130
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:10,392
- Aww, it's cute.
- Just wear this for now.

131
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,295
- Hey! What's the big idea?
- Give it back.

132
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,164
Is it cute?

133
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:21,727
Call me Natsuo-chan.

134
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:25,859
Come on, look at me!

135
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,354
It's Natsuo-chan!

136
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,104
Right, Hiro?

137
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:34,916
Huh?

138
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:44,685
Heeey, Hiiirooo.

139
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:47,194
You done? Are you done yet?

140
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,029
Oh, senpai...

141
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:19,036
It's fine. You're done, right?

142
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:20,903
I'll lock up.

143
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:23,856
Thank you.

144
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:27,231
Well then, I'll be heading out first.

145
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,734
- Oh, good work.
- You too, good work.

146
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,982
Huh. It's rare to see you closing up, Hiro.

147
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:43,960
There's a loudmouth at home, so...

148
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:45,727
Ooh, what's this? Who is it?

149
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:50,500
- It's not what you think.
- Hmm...

150
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,047
Manager?

151
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,311
I'm looking forward to your performance.

152
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,726
Maybe I shouldn't.

153
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,056
Come in.

154
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:03,884
Are you sure?

155
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:13,314
Excuse me.

156
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:19,404
- Oh, here.
- Thanks.

157
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:20,449
Mhm.

158
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:27,220
Whoa! So you've finally decided on a design.

159
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:29,747
No, it's not quite that.

160
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:31,941
I just don't have time, so I need to get a head start.

161
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:33,938
This is awesome!

162
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:36,498
- You think so?
- Yeah.

163
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:41,498
What part? Tell me what you like about it.

164
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:45,537
Well...

165
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:49,368
First off, this part... here.

166
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,399
Oh, right...

167
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,695
- Kiryu?
- Hiro-san.

168
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,761
Sorry to bother you so suddenly.

169
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:13,430
- Uh... what's up?
- Um...

170
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,972
Have you seen my sketchbook?

171
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:23,157
It's gone.

172
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:25,894
I'm sure I put it in my bag.

173
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:28,245
Huh...

174
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:32,371
It's really important for the competition.

175
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,301
I haven't seen it...

176
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:46,221
You were the last one to leave yesterday,
weren't you, Hiro-san?

177
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:53,877
- Are you accusing me?
- No... I mean...

178
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,408
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:59,752
I'll go home and look for it again.

180
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:01,273
Excuse me.

181
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:09,859
Phew.

182
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,764
What was that about?

183
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,038
As if Hiro would steal anything... Jeez.

184
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:27,045
Wait...

185
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,498
Could it be...?

186
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:33,123
Of course not.

187
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,177
It wasn't me, but...

188
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:05,618
Argh, I forgot something again...

189
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,488
Huh? Has Hiro already left?

190
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:15,185
If the manager hadn't come back...
I definitely would have taken it.

191
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,271
What are you talking about? You didn't take it.

192
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:22,432
But...

193
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,471
a part of me was glad.

194
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,893
Huh?

195
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,003
When I heard Kiryu's sketchbook was gone.

196
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:34,573
Hiro...!

197
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,362
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

198
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:40,495
But I feel like I have no choice.

199
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:45,292
The manager and my coworkers
are all counting on me.

200
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:48,579
You can't get by on idealism alone...

201
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:49,898
Get a grip!

202
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,633
Why won't you believe in your own hands?

203
00:15:55,935 --> 00:16:00,157
Listen, that day,
Hiro you gave me an amazing haircut

204
00:16:00,182 --> 00:16:02,057
that suited me perfectly.

205
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:08,205
I was shocked at how different it could be
depending on the person.

206
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,020
Is that what you call "heart"?

207
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:14,492
I think I really felt that from you.

208
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:17,328
So...

209
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:20,549
you need to have more faith in these hands.

210
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:21,828
And your heart, too.

211
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,900
Otherwise, your hands and your heart...
what a pathetic waste!

212
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,455
Kiryu... I...

213
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:00,565
N-No, um, Hiro-san.

214
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:03,784
I am so incredibly sorry.

215
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:07,329
I found it. The sketchbook.

216
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:08,576
What...

217
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:13,350
When I searched again carefully,
it was behind the shelf...

218
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,686
My bag is always a mess.

219
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:21,415
I just stuff all kinds of things
in there together.

220
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:25,407
So things fall out all the time,
causing trouble for everyone...

221
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:28,931
No... ah...

222
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,650
I'm truly sorry.

223
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:35,400
I guess I was in a panic.

224
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:38,469
No...

225
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,655
I'm not one to talk.

226
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:44,319
Huh?

227
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:47,460
I...

228
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:50,975
I was jealous of you.

229
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:53,795
Hiro-san...!

230
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:12,263
- Manager.
- Hmm?

231
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,232
Starting today, could I reduce
the number of clients I see?

232
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:17,489
Oh?

233
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,663
The truth is, I haven't actually
settled on a design yet.

234
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:23,163
What? You still haven't decided?

235
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:24,920
No.

236
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:28,608
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

237
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:31,319
Just make sure you get it together!

238
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:35,017
Yes. Thank you very much.

239
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,536
No. This isn't the kind of design I want...

240
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,081
I see. So that's another approach.

241
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,857
Hmm. I get it now.

242
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:01,607
Alright, the selection test for the
group competition representative...

243
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,021
starts now.

244
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:33,945
Yes.

245
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:36,463
Hiro.

246
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:51,015
- Hiro!
- Natsuo.

247
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:01,702
Hey, hey, hey! What happened?
Hurry up and tell me!

248
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:08,905
Whoa...!

249
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:11,423
You cut this, Hiro?

250
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:13,153
Yeah.

251
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:15,285
This is great.

252
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:18,572
I'm an idiot so I don't really get
the technical stuff, but...

253
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:21,347
This has to be the best one
I've seen you do, right?

254
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:24,003
- That's what you think, right?
- Yeah.

255
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,078
- And yet, I lost.
- What...

256
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:30,078
Hiro.

257
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:33,703
Sorry, but this time, it's Kiryu.

258
00:22:34,498 --> 00:22:35,515
What...?

259
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:40,277
His technique is still a long way off...

260
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:44,811
but Kiryu really observes his models.

261
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:49,202
As for you, Hiro...

262
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:52,069
it feels like you always put yourself first.

263
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:57,072
Therefore, our representative this time is Kiryu.

264
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:58,611
Go and do your best.

265
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,783
Thank you very much!

266
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:12,774
Hehe. You're too tense.

267
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,574
Thank you.

268
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:18,427
She hit the nail on the head. It's true...

269
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:22,020
I thought I was facing my clients
with all my heart, but...

270
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,900
somewhere inside, I was always thinking about myself.

271
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:29,728
Wanting to be recognized, wanting to win...

272
00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:32,580
that desire was just too strong.

273
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:39,976
But this is my favorite piece I've ever made.

274
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:43,906
The model was really happy with it, too.

275
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:46,727
And that made me happier than anything.

276
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:50,453
Then you won.

277
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:52,516
Huh?

278
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:55,485
You surpassed your old self, didn't you?

279
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,705
Then that's a win, isn't it!

280
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:01,759
Alright! Let's go eat something good to celebrate!

281
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:03,986
Heh. It's on me.

282
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:05,478
Your cooking is fine.

283
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:08,378
Actually...

284
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:10,730
I want to eat Natsuo's food.

285
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:12,285
Huh?

286
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:16,292
I see.

287
00:24:17,996 --> 00:24:19,246
I see!

288
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:22,352
I'll go make it right now!

289
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:26,136
Ah...

290
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:29,474
- All we have is shishamo.
- Huh...

291
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:33,007
(Next Episode: The Way to Reward (Kiss))
Alright! A reward date...

292
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,715
- I got it! Hahaha!
- Ow.

293
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,430
What in the world is he going to request?

294
00:25:39,283 --> 00:25:41,809
It's just the two of us now, Hiro.

295
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:43,449
What is wrong with you?

296
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:46,520
You're way too close! Too close!

297
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:49,111
But we're dating, right?

298
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:52,119
Since we're dating, isn't this what couples do?
Get all touchy-feely?

299
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:54,932
Why am I the one looking so unhappy?

300
00:25:55,257 --> 00:25:56,640
Hey. Are you going to run away again?

301
00:25:58,526 --> 00:25:59,507
Are you okay?
