1
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:51,459
Huh...?

2
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:54,154
Pachira.

3
00:00:56,983 --> 00:00:58,029
Ivy.

4
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:02,772
Oh, it's a Sansevieria.

5
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:08,655
Nemophila... and Allium too.

6
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:10,155
Wow.

7
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,786
New shoots are coming out!

8
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:41,484
So only the leaves really
come out of the ground.

9
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:03,656
It's been a while.

10
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,458
This looks amazing.
It's really finished beautifully.

11
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,919
Hmm.

12
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:24,789
How about this, Tsuboi-san?

13
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,024
Hiro-kyun.

14
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:30,483
Oh, that's awesome!
That's really awesome!

15
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:32,485
Thank you!

16
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,488
- I'll need you again next week.
- Of course!

17
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,317
Hiro-kyun?

18
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,739
- Oh, oh... I'll take the photo.
- Yeah, yeah.

19
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:10,024
- You're going to post it on social media, right?
- Exactly!

20
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,618
Got it.

21
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,785
Doing fan activities every single week...
that's incredible.

22
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,331
Such a blessing, such a blessing.

23
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:19,817
Fan activities?

24
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,283
Oh, you mean Hiro-kun.

25
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,174
Manager, she's a housewife, isn't she?

26
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,307
A godsend!

27
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,341
For our store, she's a complete godsend.

28
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:37,700
But is she really okay, though?

29
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,819
She comes every week.

30
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,442
Her hair is getting shorter and shorter...

31
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,972
She's still got plenty of hair.

32
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,175
Will she have a buzz cut in six months?

33
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:53,666
- Nah, probably just a really short cut.
- Hmm.

34
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,668
Ah, where is it?

35
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:58,683
Whoa!

36
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:01,407
What the heck are you doing here?

37
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,677
Hiro...! Because I don't have your contact info!

38
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,646
I don't have any money today,
so I can't even go inside the store!

39
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,648
Jeez.

40
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:15,292
Oh, really?

41
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:17,909
Yeah, thanks.

42
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:21,660
My bad for interrupting your work.

43
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,164
- Do you really mean that?
- Of course I do!

44
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,339
- Hey, wanna go on a date tomorrow?
- Huh?

45
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,338
- We just saw each other yesterday and today!
- That's different from a date, isn't it?

46
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:36,329
Why do I have to go on a date with you?

47
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:40,487
Because we're dating, aren't we?

48
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:46,288
Oh...! You're right.

49
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:51,014
What the heck, you're weird.

50
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:53,659
You're being called.

51
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,098
Ah...

52
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:09,417
I'm back.

53
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,595
Fine.

54
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,526
I'll make it the best date ever.

55
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:01,419
- In ten seconds.
- No, stop!

56
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:03,723
Stop it...

57
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:06,165
- Let's wear matching outfits. Come on.
- No... I'm really fine.

58
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,490
- It suits you, look!
- I don't really like orange.

59
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:10,548
You love orange the most, don't you?

60
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,073
Suzuki!

61
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:17,075
Whoa, ah!

62
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:29,354
- Suzuki suddenly called me out.
- What's the "point"?

63
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,356
Could you say a few words?

64
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:34,159
Hold on a second. Hey!

65
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:37,106
There you go. Could you say a few words?

66
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:42,534
Huh? Is this a place to get your hair cut?

67
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,113
Yo~. Good work.

68
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:57,983
Then date me!

69
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:01,946
Okay.

70
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,937
Yessss!

71
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:11,997
Ah~ ah... I was so nervous.

72
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:15,667
Ah~

73
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:25,243
One month. In one month...

74
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:24,287
"The Proper Way To Write Love"

75
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:30,635
(Episode 2: The Way to Revenge (Date))

76
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,978
Ah...

77
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,677
- Oh~ You're here.
- Yep.

78
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:41,653
- Where are we going? Where?
- Just follow me.

79
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,989
- What's up?
- Did you come up with a plan?

80
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:47,164
- Of course.
- Nice~!

81
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,560
Oh, you!

82
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm sorry, we're completely full right now.

83
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,502
- What? Full!?
- Yes.

84
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:59,504
We apologize.

85
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:02,173
I see. Understood.

86
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,175
Thank you.

87
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:08,043
Let's go.

88
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:12,984
- We look forward to seeing you again.
- I really wanted to eat that...

89
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:22,849
Ah... huh? It's their regular day off...

90
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,165
It's fine.

91
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,470
Again...?

92
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,400
What now?

93
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,006
Where are we going?

94
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:41,146
Ah... are we really going to get there?

95
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:44,149
There's a popular cafe around here...

96
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,318
Hey, Hiro, have you not really
been on many dates?

97
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:50,488
What?

98
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:53,658
No way, huh. You look like you'd be popular.

99
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:55,660
Of course I am!

100
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,664
- I've dated a ton of people.
- Yeah, yeah...

101
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:02,167
Come on. Let's just go into anywhere already!

102
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,336
I know, we'll be there in just a bit.

103
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:08,006
You keep saying that, but we're getting further and further
away from the city, aren't we?

104
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,008
Will you shut up?

105
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:12,977
You've been doing nothing
but complain this whole time.

106
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:16,314
- Are we seriously going to get there?
- Hurry up and come on!

107
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:18,816
There doesn't seem to be anything here.

108
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,121
Ugh...

109
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:28,159
Ugh, I'm sooooo tired... Hurry up...

110
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,663
I'm tired! Hurry up!

111
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:34,666
- I'm so tired!
- Seriously... Be quiet!

112
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,500
- Huh? But I'm tired.
- I can't concentrate!

113
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:38,836
Huh?

114
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:40,539
Ah...

115
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:43,675
I miss the city.

116
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, it's beautiful.

117
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:51,149
How about this one? This one's beautiful too.

118
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:54,986
This one's nice too.

119
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,988
Alright.

120
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:58,990
Suzuki!

121
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,659
Your hobby is tending to flowers?
You're like "Grandpa Hanasaka," huh?

122
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,661
What's that supposed to mean?

123
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,831
From today, your nickname is "Hanasaka."

124
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:08,833
- That's dangerous!
- Hey!

125
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,836
Huh!

126
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:14,172
Nice.

127
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:17,642
- Geez...
- Are you okay? Come on!

128
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:21,479
- Stop that...
- Sunflowers are nice.

129
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,120
Stop it.

130
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:28,986
- Hey, that's dangerous! Hmph!
- Oh, come on. I said it's dangerous!

131
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:33,057
- Hey, it looks like sunflowers are growing out of your umbrella!
- Don't throw them!

132
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,664
Oh, wow.

133
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,578
Huh-huh.

134
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:45,178
Hiro.

135
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:48,673
I had it sealed away for a long time...

136
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,612
Sealed away?

137
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,679
It's nothing.

138
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,682
Got it.

139
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:05,323
Look at this flower! It's interesting.

140
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:08,601
Genpeikusagi.
Genpeikusagi?

141
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:13,831
Talking nonsense again... Wait, it's real.

142
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:16,000
Huh? Then what's this one?

143
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,837
- This is a guava.
- Guava.

144
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:24,008
Oh, correct! So... what's this one?

145
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,008
This is...

146
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:29,304
- Thunbergia fragrans.
- Thunbergia fragrans.

147
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:31,182
That's amazing.

148
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,508
And this is...

149
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:34,652
- Acerola.
- Acerola?

150
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:36,726
And the one next to it is...

151
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:38,646
- Mango.
- Mango.

152
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:39,316
Yeah.

153
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,827
- Mangoes get this big?
- That's right.

154
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:45,796
And this is Thunbergia vogeliana.

155
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:48,666
- Huh? Thunbergia Vog...?
- The name is a bit long, though.

156
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,668
Too long.

157
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:52,670
And this tree is...

158
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,840
- Sapodilla.
- Sapodilla.

159
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,342
Amazing. It looks like a mango.

160
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:00,124
This white flower is...

161
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:01,679
Yaesanyuuka.

162
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,681
It's kind of cute.

163
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:06,283
- It's beautiful, right?
- Yeah.

164
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:08,252
There are a lot of them.
Oh...

165
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:12,323
Wait, why are you so knowledgeable about plants, Hiro?

166
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:16,160
Well, it's not just plants. I know everything.

167
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,329
- Oh, really?
- Did you know?

168
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:20,998
- That cats have dominant paws too.
- Yeah.

169
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:23,346
And the way to determine that is...

170
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:27,338
- Huh?
- Oh, Hiro?

171
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:31,008
- Is that...
- Oh, oh... Hiro!

172
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:49,160
Whoa! Main dish of the botanical garden: the Rose Garden!

173
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,621
Unbelievable!

174
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:56,166
Whoa! What's this one called, Hiro?

175
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,837
- That's "Twilight."
- "Twilight?"

176
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:04,174
- Yeah.
- That's a cool name.

177
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:05,728
Actually, Hiro...

178
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:08,512
You really are a plant guy, aren't you?

179
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:10,681
I know everything.

180
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:12,683
Oh, do you know this?

181
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:16,153
Dogs also have dominant paws.
And the way to determine that is...

182
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:19,823
Excuse me! Excuse me... Excuse me!

183
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:21,825
- What is it?
- Oh, wait...

184
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,328
About the dominant paw thing... eh?

185
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:33,671
It's about this...

186
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,683
What is this? This is awful...!

187
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:50,320
That's terrible.

188
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,213
I see.

189
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:03,167
Recently, there have been a lot of incidents
where someone is slashing flowers.

190
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:08,171
Yes... Looking at the cuts, it seems to be with scissors...

191
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,053
I see.

192
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:13,862
We'll also keep an eye out for the culprit around the garden.

193
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:17,347
Oh, no! We can't let our guests do anything so dangerous...

194
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:21,819
It's fine. Leave it to us.

195
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:24,488
- Yes.
- Okay.

196
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,992
Alright! We're definitely gonna find them!

197
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:30,994
This isn't a game, you know.

198
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:33,330
I know that.

199
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,999
- Oh! Look at that!
- Hm?

200
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,001
- Doesn't that look suspicious?
- No way!

201
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,054
That's him.

202
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,401
Looks like it.

203
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:58,822
Ah... So relaxing.

204
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:05,042
I guess I'm really not cut out for being yakuza.

205
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:06,514
Hey!

206
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:07,998
That's not him at all!

207
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,725
Well... that was confusing.

208
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:13,170
- Ah!
- Hm?

209
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,006
- Oh...!
- Oh, man...

210
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,846
Oh! Wait...!

211
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:29,235
- That looks shady.
- I know, right?

212
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:37,327
Turns out he's just pruning.

213
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:40,935
- Huh? So, He's staff?
- Yeah.

214
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,334
- Oh! What about that?
- Huh?

215
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:50,692
And that?

216
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:54,845
- Hey, what about that?
- Give it a break already.

217
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:57,681
You're just pointing at everything you see, aren't you?

218
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:02,018
- Stop messing with me.
- No, but...

219
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:20,031
Hey!

220
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,173
What are you doing?

221
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,689
Ah...

222
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:35,018
So you were cutting all these flowers?

223
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,253
Why would you do something like this?

224
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,401
No reason. They're just flowers,
so I thought it was not big deal.

225
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:54,905
- Huh?
- But everyone started gathering around.

226
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,908
It amuses me, so I just did it.

227
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:00,302
Just flowers?

228
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,491
- They're not just flowers!
- Hiro.

229
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:10,879
Listen.

230
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:13,998
This flower is a Calla Lily.

231
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,012
Its official name is Zantedeschia aethiopica.

232
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:22,563
It takes 60 to 90 days to bloom.

233
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:25,883
But it only blooms for two to three days.

234
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:27,182
Oh...?

235
00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:32,563
You water it regularly to keep the soil from drying out...

236
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,112
And when the leaves grow long...

237
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:38,464
You use stakes to keep it from falling over.

238
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:45,690
Even with all that tender care,
it only blooms for two to three days.

239
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:50,768
And you think it's okay to do this to it?

240
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:52,546
Ah...!

241
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,811
It's small, but it's a precious life.

242
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:04,421
Its name is Zantedeschia aethiopica.

243
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:08,341
It's not just a flower.

244
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:15,185
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:31,167
If you float it in water like this...

246
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,169
It'll live much longer.

247
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,171
Want to try?

248
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:41,145
Oh! That's good! Alright, next one please.

249
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,929
Where will this go?

250
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:47,298
Okay. Next.

251
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:50,442
That kid just transferred here, apparently.

252
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:53,528
He couldn't quite settle in at school,
so that's why he did that.

253
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,907
- Ah, so that's it.
- Yeah.

254
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:00,944
- I remembered something.
- Hm?

255
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:05,266
There's a person who taught me how to read kanji
a long time ago.

256
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:06,770
Huh?

257
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:25,141
Flowers?

258
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:27,544
So, you're planting flowers today.

259
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:32,387
Oh...

260
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:35,331
The furigana are written in.

261
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:37,333
Suzuki did this?

262
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,477
Engei nyumon.
(Gardening for Beginners)

263
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:47,895
So this reads as "en".

264
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:51,958
Huh. Oh, there are furigana inside too...

265
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:56,271
"Kadan?"
(flower bed)

266
00:20:56,642 --> 00:20:59,856
So the word "hana" (flower) is read as "ka."

267
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:01,642
Huh.

268
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:05,685
Thanks, Suzuki!

269
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:12,335
That was the trigger that got me to study a bit.

270
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:15,783
Thanks to that, I didn't have to repeat a year and could get a job.

271
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:19,842
Now that I think about it...

272
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:23,513
That guy planted a seed inside me.

273
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:24,787
A seed...

274
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:32,053
I hope that kid turns out the same way, starting today.

275
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:45,492
Alright, let's head home.

276
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:47,620
Huh...?

277
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:49,670
Hiro?

278
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:52,341
Oh, there you are.

279
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:56,625
Hiro!

280
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,622
- Natsuo.
- What, you're getting souvenirs? For colleagues?

281
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,368
No.

282
00:22:04,353 --> 00:22:07,523
Hmm. Something like this, huh?

283
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:11,360
Should we buy one? As a souvenir of our first date.

284
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,197
Huh... you mean we'll raise it together?

285
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:19,001
I see. Like cutting the wedding cake.
Our first joint effort!

286
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,884
- Excuse me, I'll take this.
- Hey, wait!

287
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:23,133
- What?
- Let's choose one together.

288
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,348
Which one do you think is best?

289
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:31,005
Hmm... ah.

290
00:22:32,348 --> 00:22:35,518
This one looks good.

291
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:38,020
Yeah. I'll take this one.

292
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,524
- This one?
- Yeah. It's good, isn't it?

293
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:45,050
- You're impossible.
- Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

294
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:47,510
- Is this really okay?
- Yeah.

295
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:51,167
Oh, there are so many other things here...

296
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:55,186
Here.

297
00:22:56,338 --> 00:22:57,735
Ah...

298
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,911
- I'm home!
- You're so loud.

299
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:06,182
- You'll bother the neighbors.
- What?

300
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:11,187
Ugh, I'm so tired.

301
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:13,689
Don't just walk in here like you own the place.

302
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:15,858
Because we're lovers!

303
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:17,860
Forget that, let's eat.

304
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,196
No, before that, beer...

305
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:22,498
No, before that, this.

306
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:23,708
Huh?

307
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:34,343
- Oh, that's nice!
- Huh?

308
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:38,847
It's nice. It really changes the whole vibe.

309
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:40,849
- Right?
- Yeah.

310
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:45,224
It has a great presence. That's life for ya.

311
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:48,181
- Delphinium.
- Hm?

312
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,736
This is called Delphinium.

313
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:55,197
Huh. Delphinium.

314
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:57,666
- A flower?
- Yeah.

315
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,668
What kind of flowers will it bloom?

316
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:03,355
That's a surprise until it blooms.

317
00:24:04,117 --> 00:24:06,342
Alright, alright.

318
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:08,344
Alright, let's drink.

319
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:10,846
Phew, I'm tired.

320
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:16,852
- Alright, cheers!
- Cheers!

321
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,526
- Ahhh.
- Ahhh.

322
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:27,051
- Amazing!
- So good!

323
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:33,528
(Next Episode: The Way to Fight (Jealous))
- A competition? - Me and... Kiryu?

324
00:25:33,528 --> 00:25:35,530
The winner gets to be the representative.

325
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,166
Well, I'm certainly not going to lose.

326
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:42,170
When you win next time,
I'll cook you something amazing to celebrate.

327
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,172
Start thinking about what you want to eat.

328
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:47,809
- Here, put this on!
- Huh?

329
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:52,174
Why would the manager
make him compete with Kiryu?

330
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:56,621
- Kiryu.
- Hiro-san.

331
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:59,570
- Sorry... for suddenly visiting.
- Huh?
