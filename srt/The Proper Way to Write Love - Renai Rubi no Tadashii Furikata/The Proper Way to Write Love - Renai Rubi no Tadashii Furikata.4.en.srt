1
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,239
So beautiful.

2
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,611
Get a grip!

3
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,134
Why won't you believe in your own hands?

4
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:21,416
Because "cutting with all his heart" is Hiro-kun's motto.

5
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:26,385
- Hmm. With all his heart…
- Listen.

6
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:28,205
That day, Hiro…

7
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,486
You gave me an amazing haircut
that suited me perfectly.

8
00:00:32,752 --> 00:00:34,064
Is that what you call "heart"?

9
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:37,056
I think I really felt that from you.

10
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,244
You need to have more faith in these hands.

11
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:41,564
And your heart, too.

12
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,666
Otherwise, your hands and your heart...
what a pathetic waste!

13
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:06,478
I see. So you realized something important
because of me, huh?

14
00:01:29,837 --> 00:01:31,071
Oh, give me a break.

15
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,734
Honestly!

16
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,047
You're so annoying.

17
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,301
Hmm...

18
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,879
You've been glued to your phone this whole time.

19
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:28,206
Unlike you, boss, I'm young and hip.

20
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,253
Ow! What was that for?

21
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:33,604
Ooh.

22
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,243
Alright! A reward date... I got it!

23
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:40,408
Ow! What was that for?

24
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:42,752
- Shut up.
- What's the big deal?

25
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:46,415
I got a date. I can't wait!

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,011
Where should we go? Hmm, where to...

27
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,715
Hey, what are you doing? Don't send that.

28
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,832
- The boss's... Come on! Argh!
- I'm replying for you.

29
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:56,309
- Hey! I don't need some old geezer replying for me.
- Hey. Give it back.

30
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,168
Hey, hey, hey, hey... Ow, ow, ow.

31
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:00,980
Oh, sorry. My bad.

32
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:14,517
Seriously? Anywhere is okay? For real?

33
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:16,743
- Awesome!
- You've got to be kidding me...

34
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:19,557
What in the world is he going to request?

35
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:26,588
Maybe a luxury watch or something?

36
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:34,768
Wait... could it be...

37
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,042
a high-class sushi restaurant?

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,925
Damn it.

39
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:44,083
Why am I the one suffering
when I was supposed to be torturing him?

40
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,598
I'm doomed...

41
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:52,653
Oh...

42
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,889
Go.

43
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:11,352
A man never goes back on his word.

44
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:15,359
I'll take you anywhere and do anything you want.

45
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:16,844
Hmm.

46
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:19,578
You said it, right?

47
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,398
Then follow me.

48
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:26,638
"The Proper Way to Write Love"

49
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,965
(Episode 4: The Way to Give a Present (KISS))

50
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,990
Huh? This place is...

51
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:34,461
Yeah.

52
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,820
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

53
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:41,906
- Seriously?
- I'm serious! Let's just take a nice, relaxing walk.

54
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:46,597
Wait, I didn't think you'd choose
somewhere right by my house...

55
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:51,152
Oh, what a relief...
that you're so simple.

56
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,488
Simple?

57
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:56,128
Ah, no, that's not it. By simple, I meant...

58
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:59,453
- Yeah?
- The weather's nice today.

59
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,719
- It sure is.
- The breeze feels amazing.

60
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,430
- Hmph.
- What is it?

61
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:07,628
Hm? Nothing.

62
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,226
- Such nice weather.
- What's with you?

63
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,807
- It's hard to walk like this.
- What's the big deal?

64
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,992
- Aah!
- Whoa, hey...

65
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:21,342
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

66
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:26,067
CPR? No, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

67
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:27,403
- What?
- I'm okay.

68
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,397
I'm okay.

69
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,791
- I'm okay, I'm okay!
- You're okay.

70
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:31,826
I'm okay...!

71
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,537
Hey. Hey, hey.

72
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:39,225
Hey, Hiro.

73
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:40,696
Let's play this.

74
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,836
No... I'm not really into games.

75
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,344
Huh?

76
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:48,516
Come on, just try it. Here.

77
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,785
- I told you, I'm good.
- Why not?

78
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,146
Just try it once. Come on.

79
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,661
- It's fine.
- Hey, Hiro.

80
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:57,622
- How about you try the gacha?
- Oh, give me a break.

81
00:06:57,647 --> 00:07:00,535
Why not? It'll be fun, see?

82
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,138
- Just play by yourself.
- But whyyy?

83
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:04,020
Things like this are fun
because we do them together.

84
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,770
- I can't.
- Just try it, it's fun.

85
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:08,903
Come on... Let me go.

86
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,489
- Ooh! What about that?
- Huh?

87
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,122
I wanna take that.

88
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,597
Hey, Hiro.

89
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,160
What?

90
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:30,714
It's just the two of us now, Hiro.

91
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,995
Hey, let's head back.

92
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,081
Let's hang out a little longer.

93
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:39,172
- Let me.
- Ah, hey, hey, hey...

94
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,133
- I'll do it!
- I've got it!

95
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:42,781
- Aah!
- Whoa!

96
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,149
Are you okay?

97
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,967
Aah!

98
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:48,559
- Oh no!
- We're gonna crash!

99
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,470
This way, this way... This way!

100
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,631
- Hurry! Paddle!
- Jeez!

101
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,105
We're gonna hit it! Watch out!

102
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,746
- Whoa, that was close!
- What? What are we about to hit?

103
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,534
- Phew... that was close.
- What was that? A fish?

104
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,409
- No, that was definitely the boss class.
- The boss?

105
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,651
- Is it good to eat?
- No...

106
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:12,995
- It's no good.
- What?

107
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:15,536
I'd love to try cooking it, though.

108
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:21,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa...!

109
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,954
Hey, Hiro!

110
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,602
Hold on. Whoa, whoa...

111
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,500
Hiro~!

112
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,336
Hiro!

113
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,321
Ah!

114
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,383
Whoa!

115
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,735
I'm being targeted...

116
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:48,906
- Hiro.
- I'm sure.

117
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:54,195
Whoa! Gotcha!

118
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,000
Alright, let's stretch.
Okay? Come on.

119
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,064
Here. Ready?

120
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:01,824
- Yeah.
- Aah!

121
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:03,613
Yeah, that's a good stretch.

122
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,144
Okay, next one.

123
00:09:05,316 --> 00:09:06,495
Okay, give me your back.

124
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,292
Ready? And...

125
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:11,597
- Mmm... Ah...
- Aah...

126
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:13,386
How's that?

127
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,080
Okay, next, we'll take your arm and...

128
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:16,683
Knock it off already!

129
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:19,683
What is wrong with you?

130
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,284
You're way too close! Too close!

131
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:24,894
You have no sense of personal space!

132
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,068
But we're dating, right?

133
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,521
Since we're dating, isn't this what couples do?
Get all touchy-feely?

134
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,498
Well, that's...

135
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:36,997
Am I wrong?

136
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,927
Is it different for you, Hiro?

137
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,188
Haaah...

138
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:22,539
Uh, well...

139
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:26,594
Then. I'm leaving.

140
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,492
Huh?

141
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,808
Why am I the one looking so unhappy?

142
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:26,819
Here you are.

143
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:28,537
Why you are here?

144
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,591
That's my line.

145
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:36,779
It really is great.

146
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:38,935
The view from up here.

147
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:40,880
Yeah.

148
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:46,005
Natsuo, today's your birthday, right?

149
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,668
How did you know that?

150
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:51,551
It was on your profile.

151
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:53,653
Oh... Right.

152
00:11:57,606 --> 00:12:00,419
If you had told me, I would have taken you anywhere.

153
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:04,176
Why didn't you say it was your birthday?

154
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,411
As long as I'm with you,
I don't care where we go.

155
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:12,473
Heh.

156
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:14,707
Let's go.

157
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,653
What?

158
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,606
Our date's back on.

159
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:22,035
What?

160
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,830
Whoa! This one's awesome!

161
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:45,181
Here. It would look great on you, too.

162
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:47,466
- Really?
- Yeah!

163
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,778
- What is this?
- It's images of watermelons. Look.

164
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,801
Three of them! Isn't it cute?

165
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,528
Huh? You don't like it?

166
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:54,692
C'mon, look.

167
00:12:57,122 --> 00:12:58,208
I dunno...

168
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,738
- I like this one better.
- No way, not that one.

169
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:02,770
- It's gotta be this one. See?
- Yeah!

170
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,652
- Seriously?
- This is it. I've decided.

171
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,238
- We'll get two of these.
- Two?

172
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,008
- We'll get matching ones.
- Matching?

173
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:10,956
Mhm.

174
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,996
- What?
- This is great.

175
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:14,043
Cheese!

176
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,798
- Great! How'd it turn out?
- Let's take a look!

177
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,782
- Oh, wow!
- This one's great.

178
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:20,685
This is great!

179
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:23,130
Whoa. Look at you, Hiro.
You're smiling so big.

180
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:24,025
- I love it.
- Yeah.

181
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:26,254
- Wait, is this blurry?
- Oh, you're right.

182
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,266
- Let's take it again.
- Okay.

183
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,582
- Okay, one more time... one more.
- Get more of the shirt in the shot.

184
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:32,074
- What, like this?
- Yeah.

185
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:32,826
Okay.

186
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:34,490
Ready? Cheese.

187
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,732
- Yes! This is perfect!
- Whoa, that's a great one!

188
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:40,615
- You're so handsome.
- Hehe.

189
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:45,240
- Thanks, Hiro.
- Yeah.

190
00:13:45,427 --> 00:13:47,470
Here, you should have the first bite, Hiro.

191
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,394
- Me?
- Mhm.

192
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,548
- You sure?
- Mhm.

193
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:53,039
- How's it?
- Amazing!

194
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:54,884
- Really?
- Try some.

195
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,110
Okay. Let's see!

196
00:13:57,345 --> 00:13:58,767
- Mmm...
- So?

197
00:13:58,792 --> 00:13:59,979
- Mmm!
- Told you, right?

198
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,721
Mhm!

199
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,721
- Mmm.
- They have other great options.

200
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:06,885
Ooh. You're right.

201
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:10,674
Excuse me, do you know how to get to the station?

202
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:13,369
Oh, for that, just go straight down this street...

203
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,908
and turn left. You can't miss it.

204
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:16,764
- Thank you.
- No problem. Take care.

205
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:17,963
Let's go, let's go.

206
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:20,064
- Hey, aren't their T-shirts the same?
- Huh?

207
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:21,652
- It looks weird, but kinda cute.
- Yeah, it is cute.

208
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,277
Huh? You think it's cute?

209
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:31,714
What? What are you so happy about?

210
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,651
Hm?

211
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:43,125
Man, that was fun.

212
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:45,782
- Hey.
- Yeah?

213
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,289
- Wanna go somewhere?
- Where? Did you forget something?

214
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:52,829
- Nope.
- Oh. What is it?

215
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,485
- Watch out.
- Whoa!

216
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,039
What the heck?

217
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:10,641
- It's the manager.
- So that's the manager.

218
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:12,875
Let's go say hi.

219
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,164
- Shhh!
- Oh...

220
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,148
Shhh!

221
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:22,779
Wait, we're closed today.
Why is she here?

222
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,639
Huh? It's your day off?

223
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:32,849
But look, her hair is all done up.

224
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:45,495
Alright.

225
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,727
Hey. Let's move.

226
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:06,259
Going for a date?

227
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,469
- Maybe go for a blind date?
- A blind date?

228
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,547
Man, that totally freaked me out.

229
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,797
So the manager's going for a blind date...

230
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:17,399
- Natsuo.
- Huh?

231
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:19,877
- Sit here.
- What?

232
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:23,236
- I'll give you a cut and a head spa.
- Why?

233
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:25,533
It's your birthday present.

234
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,736
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

235
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:33,220
Woo! Yes!

236
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:36,228
- You sure?
- Of course.

237
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,970
- Alright.
- I've been wanting to get my hair cut, actually.

238
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:40,275
- Excited?
- Yeah.

239
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:43,509
What should I get? I want to look cool.

240
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:46,345
- What should we do with it?
- Hmm.

241
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,657
Hey, just don't shave it all off, okay?

242
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,161
Don't move.

243
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,909
- On your back.
- Okay.

244
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:45,572
- You okay?
- Yeah.

245
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:49,173
I want to see your back.

246
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:50,846
- Can you scoot down a little?
- Sure.

247
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,889
- Okay.
- Yep.

248
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:54,533
Alright.

249
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,613
Okay.

250
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,957
This is going to be your best birthday ever.

251
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,759
Okay.

252
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:09,947
I'm so excited.

253
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,064
- This might be a little cold. Okay?
- Yeah.

254
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:21,585
- Yeah, it's perfect.
- Let me know if it's too hot.

255
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:22,620
Okay.

256
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,243
Alright! It's done.

257
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,091
Whoa! No way!

258
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:15,911
It looks great!

259
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:19,950
- Right?
- Yeah. It's awesome.

260
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:24,208
I look so much cooler now.

261
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:26,888
- Happy birthday.
- Huh?

262
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,957
I just realized... I hadn't said it yet.

263
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,644
- Happy birthday.
- Yeah.

264
00:20:40,277 --> 00:20:44,019
This might be the first time for me.

265
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,472
Having a birthday this amazing.

266
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:49,527
- You're exaggerating.
- No, I'm serious.

267
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,024
I'm not really used to people celebrating my birthday.

268
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:55,836
What?

269
00:20:56,664 --> 00:21:00,125
My parents have always been self-employed.

270
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:01,875
They run a metal processing factory.

271
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,297
- Yuki, let's go home!
- Coming!

272
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:06,266
They worked from morning till night, so...

273
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,688
I was always alone.

274
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:12,782
Even my meals were like this...

275
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,187
and nothing special ever happened, even on my birthday.

276
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,945
So I never really knew what it felt like to be celebrated.

277
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,211
That's kind of why I didn't say anything today.

278
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:30,554
But it feels really nice.

279
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,999
To have someone actually celebrate with me like this.

280
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:36,788
Thanks, Hiro.

281
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,053
- What else?
- Huh?

282
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,350
What else do you want?

283
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,404
We still have half a day left.

284
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,162
Thank you. You've already given me more than enough.

285
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:54,124
Come on, tell me!

286
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:57,046
Uhh...

287
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:01,366
Hmm... you know,
like a high-class sushi restaurant.

288
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,507
Or maybe a luxury watch?

289
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,053
Hmm...

290
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:09,272
In that case...

291
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:14,733
A kiss.

292
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:17,123
I want a kiss.

293
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:19,927
Whoa, that's...

294
00:23:20,013 --> 00:23:21,943
But you said I could ask for anything.

295
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:24,638
- Well, yeah, but...
- A man doesn't go back on his word, right?

296
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:25,983
That's a different case.

297
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:27,452
Hey. Are you going to run away again?

298
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:34,287
- Are you okay?
- Y-Yeah.

299
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,827
(Next Episode: The Way to Deal with Love Rival (Trauma))
It's not a dream.

300
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:36,679
No way. Oribe? Are you really Oribe?

301
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:39,858
We used to work together.
Did I never mention it?

302
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:42,992
- You had a thing for him?
- Why did you say so?

303
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:46,147
So he's your type, huh?

304
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:50,281
I just want it to be us.
Just Washizawa and me...

305
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,578
Natsuo, you better stay away from him.

306
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:58,867
- He's not like Hiro. He's weak.
- Huh?
