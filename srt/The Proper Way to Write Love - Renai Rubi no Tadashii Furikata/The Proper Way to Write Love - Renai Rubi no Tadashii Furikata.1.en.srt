1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:04,980
Shut the f*** up, Natsu!

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,250
Should've done this
from the start.

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:10,148
- Take it off!
- No! I don't want to!

4
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:11,883
Then why did I...?

5
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:13,813
Natsu... Natsuo! Stop it!

6
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,496
Take it off! Now!
Ah... ah...

7
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,489
- I said no!
- Natsuo!

8
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:19,071
- Stop it!
- Shut up!

9
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:20,207
No...!

10
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,575
Natsuo...!

11
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:33,348
This is it.

12
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,606
This is the face I wanted to see.

13
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,704
I've always wanted
to see this face...!

14
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:44,896
"The Proper Way To Write Love"

15
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,051
(Episode 1: The Way to Reunion (Revenge))

16
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,793
- How does it look?
- Um...

17
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:56,396
I think using BE14 light brown, blended
half-and half level 5 violet might be better.

18
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:59,452
How long should we leave it after applying the color?

19
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,554
Hmm... in five-minute intervals.

20
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,923
Oh, stagger it by five minutes. Got it.

21
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:04,600
Okay, got it.

22
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,561
- I think it'll turn out great.
- Oh, okay.

23
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,230
Hiro, new client consultation, please.

24
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,733
Okay. Let's get started.

25
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:17,403
- Just a moment, please.
- Next, perm and cut for the client.

26
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,912
- Okay, thanks.
- Yep.

27
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,044
- Hello.
- Hello.

28
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,360
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:27,880
I'm Hiro, your stylist.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,882
Nice to meet you.
I'll show you to your seat.

31
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,077
Oh, thanks.

32
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,057
- Please fill this out.
- Oh, okay.

33
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:49,839
- So, cut and perm for today, right?
- Yes.

34
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,378
How short would you like it?

35
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,773
- About a bob length.
- A bob.

36
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:55,718
Okay.

37
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,859
- About this length?
- Yes.

38
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:01,398
Hmm. Cute.

39
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,718
But maybe a little shorter would be nice.

40
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:09,388
- Oh, then please.
- Got it.

41
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:11,390
- Aoi!
- Yes!

42
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,920
- Take care of her.
- Yes.

43
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,631
- One moment, please.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:19,208
Thanks for waiting.

45
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,023
Your ends are a bit damaged,
so I'll cut them off.

46
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:59,259
Back in the day...

47
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:09,381
In a low-ranking country high school
where 80% of the students were delinquents...

48
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:13,727
I was one of the remaining 20%,
a background character.

49
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,155
Who do you think the culprit is?

50
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,485
Oh, I know who the culprit is.

51
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:20,159
- Did the latest issue come out?
- Yeah, it did.

52
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,364
I buy the weekly magazine.

53
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:22,630
Seriously?

54
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,599
The final boss is badass.

55
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,907
- What are you looking at?
- No, no. Anyway...

56
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,909
How much do I have to pay to get him to shut up?

57
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,719
Damn it...

58
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,148
Those f***ers
made this their hangout...

59
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,515
Hey.

60
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,263
- I don't have any.
- Huh?

61
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:01,911
Money.

62
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,403
What the hell are you talking about?

63
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,529
Hey...

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,440
You like flowers?

65
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,377
Huh? Uh, yeah...

66
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,372
You're strange.

67
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:19,607
Flowers... they respond to you...

68
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,893
If you put your heart into it.

69
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,892
Hmm.

70
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:31,791
Oh...

71
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,716
How do you read this?

72
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:38,888
Nangei Nyumon?

73
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,623
It's so hard.

74
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,018
Hana? Dan...

75
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,411
What the hell is this?

76
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,887
Oh, how do you read this?

77
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,389
And that was the beginning of my dark history.

78
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:58,991
What the hell is this?

79
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,731
Hey, Suzuki!

80
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:04,019
Go buy us some bread, bread!

81
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:06,398
- Cut it out.
- Go, you have 10 seconds!

82
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:11,737
Among the many delinquents,
I was targeted by the dumbest, the loudest...

83
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:14,242
Washizawa Natsuo...

84
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,910
- I'll give you my favorite.
- What? This?

85
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,712
Nah, it suits you.
Look, we’re a matching pair.

86
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:22,713
- Huh, matching...?
- Yeah, matching. Let's use the same one.

87
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:25,284
- No, it's fine. Really, it's fine.
- Just take it, it suits you, look!

88
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,286
- I don't really like orange.
- It's fine!

89
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,381
Just give this water, right?
Water. Heh heh.

90
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:32,724
Whoa, ah!

91
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:35,160
Oh... my bad.

92
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,756
Ugh...

93
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,946
It was a living hell of errands
and torment.

94
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:53,378
Then one day…

95
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:07,306
Ah... oh...

96
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,713
Sorry for calling you out here.

97
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:14,575
Uh... I...

98
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,209
I've got something important
to tell you...

99
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,720
Huh?

100
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:23,035
- Natsuo, you skipping too?
- Hey!

101
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,010
- Samejima.
- Come on...

102
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:27,193
Let's take a smoke break. Just one.

103
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:33,789
What a pain.
What are you doing here?

104
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,206
Suzuki.

105
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:42,955
Oh...

106
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:48,195
Huh? Natsuo,
did you need something from this guy?

107
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,527
No, no...

108
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,853
Suzuki just suddenly
called me out here.

109
00:07:58,322 --> 00:07:59,851
Up on this rooftop?

110
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,916
Yeah...

111
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:05,383
Is this, like, a confession?
Hahahaha...

112
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:08,534
Whoa! You've got some nerve!

113
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,890
For someone so 'lame' though.

114
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,494
Right?
Who buttons their shirt all the way to the top?

115
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,236
Button Prince!

116
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:19,658
So, what's the “point” of today's buttons?

117
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,928
Come on, say something!

118
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,901
- Seriously, now.
- Your glasses are so cute, too.

119
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:29,074
Whoa, hold on a minute.

120
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:32,467
- That's why I decided to change myself.
- Care to say a few words?

121
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:35,179
What's the “point” of the buttons?

122
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:37,456
That was pretty funny.

123
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:46,039
Defying my parents'
wishes and without telling a soul...

124
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:48,696
I enrolled in a beauty academy.

125
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:59,349
Perpendicular to the scalp.
Like this...

126
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:03,485
For two years, I desperately honed
my styling skills...

127
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,365
it's super important, so
when you curl it next time...

128
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,114
Don't worry too much about
the parts you already curled.

129
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,116
And not just parallel...

130
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:14,386
After completely reinventing myself…

131
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,388
- I've never dyed it before...
- Oh, it'll absolutely suit you!

132
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,390
Yeah…

133
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,017
I was finally transformed.

134
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:27,894
She’s fallen for him, isn’t she?

135
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,589
Definitely.

136
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,942
That's our number one stylist.

137
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,383
Just a moment, please.

138
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:50,054
Thank you very much.

139
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,062
Huh? Is this a place to get your hair cut?

140
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,532
Suzuki!

141
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,927
I texted you, so text me back!

142
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,262
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

143
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:34,098
- Just cleaning up.
- Cleaning up.

144
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:35,653
- Oh.
- Don't...

145
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:37,769
What?

146
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,272
- No, it's... it's nothing.
- Hey, this looks like an elephant.

147
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,274
- I'll draw a picture on it for you.
- No, that's not what it is...

148
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:46,323
Hello.

149
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,627
Nice to meet you.

150
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:51,725
Yo.

151
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,461
What?

152
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:00,992
- Did I make a mistake?
- Oh, then...

153
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,428
- I'll take your belongings.
- Oh, okay.

154
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:05,430
Okay.

155
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:13,891
Yeah, thanks.

156
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:17,719
- Please fill this out.
- Mmm…

157
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:21,100
Oh.

158
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:30,922
Washi... zawa... Na tsu o. Male.

159
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:32,502
Washizawa Natsuo...!

160
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:34,400
What?

161
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,596
Uh... no, no.

162
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,601
What kind of style are we aiming for today?

163
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,342
Ah, I want you to get rid
of everything.

164
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,772
- Huh?
- I mean, my hair...

165
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:50,363
Just cut it all off.
Nothing left, absolutely nothing.

166
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:52,908
“Nothing”...?
You mean, like, a total buzz cut?

167
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:54,078
Yeah, that's right.

168
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,875
I've been growing it out,
but everyone says it doesn't suit me at all.

169
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:01,020
Oh, that's not true at all!

170
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:02,772
It actually suits you quite well.

171
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,884
- Really?
- Yes.

172
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:13,163
Huh? Really?

173
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:16,434
In that case, how about a cut
and a treatment?

174
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:19,723
It looks like your ends
are a bit damaged.

175
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:22,156
Alright, I'll do that.
Go with that, please.

176
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:25,158
Okay.

177
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:47,431
Whoa! That looks great!

178
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:51,102
That's awesome!

179
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,938
- I'm so glad you like it.
- Yup.

180
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:57,623
Because "cutting with all his heart"
is Hiro-kun's motto.

181
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:03,821
Hmm. With all his heart, huh?

182
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:07,314
What’s wrong?
Oh... no.

183
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:10,361
Alright. Thanks.

184
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:14,592
Ah, what a shame.

185
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:18,596
If it weren't for that ridiculous T-shirt
and his idiotic chatter...

186
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:20,598
He'd be absolutely perfect.

187
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:22,600
Man, that was good.

188
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,770
- I can't believe he didn't notice at all.
- Huh?

189
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:39,892
I want to try the bread
from that shop.

190
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,713
- You haven't tried it?
- No.

191
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,276
- Have you?
- Me neither.

192
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:44,088
You haven't?

193
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,090
Hey there.

194
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,926
Excuse me, sir,
can I help you with something?

195
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:50,928
No. Ah...

196
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:53,789
Can I not come in here
unless I'm getting my hair done?

197
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:59,725
- Well, we do offer head spas.
- Then I'll have that.

198
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:03,607
- Asahi-san.
- Yes.

199
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,609
Please show him to his seat.

200
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,984
- Please come this way.
- Mmm.

201
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:14,132
Huh? That customer
was here yesterday too, right?

202
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,347
Why two days in a row...?

203
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:22,425
Ugh.

204
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,459
Yo.

205
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:36,506
- You’ve worked hard.
- Again?

206
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,412
Um... you're Hiro-san, right?

207
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,526
Yes. I'm Hiro.

208
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:48,801
There's something I gotta ask you.

209
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:53,154
Oh...

210
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,060
- You got a girlfriend?
- Huh?

211
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,843
No... I said, do you have a girlfriend?

212
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:05,088
- Not right now, no.
- Seriously?

213
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,287
Then date me!

214
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,610
- Gay?
- Well...

215
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,612
I'm not sure if I am.

216
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:19,703
It was...
like love at first sight, I think.

217
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:23,152
So, just try dating me. Please?

218
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:25,923
Are you messing with me?

219
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:28,163
- If so...
- I'm not f***ing messing with you!

220
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:42,790
Were you waiting? For my shift to end?

221
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:44,888
Uh-huh...

222
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:57,036
Alright.

223
00:15:58,589 --> 00:15:59,759
Seriously?

224
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:02,705
Dead serious.

225
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:05,886
I don't really know much about you, but...

226
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,419
It's fine.
I'll definitely make you fall for me.

227
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:11,435
Hell yeah!

228
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:14,227
It's revenge. For high school.

229
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:18,434
I'll date him for a bit and then dump him hard.

230
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:22,446
Go ahead and enjoy your false hope, you f***ing moron.

231
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,667
Hiro... Hiro...

232
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:38,747
Hiro... Hi! Ro!

233
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:43,934
Why the hell are you here?!

234
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,504
Well, you told me where you live yesterday.

235
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:49,668
No, I mean, how did you get inside?

236
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,815
Hm, cause the front door was open.

237
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:55,907
I made breakfast. Let's eat.

238
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,259
- What's this?
- Braised snapper head.

239
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:12,294
Crazy, right?
I prepped fish early in the morning.

240
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:16,078
- Huh?
- Eat, eat!

241
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:19,582
Come on, hurry.

242
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:31,004
How is it?

243
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:37,712
Yeah... it's good.

244
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:38,806
Really?

245
00:17:39,756 --> 00:17:41,384
That's great!

246
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:45,327
Eat more.

247
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,765
I'll eat... I'll eat. Yeah.

248
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:49,925
Hey, hey.

249
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:51,845
Hey!

250
00:17:53,937 --> 00:17:55,939
It's good... I said it's good.

251
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,941
- No, I mean, what time do you go to work?
- Oh...

252
00:17:57,941 --> 00:18:01,170
- Uh... nine.
- Nine, huh?

253
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:02,990
Oh, then we still have time.

254
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,389
Oh, when you're done eating that,
come with me for a bit.

255
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:08,084
I'll show you a great spot.

256
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,641
- Huh?
- I’m digging in.

257
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:11,550
Mmm.

258
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,538
Mmm. Delicious.

259
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:22,565
What's wrong?

260
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,688
Hurry. This way.

261
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,123
Whoa. Come on, hurry!

262
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:42,267
This is the construction site
I’ve been working at recently.

263
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,922
Wow... that's incredible.

264
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:48,785
Right?
I wanted to show you, Hiro.

265
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:52,817
What do you do for work?

266
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:55,239
Me? Oh, I'm a scaffolder.

267
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,767
That snapper from earlier,
I got it from my boss.

268
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:00,842
Oh~ I just assumed you liked fish.

269
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:04,441
No. How about you, Hiro?
What do you like?

270
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:07,410
- Me?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,378
Hot pot, maybe?

272
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:14,284
Hmm, I see. Haha.
Oh, right.

273
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:16,586
There's one more thing I want to show you.
Let's go.

274
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:18,755
- No, it's fine. I don't have time.
- It's right there.

275
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,571
- I said it's fine.
- Just come with me.

276
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,124
I said no!

277
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:27,436
Sorry. I really don't have time...

278
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,171
Oh, okay...

279
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,015
Ugh...

280
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:48,595
Why did I get myself into this mess...?

281
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,669
What's wrong?

282
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,325
Nothing.

283
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:15,844
Why are you here again?

284
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,891
Hm? Cause the door was also open today.

285
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,234
Hey... Hiro!

286
00:20:34,477 --> 00:20:37,742
- Here, spread this out.
- What is it?

287
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,269
Hehe. Ta-da!

288
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:44,001
Natsuo-chan's special breakfast kimchi hot pot!

289
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:51,233
Hot pot for breakfast...
What the hell were you thinking?

290
00:20:51,781 --> 00:20:53,207
But you said you liked it, didn't you?

291
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:55,061
- Huh?
- Hot pot.

292
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:58,675
Oh, right...

293
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,818
- Let’s dig in!
- What happened to your hand?

294
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:14,106
Oh... no, it's nothing.

295
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:16,182
It doesn’t look like “nothing”…

296
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:21,110
The truth is... it's my first time cooking.

297
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:25,368
- Huh...
- My parents never really cooked for me, either.

298
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:28,284
So I don't really know what I'm doing, but...

299
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:30,545
But I wanted to make you happy, Hiro.

300
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,429
I’m digging in.

301
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:59,266
- How is it?
- Mhm.

302
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:02,503
- It's good!
- Really?

303
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,406
- Yeah.
- You sure?

304
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,121
Yeah.

305
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,999
- Seriously?
- I'm telling you!

306
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:10,244
It's better than yesterday, that's for sure.

307
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:13,480
Yes!

308
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:17,933
That's great! Here, have some more.

309
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,756
- You've gotta get your nutrients.
- Yeah.

310
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:20,981
Here.

311
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:23,424
- That's a lot, isn't it?
- It's fine. Oh, my bad.

312
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:27,357
Looks like I spilled a bunch...

313
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:29,332
Can I finish all this?

314
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,022
Oh... not this one, this.

315
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:37,970
Mhm, it's delicious.

316
00:22:37,995 --> 00:22:40,289
Mhm, really good!

317
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:43,461
Think about the portion size a little.

318
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:02,532
Heh.

319
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:04,183
Wow.

320
00:23:06,404 --> 00:23:08,424
Heh...

321
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,315
That's incredible!

322
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:15,839
Wow.

323
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:28,891
Beautiful.

324
00:23:52,628 --> 00:23:55,169
Wait... a Pachira.

325
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,718
Ivy.

326
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,381
It's a Sansevieria!

327
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:08,560
Nemophila... and Allium too.

328
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:10,602
Oh wow.

329
00:25:28,537 --> 00:25:30,736
(Next Episode: The Way to Revenge (Date)
- Wanna go on a date tomorrow? - Huh?

330
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:34,129
Why the hell would I go on a date with you?

331
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:37,488
Alright, fine.
Alright. I'll make it the best date ever.

332
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:40,268
I've been keeping it under wraps for ages, you know.

333
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:45,440
"Under wraps"?
Wait, why is Hiro so good with plants?

334
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,790
It's fine.
You can count on me.

335
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,178
Yes.

336
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:52,180
The furigana are written in.

337
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,449
- Did Suzuki do this?
- There's a person who taught me...

338
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:57,273
- how to read kanji.
- Huh?
