1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,370
Come to think of it, his name's almost the same as Hiro's.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,040
And the way he loves gardening...
They're so alike...

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,920
Wait...

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,830
Don't tell me... Hiro is Suzuki Hiromu?

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,160
Of course not.
Don't compare me to a guy like that.

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,330
You're right. You two are nothing alike.

7
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,110
Sorry, my bad.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,950
- Hey.
- Yeah?

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,780
- Was he really your first love?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,480
Suzuki!
Go buy us some bread!

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,650
Hurry! You've got ten seconds, go!

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,350
Here! Let me give you a face massage.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,130
Suzuki, your style is so lame.

14
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,390
Look, I'll give you my favorite.

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,230
- No, thanks.
- Don't be shy.

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,130
See? Now we have matching ones.

17
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,970
- Huh? Matching...?
- It's cute, isn't it?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,140
- Wear it to school tomorrow, okay?
- What?

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,880
You just have to water it, right?

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,920
Ah! Ah!
- Ha...!

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,530
Oh... Sorry, Suzuki.

22
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,320
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,730
To get closer to him,
I tried my best to strike up conversations.

24
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,200
Then one time, when I planned to confess,
I asked him to meet me on the rooftop.

25
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,110
Um... listen, I...

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,840
I have something important to tell you...

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,310
Huh?

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,490
- Natsuo, skipping class?
- Hey!

29
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,810
Samejima.

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,950
Suzuki.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,280
Huh? Natsuo,
you needed him for something?

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,090
No... it's not like that...

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,060
- Hey!
- Ah...

34
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,520
Wait up!

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,320
He's a pretty interesting guy.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,190
Yeah...

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,860
But then our classmates showed up
and ruined everything.

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,490
I couldn't just
confess in front of everyone, you know?

39
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,770
- Confess your feelings?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,010
C-Confess your feelings?

41
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,500
Yeah.

42
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,410
Confess your feelings?

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,930
I said yeah.

44
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,870
Confess...

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,430
Huh...? Hiro?

46
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,850
Confess...

47
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,220
Are you okay?

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,930
What's wrong? What is it?

49
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,820
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

50
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,580
Alright, thank you.

51
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,520
It's a little chilly,

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,450
but that was amazing, as always!

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,360
Hiro-kun,
can you take one more picture?

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,960
I want to post it on social media.

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,120
- Oh... uh, sure.
- Hiro-kun.

56
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,680
Okay, say confess.

57
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,050
Thanks.

58
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,530
Confess...

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,710
- Huh?
- Confess...

60
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,380
Hiro-kun...?

61
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,380
Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow
at 2:00 PM.

62
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,270
Right... confess.

63
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,760
Huh, wait... hold on... "Confess?"
Huh? What do you mean?

64
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,560
Hello?
I'll take that.

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,650
- Sorry about that.
- They already hung up...

66
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,840
- Oh...
- Thank you.

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,070
- Mr. Ueda, thank you for waiting.
- Right.

68
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,360
- How are we feeling?
- Ahh, that's so relaxing.

69
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,810
- Please head over to the confession.
- The confession?

70
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,020
Huh? Did I just say "confess"?
Who...? Me? What? Who said that?

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,220
Geez, what is wrong with you?

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,620
You're acting a little weird today, aren't you?

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,300
Sorry... A lot's on my mind.

74
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,750
Then go rest in the back.
I'll handle this with Kiryu and Asahi.

75
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,840
No, no, I'm fine, really.
I'll do it.

76
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,920
- Ow, that hurts...!
- Wait... Hiro-kun?

77
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,240
Oh no, I really messed up...

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,690
- Ah...
- Are you okay?

79
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,480
"The Proper Way to Write Love"

80
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,510
(Episode 6: The Way to Hide a Wound (and Your Feelings))
What!? An injury?

81
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,200
Yeah, I just left the doctor's office and I'm heading home.

82
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,230
Are you okay?

83
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,000
It's nothing serious.

84
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,530
The doctor said it'll get better soon as long as I rest.

85
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,530
I see.

86
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,310
Yeah...

87
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,200
Agh...

88
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,480
Damn it...

89
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,970
Ugh...

90
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,870
Oh, Hiro.

91
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,920
Are you okay?

92
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,950
Yeah, I'm fine.

93
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,150
But you're all bandaged up.

94
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,580
Oh, no, it's fine.
Hiro, you just sit and rest.

95
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,830
- It's okay, really.
- No, please, just relax.

96
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,110
Um, is there something I can use to wipe this?

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,300
- Oh, yeah... under the sink...
- Under the sink...

98
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,530
on the second shelf.

99
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,410
Second shelf... ah.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,970
- This one?
- Oh, yeah.

101
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,010
Okay.

102
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,460
Want some coffee?

103
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,980
Oof... oof...

104
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,950
I'll just move this out of the way, okay?

105
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,150
Oof.

106
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,030
- Anything else?
- Um...

107
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,620
Anything else I need to do.

108
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,500
Oh... In that case...

109
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,390
Could you go do some shopping for me?

110
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,860
Oh, shopping. Got it.

111
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,620
- Get in touch with me later.
- Okay.

112
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,930
You get some rest.

113
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm heading out.

114
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,400
I'm home.

115
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,070
Oh, you're back.

116
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,700
- You're late.
- Yeah.

117
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,660
I also picked up some things
I thought you might need.

118
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,910
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

119
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,920
Hey, this is nice.

120
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,210
The feeling of someone waiting for me.

121
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,980
I haven't really experienced this before.

122
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,380
Whoa, this is amazing.

123
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,550
Ooh...

124
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,210
- There.
- Thanks.

125
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,970
Mm.

126
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,020
I wonder how it tastes.

127
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,520
You're right.
This way, I can even eat with my left hand.

128
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,860
- Right?
- Yeah.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,890
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

130
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,550
- Mmm, delicious!
- Right?

131
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,920
- Having skewers at home is great, isn't it?
- Mmm.

132
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,910
That was really nice.

133
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,190
What you said earlier.

134
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,500
Here.

135
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,830
Hm?

136
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,610
Oh, it's nothing...

137
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,840
Mmm, this is good.

138
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,430
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,050
- Here.
- Whoa.

140
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,530
Ahh!

141
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,830
Mmm, delicious. This is great.

142
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,720
- It's nice to eat with someone.
- Did I buy too much?

143
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,080
Are you serious?
Can I? Can I stay over?

144
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Yeah, it's already late.

145
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,880
- Thanks!
- Hey.

146
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,390
- Scoot over!
- Uh... okay.

147
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,320
- Listen up. This is the dividing line.
- Okay.

148
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,880
You are absolutely not to cross it.

149
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,050
Also, you face that way when you sleep.

150
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,460
- Hurry up.
- Yeah, I know...

151
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,490
- You're over the line!
- This is so cramped.

152
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,830
- I'm about to fall off.
- Move over a little more...

153
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,470
Jeez...

154
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,030
It's nice, having someone next to me.

155
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,570
Huh?

156
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,230
It's strangely comforting.

157
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
(No. 118567 Washizawa Natsuo)

158
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,420
- Heh. Did something happen?
- Huh?

159
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,680
It's just that you seem different lately.

160
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,220
- Do I?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,320
You used to feel more artificial,
flawless, I guess you could say.

162
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,910
Now you seem more human.

163
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,950
You make mistakes, you get carried away.

164
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,400
It's almost like you're in love.

165
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,610
In love? No, no, no... How could I be in love...

166
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,430
Wouldn't that be a good thing for your work, too?

167
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm telling you,
I'm not in love with anyone.

168
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,080
Okay, okay, okay...

169
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,970
How are you feeling?
Is there anything else I can help with today?

170
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,610
Hiro! Wake up!

171
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,290
It's already seven.

172
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,760
Hey, come on, get up.

173
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,590
Mmm, what is it?
Ow, ow, ow...

174
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
I said it's already seven.

175
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,170
Hey, Hiro.

176
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,370
Here, open your mouth.

177
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,760
How is it?

178
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,560
- Mmph...
- Hiro...

179
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,830
Hey... Are you okay?

180
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,670
Wait... Huh? Huh? Huh?

181
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,540
Hey, Hiro.

182
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,450
Is it good?

183
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,220
- Mmph...
- Huh?

184
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,110
- Hiro.
- Hm?

185
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,240
Which one do you want?

186
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,600
Ah, this one.

187
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,740
- Oh, this one?
- Yeah.

188
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,550
Ahh, no, it's fine. I'll feed you.

189
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,160
- I can eat it myself.
- Okay, okay.

190
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,710
Ahh...

191
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,230
- Is it good?
- Delicious!

192
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,400
- Which one should I have, then?
- You want some?

193
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,130
Yeah.

194
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,180
- Which one do you want?
- Hmm, the white one.

195
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,660
Okay.

196
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,360
Hey!

197
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,050
- There was only one white chocolate!
- Ah, sorry.

198
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,190
So this is what he wears...

199
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,000
Natsuo, what are you doing...

200
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,650
- You're holding my underwear!
- Huh?

201
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,800
- Put it back!
- What's the big deal?

202
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,830
- And you're going through my... That's mine, too!
- Oh, you're so annoying.

203
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,300
You're being so loud! That's enough!

204
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,600
All right, all right.
You're the injured one, after all.

205
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,070
Just leave it to me.

206
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,120
- Is that all? Anything else?
- Uh, is there more?

207
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,720
That's it.
Didn't you buy too much underwear?

208
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,230
Ah!

209
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,110
Hiro!

210
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,900
Wait for me!

211
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,900
Hiro.

212
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,980
Hah!

213
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,820
Hey, Hiro!

214
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,370
Come on, get down here!

215
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,390
Hey, Hiro!
I said get down here.

216
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,550
Hiro!

217
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,060
Hey, can you hear me? Hiro.

218
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,830
Hiro!

219
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,850
Come on, get down here.

220
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,910
Natsuo's bike is pretty cool, huh?

221
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,790
Hiro.

222
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,410
- Hiro!
- Huh?

223
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
A flower...

224
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,740
Whoa...!

225
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,610
- This is amazing.
- Yeah.

226
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,880
- It's so beautiful.
- I'm glad.

227
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,880
If it starts to hurt, you have to tell me.

228
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,740
Oh, okay...

229
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,310
Ah...

230
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,080
Um...

231
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,030
Mr. Suzuki, this is fine now.
You don't need to wrap it anymore.

232
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,530
Try moving it a little.

233
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,570
- No, a little more forcefully.
- More forcefully?

234
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,060
No problem. Treatment's over.

235
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,030
No problem.

236
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,420
I'm home!

237
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,220
Hiro! I brought back some beer.

238
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,930
Huh?

239
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,400
You're here.

240
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,030
- What the heck, so you were here, Hiro.
- Oh, you're back.

241
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,840
I'm back.

242
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,160
So, what did the doctor say? How is it?

243
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,900
It went well... Real well.

244
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,990
I see.

245
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,690
That's great!

246
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,560
Oh, right. I bought some beer.

247
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,420
- Want some?
- Let's drink.

248
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,370
I got four cans today.

249
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,740
- Isn't that a bit much?
- Yeah, let's go.

250
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,390
This is pretty funny.

251
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,710
- Huh...?
- Ah...

252
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,140
- Hey, what's wrong?
- It's nothing, it's nothing.

253
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,700
- Haha, this is fun.
- What is this? I've never seen one before.

254
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,390
- Does it hurt?
- Oh, not at all.

255
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,280
What is this thing?

256
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,990
- This is really something.
- Yeah. Heh.

257
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,430
- It hurts...
- Natsuo!

258
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,250
Yes.

259
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,170
Don't just stand there daydreaming!
That's dangerous!

260
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,020
- Sorry, boss.
- Seriously.

261
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,050
- Hey.
- Oh, can I?

262
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,960
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

263
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,710
Ugh.

264
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,520
You remember Kaburagi who used to work here?

265
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,060
Oh, yeah.

266
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,550
- The guy broke a bone and needed surgery.
- Huh?

267
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,860
He thought it was just his pinky, nothing to worry about.

268
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,590
Turned out to be a nasty break. I heard they put two metal plates in.

269
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,140
So you need to be careful too.

270
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,740
Right.

271
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,810
- Metal...
- That's right, metal.

272
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,480
But I don't know how they put them in.

273
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,810
Wait... Wouldn't that hurt a lot?

274
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,720
Of course it hurts, you idiot. It's metal.

275
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,730
It can't be...

276
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,280
It should be fine, right...?

277
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,490
Huh...?

278
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,770
- I'm back. You're home early.
- Yeah.

279
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,100
- I used the spare key.
- Okay.

280
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,690
Are you going shopping? If not, do you want to...

281
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,140
Aren't you all better now?

282
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,940
I was worried about you, so I stopped by the shop today.

283
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,020
You've been looking so down lately.
I was concerned, so I went to the shop.

284
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,960
Hey, why did you lie?

285
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,490
I didn't... intentionally lie...

286
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,360
Then you could have just told me you were better, couldn't you?

287
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,940
You made me worry.

288
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,030
If I had told you...

289
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,250
If I had told you,

290
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,830
you would have gone back, right?

291
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,570
Huh?

292
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,530
I don't want that.

293
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,570
I don't want you to go back...

294
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,790
Why?

295
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,870
You ask me why... How should I know?
I just don't, that's all.

296
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,150
Hiro...!

297
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,180
I'm so glad.

298
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,250
I'm so glad...

299
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,570
Huh?

300
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,350
I'm so glad... Hiro.

301
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,100
I'm so glad, Hiro...

302
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,690
Who falls asleep at a time like this?

303
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,200
Don't tell me...

304
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,300
You haven't been sleeping well lately, have you?

305
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,130
Natsuo...

306
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,130
I... about you...

307
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,320
(Next time on: The Way to Deal with Your Past (The Nightmare).)
Ta-da! Washizawa Natsuo scores a spare key!

308
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,610
Come over whenever you want to see me.

309
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,460
- You can even come by today.
- Today?

310
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,510
Don't tell me...
the person Hiro-kun likes is...?

311
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,240
- I'm going to a class reunion this Sunday.
- What?

312
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,420
- What for?
- There's someone I want to see.

313
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,330
Who even goes to those things?

314
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,520
Don't tell me... it's Suzuki?
