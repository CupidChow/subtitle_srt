=Dear Enemy=

2
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,800
Director,

3
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,111
I'll leave the room to you.

4
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,880
Okay, go on.

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,840
("After Love" Casting Office)

6
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:00,555
Zhong,

7
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,080
your look, presence, and overall vibe

8
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,310
fit this role perfectly.

9
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,920
We're aiming

10
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,200
to get this project nominated
in Cannes, Venice,

11
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,760
and maybe even the Oscars.

12
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,800
Let's do a reading.

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,870
If your performance holds up,

14
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,480
the role is yours.

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,670
Thank you, sir.

16
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,196
You have five minutes

17
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:28,033
to prepare.

18
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,110
I'll set up the camera.

19
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,110
Got it.

20
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,200
Zhong,

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,550
can you undo your top button?

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,550
You've read the script, right?

23
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,920
You've got the look and figure.

24
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,830
That's what this character needs.

25
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,390
You have to show your charm, you know?

26
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,920
Actually, you could open two buttons.

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,320
And

28
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,830
turn the collar out

29
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,430
a little.

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,870
You've got a great figure.

31
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,040
You should show them off.

32
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
And in the dancing part,

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,960
give it some heat, you know?

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,640
Make it seductive and sensual.

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,480
And if you're feeling it,

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,040
you can even dance on the couch.

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,320
Just go with the feeling.
Dance however you feel like it.

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,480
I'll play some music

39
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,710
to help you get in the mood.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
Sir, I quit.

41
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,430
I won't waste your time anymore.

42
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,270
You want to chase Cannes

43
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,200
and Venice?

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,360
Go do it yourself. I'm out.

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,640
What do you mean?

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,200
I've got everything set up.

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,733
We're rolling and you're walking out?

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,870
Zhong,

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,066
think about what you're doing.

50
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:32,200
You're throwing your future away.

51
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,390
Get lost.

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,150
I'm surpassing you.

53
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,990
You're not.

54
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,240
I'm faster than you.

55
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,430
Mommy!

56
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,480
Wait up!

57
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,240
Okay, Tiao.

58
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,080
Ten more minutes,
and we're going home, okay?

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,550
Okay!

60
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,110
Spinny ride, let's go!

61
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,960
Follow me!

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,640
All aboard the train!

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,430
Tiao!

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
Tiao, are you okay?

65
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,200
Tiao!

66
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,760
Is the one
sitting behind us on the left...

67
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,577
Not so loud.

68
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,350
Is he the top-tier star in recent years?

69
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,320
You still care about me, don't you?

70
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,150
No, I don't.

71
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,150
I just wanted to see

72
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,520
how beautiful this woman is.

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,390
Totally don't care.

74
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,790
Okay?

(Gradually Becoming Enemies)

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
Hello, Director Sun.

77
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,200
Sure, no problem.

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,120
I'll be right over.

79
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
Director Sun,

80
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,390
may I know

81
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,390
what type of role this is?

82
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Yes, absolutely.

83
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,520
Okay, I'll see you soon.

84
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,390
Okay, bye.

(Return Call)

87
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,270
Ms. Luo Man,

88
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,080
want to join us

89
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,320
at the beer house next door?

90
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,390
The crew booked
the whole place for a wrap party.

91
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,422
Thanks but I...

92
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,680
You have to rush home?

93
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,760
I'll pass this time.

94
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,000
Tell Jiang

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,320
I'll buy him drinks another day.

96
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,080
Okay.

97
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,750
Do you really need to rush home now?

98
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,710
What about you?

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,710
You're not?

100
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,440
I've got time.

101
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,910
You actually look

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,680
like a professional screenwriter today.

103
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
How about grabbing a bite later?

104
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,760
What do you think of the film?

105
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:03,111
I noticed you sat perfectly
still the whole time.

106
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:04,270
You looked super focused.

107
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,000
Why were you watching me?

108
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,910
Would you prefer I didn't?

109
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,790
Hello, Xi.

110
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,470
What's wrong?

111
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,680
Don't cry.

112
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,760
What happened to Tiao?

113
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,640
Tiao is injured.

114
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,830
I'm coming.

115
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,280
Here you are.

116
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,040
What's wrong?

117
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,750
Luo Man, I'm so scared.

118
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,590
Hey, it's okay.

119
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,800
This is nothing.

120
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
These little accidents

121
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,044
happen to kids all the time.

122
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,990
Stop crying now.

123
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,710
I know a fracture is not
the end of the world,

124
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,911
but Chen Mian will put this on me.

125
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,470
Xi, what did you say?

126
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,911
Your voice is breaking up a little.

127
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,510
He'll say,

128
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,040
"With so many people around,

129
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,933
you couldn't even
watch a child properly."

130
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,733
He'll blame me. I know it.

131
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,960
It's okay.

132
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,440
Stop crying now.

133
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,470
Wipe those tears.

134
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,470
I'm almost there.

135
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,350
We'll figure this out together.

136
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,960
Stay calm.

137
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,630
How much longer?

138
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:34,680
About five more kilometers.
We're almost there.

139
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,920
Sorry for

140
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,560
troubling you at this late hour.

141
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,200
It's no trouble.

142
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,750
Roads are clear at this hour.

143
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,222
Feels more like a late-night drive.

144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,870
That friend of yours...

145
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,750
She's your college roommate, right?

146
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,280
I remember you mentioned

147
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,040
she got married right after graduating.

148
00:10:00,222 --> 00:10:01,844
Her husband runs a business, right?

149
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,870
I heard it's doing pretty well.

150
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,510
With this kind of background,

151
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,470
why didn't they just pay more

152
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,200
and go to a better
private hospital nearby?

153
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
Why run all the way to the airport?

154
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,990
Maybe

155
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,377
it's just more convenient.

156
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,470
They have relatives
working at that hospital.

157
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,230
It's close by too.

158
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,200
It's convenient.

159
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,066
Her husband is pretty impressive.

160
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,960
So your friend's a full-time mom then?

161
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,590
Yes.

162
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,750
I see.

163
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Full-time mom, huh?

164
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,160
Yet she still let

165
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,350
her kid break a bone?

166
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,710
Have you ever babysat?

167
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,560
No.

168
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,200
Then maybe keep
the parenting critiques to yourself.

169
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,440
Sorry.

170
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,710
I just don't like people talking

171
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,710
that way about my friend.

172
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,200
You're right. My bad.

173
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,280
I was out of line.

174
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,470
Look,

175
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,040
that petite,

176
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,870
soft-spoken

177
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,870
woman

178
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,590
runs an entire household

179
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,200
on her own.

180
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,590
She raises that kid,

181
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,920
while her husband barely lifts a finger.

182
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,320
She has to do everything herself.

183
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
And her little boy

184
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,280
is smart, kind, athletic,
and well-rounded.

185
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,355
Absolutely an adorable kid.

186
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,750
Besides,

187
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,080
active boys always climb and jump,

188
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,866
so tripping and falling are normal.

189
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,400
Fractures happen.

190
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,560
Yes.

191
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,870
It doesn't mean she failed...

192
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,510
Yes, you're totally right.

193
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,710
Kids get bumps and bruises.

194
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,110
When I was a kid,

195
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:38,190
I loved basketball so much.

196
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,160
I also fell and broke my arm.

197
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,960
Still can't fully straighten it now.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,933
Just focus on the road.

199
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:43,630
Okay.

200
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,520
(Emergency Department)

201
00:11:57,577 --> 00:11:58,870
You don't have to wait for me.

202
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:00,400
I'm staying over at Xi's tonight.

203
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,110
Luo Man.

204
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,870
Do you want to go to Mexico?

205
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Mexico?

206
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:09,870
You don't remember?

207
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,630
I do.

208
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,990
Are you saying you want
to take me to Mexico?

209
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,080
It's a lot more costly now
than it was back then.

210
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,750
We're talking tens
of thousands at least.

211
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,440
What's with the sudden generosity?

212
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,510
I was immature back then.

213
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,160
I let go of the most important person,

214
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:32,244
and missed out on something
that really mattered.

215
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:34,080
It took me until now to finally get it.

216
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,800
Wu Hao,

217
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,160
don't you think

218
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,750
it's a little late for all this?

219
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,470
I should go find Xi.

220
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,377
She's waiting for me.

221
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,710
Luo Man.

222
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,160
You don't have to answer me now.

223
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,710
Just consider it.

224
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,350
It doesn't have to be Mexico.

225
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,830
Name any place.

226
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,400
Tell me where and I'll book the tickets.

227
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,733
We'll leave whenever you're ready.

228
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,590
Yes.

229
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,710
The diagnostics area?

230
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,440
To the right after the entrance?

231
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,160
I'll be there in a minute.

232
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,630
Don't worry.

233
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,990
I'm so sorry.

234
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,560
Sorry.

235
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,160
Sorry.

236
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,040
I'm in a bit of a rush.

237
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,680
Sorry.

238
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,350
Yes?

239
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,280
Everyone in the ER is in a rush.

240
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,110
Look,

241
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
I picked up your stuff

242
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,990
and apologized.

243
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
What else do you want,
kneel and bow to you?

244
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,510
Sorry, okay?

245
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,230
What do you want?

246
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Watch where you're going.

247
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,422
You almost ran into someone again.

248
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:53,090
(Practice civility.
Care for the elderly.)

249
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,960
Young people these days

250
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,560
are so hot-tempered.

251
00:13:58,644 --> 00:14:00,250
(Practice civility.
Care for the elderly.)

252
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,560
Xi.

253
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,040
It's okay. I'm here now.

254
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,990
Let's get home first.

255
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,920
Hi, Tiao.

256
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,560
You got a cast on.

257
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,590
Does it hurt?

258
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,750
A little bit.

259
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,110
I'm sleepy.

260
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,990
Sleepy, huh?

261
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,590
My brave little man.

262
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,110
Let's get you home to bed, okay?

263
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,110
Okay.

264
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,960
We can't go yet.

265
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,190
Fang Chi is picking up the meds.

266
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,244
Fang Chi? Who's that?

267
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,750
Chen Mian's brainy cousin.

268
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,960
He's working on his PhD,

269
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,333
doing his medical residency here.

270
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,990
Fang Chi.

271
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,440
(What are the odds!)

272
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,870
Here's the receipt

273
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,320
and the medical records.

274
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
Everything's in the system,

275
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,750
but just in case,

276
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,560
bring these along for the follow-ups.

277
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,110
Got it.

278
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
There's also a course
of oral antibiotics.

279
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,400
Thank you.

280
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:57,750
Tiao,

281
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,560
no more jumping around for now, okay?

282
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,350
When you play with your friends,

283
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,320
be careful

284
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,510
not to bump your arm.

285
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,920
You heard Mr. Fang, right?

286
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,230
Good boy.

287
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,560
After you remove the cast,

288
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,466
how about I take you
to the amusement park?

289
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,110
Mom,

290
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,870
can I bring Wang Zihan too?

291
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,320
He's the one who knocked you over.

292
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,560
And you still want to take him?

293
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,080
He said sorry.

294
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,320
We're best friends.

295
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,990
You're so sweet.

296
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,320
Fang Chi, thank you again
for everything.

297
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,510
Oh right, I forgot to introduce you.

298
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:33,830
This...

299
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,230
This...

300
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,040
This is my best friend, Luo Man.

301
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,160
She's a brilliant screenwriter.

302
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:42,560
Oh no, I'm flattered.

303
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:43,920
Nothing compared to a doctor.

304
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,911
Your precision standards

305
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,800
don't allow any mistakes.

306
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:48,444
That's more impressive.

307
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Children are better.

308
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,160
At least they remember their manners.

309
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:55,800
We should get going.

310
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,960
He's getting sleepy.

311
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:58,750
Come on.

312
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,350
We're off then, Fang Chi.

313
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,350
Out with it.

314
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,755
What really happened today
that freaked you out like this?

315
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,790
This afternoon, Tiao said
he wanted to ride his scooter.

316
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,680
The maid was cooking,

317
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,510
so I took him out to the park myself.

318
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,230
I swear, I just looked down for a second

319
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,160
to reply to a message.

320
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,160
When I looked up,

321
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,400
he was gone.

322
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,790
Then some kid

323
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,030
came flying down the hill on a scooter

324
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,360
and plowed right into him.

325
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,160
That's it?

326
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,600
Then

327
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,790
just make something up.

328
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,600
Say he insisted on riding

329
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,920
when you weren't looking

330
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,310
and he took a fall.

331
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,160
Problem solved.

332
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:37,920
That won't work.

333
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,400
Tiao's English tutor
saw the whole thing.

334
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,920
Of all times,

335
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,070
she arrived early for his lesson.

336
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,920
A tutor?

337
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,960
Just tell her to keep quiet.

338
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,160
Give her some gifts.

339
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:55,177
You're turning a playground accident

340
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:56,920
into some palace drama.

341
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,750
You're overthinking this.

342
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
It won't work.

343
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,270
She

344
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:12,977
and Chen Mian might be...

345
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,230
I'm not sure.

346
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,790
But I need to come up
with an explanation

347
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,133
before Chen Mian gets home.

348
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,710
I don't trust

349
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,960
that tutor.

350
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,270
You're saying Chen Mian
and the tutor...

351
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,880
Chen Kaixi,

352
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,680
look at me.

353
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,070
Come on.

354
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,920
Tell me,

355
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:13,550
what time is Chen Mian getting home?

356
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,750
His flight back from overseas

357
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,070
lands at 11:40 PM.

358
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:22,755
He should still be in the air now.

359
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,640
Are you sure?

360
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:26,880
Positive.

361
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,790
I paid off his assistant.

362
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,030
Okay.

363
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,200
It's 11:18 PM now.

364
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,960
We've got 22 minutes
before he touches down.

365
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,790
Let's use that time

366
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,750
to figure out how to handle this tutor.

367
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,222
What can we possibly do in 20 minutes?

368
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,790
Didn't you say
I'm a brilliant screenwriter?

369
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,310
Cleaning up a mess like this?

370
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,960
Totally in my wheelhouse.

371
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,750
Didn't you say

372
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,710
I like writing
the whole world into my scripts?

373
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,790
Well, tonight,
I'll write the hell out of this story.

374
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,750
Just watch.

375
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,960
First question,

376
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,990
what makes you think
something is going on between them?

377
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,710
Not trying to pry.

378
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,230
Just need to understand more
about the characters.

379
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,840
Tiao has five tutors.

380
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,120
But Chen Mian only

381
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:17,822
stays home during English class.

382
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,000
And he always steps in to take a look.

383
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:21,311
So he's paying extra attention.

384
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,550
What else?

385
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,470
She always shows up super early.

386
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
The others arrive at 7 PM,

387
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,400
but she's often here

388
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,270
before 5 PM.

389
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,550
She says it's because she lives far away

390
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,711
and doesn't want to be late.

391
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,400
But who knows?

392
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,640
Like today, she only saw everything

393
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,960
because she came early.

394
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,790
Now, the crucial part...

395
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,200
Do you think

396
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,640
whatever is going on between them

397
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,111
started before or after she was hired?

398
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,840
That matters a lot.

399
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,510
Because if it started before,

400
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,600
then this woman

401
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,310
was probably planted
by Chen Mian himself.

402
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,190
And that would mean
she has serious leverage.

403
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,030
I think it was after.

404
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,030
She was hired by me

405
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,070
and Chen Mian's assistant.

406
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,880
Chen Mian didn't get involved
in the process at all.

407
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,400
Back then she was

408
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,920
probably still in grad school.

409
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,230
I don't think

410
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,840
his assistant would've helped her.

411
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,070
Then

412
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,990
this just got easy.

413
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,960
Chen Kaixi,

414
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,600
listen carefully.

415
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,790
You did nothing wrong today.

416
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,550
I'm not

417
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,070
helping you "cover-up",

418
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,466
because there's nothing to cover.

419
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,960
We're just clearing out the mess,

420
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,030
all these messy people and messy things.

421
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,680
Got it?

422
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,270
Now follow my lead.

423
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,200
That tutor must throw you under the bus,

424
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,680
so you have to make the first move.

425
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,070
Step one, call Chen Mian.

426
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,640
Tell him Tiao got hurt

427
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,790
and that he must come home.

428
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,880
Now.

429
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:04,380
(Dear)

430
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,510
Step two,

431
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,680
you need to get into character.

432
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,400
Listen carefully,

433
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,120
you're not Chen Mian's
perfect wife right now.

434
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,222
You're a woman
who needs to get through a problem.

435
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,840
Got it?

436
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,750
Detach yourself a little.

437
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,750
Step outside of it.

438
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:23,177
Take a deep breath.

439
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,200
Add in some guilt.

440
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,990
A little softness.

441
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,070
A bit of hurt.

442
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,400
Feel it.

443
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,270
Final step,

444
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,880
go upstairs and wake Tiao.

445
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,680
But he's asleep.

446
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,120
Exactly.

447
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,960
You have to wake him up

448
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,790
and have him tell Chen Mian

449
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,880
he fell accidentally,

450
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,160
and the tutor helped him.

451
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,070
Are you telling me to...

452
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,360
Yes.

453
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,030
That's exactly what I'm saying.

454
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,790
No way.

455
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,990
I won't drag Tiao into this.

456
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:07,733
That's my line. I won't cross it.

457
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,360
Fine.

458
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,030
Then get ready

459
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:11,711
to hear Tiao call someone else "Mom."

460
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,030
You're out of time.

461
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,230
Chen Mian is almost home.

462
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,510
Tiao, wake up.

463
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,600
Your mommy needs to talk to you.

464
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,550
Mommy?

465
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,866
Is this really the only way?

466
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,422
It's the only way now.

467
00:23:56,022 --> 00:23:56,920
Tiao is a smart kid.

468
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,710
He'll get what you mean.

469
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,840
Tiao is asleep.

470
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,230
It's okay. I just want
to take a look at him.

471
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,120
Daddy.

472
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,710
Did I wake you?

473
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,444
Does your hand still hurt?

474
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,360
No.

475
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,310
I'm a tough guy.

476
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,030
You sure about that?

477
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,710
Your mom told me

478
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,200
you cried yourself hoarse.

479
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,470
I tried to dodge Wang Zihan,

480
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,920
but I couldn't stop myself in time.

481
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,880
I get it.

482
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,640
You couldn't stop

483
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,510
because of momentum.

484
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,790
Your mom told me

485
00:26:10,022 --> 00:26:11,600
she looked down to reply to a message.

486
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,990
When she looked up again,

487
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,230
you were gone.

488
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,310
Your mom

489
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,120
is a little careless

490
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,440
and immature.

491
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,960
You have to be more careful

492
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,200
when you're playing next time.

493
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,880
Daddy,

494
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,880
Miss Amy helped me today.

495
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,600
When I fell, she saw it happen

496
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,880
and told Mommy.

497
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,311
You should thank her for me.

498
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:46,244
She did what she should have done.

499
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,160
Tiao,

500
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,400
do you like Miss Amy?

501
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,510
Yes.

502
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,310
She's really nice to me.

503
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,440
Oh really?

504
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:01,710
What does she do for you?

505
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,310
She always comes really early for class.

506
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,550
She plays with me, watches TV with me,

507
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,920
asks how I'm doing,

508
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,920
and even cares about you and Mommy.

509
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,640
She said

510
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,470
she could keep me company

511
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,044
if the maid wasn't around.

512
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,160
Oh,

513
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,270
she also asked what food you like,

514
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,266
and what sports you enjoy.

515
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,120
Anything else?

516
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,160
She always brings me chocolate.

517
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,710
Mommy only lets me
have one piece a week,

518
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,440
but Miss Amy brings me

519
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,680
some every time.

520
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,640
Listen here, sugar bandit,

521
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,600
no more sneaking chocolate!

522
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,510
Fixing cavities hurts,

523
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,310
you hear?

524
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:55,400
Now get some sleep, Tiao.

525
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,750
Tiao,

526
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:05,680
good night.

527
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,600
Good night, Daddy.

528
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,840
Why are you still up?

529
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,790
It's been a long day. Go get some rest.

530
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,840
Alright now.

531
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,360
It's okay.

532
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,990
Tiao is a boy.

533
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,710
I used to get banged up
when I was little,

534
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:39,177
and I still turned out just fine.

535
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,640
Dear,

536
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,230
I'm so glad you're here.

537
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,310
I feel like I can finally breathe.

538
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,510
I'm here.

539
00:28:56,244 --> 00:28:57,311
It's going to be okay.

540
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,030
Honey,

541
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,470
I...

542
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,600
I've got another round tonight.

543
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,088
The guys are all waiting on me.

544
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,640
Let me walk you down.

545
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,120
Dear,

546
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,470
take this before you drink.

547
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,710
It's for your liver.

548
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,440
Don't drink too much, okay?

549
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,790
Be good.

550
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,960
I'll be back early.

551
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,640
Lady of the house,

552
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,200
I opened a bottle of wine.

553
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,790
Just a little reward
for your hero tonight.

554
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,133
Go whip up some snacks to go with it.

555
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,400
You're unbelievable.

556
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,955
I'm your most loyal right hand!

557
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:09,710
Coming right up.

558
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,600
Here you go.

559
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,680
Please enjoy.

560
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,710
Pig ears, duck wings, and duck necks?

561
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,790
Shouldn't you be serving

562
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,200
some fancy jamón
with honeydew or something?

563
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,200
Fine, fine.

564
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,510
What did Tiao say to you?

565
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
He just told me he loved me

566
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,710
before I could say anything.

567
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,750
When I went in earlier,

568
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,200
I didn't say anything to him.

569
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,510
I couldn't do it.

570
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,960
He's still so young.

571
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,990
Teaching him to say those things

572
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,440
just to get rid of my love rival...

573
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,230
I don't think

574
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,230
that's how a mom should be.

575
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,270
Maybe you didn't need

576
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,120
to say anything.

577
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,270
Kids understand more than we think.

578
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,750
Maybe Tiao is more perceptive,

579
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,120
and more thoughtful

580
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,030
than other kids.

581
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,600
Honestly, I'd rather

582
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,710
he wasn't.

583
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,030
I wish he could just be a regular kid.

584
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
I never imagined...

585
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,360
Kids today

586
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,750
understand so much.

587
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,470
A regular kid?

588
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,790
You think

589
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,360
any average kid out there

590
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,333
has a whole room full of LEGO sets?

591
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,620
Or a dad who guarantees him
a smooth ride through life?

592
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,700
When you gain something,
you'll lose something else.

593
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,120
You know,

594
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,790
through all of

595
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,680
Chen Mian's affairs,

596
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,510
I never actually hated him.

597
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,680
But tonight, for the first time,

598
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,200
I felt him

599
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,310
turning into my enemy.

600
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,840
Xi,

601
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,070
honestly,

602
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,200
you're lucky to be able to see

603
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,030
all this clearly now.

604
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,120
Most people live their whole lives

605
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,680
in denial,

606
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,680
lying to themselves till the end.

607
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,230
Sometimes I feel like a joke.

608
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm like a firefighter.

609
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,200
I put out one "Ke" today,

610
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,960
and then tomorrow it's an "Amy."

611
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,510
After I get rid of Amy,

612
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,030
the next day
there's a Zhong Qingcheng.

613
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,550
When does it ever end?

614
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:36,822
You think I'd be embarrassed
to talk about that?

615
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:40,222
You think if I keep my mouth shut,

616
00:33:40,222 --> 00:33:41,288
people won't notice?

617
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,790
Come on, everyone knows.

618
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,880
Right?

619
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,510
If you ask me,

620
00:33:47,644 --> 00:33:49,866
I don't think anything
is going on between them.

621
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,400
That girl has pride.

622
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,840
As long as she's not an enemy,

623
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,400
I can treat her like a friend.

624
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,070
You probably won't believe me,

625
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,800
but I kind of like her.

626
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,150
Listen to me.

627
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,760
When you're feeling

628
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,990
really low,

629
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,320
don't go spiraling.

630
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,533
Don't let your mind wander

631
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,960
into all that mess.

632
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,590
Do you ever look at me and think

633
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,880
how can someone be this stupid?

634
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,150
Not stupid.

635
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,720
Naive.

636
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,760
And at our age, that naivete is rare.

637
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,590
It's precious.

638
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,320
You know...

639
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,920
I mean,

640
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,880
all the wives around me,

641
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,360
they've got it all figured out.

642
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,150
As long as there are a husband,

643
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,630
a kid, and money,

644
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,880
nothing else really matters to them.

645
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,630
Who cares about the rest?

646
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,070
You do your thing, and I do mine.

647
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,510
They live so freely.

648
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,400
So what if

649
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:51,960
their heart dies along the way?

650
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,670
Unlike me.

651
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,550
You can't compare yourself

652
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,110
to them.

653
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,670
You're not like them.

654
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,990
Not even close.

655
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,190
Because you married for love.

656
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,150
You chose to marry Chen Mian

657
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,110
because of love.

658
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,510
That was so naive.

659
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,630
Screw love!

660
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:04,800
Which side of the bed do I sleep on?

661
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,960
I'm not sleeping on Chen Mian's side.

662
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,400
I'll sleep there.

663
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,550
But it doesn't matter anyway.

664
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,760
Our maid changes the sheets every week.

665
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,177
Besides, Chen Mian hasn't
slept here in over two weeks.

666
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,470
Do you want to try this mask?

667
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,630
It's expensive,

668
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,666
but it works so well.

669
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,960
Look at my skin.

670
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,866
It really works, right?

671
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:30,400
Let me see.

672
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,240
It's impressively smooth.

673
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,320
I can't even see your pores.

674
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,070
Right?

675
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,150
There is a reason it's expensive.

676
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,550
Time's almost up.

677
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,800
We're closing in ten minutes.

678
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,150
Got it.

679
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,470
You think we will end up

680
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,840
like that someday?

681
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,630
No way.

682
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,320
You skip carbs at dinner,

683
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,470
and I run laps every day.

684
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,333
There's no way we'll turn out like that.

685
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,440
But you might

686
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,470
need to work on your boobs.

687
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,440
Luo Man!

688
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,510
Luo Man!

689
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,400
Now I realize

690
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,960
that was just the arrogance of girlhood.

691
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,960
Thinking that just because
we were young and beautiful,

692
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,110
everything ugly in this world

693
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,555
must be someone else's fault
for not trying hard enough.

694
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,190
So arrogant.

695
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,760
Forget it.

696
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,590
No matter how expensive
the face mask is,

697
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,880
it can't turn back time.

698
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,630
Why would we turn back time?

699
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,630
Our youth,

700
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,630
our past,

701
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,920
they haven't been wasted in vain.

702
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,470
Look at us now.

703
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,440
You're the elegant socialite,

704
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,190
and I'm fiercely independent.

705
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,990
I have no desire to return
to those broke,

706
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,670
bruising, and exhausting days
of struggle.

707
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,400
I've had more than enough.

708
00:39:27,222 --> 00:39:28,977
Do you still hog blanket when you sleep?

709
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:30,360
Back when we used to share a bed,

710
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,422
I'd wake up shivering
in the middle of the night.

711
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,920
You were no better.

712
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,590
You talked in your sleep

713
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,550
and ground your teeth.

714
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,440
It really scared me, okay?

715
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,150
