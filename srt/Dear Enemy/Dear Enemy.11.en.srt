00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,880
=Dear Enemy=

2
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,280
Then enlighten me,

3
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,590
what does "fully commit"

4
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,870
even mean?

5
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,320
Alright,

6
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,710
got it.

7
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,710
After all,

8
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,390
a guy like you,

9
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,830
tasteful, handsome,

10
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,320
and almost perfect in every aspect...

11
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,790
It's not easy to come by.

12
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,230
Have I told you how much

13
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,230
I adore that sharp tongue of yours?

14
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:06,420
=Episode 11=
(A Little Pathetic)

15
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:11,670
Where are you going?

16
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,230
I'll have Mr. Liu take you first.

17
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,790
It's fine. I've ordered a cab.

18
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,790
Let's not mix business
with personal life.

19
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:21,390
Keep things clear and separate, right?

20
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,230
Mr. Zhou, I've taken
everything you said to heart.

21
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,066
Wouldn't want you struggling to
explain if we ran into someone you know.

22
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,480
Bye.

23
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Ms. Kaixi, you looked
so graceful on stage!

24
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,880
And beautiful!

25
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,200
Oh stop.

26
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,840
I... It's been years
since I last played.

27
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:00,880
I got a little rusty.

28
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,360
But Chen Mian insisted I get on stage.

29
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,790
He didn't even worry

30
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,000
I might embarrass myself
in front of all those people.

31
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,080
I remember

32
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,710
when he went
to his first big formal event.

33
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,390
I bought him
a brand-new designer trench coat.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,240
When we went out to dinner,

35
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,680
he just had to show off.

36
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,910
He told the waiter,

37
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,390
"Please hang up

38
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,270
this designer coat for me."

39
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,320
I swear,

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,950
I wanted to sink into the floor.

41
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,390
We were such nouveaux riches

42
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,800
back then.

43
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,590
We've been through lean times

44
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,030
and good times.

45
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,800
But somehow,

46
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
these days

47
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,440
we've run out of things to talk about.

48
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,350
That's why I've been thinking,

49
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
I want to do something for myself.

50
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,510
I want to start a business.

51
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,950
I remember

52
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,150
back when Chen Mian
started his business,

53
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,710
didn't he even take a break

54
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,560
from school?

55
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,950
Didn't his family object?

56
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,710
He's the first college graduate

57
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,440
in generations for the Chen family.

58
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,200
Whatever he says goes.

59
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,320
I supported him too

60
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,880
when he wanted to start a business.

61
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,500
Sure, it was tough,

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,060
but that didn't matter to me.

63
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,030
See,

64
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,644
when Chen Mian wanted
to start his business,

65
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,980
he got nothing but support.

66
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,980
His family backed him,

67
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,620
and his girlfriend supported him.

68
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,830
But us?

69
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,980
It's different.

70
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,860
When I went north to pursue my dreams,

71
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,300
I had to sneak away.

72
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,300
My parents were furious
when they found out.

73
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,590
They kept saying,

74
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,910
"Ever since you started this path,

75
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,470
we haven't had a single day of peace."

76
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,620
They still say that.

77
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,500
So

78
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,910
I have to say,

79
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,910
I envy Chen Mian
from the bottom of my heart.

80
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,540
Man,

81
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,060
give me some ideas.

82
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,910
If I wanted to start a business now,

83
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,420
what could I do?

84
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:13,910
You've got two options.

85
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,380
Option one is the indirect approach.

86
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,910
Ask Chen Mian to invest in you,

87
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,180
and open some fancy influencer shop.

88
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,860
But that just feels like
we'd be selling ourselves short.

89
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,590
I know you wouldn't go for that.

90
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,270
Option two,

91
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,066
trade your time and energy

92
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:32,620
to build connections
and leverage resources.

93
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,270
But be warned,

94
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,150
you'd probably
have to neglect your family.

95
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,030
Are you ready for that?

96
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,270
No way.

97
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,180
Why don't you
try starting your own brand?

98
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,150
Lots of society ladies

99
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,790
start niche jewelry lines

100
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,710
or something similar.

101
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,910
It's quite classy.

102
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,740
Sure, it's classy,

103
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,133
but the failure rate is high too.

104
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,300
If you ask me,

105
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,830
quit chasing every whim
that comes along.

106
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,980
Just stay home

107
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,940
and enjoy being a lady of leisure.

108
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,940
Sorry for interrupting.

109
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,590
Mrs. Chen,

110
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,860
how should I prepare
the yellow croaker today?

111
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,940
Let's do

112
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,190
a braised yellow croaker
with rice cakes.

113
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,860
It's simple. Just follow these steps.

114
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,910
First, clean the fish

115
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,230
and pat it dry.

116
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,740
Score both sides,

117
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,890
and then pan-fry it until
both sides are golden brown.

118
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,940
In another pan, sauté some pork belly
until the fat renders out.

119
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,980
Add scallions, ginger, and garlic.

120
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,710
Then put in the fried fish.

121
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,270
Pour in cooking wine and stock.

122
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,150
Then add the pre-seasoned,

123
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,710
sliced rice cakes.

124
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,790
Once the rice cakes are tender,
it's ready to serve.

125
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,420
Got it.

126
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,110
Okay.

127
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,980
What?

128
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
That was impressive.

129
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,180
It's really simple.

130
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,180
Simple?

131
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,230
How is that simple?

132
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,110
You'll see once you try it.

133
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,590
I've got an idea.

134
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,860
Why don't you start

135
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,940
a cooking vlog?

136
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,790
It'd be perfect!

137
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,590
I mean,

138
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,740
your father
is a professional chef, right?

139
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,940
You've got family recipes!

140
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,540
You could totally impress amateurs.

141
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,910
Right?

142
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,830
That's actually a great idea, Ms. Kaixi.

143
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,710
It's got real appeal.

144
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,670
Totally doable too.

145
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,060
You think so?

146
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,860
But what would my angle be?

147
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,830
Your lifestyle is your angle!

148
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,180
You think just anyone lives

149
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,270
like this?

150
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,300
And when it comes to recipes,

151
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,710
don't go

152
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,350
too basic.

153
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
But your presentation

154
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,190
should feel homey.

155
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,260
Just like how you explained it earlier.

156
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,190
Got it?

157
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,900
And when you film,

158
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,830
don't show your face.

159
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,260
But occasionally pan out

160
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,430
and give a glimpse
of your whole kitchen.

161
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,590
Subtle flexing,

162
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,900
and mysterious filming.

163
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,380
Get people curious.

164
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,980
Audiences eat it up.

165
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,620
I love watching content like that.

166
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,110
Really?

167
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,260
So how exactly do I get started?

168
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,260
(First, we need to find)

169
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,110
(a decent but affordable videographer.)

170
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,830
(Someone who can)

171
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,740
(handle both shooting and editing.)

172
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,066
- (And they better be good at it.)
- Hi.

173
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,780
(I actually know a guy, Xiao Nanke.)

174
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:10,690
(Though he's a little ambitious
and prideful.)

175
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,050
(Always dreaming of making movies.)

176
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,550
I've spent a lot of time on set.

177
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,380
I can take care of all
the grunt work for you.

178
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,900
That's good.

179
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,550
Okay.

180
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,860
A little higher, please.

181
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,230
Here you go.

182
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:25,920
Okay.

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,658
(Storyboard Script)

184
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,020
Let me take a look.

185
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,830
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

186
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,380
So,

187
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,190
are you ready?

188
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,310
Let's begin when you're set.

189
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,110
Okay. Three, two, one, action!

190
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,710
(Remember,)

191
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,500
(no face shots,)

192
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,550
(just hands.)

193
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,310
(Only these pampered, privileged,)

194
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,930
(yet surprisingly
good-at-cooking hands.)

195
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,900
(One fixed camera angle.)

196
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,230
(Soft, warm lighting.)

197
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,620
(A little background music.)

198
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,230
(A gentle voiceover...)

199
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:57,710
(You'll be an influencer.)

200
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,860
(I'm interested.)

201
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,710
If everyone has issues

202
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,620
with the episode outlines,

203
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,660
we should focus on
strengthening them first.

204
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,140
Right?

205
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,380
It'll save us rework later.

206
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,950
But the boss is getting impatient.

207
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,980
We've been stuck on these
episode breakdowns for too long.

208
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,710
Honestly,

209
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,620
many issues we can't solve in outlines

210
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,740
could be fixed
during actual scriptwriting.

211
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,380
Well,

212
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,780
how soon does
the boss want to see drafts?

213
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:37,980
Can you deliver the first
three episodes in a week?

214
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,740
Strike while the iron's hot.

215
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,260
The boss is waiting.

216
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,740
Please?

217
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:43,710
Fine.

218
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,190
Here.

219
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,110
Have some fruit, Dear.

220
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,380
I got it.

221
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,830
Actually, this was Luo Man's idea.

222
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,260
I figured since there is
little cost involved,

223
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,590
why not give it a try?

224
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,590
What do you think?

225
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:21,620
It's kind of interesting.

226
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,350
Really?

227
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,740
I thought,

228
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,500
for our first episode, we have
to feature that wild yellow croaker.

229
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,590
It looks absolutely golden on camera.

230
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,900
We actually prepared
four or five of them.

231
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,430
Dear, you know,

232
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,980
I found out when filming food videos,

233
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,430
you can't fully cook the dish.

234
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,844
Or it won't look good on camera.

235
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,830
Not bad.

236
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,230
Have you uploaded it?
How's the response?

237
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,511
How could I dare post anything
without your approval first?

238
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,550
Just post it.

239
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,020
Short videos like these

240
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,900
won't blow up right away.

241
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,980
Just

242
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,660
keep filming and posting,

243
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,020
and watch the comments to improve.

244
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,740
Dear,

245
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,620
how about

246
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,830
you post the first one for me?

247
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,140
For sentimental value.

248
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,500
Come on.

249
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:10,133
(Send a Post)

250
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,740
Dear, how about this?

251
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,070
After I finish each video,
I'll send it to you first.

252
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,660
You can give me some notes.

253
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,500
Tell your videographer

254
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,977
to pay more attention to lighting.

255
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,190
And use multiple angles.

256
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,590
Single shots are too monotonous.

257
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,230
And...

258
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,140
Most importantly, pick up the pace.

259
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,660
Shorter segments.

260
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,266
That's what grabs people's attention.

261
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,590
Dear, say it again.

262
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,620
Let me write this down.

263
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,430
Better lighting.

264
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,620
More camera angles.

265
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,200
(Zhou Musun: Are you asleep?)

266
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,470
(Luo Man: Still writing scripts.)

267
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,070
(Are you coming back tomorrow?)

268
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,000
(Zhou Musun: Come downstairs.)

269
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:00,860
You came all the way here this late.

270
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,550
Just get off your flight?

271
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,190
You

272
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,710
haven't washed

273
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,350
your hair, have you?

274
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,710
Didn't wash my face either. You like it?

275
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,830
I don't think

276
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,950
I can go back with you tonight.

277
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,590
I have a script to finish.

278
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:39,622
Let's get in the car first.

279
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,380
Why won't you come with me?

280
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,950
Script deadline.

281
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,500
Still so much to write.

282
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,710
If I go to your place and come back,

283
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,070
it'll be too much hassle.

284
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,470
You've worked at my place before.

285
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,740
Ai Di is coming tomorrow

286
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,350
to work with me.

287
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,430
I really shouldn't waste
time going back and forth.

288
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,140
Just bear with me, okay?

289
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,860
What's wrong? You look tired.

290
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,230
I didn't sleep well in hotel beds.

291
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,470
Haven't had proper rest in days.

292
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,550
Is it the hotel pillow
you can't get used to,

293
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,070
or the fact

294
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,860
that I'm not next to you?

295
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,500
Why don't you

296
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,190
go home and rest?

297
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,710
Let me hold you a little longer.

298
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,070
Man, I posted the video.

299
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,690
Chen Mian grabbed the phone
and hit the post himself.

300
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,110
He watched the whole thing seriously.

301
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,020
He said I did a pretty good job.

302
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,110
Then he started going on and on,

303
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,590
saying "You should've done this,

304
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,844
and you should've done that."

305
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,900
Thank god he's my husband
and not my boss,

306
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,380
or I'd be so annoyed.

307
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,980
That's actually sweet.

308
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,710
That means

309
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,740
your husband really cares about you,

310
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,470
right?

311
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,860
But seriously, I'm starting to think
all these boss types

312
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,030
just run with whatever
pops into their heads.

313
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,940
Just yesterday,

314
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,350
Zhou showed up unannounced

315
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,700
downstairs at my place.

316
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,070
I had to drop my work

317
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,380
and go see him.

318
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,900
And I ended up

319
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,070
pulling an all-nighter
just to finish the script.

320
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,660
Unbelievable.

321
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,460
It's annoying, right?

322
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,380
We might need better lighting,

323
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,900
more camera angles,

324
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,070
and faster pacing.

325
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:46,620
Camera setup was something
I agreed on with Ms. Luo.

326
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,220
Even if I wanted to accommodate you,

327
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,750
I couldn't.

328
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,880
We don't have that equipment.

329
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:51,333
And that's not
what we budgeted for.

330
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,860
How about

331
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,590
we stick to the original plan
for this shoot?

332
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,070
If it doesn't work,

333
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,420
we'll switch things up next time.

334
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,030
There really aren't enough shots.

335
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,420
It's all from the same angle.

336
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,180
What do you mean?

337
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,990
It just makes the visual language
really monotonous.

338
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,990
People will fall asleep watching it.

339
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,380
Plenty of food bloggers shoot like this.

340
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:41,800
Name one you actually watched.

341
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:43,590
Who are you modeling after?
Why copy anyone?

342
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,310
Then you shoot it.

343
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,590
I'm not a videographer.

344
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,310
This is just lazy work.

345
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,777
We're discussing creative choices.
Let's not get worked up.

346
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,620
What's going on?

347
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,220
You're back early.

348
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,660
The other kids went to play frisbee.

349
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,620
He couldn't join in, so he got upset.

350
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,830
Tiao, it's okay.

351
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,380
You can play too when your arm heals.

352
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,620
No need to be upset about it.

353
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
Hey, Dear.

354
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,140
My mom called you.

355
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,700
Why didn't you pick it up?

356
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,460
I was filming just now.

357
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,750
My phone was on silent.

358
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,620
She just wants me to book flights

359
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,790
and hotels for her and her girlfriends.

360
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:39,510
The tiger-print short-sleeved shirt?

361
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,310
Does it have to be now?

362
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,550
It has to be now?

363
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,510
Alright.

364
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,550
I'll play with you

365
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,900
after my meeting, okay?

366
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,900
I've reviewed the footage.

367
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,940
To be honest,

368
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,700
it's below standard.

369
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,180
It really is not great work.

370
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,990
Ms. Luo,

371
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,155
in our line of work,

372
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:30,510
nothing is worse than
amateurs trying to direct professionals.

373
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,090
Who are we supposed to listen to on set?

374
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,310
Kaixi isn't from our industry.

375
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,350
So yes, she's not a professional.

376
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,620
But at the very least,

377
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:44,510
she knows what she wants
and doesn't want.

378
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:46,170
And she can communicate that clearly.

379
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,180
As for Zhong Qingcheng,

380
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,220
why don't you go look up
some of her scenes?

381
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,180
Actually, never mind,

382
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:59,060
you probably won't be able
to find where she is in them.

383
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,790
I've seen her act before.

384
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,940
Even when she only had a tiny role,

385
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,660
she brought it to life.

386
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,460
Sometimes, I think

387
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,140
we need to stop slapping labels

388
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,860
like "professional"
or "not professional"

389
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,510
on people so easily.

390
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:23,380
You're not the only one
whose talent goes unrecognized.

391
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:51,560
(Chen Kaixi: Video isn't getting much attention.
What should I do, @Luo Man?)

392
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:06,680
(Video isn't getting much attention.
What should I do, @Luo Man?)

393
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,940
"Every morning,

394
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,900
the women of the village would
come to the river to do the laundry.

395
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,460
They'd place their clothes on the rocks

396
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,080
(What should I do, @Luo Man?)
and beat them with wooden sticks.

397
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,180
Before long, the clothes would be clean.

398
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,620
Watching the villagers come and go,

399
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,460
working so hard,

400
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,310
the rock felt a warm glow in its heart."

401
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:54,390
(Luo Man: I was writing script just now,)

402
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,800
(so I had my phone on airplane mode.)

403
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:57,220
(Get some influencers to share it.)

404
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,180
(Build up followers.)

405
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,270
(Chen Kaixi: Which influencer?)

406
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,700
(How do I get them to share it?)

407
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,550
Mommy, I'm right here!

408
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,700
I can see you!

409
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,900
How's your arm?

410
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,110
It's good!

411
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,750
Go!

412
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,700
Go find Tiao.

413
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,700
Fu really

414
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,220
went too far this time.

415
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,620
Not only

416
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,700
did he humiliate Wei'an

417
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,070
with the rushed wedding,

418
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,830
but he even made her leave with nothing.

419
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,460
Are you talking about Li Wei'an?

420
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,620
Our maid saw her just the other day.

421
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,620
She left the house early morning

422
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,380
with just a small suitcase

423
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,900
and hailed a rideshare.

424
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,900
Fu didn't even bother to send a driver.

425
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,030
Come, easy.

426
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,380
Chen!

427
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,140
Chen!

428
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,990
Now, Chen is being
looked after by a nanny.

429
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,790
They won't even let him see his mother.

430
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,900
Poor kid... What did he
ever do to deserve this?

431
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,200
(Luo Man: Get some influencers to share it.)

432
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,199
(Chen Kaixi: Which influencer?
How do I get them to share it?)

433
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,400
(Chen Kaixi: I've shortlisted
some influencers I follow.)

434
00:24:52,596 --> 00:24:54,295
(Which ones do you think I should ask?)

435
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:11,690
(Man)

436
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,830
Hello,

437
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,550
sweetie.

438
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,790
Oh, look who's finally free.

439
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,900
So I checked out

440
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,220
Deng Xingye's Weibo.

441
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,220
3 million followers? Perfect!

442
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,420
One repost from him

443
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,733
and you'll go viral overnight.

444
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,590
But why would he ever share my stuff?

445
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,750
Easy.

446
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,660
First,

447
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,140
start posting

448
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,380
those humblebrag content.

449
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:42,940
What do you mean?

450
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,620
Don't play dumb now, Chen Kaixi.

451
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,490
You know exactly
how to post that kind of thing.

452
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,830
Let me just open your Weibo

453
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,940
and search for the word "Dear"...

454
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,070
Look what I found.

455
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,363
(Kaixi Cathy)
"Just found out

456
00:25:57,364 --> 00:25:59,070
(Kaixi Cathy)
my dear's private banker

457
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,310
is a very pretty young woman.

458
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,460
I was a little upset,

459
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,590
but he assured me,

460
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,088
'I'm probably her poorest client.

461
00:26:07,111 --> 00:26:08,860
You have nothing to worry about.'"

462
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,990
And the post title?

463
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,750
"On Men and Their Tactics."

464
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,180
Perfect example.

465
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:17,355
Public displays of affection mixed
with subtle flexing, seamless execution.

466
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,900
What we call "sweet-sour boasting".

467
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,900
It sounded like

468
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,220
a complaint,

469
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,140
but it was actually a low-key brag.

470
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,380
You know what we call that?
Misery flexing.

471
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,620
Xi, you're natural at this.

472
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,510
That was when we were newly rich.

473
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,644
I used to post random stuff
like that all the time.

474
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,700
But come on,
just tell me what to post now.

475
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,310
Alright.

476
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,180
How about this,

477
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,140
just repost

478
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,940
Chen Mian's company IPO announcement

479
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,510
with just a single period
as your caption.

480
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,180
Just a period?

481
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,420
That is the most elegant
and understated kind of humblebrag.

482
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,140
And when you comment
on Deng Xingye's posts,

483
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,140
keep this in mind,

484
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,700
less is more.

485
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,350
Leave them curious.

486
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,310
Deng Xingye seems quite established.

487
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,180
He comes from money too.

488
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,990
Judging by his posts,

489
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,460
he's got this proud intellectual vibe.

490
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,940
Always critiquing social issues.

491
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,940
I doubt he'd agree to help me.

492
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,350
Oh he will.

493
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Trust me on this.

494
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,510
People who love to put on a front

495
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,860
are usually the first
to kneel in front of capital.

496
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,020
(Chen Kaixi: Deng Xingye replied!
He even sent me a direct message!)

497
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,340
(I invited him for dinner at our place.
You're coming, right?)

498
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:40,620
(Luo Man: You've got this!)

499
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:46,460
Please enjoy.

500
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,070
Don't you think

501
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,620
us having dinner here

502
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:53,380
kind of feels like

503
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,350
I just made a huge contribution
to the company,

504
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,310
and now

505
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,030
you're rewarding me with a fancy meal?

506
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,177
Look at what everyone else is wearing.

507
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,990
I know

508
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,270
I wouldn't reward
my employees with a meal like this.

509
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,420
Not

510
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,140
even an employee like me?

511
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,900
I'd never hire you as one.

512
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:15,940
Why?

513
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,310
You're too smart.

514
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,700
Who was it that told me,

515
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:23,070
"Teach your apprentice too well,

516
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,830
and the master loses their job"?

517
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,110
I'll take that as a compliment then.

518
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,620
Do you know why I like you?

519
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,830
Why?

520
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,420
Because

521
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,510
a smart woman like me...

522
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,860
What's so funny?

523
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,700
Forget it then.

524
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,460
Alright.

525
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,420
Tell me.

526
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,350
Why?

527
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,900
Because a smart woman like me

528
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,860
learned something

529
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,940
ever since my first relationship.

530
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,830
That is,

531
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
how to play dumb.

532
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,620
I had to appear just
slightly dumber than the man.

533
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,220
I had to

534
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,790
twist myself into this weird posture,

535
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,590
just to look up at him.

536
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,660
And

537
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,420
I had to make sure
he felt that I was looking up at him.

538
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,660
Only then would they find me endearing.

539
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,510
Only then

540
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,550
could I be worthy of being loved.

541
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,070
Doesn't that get exhausting?

542
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,900
It does.

543
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,700
But

544
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,860
with you, I don't have to.

545
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,750
Here.

546
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,990
Here comes the lobster.

547
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,380
You've got to eat it

548
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,270
while it's warm.

549
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,110
Here.

550
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,110
This is too extravagant, Mrs. Chen.

551
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,350
We'll never finish all this.

552
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,860
I'm just so thrilled

553
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,940
to have you here!

554
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,900
I absolutely

555
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,550
love the books you recommend.

556
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,460
I read several recently

557
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,590
and learned so much.

558
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,510
You've got such great taste.

559
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,140
Let me toast to you.

560
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,790
I thought nobody reads books anymore.

561
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,140
Most people

562
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,420
just snap photos of book covers

563
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,790
for social media,

564
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,900
and call it "literary networking".

565
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,220
I majored in Chinese literature
in college.

566
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,590
Not that I've read extensively,

567
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,700
just a personal hobby.

568
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,750
Now eat up before it gets cold!

569
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,380
Okay.

570
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:51,911
Here.

571
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,460
It's good.

572
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,420
Is it?

573
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,350
Back in 1997,

574
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,070
I wrote an article

575
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,990
about Deep Blue.

576
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,860
I predicted

577
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,110
books would vanish
because of the internet,

578
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,350
and human labor

579
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,660
would be replaced by AI.

580
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,510
People called me
an alarmist at the time.

581
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,550
But look now,

582
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,660
everything I predicted is coming true.

583
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,830
So tell me,

584
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,590
in the future,
will reading and writing books

585
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,350
still matter all that much?

586
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,380
When it comes down to it,

587
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,660
technology has changed everything.

588
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,620
That's why

589
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,660
people like Mr. Chen Mian

590
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,750
are the ones truly changing the world.

591
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,180
Here's to

592
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,660
Mr. Chen,

593
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,180
to technology,

594
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,270
and to a new era.

595
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,750
Nice wine.

596
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,270
How are you always so spot on?

597
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,420
Here's my read

598
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,750
on these influencer accounts.

599
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,620
They're essentially attention whores.

600
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:24,750
Yes,

601
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,940
that's the precise term for them.

602
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,220
Their harshness is very targeted.

603
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,510
They go after people

604
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,830
they believe are

605
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,830
the safest to attack.

606
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:36,140
As for ordinary folks,

607
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,160
they'll throw in
some token concern now and then,

608
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,270
but groveling to new money?

609
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,070
That's their default setting.

610
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,310
You know these so well.

611
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,380
How is it?

612
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,070
The moment he reposted it,

613
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,860
your views shot up
by the tens of thousands.

614
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,990
Instant results.

615
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,310
Miss, your full hand whitening treatment
is complete.

616
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,660
Would you like to try

617
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,300
our seasonal deep hydration package?

618
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,780
No thanks.

619
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,390
These hands aren't going on camera.

620
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,070
Okay.

621
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,820
Then I'll wait for you outside.

622
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,950
Excuse me, Miss?

623
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,180
Would you mind filling out

624
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,340
a quick survey?

625
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,990
We have a small gift for your time.

626
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,820
Miss Yu, would you like
your usual fruit tea?

627
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,260
Sure.

628
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,430
Please have a seat and relax.

629
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:47,400
Let me guess, mark everything
as "very satisfied?"

630
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:50,870
The pen's out of ink!

631
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,910
So sorry.

632
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,030
Let me find another one.

633
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,620
Here, use mine.

634
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,620
If even a woman this perfect
couldn't keep him...

635
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,590
What chance do I have?

636
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,990
Go ahead. It's fine.

637
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,950
Thank you.

638
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,180
I

639
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,910
saw Yu Qiaoqiao.

640
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,950
How is she?

641
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,030
When Chen Mian came home last night,

642
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,780
we had a conversation.

643
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,700
Zhou once asked me...

644
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,590
He said,

645
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,030
"What does your ideal life look like?"

646
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,910
And I told him,

647
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,660
Chen Kaixi's life.

648
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,510
Chen Kaixi's life is my ideal life.

649
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:00,950
Is that

650
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,990
really what you see?

651
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,140
Dear.

652
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,260
I've booked the English tutor.

653
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,700
He's a junior from
the foreign languages college.

654
00:37:12,177 --> 00:37:13,620
His spoken English is excellent.

655
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,470
Honey.

656
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,990
Is this really necessary?

657
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,260
What do you mean?

658
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,910
I mean,

659
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,820
does keeping me on such a tight leash

660
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:36,340
actually make you feel better?

661
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,510
Dear,

662
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,780
what are you talking about?

663
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,030
Do you remember He?

664
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,030
He died yesterday.

665
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,470
Heart attack.

666
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,780
Dear...

667
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,870
He was only 46,

668
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,220
just ten years older than me.

669
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,140
You know what I've been thinking?

670
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,820
I've probably only got

671
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,990
ten good years left.

672
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,660
Really,

673
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,070
just ten years.

674
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,620
I promise you, after that,

675
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,620
I'll settle down.

676
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,430
I'll come home,

677
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,777
and be the husband you deserve.

678
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,590
But until then,

679
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,990
I won't deny myself.

680
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,300
Hang on...

681
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,577
Dear, are you listening to yourself?

682
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,740
Dear,

683
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,140
you told me you'd love me forever.

684
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,700
You promised you'd only be good to me.

685
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,780
You swore in front of the Bodhisattva
at Mount Putuo.

686
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,950
Don't you remember that?

687
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,140
I remember.

688
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
I remember everything.

689
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,820
But

690
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,110
people change.

691
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,430
Change?

692
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,180
You mean because you're rich now?

693
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,740
Or because I'm getting old?

694
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,180
Neither.

695
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,220
It's me.

696
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,620
I overestimated myself

697
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,444
and underestimated human nature.

698
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,820
Just tell me whatever is bothering you.

699
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,550
Talking won't fix anything.

700
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,070
Never mind. It's pointless.

701
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,870
I really get that feeling.

702
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,430
When did everything get so complicated?

703
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,950
Or is this

704
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,140
just what growing up

705
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,620
means?

706
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,870
Sometimes I think

707
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,260
growing up really sucks.

708
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:51,390
Remember how happy
we used to be as kids?

709
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,510
We could talk forever,

710
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,030
literally all night.

711
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,070
We could tell each other
every stupid little thing.

712
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,820
It never solved anything.

713
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,870
But still,

714
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,990
it just felt like,

715
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,700
after just talking with you,

716
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,990
all the bad feelings

717
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,030
somehow felt lighter.

718
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,550
Back then, we thought

719
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,820
saying it out loud

720
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,111
was enough to make it better.

721
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,950
But now...

722
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,550
What about you?

723
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:49,300
Is there something you want to say?

724
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,133
Is your treatment going to take long?

725
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,470
A little while more.

726
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,030
Hurry up.

727
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,180
Get some sleep early.

728
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:08,022
My flight's at nine tomorrow morning.

729
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,260
9 AM?

730
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:10,910
No way I'm getting up that early.

731
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,950
Just go without me.

732
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,780
Don't worry about me.

733
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,470
It's fine.

734
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,622
Just let me know where
you're going after you get up.

735
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:21,000
I'll have Mr. Liu take you.

736
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,110
Why the rush?

737
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,910
What, afraid I'll overstay my welcome?

738
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,340
I just can't stand
having people in my space.

739
00:42:29,977 --> 00:42:31,200
Even when my mom visits,

740
00:42:31,222 --> 00:42:32,470
I make her stay at a hotel.

741
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,260
Got it. No need to explain.

742
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,180
Hurry up.

743
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,140
Forget it.

744
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,244
I don't want to talk about it.
It kills the mood.

745
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,880
(Deng Xingye: Finally get the appeal
of short videos.)

746
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,890
(Stop pretending we have refined tastes.
It's neither refined nor interesting)

747
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,580
(Cathy: Well-made long-form dramas still exist.
