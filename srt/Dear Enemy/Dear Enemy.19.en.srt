=Dear Enemy=

2
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,540
I really wish I could go.

3
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,820
I've been switching departments lately.

4
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,700
I work seventy hours a week.

5
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,180
And I still have papers to write.

6
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,420
I barely have time to sleep.

7
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,740
How am I supposed to help you?

8
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,070
But...

9
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,580
This project really means a lot.

10
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,670
Think about it. These past few months,

11
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,980
everyone has come to realize

12
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,070
how noble and heroic
medical workers are, right?

13
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,470
But how noble are doctors, really?

14
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,260
How heroic?

15
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,390
Most people do not know.

16
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,790
That is why our project

17
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,390
focuses on these young doctors,

18
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,070
their path of growth,

19
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,070
the struggle and how it is all worth it.

20
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Right?

21
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,390
Say it.

22
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,700
Fine.

23
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,510
Let's say I owe you one.

24
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,670
Just help me this once.

25
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,470
Failing my first assignment in the team

26
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,580
isn't going to look good.

27
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,580
Right?

28
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,630
Can you really bear
to see me this miserable?

29
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,230
No, I cannot.

30
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,910
But...

31
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,140
I still can't go.

32
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,950
Eat up.

33
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,260
It will get cold.

34
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,740
You still have a meeting later.

35
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,980
I am already full-on anger.

36
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:28,220
=Episode 19=
(Like a Rainbow in the Flesh)

37
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,670
What are you doing here?

38
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,300
I...

39
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,470
I came to ask you something.

40
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,110
No time to shoot,
but you have time to go camping?

41
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,620
I...

42
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,940
I actually

43
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,420
made plans with Tiao a while ago.

44
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,500
But Tiao had a fever,

45
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,910
so I came in his place.

46
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,790
Here.

47
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,590
What is this?

48
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,420
Is this that skewer pancake
from your hospital?

49
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,860
Pretty much.

50
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,110
How is it?

51
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,500
It tastes pretty good.

52
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,230
I actually understand you.

53
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,740
There are thirty
or forty students in each cohort,

54
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,620
but only three or four
end up staying in the hospital.

55
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,500
It is pretty competitive.

56
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,860
I get why you are not going.

57
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,110
But...

58
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,060
Wouldn't going actually help you

59
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,300
get noticed by the supervisor?

60
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,300
Right?

61
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,230
I looked into it.

62
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,910
In your cardiothoracic department,

63
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,670
the top two

64
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,620
are you

65
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,230
and the one called...

66
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,910
Liu...

67
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,030
Liu Yiran.

68
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,710
Right.

69
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,740
Liu Yiran.

70
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,860
See?

71
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,300
She is going, and you are not.

72
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,180
What if she ends up

73
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,060
outshining you?

74
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,110
Liu Yiran is really good.

75
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,150
Back in undergrad,

76
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,940
she was always top of the class.

77
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,620
So it's totally normal
for her to beat me.

78
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,110
You know what?

79
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,470
You're kind of interesting.

80
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,470
You're really impossible to sway.

81
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,110
You seriously don't want to
go for first place?

82
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,500
Or stay on at the hospital?

83
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,980
Then, tell me

84
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,590
why people have to be first?

85
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,380
This whole being first thing...

86
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,380
It's not about wanting to.

87
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,860
I think it's become second nature to me.

88
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,150
I've been trained this way.

89
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,230
When I was little,

90
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,790
my dad was super strict with me.

91
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,670
If I took a test,

92
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,380
even if I came in second,

93
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,590
he'd ask me, "Who came in first?"

94
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,740
And little by little, I was trained

95
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,590
to be like a show dog.

96
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,470
I'm always chasing first place.

97
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,550
Always trying to win.

98
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,470
Aren't you tired?

99
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,550
Of course I am.

100
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,230
How could I not be?

101
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,500
Trying to win all the time

102
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,860
is utterly exhausting.

103
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,550
What about you?

104
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,190
You're so chill at your age.

105
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,660
I find that hard to believe.

106
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,190
When I was little,

107
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,660
I was raised by my grandparents.

108
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,620
They really doted on me.

109
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,310
They felt that since my brother
was already so good,

110
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,860
I didn't really

111
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,020
need to try that hard.

112
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,020
And then I became a doctor.

113
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,110
Even in this job,

114
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,140
there's no real

115
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,860
first or second place.

116
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,070
But if you really want to compete,

117
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,140
you can.

118
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,380
Like...

119
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,550
paper awards,

120
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,550
and title evaluations.

121
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,830
But for a doctor,

122
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,710
what matters most is the patient.

123
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,620
Every time I get home after work,
I ask myself,

124
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,190
"If everything I did
for my patients today

125
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,550
was the right thing,

126
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,260
then that counts

127
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,190
as a win."

128
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,660
You want to win at everything.

129
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,860
Even love?

130
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,190
What time is it?

131
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,950
Almost 10 PM, I think.

132
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,950
It's late.
We can't go down the mountain now.

133
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:14,900
So...

134
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,934
Let's just crash here for the night.

135
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,310
I'll sleep in the car.

136
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,190
Come on.

137
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,350
You're too tall for that.

138
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,190
You'll be all cramped
and broken by morning.

139
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,110
We have sleeping bags anyway.

140
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,020
Let's just sleep here for the night.

141
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,070
Be good.

142
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,140
Just...

143
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,900
You trust me that much?

144
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,230
Of course.

145
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,980
I am close with your brother and Kaixi.

146
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,780
Childish.

147
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,070
Heart rate is over 120, huh?

148
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,230
That's tachycardia.

149
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,380
Better keep an eye on that.

150
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,230
That show is pretty relentless.

151
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,470
They keep asking.

152
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,230
I had a look.

153
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,740
I think

154
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,710
the questions I marked out

155
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,350
are worth giving more thought.

156
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,900
Sure, you're Chen Mian's wife,

157
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,780
but you're still a food blogger.

158
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,860
Why are all the questions about him?

159
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,140
Maybe it is because
the company is going public.

160
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,590
They probably think this topic

161
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,380
can bring in some traffic...

162
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,350
But honestly,
that account's reach is nothing special.

163
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,110
And its audience

164
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,110
doesn't overlap with yours at all.

165
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,430
Not even a little bit.

166
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,190
Then, forget it.

167
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,110
Let's sleep on it.

168
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,266
(Director Liu:
Ms. Big-Time Screenwriter nailed it.)

169
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,950
The kid agreed.

170
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,660
That was not easy.

171
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,310
You really went all out.

172
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,190
Good thing the trip wasn't for nothing.

173
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,350
I saw he spent the night
up in the mountains.

174
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,230
Who brought you back?

175
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,470
You don't remember?

176
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,500
No, I was just thinking

177
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,070
about how to answer
some of those questions.

178
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,830
I think you should ease up a little.

179
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,110
Don't worry. I'll play nice.

180
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,310
That's kind of my thing.

(Opening Ceremony
Documenting Our Times: Power of Youth)

183
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,190
Ms. Man, I'll head over.

184
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,780
Alright.

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,780
Great. Go on.

188
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,500
Come on.

00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,500
Tighter, please.

192
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,380
Okay, shout "Good luck with the shoot!"

193
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,900
Three, two, one.

194
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,190
Good luck with the shoot!

195
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,350
Alright, that's good.

196
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,830
Okay!

197
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,230
(Outpatient Clinic)
Let's get started!

198
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,070
Luo Man.

199
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,860
Right here.

200
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:50,900
Okay.

201
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,590
Mr. Xu.

202
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,710
Here's the thing.

203
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,230
Director Jiang had

204
00:15:58,266 --> 00:15:59,830
a stomach perforation last month.

205
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,140
He can't drink.

206
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,140
So,

207
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,590
I'll drink this for him.

208
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,190
You're a generous man, Mr. Xu.

209
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,590
Let's be friends.

210
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:08,110
I drink first to show respect.

211
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,310
Let's be friends.

212
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,070
Friends, huh?

213
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,310
Then, why is the friend
always getting the short end?

214
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,190
You guys delayed three days.

215
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,590
Forget the money for now.

216
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,310
What would other crews do?

217
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,260
Mr. Xu, I totally understand.

218
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,020
You know I didn't mean
to drag things out.

219
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,780
We just started back up again.

220
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,710
Three days.

221
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,190
I swear, just three days.

222
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,620
I will get it all shot.

223
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,550
You know our rule.

224
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,830
No drinking,

225
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,020
no talking.

226
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:44,222
Director Jiang.

227
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,380
Jiang.

228
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,140
Mr. Xu.

229
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,940
Mr. Xu.

230
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,750
People say you're loyal and honorable.

231
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,030
Just do me this favor.

232
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,940
I promise it won't be for nothing.

233
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,180
Do you a favor?

234
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:19,140
Who do you think you are?

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let me drink.

236
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,070
Alright then, Mr. Xu.

237
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,110
Here's to you.

238
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,700
Enough, Qingcheng.

239
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,420
Wait.

240
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,350
Jiang.

241
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,270
Isn't she that...

242
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,030
Alright.

243
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,180
What's your name?

244
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,140
I'm Zhong Qingcheng.

245
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,420
You're that "clear-minded queen," right?

246
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,070
That's me.

247
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,460
Mr. Xu.

248
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,420
She's that young actress.

249
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:25,260
(Zhong Qingcheng:
The Clear-Minded Queen)

250
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,180
Mr. Xu.

251
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,270
You know what?

252
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,070
I'm going to blow up one day.

253
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,900
This industry

254
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,700
is neither big nor too small.

255
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,790
Today,

256
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,270
do us a favor.

257
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,140
Maybe tomorrow I'll return it.

258
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,660
You're the big boss.

259
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,310
You've seen ups and downs.

260
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,550
None of this is new to you.

261
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,180
Who knows

262
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,590
which cloud might bring the rain?

263
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,790
What goes around comes around.

264
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,380
Just think of it as making a new friend.

265
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,420
Right?

266
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,590
Your actress?

267
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,700
Not bad.

268
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,030
She has some star quality.

269
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,590
Alright.

270
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,790
Today,

271
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,790
we become buddies.

272
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,830
Three days.

273
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:16,270
Tear down the set in three days.

274
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,750
- Okay, three days.
- Thanks, Mr. Xu.

275
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:18,420
Okay, three days.

276
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,310
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

277
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,110
Let me open the window for you.

278
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,860
Some fresh air will help.

279
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,940
"You never know
which cloud will bring the rain."

280
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,310
Where did you even learn
all this street talk?

281
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,070
Well, you said it's street talk.

282
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,350
So of course,
I learned it on the street.

283
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,510
Stop laughing.

284
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Don't rush.

285
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,350
Take it one step at a time.

286
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,860
No hurdle is unbeatable.

287
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,700
We'll get through every single one.

288
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,510
So you already know.

289
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,140
I'm not stupid.

290
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,790
I've noticed how you and Jiang

291
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,420
have been anxious and all worked up.

292
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:48,550
And Jiang's lips are covered in ulcers.

293
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,750
Mr. Ken doesn't want
to invest anymore, does he?

294
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,700
We're still working on him.

295
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,790
It's not final yet.

296
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,030
Whatever.

297
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,550
He's not the only investor out there.

298
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,590
We'll keep looking.

299
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,510
I still think our project is solid.

300
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,030
Someone will invest.

301
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,180
It's okay.

302
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,140
Qingcheng.

303
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,750
Be with me.

304
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,310
I'm serious.

305
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,460
You probably already know

306
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,180
what happened between me and my ex-wife.

307
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,310
All these years, I kept wondering

308
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,990
what kind of person
I wanted to move forward with.

309
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,830
I never figured it out.

310
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,590
Not until I met you.

311
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,180
I feel like you're the one.

312
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,310
So...

313
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,660
What do you think of me?

314
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,940
Look, with us,

315
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,110
there's no need for any fluff.

316
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,420
Just give me a straight answer.

317
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,660
It's not like
I don't want to be with you.

318
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,990
You've been so good to me

319
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,140
and for so long, so sincerely.

320
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,940
You've helped me so much.

321
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,180
I remember it all.

322
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,900
But...

323
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,900
But...

324
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,310
Even if we really got together,

325
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,940
how long would it last?

326
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,380
You know me.

327
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,700
I'm still trying to move up.

328
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,990
The way we are now,

329
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,244
we're like brother and sister.

330
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,700
It's much easier.

331
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,420
You can call me for lunch,

332
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,420
or for a drink.

333
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,590
We'll see each other around.

334
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,180
Isn't that nice and easy?

335
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,510
Unbelievable. Really.

336
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,620
You called two guys
your brothers in one night.

337
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,510
So what?

338
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,830
Fine.

339
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,750
Fine.

340
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,180
Starting today,

341
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,750
Zhong Qingcheng is officially
my little sister.

342
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,590
From now on,

343
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,180
we'll take on the world together.

344
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,270
That was so corny. My god.

345
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:18,180
(Outpatient Clinic)

346
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,550
Dr. Fang, you should head home.

347
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,750
Almost done.

348
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,590
They're still updating charts.

349
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,940
They have to stay too. It's tough.

350
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,750
Set another camera position here.

351
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,140
Film that bit I mentioned.

352
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,790
Get the shot.

353
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:33,340
(Outpatient Clinic)

354
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,750
Hey.

355
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,140
When did you get here?

356
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,790
Last night...

357
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,750
Late last night.

358
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,420
Why didn't you wake me?

359
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,620
I meant to.

360
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,590
I was so tired,

361
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,900
and I fell asleep.

362
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,590
So you just stayed there...

363
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,590
You're a thoughtful kid.

364
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,380
As your sister,
I'll treat you to breakfast.

365
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,420
What do you want?

366
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:46,043
(Fang Chi:
There's no sister. And I'm no kid.)

367
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,700
Hello?

368
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,700
Hello, Zhang Fan?

369
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,940
Tell me what Zhang means by this.

370
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,270
He's bailing at a time like this?

371
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,660
Is he even human? Curse him!

372
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,940
He wants the money
but not the hard time!

373
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,350
Tell him to get lost.

374
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,790
The farther he goes, the better.

375
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,940
You think I don't know
how bad things are?

376
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,860
I know there are risks involved.

377
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,700
I know. I get it.

378
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,350
But listen,

379
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,140
if you're about to lose it,

380
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,270
then I'm on the verge of a breakdown!

381
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,990
Fine.

382
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,550
Fine. Talk later.

383
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,700
Thanks, Ms. Kaixi.

384
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,700
I'll send you the cut once it's done.

385
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,590
Alright, thank you.

386
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,990
Our car's here.

387
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,111
We're heading out, Ms. Kaixi.

388
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:48,000
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

389
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,066
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

390
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,510
Honestly, running a household well

391
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,380
takes real skill too.

392
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,940
You have to face
all kinds of challenges in life.

393
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,350
Alright, as long as it's recorded.

394
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,180
Now they can't twist it
with malicious edits.

395
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:21,940
Did you see

396
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,030
the look on that host's face just now?

397
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,380
When you called for a pause in filming,

398
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,110
I was like,

399
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,310
"That was so cool."

400
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,750
I know.

401
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,940
She was way out of line.

402
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,310
She shouldn't be indulged.

403
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,660
She changed the script last minute,

404
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,510
and pitted you against the other guest.

405
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,110
You're just too nice.

406
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:37,940
If it were me,

407
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,220
I would've walked off.

408
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,460
But honestly,

409
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,660
what you said at the end

410
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,070
really touched me.

411
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,070
It's the part when you said

412
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,620
you had Tiao,

413
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,110
and Chen Mian's career
started to take off,

414
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,830
and you

415
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,900
just powered through it all

416
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,790
on your own.

417
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,620
I was really moved...

418
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,380
Do you know why I agreed

419
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,790
to do this interview today?

420
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,460
Chen Mian's company

421
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,140
had to delay its IPO.

422
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,900
There has been a lot of gossip.

423
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,350
So, those questions today

424
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,590
weren't random.

425
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,070
He is under a lot of pressure.

426
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,620
Honestly, I don't have much to say.

427
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,990
I just want people to know

428
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,270
Chen Mian's company is fine.

429
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,790
I can still afford to wear

430
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,380
the latest season of Loro Piana.

431
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,380
Am I being childish?

432
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,940
Not at all.

433
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,310
It's just that

434
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,590
Chen Mian...

435
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,310
How could he ever deserve
this love from you?

436
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,030
As long as I can live with myself,
that's enough.

437
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,350
It's about to rain.
You should head back.

438
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,110
After going back,

439
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,990
you should take care of yourself.
Watch your health.

440
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,270
You're the one
who needs to be taken care of.

441
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,860
Remember,

442
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,460
don't skip your meals.

443
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,700
Here.

444
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,750
This is for you.

445
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,270
Again?

446
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,140
Get well soon.

447
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,350
Don't come back again.

448
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:06,670
(Emergency Department)

449
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,180
Forgot your umbrella?

450
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,420
Use this.

451
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,420
What can this do?

452
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,790
Go, Pikachu!

453
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,420
Is this even going to work?

454
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Come on over!

455
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:30,400
(Emergency Department)

456
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,620
Use this to blow it dry.

457
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,660
Here, this one's better.

458
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,990
You're in great shape.

459
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,390
Definitely not from
just chugging protein powder.

460
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,550
I have some now and then.

461
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Dry it off out here.

462
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,030
It's too cramped in there.

463
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,470
Your clothes are dry now.
You're welcome.

464
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,510
Hey...

465
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,260
Was that little girl your patient?

466
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,700
Yeah.

467
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:54,390
She's been coming here for years.

468
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,340
Her illness...

469
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,910
is hard to treat.

470
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,550
She has to come back
and stay in the hospital all the time.

471
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,470
In the beginning,

472
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,220
her parents were with her.

473
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,990
But now,

474
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,700
it's just her.

475
00:37:15,288 --> 00:37:16,870
She goes up and down the building,

476
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,780
running tests, and paying bills.

477
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,260
She's a little ball of sunshine.

478
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,030
Always so cheerful.

479
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,820
She gets along well with us.

480
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,220
And she is close
with the other patients too.

481
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,110
Wherever she stays,

482
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,070
that's the room with the loudest laughs.

483
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,030
Very mature...

484
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,300
How old is she?

485
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,740
Fourteen.

486
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,620
We once went to a restaurant.

487
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,550
They gave out a bag of fortune cookies.

488
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,340
I handed them out to the patients.

489
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,340
I gave her one too.

490
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,620
Hers said,

491
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,510
"If you can only keep smiling,

492
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,430
maybe it's because
you really need to cry."

493
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,300
And she cried right after.

494
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,140
Yeah.

495
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,590
There aren't that many kids
who are mature by nature.

496
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,030
They are all

497
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,590
forced to be.

498
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,620
They are trained to be that way.

499
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,220
There aren't any truly mature adults.

500
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,110
All adults

501
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,820
were once kids too.

502
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,260
The rain has gone over.

503
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,390
I should get going.

504
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:59,092
(Warrior Princesses, Zhong Qingcheng:
Ladies, I'm back! Let's meet up soon!)

505
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:26,970
(Like a rainbow in the flesh,
never known until encountered.)

506
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,590
Hi, could I get a fresh pot of tea?

507
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,620
Sure.

508
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,260
I can only stay till 2 PM.

509
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,070
I need to take Tiao to class.

510
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,430
I have a shoot too.

511
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,070
Text her.

512
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,260
Dear superstar,

513
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,820
where are you now?

514
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,870
Xi and I have plans this afternoon.

515
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,950
If you're really busy,

516
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,110
we can reschedule.

517
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,070
Okay?

518
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,780
Why are you filming every single day?

519
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,880
Is it always this intense?

520
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,550
It goes on all day long.

521
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,220
The doctors are exhausted. So are you.

522
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:13,990
I know.

523
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,030
By the way,

524
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,180
what happened
with Fang Chi and your cousin?

525
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,430
Seems like those two kids

526
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,390
didn't feel anything.

527
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,620
They came up with some noble excuse like

528
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,820
they want to focus on school and career.

529
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,950
That's just how Fang Chi is.

530
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,820
Every time I try to set him up,
he says the same thing.

531
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,110
It was fine when he was still in school,

532
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,590
but now he's working.

533
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,700
I wonder if he already likes someone.

534
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,260
Chen Mian really does

535
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,590
dote on that brother of his.

536
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,300
He handles his work,

537
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,990
and even tries to
sort out his love life.

538
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,140
Every day he talks about

539
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,470
setting him up with someone new.

540
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,260
People might mistake him for the dad.

541
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:03,620
Thanks.

542
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,510
You're finally here.

543
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,700
Sorry, I'm late.

544
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:10,820
You can serve the food now.

545
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,510
Okay.

546
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,590
Come on.

547
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,910
I'm really sorry.

548
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,390
I keep making you all wait so long.

549
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,140
I was stuck with those big shots.

550
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,590
I couldn't

551
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,590
leave until they did.

552
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,990
I'll take a shot as punishment.

553
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,510
Take it slow.

554
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,300
Alright.

555
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,910
You're one of us. No need for that.

556
00:42:30,155 --> 00:42:31,180
I have to drink.

557
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,430
A superstar like you

558
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,780
is on a whole different level.

559
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,620
Eat something before you drink more.

560
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,070
Okay.

561
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,620
Here.

562
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,700
I'm starving.

563
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,660
I just sat there
pretending to be polite.

564
00:42:44,488 --> 00:42:45,820
I didn't get to eat anything.

565
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,260
I just listened to gossip.

566
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,180
And drank a ton of tea.

567
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,700
I heard Zhou Musun add a boost.

568
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,180
A boost?

569
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,180
What kind of boost?

570
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,030
To Chen Mian...

571
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,910
Mr. Chen's company
hit a snag going public.

572
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,220
After Zhou Musun stepped in,

573
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,390
it all got fixed.

574
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,780
Who told you that?

575
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,260
You know those big shots.

576
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,220
After I wrapped that show,

577
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,220
I didn't have the budget
for post-production.

578
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,430
Jiang Ya got me to meet some people.

579
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,510
It was them.

580
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,820
Once they start sipping tea,

581
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,140
playing poker or whatever,

582
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,340
they chat about anything.

583
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,910
Just random stuff, gossip, all of it.

584
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,950
That's where I heard it.

585
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,030
You've leveled up since we last met.

586
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,990
Didn't you use to hate
socializing with those bunch?

587
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:43,620
What choice do I have?

588
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,300
Jiang Ya is off
shooting Mr. Ken's web movie.

589
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,220
I can't just sit here acting all noble.

590
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:50,990
True.

591
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,070
Again?

592
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,550
I'll go take a call.

593
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,260
Hello?

594
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,070
And I was going to
go on that show to speak up for him.

595
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:07,740
Turns out

596
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,430
he had already sorted it out on his own.

597
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,990
Isn't that laughable?

598
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,030
Don't overthink it.
At least it's solved.

599
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,510
The most ridiculous part is,

600
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,820
I had to hear it from someone else

601
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,820
and not from him.

602
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,110
I have another round.

603
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,220
I should head out.

604
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,700
Can I treat you to a hot spring trip

605
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,780
when I'm done with work?

606
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,550
Give me a chance
to make it up to you, okay?

607
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,470
Forget it.

608
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,260
Until you land your next role,

609
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,740
better save some money.

610
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,140
No need to say that. We're family.

611
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,700
Then forget it. Let's leave together.

612
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,950
We're pretty much done eating.

613
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:59,590
Alright.

614
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,110
Let's toast, then.

615
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:05,180
Let me drive you.

616
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,620
Never mind. My driver's outside.

617
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:07,990
I'm heading off.

618
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,820
Text me.

619
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,870
See you. Bye.

620
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:10,870
Bye.

622
00:45:30,596 --> 00:45:33,880
(Interview Room)

623
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,030
Director.

624
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,340
What's up?

625
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,070
Ms. Luo.

626
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,950
I want to reshoot the part
where Fang Chi walked

627
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,280
the little patient out yesterday.

628
00:45:42,288 --> 00:45:44,030
But, Fang Chi said no.

629
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,510
Maybe you could talk to him?

630
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,870
You want to reshoot it?

631
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,820
Isn't this a documentary?

632
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,550
Why are we staging things?

633
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,470
Come on, Luo Man.

634
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,510
You're a screenwriter.

635
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:54,950
You should know how this works.

636
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,660
I do know.

637
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,030
But this is a documentary.

638
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,390
It should be authentic.

639
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,700
It's not the same as a drama.

640
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,300
And they're not actors either.

641
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,660
Staging it might not make it better.

642
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,030
Fine, I'm not arguing with you.

643
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,910
ER's still short on people.

644
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,300
Go. Head over to the ER.

645
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:14,950
Go on.

646
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,970
(Luo Man: I could write 800
of these soul-healing quotes a day.)

647
00:46:26,977 --> 00:46:29,080
(Fang Chi)

648
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,030
You haven't eaten, right?

649
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:52,470
The cafeteria ran out of food.

650
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,133
I ordered you
three skewers and a pancake.

651
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,740
You need to eat more.

652
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:56,660
ER's hectic.

653
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,340
You'll burn out tonight otherwise.

654
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,070
This morning,

655
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,820
I saw it.

656
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,340
I didn't expect

657
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,260
you'd go up against the director for me.

658
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,590
And

659
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,620
you even took the hit for it.

660
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,510
Thank you.

661
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,470
It's a documentary.

662
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,820
It shouldn't be staged.

663
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,390
It's not just about you.

664
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,820
I'd do the same for anyone.

665
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,340
That's my principle.

666
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,910
I thought we...

667
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,260
Make no assumptions.

668
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,590
There is no "we".

669
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,700
Luo Man?

670
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,430
We need backup at the ER lobby.

671
00:48:08,444 --> 00:48:09,260
Please come quickly.

672
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,590
Okay, I'm coming now.

673
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,510
Ms. Man!

674
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,660
They need some footage over there.

675
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,870
The director wants you
to get the patient's consent.

676
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,510
That director is too petty.

677
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,990
All that just because of this morning?

678
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,260
He's been exhausting you.

679
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:24,660
It's okay.

680
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,300
I'll go.

681
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:37,140
Sir, we're filming a documentary here.

682
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,070
We need you to...

683
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,970
