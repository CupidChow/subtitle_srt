00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,880
=Dear Enemy=

2
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,340
Sir, we're filming a documentary here.

3
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,390
We'd like your...

4
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,910
It's been a while.

5
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,230
We're filming a documentary,

6
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,350
and we need your consent.

7
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,300
You've lost weight.

8
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,459
=Episode 20=

9
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,666
(I Need to Know
What Kind of Hell I'm In)

10
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,140
Well,

11
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,580
how are things going?

12
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,350
Have you been well?

13
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,510
Busy.

14
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,910
But fulfilled.

15
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,140
How about you?

16
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,420
What happened to you?

17
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,350
Badminton.

18
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,630
The doctor will be here in a minute.

19
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,980
I'll turn down

20
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,580
the documentary for you.

21
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,820
It's fine.

22
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,390
I don't mind

23
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,190
being filmed.

24
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,510
I'd like

25
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,420
to support your work.

26
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,390
Dr. Fang is here.

27
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,390
Perfect timing.

28
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,740
How did you hurt yourself?

29
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,510
Badminton.

30
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,020
Usually with badminton,
it's an ankle or a shoulder.

31
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,260
How did you mess up

32
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,580
your back?

33
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,740
I jumped

34
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,540
to smash a shot.

35
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,420
Landed weirdly,
and it didn't feel right.

36
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,350
Maybe

37
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,350
I twisted it.

38
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,270
After the game,

39
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,150
I could barely move.

40
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,980
Does it hurt when I press here?

41
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,670
Does the pain shoot down your legs?

42
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,940
Not really.

43
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,030
Okay.

44
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,590
It's probably not a herniated disc.

45
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,940
Get a CT scan of your lumbar spine

46
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,980
in a bit.

47
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,060
No workouts for the next few days.

48
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,940
Try to rest.
Lie down as much as possible.

49
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,860
Luo Man.

50
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,540
What?

51
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,940
Do you want me
to get your prescription for you?

52
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,150
What time do you get off tonight?

53
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,670
Want to grab a bite

54
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,940
after this?

55
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,710
Nah.

56
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,500
I'm getting supper

57
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,940
with Fang Chi.

58
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,910
Right.

59
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,470
We already made plans.

60
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,590
You two seem close.

61
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,860
When my dad was in the hospital,

62
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,150
Fang Chi helped a lot.

63
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,300
Well, then.

64
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,980
Thank you, Dr. Fang.

65
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,710
No need for that.

66
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,380
Mr. Luo and Mrs. Luo are good people.

67
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,670
It's what

68
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,790
we younger folks

69
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,740
should do.

70
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,180
We're all family.

71
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,620
You've known each other

72
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,620
for a long time?

73
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,030
We...

74
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,470
Yes.

75
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,380
We met back when she was in college.

76
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,670
My cousin was dating Kaixi then.

77
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,790
Kaixi said she was talented.

78
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,030
Left quite the impression.

79
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:02,980
All right.

80
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,311
We should let the patient rest.

81
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,590
We'll head out.

82
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,860
Mr. Zhou.

83
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,470
Take care of that back.

84
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,940
Don't go so hard next time.

85
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,860
Got it.

86
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,540
Can't keep up
with the young ones anymore.

87
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,350
07, please pay the ER fee

88
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,980
using the kiosk outside.

89
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:24,500
I'll take care of that.

90
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,180
Together.

91
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,180
Thanks.

92
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,710
Scan your QR code

93
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,300
or barcode at the reader.

94
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,980
I can...

95
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,180
Thank me for what?

96
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,830
Thank you...

97
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,500
For bailing me out back there.

98
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:45,020
(Violation Recorded)

99
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:59,340
(Dear)

100
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,670
Yes?

101
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,910
Dear?

102
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,380
You're in Shanghai?

103
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,980
Yes, the flight was delayed.

104
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm exhausted.

105
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,860
It's crazy hot here.

106
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,030
I'm drenched in sweat.

107
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,620
The weather's been finicky.

108
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,590
I'm going to shower soon.

109
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,270
Is Tiao asleep?

110
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,266
He's gone to sleep for a while.

111
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,540
I've got a meeting

112
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,500
first thing tomorrow.

113
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:28,060
You should get some sleep too.

114
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,300
Oh, right.

115
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,110
The holiday's coming up.

116
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,380
Invite Fang Chi over for a meal.

117
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,740
And ask Luo Man to come too.

118
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,020
Hello?

119
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,900
Something else?

120
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
No, Dear.

121
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,660
Good night.

122
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,710
Ms. Luo.

123
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,590
Right.

124
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,470
I won't bother wiring you the money.

125
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,980
Okay. This doctor's visit
will be my treat.

126
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,500
I got it.

127
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,140
I'm heading back, Mr. Zhou.

128
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,980
Thanks.

129
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,110
Speedy recovery.

130
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,860
Luo Man.

131
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,780
Believe it or not,

132
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,860
I'm actually

133
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,140
very happy

134
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,740
to see you again.

135
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,620
I'll transfer the money to you.

136
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,780
It's fine.

137
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,020
That bit you said earlier?

138
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,620
About how we used to know each other

139
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,660
almost sounded real.

140
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,070
You nearly had me fooled.

141
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,860
I just want to say

142
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,140
your EQ and IQ are both on point.

143
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,070
Are you

144
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,380
working the night shift?

145
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,020
I'll pack up soon.

146
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,133
Want to leave together?

147
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,900
Go where?

148
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,780
Go grab a bite to eat, together.

149
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,350
There is no "together".

150
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,380
There is no "us".

151
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,950
Was there ever an us?

152
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,830
Will there ever be an us?

153
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,260
I admit,

154
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,070
I chickened out.

155
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:07,480
(WeChat)

156
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,635
(Fang Chi: I don't have a sister,)

157
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:11,720
(and I'm not a child.)

158
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,160
(Chen Kaixi: Chen Mian did not
go to Shanghai that weekend.)

159
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,310
Hello?

160
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,660
Where are you?

161
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,470
I'm downstairs.

162
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,500
What's your room number?

163
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,140
(Violation recorded)
Chen Mian has a car

164
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,590
registered under my name.

165
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,710
Last weekend,

166
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,660
he was supposed to be
in Shanghai for a conference.

167
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,230
One night,

168
00:13:58,444 --> 00:14:00,380
I suddenly got a text

169
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:02,500
saying the car had a traffic violation.

170
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,260
I opened the app

171
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,190
and saw the photo.

172
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,660
Who's this woman?

173
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,260
Do you recognize her?

174
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,860
I can't tell from the photo.

175
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,660
You know what's the saddest part

176
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,310
about all this?

177
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,710
It's not that Chen Mian cheated again.

178
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,310
It's that...

179
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,380
I wasn't even surprised.

180
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,350
These past few months were so quiet,

181
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,710
and I actually
thought maybe he'd changed.

182
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,550
But, no. After the miscarriage,

183
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,070
I was too weak

184
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,470
to deal with anything.

185
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,350
Any little clue,

186
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,230
I forced myself not to see it.

187
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,110
The violation happened right in front

188
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,350
of the Women's and Children's Hospital.

189
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,590
What do you mean?

190
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,070
He got his other woman pregnant?

191
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,590
Has he lost his mind?

192
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,830
So...

193
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,780
So...

194
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:26,260
So, what are you going to do?

195
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,430
What am I going to do?

196
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,740
What can I do?

197
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,070
If there's a child involved,

198
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,500
that's a lifelong thing.

199
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,550
There's no way

200
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,590
we can just let it go.

201
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,830
Here's what we do.

202
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:50,377
Here's the plan.

203
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,500
First,

204
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,190
don't lose your temper.

205
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,350
Second,

206
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,190
stay calm. Take it slow.

207
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,110
We need a long-term plan.

208
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,430
We get

209
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,020
all the evidence

210
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,710
and find out who this woman is,

211
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,020
how far things have gone,

212
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,900
and whether that baby is really his.

213
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,500
Once we've got all that in our hands,

214
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,660
we're in control.

215
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,590
It'll be our call,

216
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,740
on how far this goes.

217
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:20,230
So, we'll take it step by step.

218
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,660
We'll do this together.

219
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,070
I know.

220
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:28,140
That's what I had in mind too.

221
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,500
Good thing Tiao just started school.

222
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,260
I finally have a bit more time.

223
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,900
You, on the other hand,

224
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,230
are so busy
and still listening to me vent.

225
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,430
Then again, truth is,

226
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,230
I don't have anyone else I can talk to.

227
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,140
Chen Kaixi, what's wrong with you?

228
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,780
Why are you telling me all this?

229
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,740
Enough.

230
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,180
If you want to cry, just cry.

231
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,750
Don't hold it in.

232
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,550
I want to cry.

233
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,140
But it's like

234
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,350
I've forgotten how.

235
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,990
Let's get to work.

236
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,990
I'll grab something simple for lunch.

237
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:37,660
All right.

238
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:47,140
I've already sent the nanny home.

239
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,777
Do we really need to be this careful?

240
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,790
Of course.

241
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,420
Better safe than sorry.

242
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,110
Everything has to look exactly
the same as before.

243
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:57,790
I already looked through all this.

244
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,220
Chen Mian spent more time
at home these past few months.

245
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,420
Is he

246
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,660
into gaming?

247
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,220
He loves it.

248
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,660
Drinking tea and playing mahjong
are too old-fashioned for him.

249
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,750
Gaming makes him feel young.

250
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:26,700
What kind of normal adult
plays Honor of Kings on a desktop?

251
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,270
His neck's bad.

252
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,860
He says using a computer feels better.

253
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:36,220
(Any guys want to team up and play?)

254
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,590
He didn't log out?

255
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,590
Won't he notice
someone's been on his account?

256
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,700
Just tell him

257
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,310
Tiao brought a friend over

258
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,955
and they accidentally pressed something.

259
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:56,129
(Wang Pixi. Wen Jun uu. ZQC.)

260
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,350
Zhong Qingcheng?

261
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:04,560
(King: You're terrible at this.
You kept feeding the enemy.)

262
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,844
(- Want to rank up?
- Of course.)

263
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:10,955
(- Call me "bro" and I'll carry you.
- So childish.)

264
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:13,755
(- Used to roll right off your tongue.
- That was before. Play or not?)

265
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:15,360
(King: Fine. Next round, stick with me.)

266
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,460
Well, she is an actress.

267
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,420
You're back.

268
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,750
Didn't I already tell you?

269
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,420
Forgot?

270
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,070
Were you waiting for me?

271
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,110
You could've just called.
I'd have come down.

272
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,860
Don't flatter yourself.

273
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,180
Who's waiting for you?

274
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,030
I'm waiting for Mr. Kang from Hehui.

275
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,830
Our project got put on hold.

276
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,180
He's still interested,

277
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,590
so he asked me
to meet for dinner, and catch up.

278
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,270
Thought you didn't do

279
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,940
these kinds of dinners?

280
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,550
If you were open to that,

281
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,420
it wouldn't be
Mr. Kang taking the meeting.

282
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,790
Can't be helped.

283
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,380
The market's bad right now.

284
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:10,660
How long have you been waiting?

285
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,660
Two hours.

286
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,350
Are you stupid?

287
00:20:16,688 --> 00:20:17,750
Why are you still waiting?

288
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,940
He's clearly not coming.

289
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,070
Come on. Eat with me.

290
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,350
I'm not hungry.

291
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,220
Well, I am.

292
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,140
Come have steamed buns with me.

293
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,460
Steamed buns again?

294
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:29,466
I don't want the ones
with chive filling.

295
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,420
Qingcheng,

296
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,310
here's another tip for you.

297
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,140
Next time this happens,

298
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,866
just leave if they're more
than an hour late.

299
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,590
They're obviously blowing you off.

300
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,790
But don't be mad.

301
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,110
These days,

302
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,460
even the bosses are broke.

303
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,180
It's better he didn't show.

304
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,510
I've been drinking much these days.

305
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,022
I've thrown up several times already.

306
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,900
Wait.

307
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,350
You're an actress.

308
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,550
Why do you need

309
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,620
to be there?

310
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,790
Shouldn't producers be
handling investment meetings?

311
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,180
That's what I thought.

312
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,420
But they said having me there

313
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,660
makes it more "vivid,"

314
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,030
and more "immersive."

315
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,030
Those scoundrels.

316
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:10,110
If the drinks actually led to funding,
maybe it'd be worth it.

317
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,900
But they're all empty talk.

318
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,070
You're better than them.

319
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,750
At least you tell it like it is.

320
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:17,180
Wow. That's how you talk to people?

321
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,180
It's because you're pretty.

322
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,220
You think I talk straight
with just anyone?

323
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:24,940
I can hardly expect
to hear nice things from you either.

324
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,620
No.

325
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,700
I meant the last part.

326
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,460
I've been working

327
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,070
like a dog every day.

328
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,180
It's only when I'm chatting with you

329
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,070
that I can breathe for a second.

330
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,700
So, tell me.

331
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,380
Why keep doing this?

332
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,420
Why?

333
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,620
Well,

334
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,620
life's hard.

335
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:51,380
So, we should make the most

336
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,940
of the moment.

337
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,270
Mr. Zhou. Ms. Luo Man and her guests
are inside Donghuan.

338
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,460
We already delivered the wine

339
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,550
like you asked.

340
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,660
We're not strangers,

341
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,420
so let's just lay it all out.

342
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,900
What's going on
between you and Chen Mian?

343
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,270
You...

344
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,220
You think it's me?

345
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,590
You think I'm crazy?

346
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,140
Why would I have a baby with Chen Mian?

347
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:25,790
I'm on the rise in my career.
Why would I throw that away?

348
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,133
Why would I give up my future?

349
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,900
Who does Chen Mian think he is?

350
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,750
Why would I pay

351
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,180
such a huge price for him?

352
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,350
Is he worth that?

353
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,350
Am I out of my mind?

354
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,555
Whether you're out of your mind

355
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,830
or he's worth it
is a whole other conversation.

356
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,310
But the way you flirt with him
in the game?

357
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,900
You two do kind of match.

358
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,380
Guess I was just too naive.

359
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
All these pet names

360
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,750
and talk of being best friends.

361
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,900
All a load of bull, huh?

362
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,220
You guys never really respected me.

363
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:01,822
The moment something goes wrong,

364
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:03,220
I'm the one you dump it on.

365
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,030
Sure. Whatever.

366
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,660
Fine. It's all my fault.

367
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,860
I'm the one who let the wolf in.

368
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,860
Forget it.

369
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,140
This was never going to end well.

370
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,110
Let's just say we misjudged her.

371
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,460
Our first meal together was here.

372
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,070
Guess our last one is too.

373
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
Kind of fitting.

374
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,310
Can't believe it came to this.

375
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:02,970
(Cathy: So, this is
how someone "repays" you.)

376
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,220
Good.

377
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,550
Keep digging.

378
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,180
There's a lot more dirt to come.

379
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,550
♪The wine isn't even that strong♪

380
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:33,350
♪Stop romanticizing getting drunk
like it's some poetic escape♪

381
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,420
♪We made eye contact♪

382
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,420
♪Get lost♪

383
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,030
("Falling for You Slowly")

384
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,270
Who picked this song?

385
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,244
Who wanted this song?

386
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,590
I picked it.

387
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,900
Is it true about Fang Chi and Liu Yiran?

388
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,310
I bet a week's worth of milk tea on it.

389
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,310
Men are always acting.

390
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,940
What's real can look fake.

391
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,940
And what's fake can end up real.

392
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,380
People will love Dr. Fang's pairing!

393
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,940
Shipping characters

394
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,220
even in a documentary?

395
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,311
Isn't that kind of tacky?

396
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,510
Yes,

397
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,460
but audiences eat it up.

398
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,750
And hey, sometimes the fake flirting

399
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,140
turns into something real.

400
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,380
Really? Would it?

401
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,830
Real is real.

402
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,590
Can't fake it if it is.

403
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,700
I envy you.

404
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,620
It's nice being young.

405
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,900
So black-and-white, and so certain.

406
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,460
Get in there.

407
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,030
Everyone's waiting.

408
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,790
What's wrong?

409
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,700
Tie this for me.

410
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,940
I don't know how.

411
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,550
You do.

412
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,750
I really don't.

413
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,420
You do.

414
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,900
There you go.

415
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,940
Here's his itinerary
from the past few days.

416
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,830
His timings are all over the place.

417
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,070
I think

418
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,750
there's more than one.

419
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,460
Keep talking.

420
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,900
They usually

421
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,180
meet outside.

422
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,830
Never at the long-stay hotel.

423
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,900
Did he go back to Women's
and Children's Hospital again?

424
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,830
No.

425
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,660
It's definitely not one of these, then.

426
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,310
Could it have just been

427
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,790
him driving past that day?

428
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,900
Do you believe that?

429
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,620
I'll stay with you for a bit.

430
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,180
It's lunch break anyway.

431
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,550
You know what it feels like?

432
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,460
Like every time I open my eyes,

433
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,510
my heart sinks a little deeper.

434
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,750
I keep thinking

435
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,220
it can't possibly get worse.

436
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,140
Then, something
even more disgusting happens.

437
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,900
Daddy!

438
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,700
Daddy told me
he was going to video call me!

439
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,110
Don't run off.

440
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,550
Your hair's still wet.

441
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,830
Tiao!

442
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,700
Daddy!

443
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,700
I missed you so much!

444
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,700
Daddy, did you catch my air kiss?

445
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,830
Got it loud and clear.

446
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,510
Tiao.

447
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,750
Did the present I sent

448
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,590
arrive?

449
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,350
It did, Daddy!

450
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,380
Thank you, Daddy!

451
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:25,244
Stop buying him more LEGO.
He can't even finish the ones he has.

452
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:27,750
I said I'd take him out

453
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,140
to play soccer last weekend.

454
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,220
I couldn't make it.

455
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,750
This is me making it up to Tiao.

456
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,510
A man has to keep his word, right?

457
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,550
Wow. What a role model.

458
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,420
Daddy! Daddy!

459
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,750
We won!

460
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,830
Three to zero!

461
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,550
I scored two goals!

462
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,510
Aren't I awesome?

463
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,350
Three to zero, Tiao!

464
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,380
And you scored twice?

465
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,380
You're amazing, Tiao!

466
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,590
I'm so proud of you!

467
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,310
I think I'm awesome too.

468
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,030
Mommy.

469
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,220
Tiao?

470
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,550
What's wrong? Can't sleep?

471
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,830
Mommy.

472
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,660
Can I sleep with you tonight?

473
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,660
Of course.

474
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,510
You're the best mommy in the world.

475
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,750
Really?

476
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,350
Yes.

477
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,510
My mommy is the best mommy

478
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,550
in the whole wide world.

479
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,460
The very best.

480
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,990
And my boy

481
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,380
is the best boy in the whole wide world.

482
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,110
I love you.

483
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,750
Let's sleep.

484
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,640
(Luo Man: Is this a good time to talk?)

485
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,940
Yes?

486
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,310
Xi?

487
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,460
I found her. I'm pretty sure it's her.

488
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,310
Go ahead.

489
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,620
Maybe

490
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,990
you want to sit down for this?

491
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,220
Get some water and prepare yourself?

492
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,310
It's fine.

493
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,460
Just tell me.

494
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,030
Let's rip the Band-Aid off.

495
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,590
I remember

496
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,590
this one American show.

497
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,790
The female lead said,

498
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,990
"If I'm in hell,

499
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:02,790
then I at least want to know

500
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,700
which circle of hell I'm in."

501
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,390
Xi.

502
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,550
You really have grown.

503
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,780
You go inside.

504
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,180
Leave this to me.

505
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,222
I'll take care of it.

506
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,430
You recognize her?

507
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,260
No wonder she looked familiar.

508
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,260
Is she a friend

509
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,990
one of your rich-lady group

510
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,740
brought along?

511
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,700
She's Chen Mian's assistant.

512
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,950
Former assistant, actually.

513
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,000
A while ago, she said she
was going home to visit family.

514
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,340
Then, she decided she liked it there
and didn't want to come back.

515
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:14,780
Chen Mian approved it.

516
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,910
I even got her

517
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,470
a thank-you gift.

518
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,870
Take it.

519
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,990
No need to be polite.

520
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,180
You and Mr. Mian have always been
so kind to me.

521
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,110
All this time,

522
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,820
I thought she was my eyes and ears.

523
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,220
That she worked for me.

524
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,700
Has Chen Mian lost his mind?

525
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,780
Does he just sleep with anyone?

526
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,550
And now he's gotten someone pregnant?

527
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,300
What's he even getting out of this?

528
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,260
Convenience,

529
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,430
I suppose.

530
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,910
Chen Mian always bragged
about not being picky.

531
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,870
Said he could enjoy

532
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,430
abalone and sea cucumber

533
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,030
or just as easily a meat bun.

534
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,700
My dad used to praise him too.

535
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,340
Said anyone who could eat plain meals

536
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,660
could do anything.

537
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,740
I know what he was really after.

538
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,510
Once you have the assistant
wrapped around your finger,

539
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,870
everything else gets easier.

540
00:36:15,555 --> 00:36:16,820
At the end of the day,

541
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,470
no "trusted team member"

542
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,510
can compete

543
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,590
with someone who shares your bed.

544
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,030
What's wrong?

545
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,510
Quick!

546
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,870
Drink some water. Rinse it out.

547
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,470
Have some water.

548
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,870
Rinse your mouth.

549
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,510
You know
what's the most disgusting part?

550
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,070
Chen Mian used to say
about his assistant,

551
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,340
"What man would even want her

552
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,950
when she looks like that?"

553
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,820
Say no more.

554
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,180
Let's...

555
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,030
Let's get a lawyer.

556
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:29,300
But there's one thing

557
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,700
I need to remind you of.

558
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,620
The word

559
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,550
"divorce"

560
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,300
isn't something

561
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,910
you just throw around.

562
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,180
Especially not over and over.

563
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,510
Not with someone like Chen Mian.

564
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,510
You need a thorough plan.

565
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,910
Otherwise,
we're the ones on the back foot.

566
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,950
We go in with one shot,
and it has to count.

567
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,550
It's okay.

568
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,510
I'm here.

569
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,700
I've got you.

570
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,590
I know

571
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,550
your heart must be
all over the place right now.

572
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,030
It's okay, Xi.

573
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,590
You have to be calm

574
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,070
when it comes to big decisions.

575
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,180
I'll be right here
while you think it through.

576
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,030
What have you been through
to know all of this

577
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,820
and be so collected?

578
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,300
Xi.

579
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,220
You know...

580
00:38:39,822 --> 00:38:42,140
Watching everything
you've been through with Chen Mian,

581
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,030
all the messed-up things he's done,

582
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,070
I've never hated him
like I do right now.

583
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,990
From this moment on,

584
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,030
he's my enemy too.

585
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,510
Well, your enemy

586
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,110
invited you over for food.

587
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,870
Then, let him.

588
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,977
What do we have to be afraid of?

589
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,870
We've got nothing to be afraid of.

590
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,220
Here comes the crab.

591
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:33,390
Why aren't you sitting closer?

592
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,390
Why leave a seat empty?

593
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,700
Zhou's on his way.

594
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,300
Mr. Chen.

595
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,470
What's the special occasion?

596
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,180
Cracking open the good wine, huh?

597
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,620
Finally wrapping up
that mess of a listing.

598
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,260
Now that HKEX approved the hearing,

599
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,870
it's pretty much a done deal.

600
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,990
Zhou really pulled some strings
for us on this one.

601
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,550
I owe him a proper toast.

602
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,950
Sorry

603
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,070
- Zhou.
- for being late.

604
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,140
Come, sit.

605
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,700
Fill Zhou's glass.

606
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,660
Tiao.

607
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,140
Everyone's here now, right?

608
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,220
Today, it's all family

609
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,300
at this table.

610
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,740
Let me speak frankly.

611
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,620
These past few months

612
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,300
have felt like years.

613
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,780
There were times I thought,

614
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,140
"Just screw it all!"

615
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,550
But

616
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,950
life's funny like that.

617
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,910
Just when you think it's over,
you let go,

618
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,780
and suddenly

619
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,220
things start falling into place.

620
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,660
Zhou.

621
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,070
We really couldn't have done it
without you.

622
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,470
Thank you, my friend.

623
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,340
Thank you.

624
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,620
Let's not dwell on that.

625
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,260
And Honey,

626
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:49,740
I've got to thank you too.

627
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,870
You never said anything,

628
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,220
but I know you were worried for me.

629
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:54,288
Thanks for being there.

630
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,590
Fang Chi.

631
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,780
Cheers.

632
00:40:59,110 --> 00:40:59,740
Luo Man.

633
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,260
Thanks for showing up.

634
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,030
Cheers.

635
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,910
Congratulations, Mr. Chen.

636
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,740
Another leap forward in your empire.

637
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,140
We'll be seeing your name

638
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,470
on Forbes soon.

639
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:11,977
I'm not trying to be the guy
with the biggest spotlight.

640
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,740
My father-in-law always said,

641
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,950
"Good meat stays

642
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,510
at the bottom of the bowl."

643
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,180
Getting rich quietly,

644
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,444
and that's real power.

645
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,870
That's exactly what

646
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,870
the nouveau riche would say.

647
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,180
Honey.

648
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,140
We have guests. Go easy on me.

649
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,620
We're all family here.

650
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,470
Come on.

651
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,700
Let's eat.

652
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,070
You have a beautiful garden.

653
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,950
It's all Kaixi's doing, right?

654
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,550
Chen Kaixi loves

655
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,340
working on that stuff.

656
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:49,155
I didn't think much of it before.

657
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,470
But when spring came around

658
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,660
and work was a mess
and giving me a headache,

659
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,140
having that garden saved my sanity.

660
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,740
Zhou.

661
00:41:59,377 --> 00:42:00,990
Doesn't matter how chaotic the world is,

662
00:42:01,177 --> 00:42:02,620
the second I step through that door

663
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,660
and smell the cake

664
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,070
she and our son

665
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,510
are baking,

666
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,870
I feel completely at peace.

667
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,340
A warm home,

668
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,780
wife and kid, cozy nights,

669
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,470
what more could a man want?

670
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:14,550
Man,

671
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,180
watch that humblebrag.

672
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:17,660
Seriously, though,

673
00:42:17,688 --> 00:42:19,377
when I was cooped up at home
for a while,

674
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,910
I ended up learning quite a few recipes
from Kaixi's videos.

675
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,140
Zhou,

676
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,260
you cook?

677
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,740
Like a real chef.

678
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,870
I'm pretty decent.

679
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,600
But when you're cooking
just for yourself,

680
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,000
it's hard to get the portions right.

681
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,555
Always end up making too much.

682
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,070
Well, find someone to eat with you.

683
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,740
Oh, you know me.

684
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,300
I'm used to being alone.

685
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,550
But I've really started to feel it

686
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,950
these last few months.

687
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,660
Sometimes even having someone

688
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,700
to argue with is actually

689
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,950
quite nice.

690
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,070
That sounds deep and all,

691
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,070
but really,

692
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,070
still feels like you love yourself

693
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,990
more than anyone else.

694
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,110
Listen to this kid,

695
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,222
acting like a love guru.

696
00:43:03,244 --> 00:43:05,400
How many relationships
have you even been in, huh?

697
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,390
Let me tell you.

698
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,820
The best girlfriend is young,
sweet, thoughtful,

699
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,180
and always puts you first.

700
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,030
Got it?

701
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,820
Can't settle for someone
who always nags.

702
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,340
You mean someone like Xi?

703
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,110
Of course, a wife like that is great.

704
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,620
She gives you your freedom,

705
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,260
gives you the final say,

706
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,180
and treats you like you hung the moon.

707
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,390
I disagree with that.

708
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,030
I think

709
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,870
it's good for women

710
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,700
to be smart and have their own opinions.

711
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:34,950
Chi,

712
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,260
you don't know any better.

713
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,430
Let me burst that bubble

714
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,644
for all the so-called
"independent women" out there.

715
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,220
Some of them think

716
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,740
they're clever,

717
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,030
but they're just overplaying their hand.

718
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,030
Any man can see right through

719
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,300
their little tricks.

720
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,510
What's the point?

721
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,070
I don't know.

722
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,110
I still think smart women are great.

723
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,660
Zhou,

724
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,950
talk to me again
after you get burned, okay?

725
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:02,910
I've already been burnt.

726
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:07,620
Chi.

727
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,430
Don't go learning from Zhou.

728
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,990
He's playing in a different league.

729
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,660
If you don't have the skills,

730
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,300
don't take on that kind of woman.

731
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,430
Why are you running your mouth so much?

732
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,550
We're having a meal at home.

733
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,110
Anyone listening would think
you're giving a speech about your IPO.

734
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:23,950
That's right.

735
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,660
We're all family here.

736
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,390
No need to play wise old uncle.

737
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,300
Spoken like
the famous screenwriter she is.

738
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,300
I like your little zingers.

739
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,950
Got more?

740
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,470
Next round is going to cost you.

741
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,030
Sorry to interrupt.

742
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:37,950
Mrs. Chen.

743
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,510
This came from your hometown in Shaanxi.

744
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,700
But the packaging was damaged.

745
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,430
You might want to take a look.
Just in case it's something important.

746
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:43,977
All right.

747
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,030
I got a bit of a headache.

748
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,180
Man, maybe you should head home first?

749
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,510
Zhou, sorry to be a poor host.

750
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:30,740
Let's catch up another time.

751
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,180
Sure.

752
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,300
Well, don't worry about cleaning up.

753
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,660
We're out of fruit.

754
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,780
Can you make a quick run?

755
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,550
Yes, ma'am.

756
00:45:48,977 --> 00:45:50,780
Chen Mian! What is wrong with you?

757
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,140
Do you think I'm stupid?

758
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,390
Do you take me for a fool?

759
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,110
Are you out of your mind?

760
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,390
What is this about?

761
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,180
Look for yourself.

762
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,430
Your family got the wrong address

763
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,340
and sent it to my family.

764
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,780
How can you go so low?

765
00:46:12,444 --> 00:46:14,488
After everything I've done
for the Chen family!

766
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:19,870
And now you want to welcome
your illegitimate child into the family?

767
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,430
You people are disgusting!

768
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,660
(Chen Kaixi:
Eat, drink, and live normally.)

769
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,666
(Luo Man:
This is "normal"? This is luxury!)

770
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:00,020
(Zhong Qingcheng: Some people
aren't meant to be your friends,)

771
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,920
(no matter how sweet their words are.)

772
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,200
(Luo Man: You ask what made me
understand all this.)

773
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,240
(Perhaps it's those wordless, unbearable nights
when everything felt impossible to explain.)

774
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,333
