00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,880
=Dear Enemy=

2
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,640
Do you know

3
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,790
how Chen Mian left today?

4
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,030
Honey, can you get me a shirt?

5
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,640
Thanks.

6
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,270
This...

7
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,320
This doesn't look right.

8
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,640
Don't you think

9
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,950
it shrunk?

10
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,390
Sorry, wrong piece.

11
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,040
What do you mean?

12
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,333
What is this supposed to mean?

13
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,510
Are you seeing someone?

14
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,600
I thought

15
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,880
you didn't care.

16
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,880
Who?

17
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,040
Who is that man?

18
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,990
Are you divorcing me because of him?

19
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,160
If you're curious,

20
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,110
hire someone to follow me too.

21
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,710
From now on,

22
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,200
stop calling me "Honey".

23
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,510
Do you think

24
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,240
I've read too many romance novels,

25
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:56,830
and it made me feel like

26
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,710
I had to stab him back

27
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,560
just to get even?

28
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,880
Am I being childish?

29
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,800
I always said you were dramatic.

30
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,800
But I think I'm worse.

31
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,350
It's hilarious.

32
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,880
To be honest,

33
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,880
for my marriage

34
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,640
to end up like this,

35
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,120
I know I'm also to blame.

36
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,800
Sometimes, I wonder,

37
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,440
and

38
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,320
I reflect on myself.

39
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,710
Was I too dependent,

40
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,710
investing all my time and energy

41
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,080
into the marriage,

42
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,950
only to end up where I am today?

43
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,240
You...

44
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,680
Are you all right?

45
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,760
Why should you reflect on yourself?

46
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,830
Do you think

47
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,880
Chen Mian's reflecting on anything
right now?

48
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,830
You've done so much better.

49
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,390
You know,

50
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,680
you're overthinking it.

51
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
But you're right about one thing.

52
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,640
You should put all your energy

53
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,350
into yourself.

54
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,120
No one is more important than you.

55
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:10,710
=Episode 24=
(We Are Dear Enemies)

56
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,440
You ingrate!

57
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,200
I must've been blind

58
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
to think you were the honest one!

59
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,200
You gang up with outsiders against me!

60
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,320
I'm your brother, you know?

61
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,910
But you are wrong.

62
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:27,150
(Yancheng West Station)

63
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,870
Hello?

64
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,280
I heard everything.

65
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,800
You left in a rush.

66
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,470
I applied for the transfer
to the branch hospital.

67
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,470
That's good.

68
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,470
You can train yourself there.

69
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,990
Are you leaving now?

70
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,520
Well...

71
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,710
All the best to you.

72
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,920
Take care of yourself.

73
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,640
(Six Months Later)

74
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,040
(The End)

75
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,800
You're exhausted.

76
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,280
You've been working so hard.

77
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,630
Treat yourself to a nice meal.

78
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,200
You deserve it.

79
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,160
Welcome.

80
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,400
Here.

81
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:31,680
Thank you.

82
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,350
You're welcome.

83
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,040
Is this seat taken?

84
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:12,350
What a small world.

85
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,680
Yeah.

86
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,040
I heard

87
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,350
you're really into golf lately.

88
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,400
I'm getting older.

89
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,320
I have to watch my back.

90
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,080
True.

91
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,870
You know a lot about me.

92
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,630
Of course.

93
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,110
You're a big shot.

94
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,750
It's hard not to know.

95
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,630
Why?

96
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,950
Are you

97
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,750
bowing down
to the evil food industry now?

98
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,470
Absolutely not.

99
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,130
(New Dishes Available)
They used to serve only set meats.

100
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,520
Now you can order a la carte.

101
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,750
To be precise,

102
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,320
the evil power turns over a new leaf

103
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,920
and bows down to us.

104
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,870
They surrender to you.

105
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,830
Do you want some more?

106
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:16,002
Ms. Luo,

107
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,600
you're producing good scripts now,

108
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,400
and your acting

109
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,110
is improving as well.

110
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
All thanks to you.

111
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,230
I learned from the best.

112
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,990
What's that saying?

113
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,040
"If the student succeeds,

114
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:31,230
the master has to starve."

115
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,400
That sounds familiar.

116
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,590
Actually,

117
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,990
I can guess

118
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,830
how you reacted at that time.

119
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,080
You didn't lose your temper.

120
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Am I right?

121
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:55,600
(Chen Mian)

122
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,710
Hello?

123
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,560
The money is gone.

124
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,080
All gone!

125
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,950
Why weren't you keeping an eye on it?

126
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:31,560
(Luo Man)

127
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,160
I had a feeling at that time.

128
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,400
But...

129
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,680
I feel like something about you

130
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,950
is off.

131
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,990
Maybe

132
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,950
you're being too nice.

133
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,080
And it makes me uncomfortable.

134
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,950
But?

135
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,920
Mr. Zhou,

136
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,733
you always leave your sentences hanging.

137
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,590
I'm not lying.

138
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,230
I'm telling the truth.

139
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,800
I know.

140
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,630
And that's what

141
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,280
made it

142
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,560
even scarier.

143
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,470
I'm a little tipsy now,

144
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,950
so I'll tell you the truth.

145
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,630
I know you really liked me.

146
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,590
Maybe even

147
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,280
loved me.

148
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,520
Not much,

149
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,200
but just a little, give or take,

150
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,990
right?

151
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,950
That tiny bit of love

152
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,710
is already

153
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,200
rare in you.

154
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,920
But so what?

155
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,680
Even though

156
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,560
it's rare to have
that tiny bit of love from you,

157
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,350
you still used it

158
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,800
and calculated with it.

159
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,280
In the end,

160
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,950
you trapped yourself.

161
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,190
This whole thing

162
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,520
may look like

163
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,240
it's about Chen Mian and Chen Kaixi,

164
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,110
but it's actually about us too, right?

165
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,240
But I didn't hurt you.

166
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,350
Instead,

167
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,630
you helped Chen Kaixin beat Chen Mian.

168
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,110
What did you get out of that?

169
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,320
Why does everything have to come
with benefits?

170
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,560
This question sounds unfamiliar to you.

171
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,390
You once said

172
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,110
we were the same in nature.

173
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,830
Selfish,

174
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,110
ambitious,

175
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,480
and desperate to climb to reach the top.

176
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Back then,

177
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,960
I agreed.

178
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,390
That was exactly who I was.

179
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,350
But then I realized it wasn't.

180
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,240
We're not the same.

181
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,390
You're much harder on yourself
than I am.

182
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,630
To put it bluntly,

183
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,320
you're more selfish.

184
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,590
Because when I make decisions,

185
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,755
I don't want anything in return.

186
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,480
I do it because it makes me feel great.

187
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,830
Is that okay?

188
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You and Chen Mian
are cut from the same cloth.

189
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,110
You're selfish,

190
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,480
cold,

191
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,910
and ruthless.

192
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,150
How does that saying go?

193
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,830
"You're cruel

194
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,320
because you understand."

195
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,110
Here.

196
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,960
Sometimes, I do feel bad for you.

197
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,000
I think

198
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,350
you're kind of pitiful.

199
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,590
The way you climbed

200
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,320
cost you your pride.

201
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,040
I wonder,

202
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,110
how can I expect someone

203
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,320
who's never truly

204
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,670
been loved

205
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,320
to learn how

206
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,240
to love someone else?

207
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,830
That's a tall order.

208
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,280
So

209
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,720
your selfishness is understandable.

210
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,870
I guess

211
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,910
you're lonely.

212
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,000
Well,

213
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,800
you

214
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,080
are like a maze.

215
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,560
Open one door,

216
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
and there's another.

217
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
And open that,

218
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,110
there's another behind.

219
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,320
So many doors.

220
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,870
They're hard to open.

221
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,870
It makes people believe

222
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,430
that when they open the last one,

223
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,240
there'll be treasure

224
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
in the room.

225
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,630
But when I finally got there

226
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,040
and walked into the room,

227
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,760
I realized it was empty.

228
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,110
Aren't all men like that?

229
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,000
Me.

230
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,080
Chen Mian.

231
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,390
What about Fang Chi?

232
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,960
Isn't he the same?

233
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,560
Or

234
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,000
is he just not capable
of being like us yet?

235
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,480
Zhou Musun,

236
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,430
you look pathetic right now.

251
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,430
Congrats.

252
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,390
I'm reporting
to the department head now.

Hello, Sir.

254
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,560
Hello.

255
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,520
- Ms. Luo Man.
- Ms. Man.

256
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,430
Ms. Luo Man.

257
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,110
Sun.

258
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,590
Can you tie it for me?

259
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,960
You haven't learned it yet?

Guys, we're about to enter the venue.

261
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,350
Go ahead.

262
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,280
During these months,

263
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,040
all of us went through hardships
and joys together.

264
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,910
There were

265
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,390
many unforgettable moments.

266
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,760
I want to tell everyone

267
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,520
(Celebration Banquet)
that you've done

268
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,333
(Medical Humanistic Documentary)
a great job.

269
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,190
The core of the documentary

270
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,040
is truth.

271
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,320
We capture reality,

272
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,000
express sincerity,
and show genuine emotions.

273
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,560
That's what

274
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,390
I've always asked of myself

275
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,910
and the team.

276
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,320
Today,

277
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,800
I'd like to take this opportunity

278
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,430
to express

279
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,280
our highest respect

280
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,000
to all medical workers here.

281
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,000
Thank you.

282
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,760
Cheers.

283
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,190
Good job.

284
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,910
What scene is this?

285
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,430
So sweet.

286
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,720
What a couple.

287
00:25:45,488 --> 00:25:47,150
- Dr. Liu?
- That guy is Fang Chi, right?

288
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,150
Is that Dr. Liu?

289
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,240
Who's the woman?

290
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,280
Who's she?

291
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,480
Don't look at me.

292
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,040
It's not me.

293
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,430
Eat the dishes.

294
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,520
Fang Chi surely knows who she is.

295
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,040
Who's she, Fang Chi?

296
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,870
So mysterious.

297
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,720
Come on,

298
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,240
everyone.

299

Let's hope our documentary
reaches new heights.

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,910

301
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,520
Hello, everyone.

302
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,320
We're having an amazing guest today.

303
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,720
She's currently

304
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,080
the most popular food blogger

305
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,240
and also the famous brand manager
of "Kaixi's Kitchen",

306
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,800
Ms. Chen Kaixi.

307
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,109
Let's give her a round of applause.

308
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,670
Welcome.

309
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,560
Hello everyone, I'm Chen Kaixi.

310
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,430
Hello.

311
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,150
Hello, Kaixi.

312
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,670
We're very happy to have you with us.

313
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,720
What dish will you share with us today?

314
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,630
I'm showing the Imperial Concubine
Aussie...

315
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,280
Let's welcome Ms. Chen Kaixi.

316
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,560
I read

317
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,960
your script.

318
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,150
Ms. Xi, you're busy,

319
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,590
yet you found time

320
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,190
to read my script.

321
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,870
You wrote about relationship lessons
and underwear.

322
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,390
You might as well reveal my identity.

323
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,110
That's art.

324
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,760
It's inspired by life.

325
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,080
It comes from life.

326
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,800
Besides,

327
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,150
the setting

328
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,800
and story are completely different.

329
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,910
No one will know it's you.

330
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,560
I know.

331
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,960
So this is what you think of me.

332
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,150
A crazy dummy.

333
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,480
Ms. Kaixi, you haven't
finished reading yet.

334
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,760
There's a plot twist later.
It's amazing.

335
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,910
I wish I could act in it.

336
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,670
When's the pitch?

337
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,830
Pitch?

338
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,960
It should be

339
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:25,422
before the Chinese New Year.

340
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,670
I'll go with you.

341
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,590
Really?

342
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,240
Are you sure?

343
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,590
Yes.

344
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,140
Do I get the honor of having you there?

345
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,320
If you come, a lot of people
will want to invest.

346
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,390
Then I want to go to.

347
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,240
Aren't you afraid people will find out
you're the inspiration?

348
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,040
Didn't you say
nobody would find out it's me?

349
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,670
I did,

350
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,630
but I can add on my slides:

351
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,080
"Ms. Chen Kaixi, thank you

352
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,630
for your huge contributions
to this script."

353
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,240
I'm fine with that.
That's free publicity.

354
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,150
Can you put

355
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,480
my brand logo there too?

356
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,760
Oh gosh, Xi...

357
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,080
You're really a businessperson now.

358
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,480
So practical.

359
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,040
I like it.

360
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,430
Cheers.

361
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,240
Happy Chinese New Year!
Let's all get rich!

362
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:15,240
Qingcheng, how many endorsements
do you have now?

363
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,150
I can see you everywhere these days.

364
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,560
My team is putting in some effort,

365
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,911
so there are quite a few.

366
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,870
That's great.

367
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,960
See?

368
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,280
You're popular

369
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,000
and capable

370
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,560
so brands are chasing you now.

371
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,430
That's right.

372
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,560
Capability matters.

373
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,520
By the way, Qingcheng,

374
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I really have to thank you.

375
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,960
If you hadn't taken me onto the
variety show,

376
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,830
I wouldn't have gained popularity
so fast.

377
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,240
There's no need

378
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,910
to bring this up.

379
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,040
No, I have to.

380
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:49,910
Speaking of variety shows,

381
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,000
Xi,

382
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,430
can you consider

383
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,630
Di Di's dating show?

384
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,240
It's all upside.

385
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,190
If you join,

386
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,870
first, you can promote

387
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,960
your band.

388
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,190
Second,

389
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,480
I want to

390
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,520
see you dating some cute
and handsome guy

391
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,080
and flirting with them

392
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,110
on TV

393
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,080
to teach them something.

394
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,800
That'd be fun.

395
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,590
Forget it.

396
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,960
Tiao is still young.

397
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,350
Maybe when he's older.

398
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:23,960
Is Tiao

399
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,630
back in Shanghai?

400
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,430
His dad picked him up.

401
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,080
His grandparents came.

402
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,644
It's the end of the year now.

403
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,111
It's good to let him be with them.

404
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,350
Chen Mian

405
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,430
wants to buy back the shares.

406
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,240
So

407
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,670
what do you think?

408
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,190
Well,

409
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,280
let's see who's more patient.

410
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,320
Please enjoy the food.

411
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,280
Zhou.

412
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,870
This really hits the spot.

413
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:22,755
Way better than the cold buffet
at our company's year-end dinner.

414
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,320
At least it's hot.

415
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,350
But speaking of which,

416
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,960
a divorced guy like me slipped away
from the dinner is understandable.

417
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
You are

418
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,870
a promising bachelor.

419
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,150
Why did you run?

420
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,080
There are many pretty ladies

421
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,480
at the office.

422
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,670
None of them caught your eye?

423
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,520
Or

424
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,040
is someone

425
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,390
still on your mind,

426
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,760
and you don't want to settle?

427
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,280
Enough about me.

428
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,080
You think I don't know why you run away?

429
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,350
It's because that woman

430
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,480
saw through you.

431
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,280
You're the president
of a listed company.

432
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:00,760
Attractive and promising.

433
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,800
But, in fact, you're just
a high-level employee.

434
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,720
What you earn goes to your ex-wife.

435
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,190
Zhou, I've known you for years

436
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,910
and never realized

437
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,910
you had such a mouth on you.

438
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,760
Did you learn that from Luo Man?

439
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,350
Luckily, you two broke up.

440
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,110
Back in the day,

441
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,040
I chased girls,

442
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,320
but now girls chase me.

443
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,390
I get nervous about that.

444
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,960
Do you know why?

445
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,800
Why are you nervous?

446
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,830
Women know exactly

447
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,110
what kind of man

448
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,080
they marry.

449
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,280
But men?

450
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,080
You sleep next to her

451
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,830
for over a decade

452
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,350
and still don't truly know her.

453
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:56,830
Am I

454
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,720
really stupid?

455
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,350
Yes.

456
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,910
Me too.

457
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
But there's one thing I do better.

458
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,350
I...

459
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,590
I never underestimated

460
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,910
any woman.

461
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,870
Chen Kaixi.

462
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,150
I missed her,

463
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,080
and I feel bad.

464
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,960
What's wrong?

465
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,870
The garlic smell is stinging my eyes.

466
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,480
What's with that look? It's the garlic.

467
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,520
Zhou,

468
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,800
why do I feel like
we're both so unlucky?

469
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,266
You can drop the "feel like" part.

470
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,040
Come on, drink.

471
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,500
(Beijing-Styled Copper Hotpot)

472
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,720
Isn't this Fang Chi?

473
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,080
He's got so many fans now.

474
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,720
Just one random post on Weibo

475
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
gets thousands of comments.

476
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,320
Really?

477
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,430
A lot of people are shipping him
with another girl.

478
00:33:31,688 --> 00:33:32,870
This female doctor, right?

479
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,190
It's her, right?

480
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,190
Man,

481
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,040
what's going on
between you and Fang Chi?

482
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,720
It's like

483
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,630
when you're tired,

484
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,910
you wish to see him.

485
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,040
After seeing him,

486
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,240
you can hold on a little longer.

487
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,670
It's hard to explain.

488
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,960
You're starting to sound like

489
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,110
Zhou Musun now.

490
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,750
Can you not pick up his bad habit?

491
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,590
Right.

492
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,560
Say something useful.

493
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,270
Have you two

494
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,750
done it?

495
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,520
Right, have you...

496
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:21,520
You know what I mean.

497
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,750
Hey.

498
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,790
Are you seriously asking that
so directly?

499
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,110
How indirectly should we ask then?

500
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,630
How?

501
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,310
Wait.

502
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,460
Can't we talk about something
more spiritual?

503
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,960
- I'm not interested.
- Not interested.

504
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,710
Spill it. Come on.

505
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,790
Yeah. Quick.

506
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,750
Stop asking.

507
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,520
My head's a mess right now.

508
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,040
Good.

509
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,110
A messy head is good.

510
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,933
You're so invested
that you're confused.

511
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:45,270
I see hope here.

512
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,480
I give up.

513
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,360
Happy Chinese New Year.

514
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:53,920
You too.

515
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,100
Let us know when you get home.

516
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,040
Rest up early.

517
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,520
Sure.

518
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,040
Bye.

519
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,880
Big star forever!

520
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,080
You can do this!

521
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,670
Bye.

522
00:35:06,155 --> 00:35:08,230
She has to work even
on the first day of the year.

523
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,270
That's tough.

524
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,520
You're not leaving today, are you?

525
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,400
No.

526
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,520
I'm staying with you tonight.

527
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,230
What are you still thinking about?

528
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,400
I just think

529
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,480
Fang Chi is pretty good.

530
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,670
Sure,

531
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,590
he can't compare to Zhou Musun.

532
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,480
But

533
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,960
if you're still thinking in those terms,

534
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,040
you won't be so torn.

535
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,150
I never

536
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,360
compare them.

537
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,310
They are

538
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,150
different.

539
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,520
The problem is

540
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,310
he's so young.

541
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,480
His life is full of unknowns.

542
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,590
If I get together with him,

543
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,960
our relationship is
also full of unknowns.

544
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,750
I'm busy with my work.

545
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,790
I don't have

546
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,150
the energy

547
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,520
for that kind of relationship.

548
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,710
So...

549
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,080
What's wrong with being young?

550
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,000
Isn't that a good thing?

551
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,360
Besides,

552
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,480
Fang Chi may be young,

553
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,150
but he's reliable.

554
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,000
Right?

555
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,190
What are you afraid of?

556
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,270
I'm afraid of

557
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,670
getting hurt.

558
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,000
I know Fang Chi is a reliable man.

559
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,040
But can you be sure

560
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,080
that he won't change?

561
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,960
Will he turn out
to be another Zhou Musun

562
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,710
or Chen Mian?

563
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,840
Right?

564
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,670
You're right, though.

565
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,080
I'm scared.

566
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:04,880
I surrender.

567
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,590
After the last relationship,

568
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,190
I've lost faith

569
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,040
in people

570
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,400
and in love.

571
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,750
To be blunt,

572
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,520
I can't love anymore.

573
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,040
You're describing me and Chen Mian.

574
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,630
Oh, come on.

575
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,750
Don't get sensitive.

576
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,400
Gosh.

577
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm not being sensitive.

578
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,710
It's just...

579
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,080
Man,

580
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,880
you know what?

581
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,750
In life,

582
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,790
the only constant

583
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,560
is change.

584
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,310
People

585
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,110
change.

586
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,960
You will.

587
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,080
He will.

588
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,360
Everyone will.

589
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,360
Look at me.

590
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,630
Change

591
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,000
isn't always bad.

592
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,480
You know,

593
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,630
yesterday Chen Mian
came to pick up Tiao.

594
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,150
We talked about work

595
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,750
for almost half an hour.

596
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,400
And

597
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,790
it was a happy conversation.

598
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,670
I never thought

599
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,400
that I'd feel sympathy for him one day.

600
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,110
Don't tell me you're...

601
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,520
For now,

602
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,310
we're just Tiao's parents.

603
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,520
Whatever happened,

604
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,360
for the sake of Tiao,

605
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,440
I'll still be nice to him.

606
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,670
What I really want to say is

607
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,710
don't miss out

608
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,110
on what's right in front of you

609
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,710
for something you
can't be sure of in the future.

610
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,590
You'll probably think I'm crazy.

611
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,190
But if

612
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,520
I could go back to 18,

613
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,150
I think

614
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,880
the 18-year-old Chen Kaixi

615
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,230
would still fall in love

616
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,790
with the 21-year-old Chen Mian.

617
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,670
That was love.

618
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:05,670
And I don't regret it.

619
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,520
No matter

620
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,790
what the future holds,

621
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,440
I'll be by your side

622
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,590
faithfully,

623
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,310
and I won't ever leave.

624
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:29,672
Regardless of what life will be,

625
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,840
we'll handle it,

626
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,670
right?

627
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,310
Come here.

628
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,150
You can't tie it?

629
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:07,310
(WeChat: You've got new messages.)

630
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:09,080
(Li Xiaoning:
Luo Man, you're impressive.)

631
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,280
(WeChat Group: That's Luo Man, right?
Is this official now?)

632
00:42:11,288 --> 00:42:13,240
(Script Analysis:
He's Luo Man's boyfriend, right?)

633
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,400
(Which team is she from?)

634
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,880
(It looks like Luo Man.)

635
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,080
(Ms. Luo Man, is that you?)

636
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,920
(Producer:
Of course! Look this carefully.)

637
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,560
Who's this?

638
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,923
(Fang Chi: I don't want to cause)

639
00:42:22,978 --> 00:42:25,470
(any misunderstandings
or unnecessary trouble to my friends.)

640
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,560
(People say there's light in my eyes.)

641
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:31,030
(Maybe it's because I'm looking
at someone behind the camera.)

642
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,560
Is he out of his mind?

643
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,480
What?

644
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,920
Ms. Man, is that you?

645
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:47,750
Everyone on the internet
is discussing it.

646
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,190
Me?

647
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,279
Don't try to deny it.

648
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,960
Others might not recognize you,
but I do.

649
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,480
We bought that blouse together.

650
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,590
Well done.

651
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,400
Don't be angry.

652
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:14,080
Wait for me at the hospital!

653
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,150
Happy Chinese New Year.

654
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,960
You too.

655
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,110
Well...

656
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,230

657

I...

659
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,920
Yes.

660
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,000
You finally remember it.

661
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:00,790
Mommy,

662
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,560
what are you looking at?

663
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,480
Look at this.

664
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,310
I know this character.

665

666
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,310
Look right here.

667
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:56,400
One, two, three.

668
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:57,560
Okay.

669
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,440
This topic is amazing.

670
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:06,670
Luo Man, you're here.

671
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,880
What a coincidence.

672
00:46:08,511 --> 00:46:10,177
It's an honor to finally meet you.

673
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,080
I'll head in first.

674
00:46:12,377 --> 00:46:14,040
Excuse me, may I
take a photo of you here?

676
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:36,880
All right.

678
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,880
to all winning screenwriters.

679
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,080
Please take a short break.

680
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,111

First,

684
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,110
let's welcome Luo Man

685
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,400
and her work,

686
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,440
"Dear Enemy".

687
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,040
It's the only entry

688
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,520
to receive a unanimous vote
from all the judges.

689
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,520
This work

690
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,960
not only delivers a compelling plot
and vivid characters

691
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,110
but also portrays the reality of

692
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,270
life struggles and emotions
women face.

693
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,790
Now, let's welcome

694
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,790
Ms. Luo Man

695
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,230
to share some thoughts about her work.

696
00:47:15,218 --> 00:47:17,560
(Dear Enemy written by Luo Man)

697
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,270
Eileen Chang once said,

698
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,480
"All women are in the same trade."

699
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,400
She was referring

700
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,560
to the rivalry among women.

701
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,270
But I believe

702
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,880
beyond that,

703
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,560
all women are allies.

704
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,400
The relationships between women

705
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,560
can be

706
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,270
complex,

707
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,360
ever-changing,

708
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,880
and profound.

709
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,230
They can be enemy

710
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,110
or friends,

711
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,880
or even dear enemies.

712
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,150
My story

713
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,630
depicts a group of such women who,

714
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,040
after understanding each other's lives,

715
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,750
extend a hand

716
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,400
to one another

717
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,150
and to themselves.

718
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,190
Of course,

719
00:48:18,244 --> 00:48:20,230
there's a little personal
sentiment in this too.

720
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,960
I want to dedicate this story

721
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,150
to all the lovely women

722
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,040
who've graced my life.
