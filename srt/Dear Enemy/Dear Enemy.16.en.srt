00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,460
I mean,

3
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,180
this is a good thing, in a way.

4
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,180
Right?

5
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,980
We've known the result,

6
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,740
and then just follow
through with treatment.

7
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,630
Right?

8
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,540
Besides, the healthcare here is
definitely better than back home.

9
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,670
Right?

10
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:20,140
But our insurance is from our hometown.

11
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,540
Can we even get reimbursed here?

12
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,860
I'm not sure either.

13
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,820
Anyway,

14
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,755
just make sure to get
the official invoice.

15
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,020
We'll deal with reimbursement later.

16
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,510
Don't even worry about the money.

17
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,190
Treatment comes first.

18
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,790
Dad.

19
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,790
I owe you an apology.

20
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,420
Don't be mad at me anymore.

21
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:46,110
You need to eat well
so you have the energy to nag me

22
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,377
about getting married.
Keep nagging me till I'm 80, okay?

23
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,740
By the time you're 80,

24
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,190
how old would I be?

25
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,470
And

26
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,670
who's going to care

27
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,140
whether you're married or not by then?

28
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,020
Do whatever you want.

33
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:46,070
and still not known a single doctor?

Hey, Xi.

38
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,620
Could you introduce me

39
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,980
to that cousin of Chen Mian's?

40
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,710
The doctor?

41
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,110

45
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,620
Over here!

46
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,030
Don't run. The floor's slippery.

47
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,380
Don't worry.

48
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,740
Modern medicine has come a long way.

49
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,860
If something's wrong, we'll treat it.

50
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,740
Besides,
Mr. Luo's always been quite healthy.

51
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,980
It's going to be okay.

52
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,670
I...

53
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,740
Kaixi!

54
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,470
Ms. Luo.

55
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,740
You're here.

56
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,060
I already had my senior
look at the report.

57
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,500
Still, I'd recommend

58
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,060
a follow-up at our hospital.

59
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,420
Is it cancer?

60
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,860
We can't say for sure yet.

61
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,270
The nodule's a bit large,

62
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,740
and there are some irregular edges.

63
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,110
But that doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

64
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,180
It's best to wait
for the full test results

65
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,480
before jumping to conclusions.

66
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,350
Here's what we'll do.

67
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,860
You should

68
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,110
download our hospital's app.

69
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,150
It's easier
to book appointments that way.

70
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,350
Here.

71
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,060
Appointments open every day at 4 PM.

72
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,980
You might want to set a reminder.

73
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,940
Here.

74
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,110
(Appointment Details)
Book Dr. Xie. He's a specialist.

75
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:20,710
Does the patient have medical insurance?

76
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:21,300
Yes.

77
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,511
Local or from another region?

78
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,180
Another region.

79
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,230
Then, I suggest you apply
for out-of-town

80
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,540
insurance coverage right away.

81
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,980
Hold on. Let me jot that down.

82
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,350
Every day...

83
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,940
4 PM.

84
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,590
Book...

85
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,150
Dr. Xie.

86
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,060
Dr. Xie.

87
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,590
Out-of-town coverage.

88
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,060
Got it.

89
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,300
Out-of-town coverage.

90
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,380
Anything else?

91
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,670
Don't be too stressed.

92
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,470
These days, lots of nodules

93
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,110
don't require surgery.

94
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,350
Even if surgery is needed,

95
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,350
the technology is very advanced now.

96
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,710
It'll be okay.

97
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,150
Thank you,

Fang Chi.

100
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,150
Fang Chi, would it be okay
to add you on WeChat?

101
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,060
Sure.

102
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,330
I'll start a group chat for us.

103
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,230
Okay.

104
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,470
Thanks.

105
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,155
Kaixi. Ms. Luo. Reach out anytime
if you have more questions.

106
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,400
I need to get back to work.

107
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,740
Thanks.

108
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,500
Thank you.

109
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,790
Thank you.

110
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,670
What's there to thank me for?

111
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,740
Don't worry about it.

112
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,830
It'll be okay.

113
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,380
Slow down.

114
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,790
Unbelievable.

115
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,670
My mom told me,

116
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,244
apparently,

117
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:49,180
my dad's known
about this nodule for years.

118
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,590
He never mentioned it to me.

119
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,830
And look at him.

120
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,030
Doesn't smoke,
doesn't drink, and exercises regularly.

121
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,470
Yells at me

122
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,270
like he's invincible.

123
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,670
I didn't expect...

124
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,150
Older folks are like that sometimes.

125
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,500
People are like cars.

126
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,790
Once they're out of warranty,

127
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,790
some parts are bound to break down.

128
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,980
Give it a little maintenance,

129
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,300
and it can still keep going.

130
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,910
Try not to overthink it.

131
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:15,380
Come to me if you need anything.

132
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,980
Thank you, Xi.

133
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,380
No need to thank me.

134
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,350
And

135
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,350
I'm sorry

136
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,590
for the things I said

137
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
that day...

138
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,590
I'm sorry too.

139
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,470
Don't get all emotional.

140
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,110
Yes, that was too mushy.

141
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,470
Why were you at the hospital?

142
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,860
I'm pregnant.

143
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,110
That's amazing news!

144
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,470
It's like the heavens
sent you this child.

145
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,020
Congratulations.

146
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,550
Dear, I'm going to take a shower.

147
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,470
Honey! Honey!

148
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,860
Tell me.

149
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,140
This is real, right?

150
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,830
How could it not be?

151
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,550
I'm so happy!
I can't believe this, Honey!

152
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,830
I'm over the moon!

153
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,020
Honey,
when's the first prenatal checkup?

154
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,830
I'm coming with you.

155
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,070
Next Monday.

156
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:13,110
Honey, do you know what this means?

157
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,470
I'm finally having a daughter!

158
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,110
Honey,

159
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,590
you know Chen has two daughters.

160
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,790
He brags about them every day.

161
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,310
We don't know if it's a girl yet.

162
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,620
Come on. Let's go tell Tiao.

163
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,950
He's going to have a little sister.

164
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:25,830
It hasn't even been three months yet.

165
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,980
Honey,

166
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,660
I've got a feeling.

167
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,780
This time,

168
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,310
we're definitely having a little girl.

169
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,190
Just imagine.

170
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,020
I'll be ringing the bell soon.

171
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,860
The four of us can ring it together.

172
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,590
Double blessings, right?

173
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,140
Right.

174
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,044
Honey, it's really not my fault.

175
00:10:41,044 --> 00:10:43,060
A meeting came up last minute.
I couldn't skip it.

176
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:43,950
But don't worry.

177
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,500
I talked to Fang Chi.

178
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
If you need anything, just go to him.
Be good.

179
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,380
Okay, I got it.

180
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,310
Honey,

181
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,355
once the exam's done,

182
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:53,422
promise me
you'll tell me everything right away.

183
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,500
Next time.

184
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,550
Next time I swear I'll be there.

185
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,190
It's fine. It's not my first baby.

186
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,140
I know what I'm doing.

187
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,620
Patient No. 10.

188
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,070
The doctor's calling. I'm hanging up.

189
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,950
Take your time. Easy.

190
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,190
I'm fine.

191
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,250
(Man)

192
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,550
Hello?

193
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,230
Hey, Xi.

194
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,430
I want to see
that cousin of Chen Mian.

195
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:40,111
He is also a professional doctor, right?

196
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,140
My dad's test results just came back.

197
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,500
His lungs don't look great.

198
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,710
Don't worry.

199
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:50,710
I'm actually
at the main hospital right now.

200
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,780
Just bring the report and come over.

201
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,140
Okay. Thanks.

202
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,110
I'll be waiting.

(Failed. Xie Zhenhua is fully booked.

206
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,177
Why is this harder than scoring tickets

207
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:32,470
to a sold-out concert?

208
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:38,510
(Failed. Xie Zhenhua is fully booked.

209
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:58,950
Yes?

210
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,740
Hello?

211
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,980
Dr. Fang.

212
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,230
Well,

213
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,070
can you spare a moment?

214
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,660
Go ahead.

215
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,470
I wanted to ask you something.

216
00:13:11,511 --> 00:13:13,733
I've been trying to book
that appointment for two days,

217
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:14,620
but no luck.

218
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,860
I wanted to check...

219
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,980
Do you know anyone at the hospital...

220
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,830
I don't.

221
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:23,020
I haven't rotated
to that department yet.

222
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,190
That director hasn't taught me either.

223
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,350
Got it.

224
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,710
Sorry to bother you.

225
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,230
Wait.

226
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:32,600
On the day Dr. Xie sees patients,

227
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,955
they release a few extra slots

228
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,860
early in the morning at the hospital.

229
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,020
Can you make it?

230
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,140
Of course.

231
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,550
Absolutely.

232
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,110
Send me the patient's information.

233
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:42,950
I'll have my senior take another look.

234
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,830
Don't stress.

235
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,550
We'll figure this out together.

236
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,310
All right.

237
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,470
Thanks.

(Yancheng First People's Hospital

240
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,860
They say this hospital

241
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,740
won't fix things.

242
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,830
Maybe there's no point in coming at all.

243
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,310
It's fine.
It'll be one less burden on you.

244
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,620
Don't overthink it, Mom.
It's going to be fine.

245
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,350
Line up.

246
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,470
Get in line.

247
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,860
Stay in line.

248
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,140
Line up.

249
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,470
Where are you going?

250
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,140
Hey!

251
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,380
Get in line.

252
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,470
Get back here.

253
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,260
Get in line.

254
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,430
Follow the order.

255
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,020
Thanks for cooperating.

256
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,329
I picked your stuff up.

257
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,310
And I said I was sorry.

258
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,980
You don't expect me
to kneel down, do you?

259
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,470
Sorry.

260
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:09,160
(The Third Affiliated Hospital
of Yancheng)

261
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,310
No more slots?

262
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,350
Yes. Dr. Xie's appointments
are fully booked today.

263
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,800
Would you like to book someone else?

264
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,980
Ji Xiang, then.

265
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,830
All right.

266
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:25,620
Thank you.

267
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,070
You've already had an appointment.

268
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,660
Dr. Xie on Friday. An extra slot.

269
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,830
Thank you.

270
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,470
Not at all.

271
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,190
Thank you.

272
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,070
You really helped me out.

273
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,980
It wasn't me.

274
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,070
It wasn't you?

275
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,660
Was it Xi?

276
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,900
I didn't tell her.

277
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,350
Maybe it was Mr. Zhou.

278
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,860
Zhou Musun.

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,790
The other day when we
were playing badminton,

280
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,430
Chen Mian mentioned your dad.

281
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,620
Zhou overheard.

282
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,780
He later asked me for the details.

283
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,260
I'd already talked to Dr. Xie,

284
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,260
but he just told me

285
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,230
the patient got added to the list.

286
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,230
I asked everyone I could.

287
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:24,066
Turns out, someone already came through.

288
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,020
It's settled now. Thanks for the help.

289
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,140
Still, thank you.

294
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,550
Yes?

295
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:22,110
Why aren't you saying anything?

296
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,180
I just...

297
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,070
wanted to say

298
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,990
thank you.

299
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,420
You got the appointment?

300
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,180
Why didn't you tell me

301
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,140
something so important?

302
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,750
Because I...

303
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,350
I'm on a business trip.

304
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:02,860
I'll see you when I'm back.

305
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,590
We'll talk soon.

306
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,620
Qi is really something.

307
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,660
Our two kids...

308
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,510
If they get too hyped at home,

309
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,270
they'll probably blow the roof off.

310
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,550
However,

311
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,270
if I could have a third,

312
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,350
I think I'd want one.

313
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,510
Really?

314
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,110
They do say

315
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,900
the more, the merrier.

316
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,750
What was I saying just now?

317
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,420
My brain's been clueless
since I gave birth.

318
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:06,860
Right. I was talking
about my two kids. Our oldest.

319
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,180
When he was home alone,

320
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,711
before the second one came along,

321
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:12,550
he was a tyrant.

322
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,700
He ruled like a king.

323
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,460
The whole world had to play with him.

324
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,620
But after the second one arrived,

325
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,900
we never even told him
to take care of his little brother.

326
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,510
One day, out of nowhere,

327
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,030
he just learned to share.

328
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,140
It was a huge change.

329
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,933
So it's true having a younger sibling
really does change things.

330
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,900
When I was pregnant with Tiao,

331
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,180
I had horrible symptoms.

332
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
I heard the second one's easier?

333
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,660
Not always.

334
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,550
With my first,

335
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,030
I had zero symptoms.

336
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,070
Ate like normal...

337
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,380
Your mommy is having a little baby...

338
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,030
100%.

339
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,070
100%.

Look at this.

346
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,420
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,110
Who sent it?

348
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,030
Dad, didn't you always say that thing?

349
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,030
On a strategic level,

350
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,550
underestimate your enemy.

351
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,510
But on a tactical level,
take them seriously.

352
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,220
Now is exactly
the time to use that line.

353
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,620
Smile a little. It's good for you.

354
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,220
Tiao,

355
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,620
do you want a baby brother or sister?

356
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,790
I want a baby brother.

357
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:34,600
Didn't you say you were jealous

358
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,044
that Wang Zihan has a little sister?

359
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,700
If I have a baby brother,

360
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,350
when he grows up,
he can protect you too.

361
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,350
Protecting me is Daddy's job.

362
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,590
Not yours or your sibling's.

363
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,940
But Daddy is never home.

364
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,860
Because Daddy has to work.

365
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,550
If Daddy didn't work,

366
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,790
you wouldn't have all that Lego
to play with.

367
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,620
Mommy.

368
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,350
What's wrong?

369
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,750
What if the baby is cuter

370
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,860
than me?

371
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,830
Even if there's a new baby,
whether it's a brother or a sister,

372
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:25,990
I will always
love you the most. Alright?

375
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,590
I feel all right.

376
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,420
Just a bit dizzy all the time.

377
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,140
Like I'm tipsy or something.

378
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,350
How's your dad?

379
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,220
Are you managing okay?

380
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,420
Still hanging in there.

381
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,550
Honestly,

382
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,750
I really like

383
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,700
the script I'm working on now.

384
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,860
Every day

385
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
I escape into writing for a bit.

386
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,460
Forget the outside world...

387
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,830
How do I explain it?

388
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,940
It's like therapy.

389
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,270
Especially since
you're getting paid too.

390
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,310
This script is my lifeline right now.

391
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,700
Every word I type

392
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,550
is like lighting incense.

393
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,270
Only one word I can think
of to describe it. Devotion.

394
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,510
What about you?

395
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,510
How are things over there?

396
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,990
Chen Mian must be over the moon.

397
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,830
He's busy with the IPO stuff.

398
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,460
Same old.

399
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,270
Women don't really need a man,

400
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,420
as long as they can let go
of the attachment.

401
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,460
Man?

402
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,380
Man?

403
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,900
Where'd she go?

404
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,590
Must've fallen asleep.

405
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,270
Hello?

406
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,660
What terrible timing, huh?

407
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,070
We just paid the down payment
on the house,

408
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,180
and then your dad gets diagnosed.

409
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,900
Yes.

410
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,070
If only we'd saved that money,

411
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,380
we'd be in a better position.

412
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,660
But your dad told me
the other day, quietly...

413
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,940
Even if he'd known he was sick,

414
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,380
he still would've bought the house.

415
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,510
He didn't want his situation
to affect you.

416
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,860
He said if we don't buy now,

417
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,510
we'll never be able to afford it.

418
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,140
But why does my dad do this?

419
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,140
Why does he insist on buying a place?

420
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,660
Did someone say something to him again?

421
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,590
Is he comparing himself
to someone else again?

422
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,030
No.

423
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,070
He's just full of regret.

424
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,460
He said back when Chen Kaixi graduated,

425
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,270
her family bought her
a place right away.

426
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,900
We couldn't afford
to do that at the time.

427
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,700
And you earned
half of this money yourself.

428
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,310
He sees this house

429
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,030
as your asset.

430
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,460
A woman who owns a home,

431
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,620
whatever happens,

432
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,420
will always have more confidence.

433
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,220
Dad, he...

434
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:18,990
Mom.

435
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,620
Um...

436
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,510
I'll transfer

437
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,220
the money to you.

438
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,700
Then,

439
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,220
pay the hospital fees

440
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,830
from your own account.

441
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,750
Will 300,000 be enough?

442
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,110
Will you still have enough for yourself?

443
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,180
I'm fine.

444
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,866
Don't worry. The producer said

445
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:45,590
they're wiring
the next payment next week.

446
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,660
I'll be fine.

447
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,550
It's in the contract. They have to pay.

448
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,830
All right, then.

449
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,220
Is this the right account?

450
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,550
Yes.

451
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,310
Come with me.

452
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,590
Thanks, Fang...

453
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,310
Of course.

454
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,030
Fang Chi.

455
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,620
Thank you.

456
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:05,220
Are the family members all here?

457
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,220
Yes.

458
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,639
What's your relation to the patient?

459
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,380
I'm his daughter.

460
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,310
This is my mother.

461
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,030
Doctor,

462
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,860
just tell us the truth.

463
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,420
I can take it.

464
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,140
I want to know

465
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,460
the real situation.

466
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,140
Very well.

467
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,750
Here's what we've got.

468
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,110
The original issue

469
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,350
wasn't too serious.

470
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,070
We thought it was just a lung nodule.

471
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,420
At worst, early-stage cancer

472
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,940
is easily removed with surgery.

473
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,750
But

474
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,270
in this scan,

475
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,860
the lymph nodes don't look good.

476
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,590
There's a chance it's metastasized.

477
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,660
That complicates things.

478
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,940
So...

479
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,420
What should we do now, Doctor?

480
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,860
I recommend admitting him

481
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:50,590
and scheduling surgery right away.

482
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,860
Doctor, should we...

483
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,750
- No.
- No.

484
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:01,822
Doctor, we'll do as you say.

485
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,940
Let's do the surgery.

486
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,750
All right.

487
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,244
Hello, Ms. Ning, so sorry.

488
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:21,110
There's been some stuff
going on at home.

489
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,510
Episode ten is almost done.

490
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,220
Luo Man, are you free tomorrow?

491
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,990
Could you come to the office?

492
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,620
The office?

493
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,180
What's up?

494
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,940
There's been a problem

495
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,140
with the project.

496
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,140
There's a high chance

497
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:37,310
the show's getting scrapped.

498
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,220
Okay.

499
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,350
I'll...

500
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,070
see you tomorrow.

501
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,790
Don't worry, Mom.

502
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,510
We'll hire a nanny.

503
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,310
We've been through this before.

504
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,900
All right, then.

505
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,990
Okay. Bye.

506
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,350
Sorry about that.

507
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,510
Have some tea.

508
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,070
Thanks.

509
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,660
Ms. Kaixi,

510
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,790
you look amazing.

511
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,030
You're glowing.

512
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,510
Am I?

513
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,070
Your baby is so considerate.

514
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,070
This baby has been really easy.

515
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,220
I haven't felt sick at all.

516
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,030
I remember
when I was pregnant with Tiao.

517
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,220
I'd throw up

518
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,070
no matter what I ate.

519
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,940
My dad even made

520
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,350
special nutritious meals for me.

521
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,790
But I couldn't eat a single bite.

522
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,790
And at night I'd get cravings.

523
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,510
Like that stinky tofu
near the university.

524
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,110
Chen Mian would drive miles
just to get it for me.

525
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,140
Thinking back,

526
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,750
I was so extra.

527
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,030
No wonder Mr. Mian's always worried.

528
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,110
He rushed out of a meeting
just to get home.

529
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,180
He was already at the gate

530
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,800
when they told him
he had another meeting

531
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:53,859
and had to fly to Shanghai.

532
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,940
That's why he asked me
to bring this stuff to you.

533
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,620
He's always making
a big deal out of things.

534
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,030
With so much on his plate,

535
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,310
he's still worrying about this.

536
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,990
There's a lot here. It must be heavy.

537
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,622
Sorry to make you come all this way.

538
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:07,480
Thank you very much.

539
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,700
It's no trouble. Just part of my job.

540
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,620
Wait here.

541
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,790
Ms. Kaixi,

542
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,700
you're too kind.

543
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,422
I can't accept this.

544
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,270
Working under Chen Mian

545
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,590
must keep you busy.

546
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,510
Take it.

547
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,380
No need to be polite.

548
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,590
You and Mr. Mian have always been
so kind to me.

549
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,310
That's because you've earned it.

550
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,700
I'll take my leave, then.

551
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,860
By the way,

552
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,790
does Tiao know yet?

553
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,790
Does he want a little brother or sister?

554
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,460
He says he wants a brother.

555
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,510
But Chen Mian and I
are hoping for a girl.

556
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,180
You know how it is.

557
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,270
We've already had a boy,

558
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,660
so now we're hoping for a girl

559
00:33:58,711 --> 00:33:59,933
to complete the "perfect pair."

560
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,030
I'll get going.

561
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:11,910
Your order.

562
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,300
Thank you.

563
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,220
I said I'd treat you
to Japanese cuisine.

564
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,820
I've already made the reservation.

565
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,300
A cold night like this
calls for something hot and warm.

566
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,390
It's the perfect thing.

567
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,030
I promised

568
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,620
this meal was on me.

569
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,550
We're close enough not to split hairs.

570
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:32,155
Let's have something
a little more warming.

571
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,950
All right. This will do.

572
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,220
What are you doing?

573
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,688
Let me be a little formal for once.

574
00:34:42,688 --> 00:34:43,510
Take it.

575
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,470
A toast to Director Jiang

576
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,590
for all your help.

577
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,030
Much appreciated.

578
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,110
Here's to you.

579
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,070
That's it?

580
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:56,740
Cheers.

581
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,140
I'll drink.

582
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,260
You don't have to.

583
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,260
Spicy!

584
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,590
Too strong.

585
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:10,422
You don't have to drink it!

586
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,470
You're not supposed to...

587
00:35:12,288 --> 00:35:13,620
It's fine. It's just one glass.

588
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,470
You still have a meeting after this.

589
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,340
Well, you're the one who said

590
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,220
a little alcohol helps you warm up.

591
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:21,820
You're something else.

592
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:25,222
Seriously, though,
the winters down here are no joke.

593
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,470
It's colder inside than out.

594
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,300
My room feels like a freezer.

595
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,590
And the heater's broken too.

596
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:33,419
Good thing
I brought an electric blanket.

597
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,650
Otherwise, I'd be frozen stiff.

598
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,180
Then, stay at my place tonight.

599
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,260
It's nice and cozy.

600
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,870
Close by, too.

601
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,910
It's late, anyway.

602
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,466
No need to run around in the cold.

603
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,070
Sure.

604
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:55,155
Let's get some vegetables in the pot.

605
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,870
Projects have dried up lately.

606
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,910
The streets feel empty.

607
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,590
Yes.

608
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,550
This time of year,

609
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,660
there used to be over
a hundred crews working.

610
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,910
Now? Barely a dozen.

611
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:21,910
No one's even posting crew calls
on social media anymore.

612
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:25,870
Have you locked down
your shooting location yet?

613
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,110
Not yet.

614
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,550
I'm thinking of checking out
nearby places.

615
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,340
Jiaxing, Shaoxing, and maybe Huzhou.

616
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:36,510
You think you'll be able
to start shooting

617
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,990
after the Chinese New Year?

618
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,990
Should be fine.

619
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,740
Once your shoot wraps,

620
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:44,510
the timing should line up just right.

621
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,430
Okay.

622
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,510
Hello?

623
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,910
I'm still out.

624
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,550
Okay. I'll head back in a bit.

625
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,430
All right. See you.

626
00:37:07,044 --> 00:37:09,180
The director needs
to rehearse tomorrow's scene.

627
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,740
Says I need to head back now.

628
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,510
I've already hailed a cab.

629
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,660
I'll drop you off first,

630
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,390
and then update the destination.

631
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,340
What? Why are you smiling?

632
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,820
Remember what you've asked me before?

633
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:31,660
You asked what you weren't
doing right in your performance.

634
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,555
The truth is,
there's no "right" or "wrong."

635
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,660
You're doing really well.

636
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,740
Except sometimes,

637
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,590
you just do a bit too much.

638
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,340
You're smart.

639
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,620
That's the thing. You're too smart.

640
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,950
I think that's our ride.

641
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,620
Get in.

642
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,700
I want to walk a bit more.

643
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,430
You head back.

644
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,820
Text me when you get there.

645
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,780
Yes.

646
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,430
I get that you've taken a hit too,

647
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:38,220
but I'm not even

648
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,260
asking for the full amount, right?

649
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,180
At least pay me for the draft.

650
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,220
I did put in the work...

651
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,660
All right.

652
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,110
Okay. I'll wait for your update.

653
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,070
Di Di...

654
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,620
Well...

655
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,950
I know what you're getting at.

656
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,340
Don't worry.

657
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,180
I will get the money back.

658
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,870
Don't worry about it.

659
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,740
I've got it.

660
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:13,730
(The Balance and Debt Status of Luo Man)

661
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,470
Ms. Cindy?

662
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,220
About that new project...

663
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:20,444
You're not moving forward with it?

664
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,510
All right.

665
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,990
I can talk. Go ahead.

666
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:33,605
Yes.

667
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,910
I understand, Ms. Ning.

668
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,660
This is the actual situation.

669
00:39:38,244 --> 00:39:39,180
Yes,

670
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,220
but we hope you can understand us too.

671
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,390
I've got a whole team
of screenwriters under me,

672
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,740
you know?

673
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,955
We've been working nonstop
for days revising everything.

674
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,950
You've seen the quality of the script.

675
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,430
And the Chinese New Year's coming.

676
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,133
People need to get home
for the holidays.

677
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,300
Yes, but don't you think

678
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,110
the payment

679
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,180
for three episodes is just
a bit too low?

680
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,780
Right? I mean...

681
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,422
We all work in the same circle.

682
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,110
We'll keep running into each other.

683
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,140
Okay.

684
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,110
All right.

685
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,620
I'll wait for your update, then.

686
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,990
Okay. Bye, Ms. Ning.

687
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,220
A caregiver?

688
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,390
I don't need one.

689
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,660
Says who?

690
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,030
Sure, you feel fine now.

691
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,740
You can walk and run.

692
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,470
Mom and I can take care of you.

693
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:36,600
But once you've had surgery
and you're lying in bed,

694
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,260
what if my mom and I can't keep up?

695
00:40:38,288 --> 00:40:39,733
My mom's health isn't great either.

696
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:41,110
If she ends up sick too, what then?

697
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,110
You want me
to take care of both of you by myself?

698
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:44,911
Man, I'll be fine.

699
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:47,070
Your dad doesn't like
being looked after by strangers.

700
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,990
And I'm not comfortable with it either.

701
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,820
What's there to be uncomfortable about?

702
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,140
I'll hire a male caregiver who is

703
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,740
more professional and stronger than you.

704
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,170
My dad will be more comfortable, too.

705
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:56,220
What's the big deal?

706
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,260
I know.

707
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,220
You just don't want

708
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,470
to spend the money.

709
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,260
But money's money.

710
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,700
Earn what you need to,
and spend what needs spending.

711
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,740
I can make more money.

712
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,950
Mr. Luo,

713
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,660
having a daughter is a blessing.

714
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,180
You're a lucky man.

715
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,300
Yes. Lucky guy,

716
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,910
big talk.

717
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,140
Dr. Fang is here.

718
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,740
Mr. Luo, and Mrs. Luo.

719
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,977
Dr. Fang, you're a busy man.

720
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,510
You didn't have to check on me.

721
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,390
It's no trouble.

722
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:28,177
I was coming to consult
my senior anyway,

723
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,070
and saw your pre-op report.

724
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,260
He said all your indicators look good.

725
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,700
If your follow-up tests

726
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,740
come back clean,

727
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,070
then you're all set for surgery.

728
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,550
Thank you.

729
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,430
Dr. Fang.

730
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,910
Is there anything else
we should be aware of?

731
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,260
You're the patient.

732
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,955
You need to stay positive, stay calm,

733
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,620
and go into surgery with peace of mind.

734
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,620
Right?

735
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,590
Be calm and happy.

736
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,780
With a caregiver,

737
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,950
we'll all feel more at ease.

738
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,620
Okay.

739
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,700
I'll do what Dr. Fang says.

740
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:00,620
All right.

741
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,309
Dad, what do you want to eat tomorrow?

742
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,622
I'll bring it to the hospital.

743
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,110
By the way,

744
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,070
Dr. Fang,

745
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,910
is there anything my dad shouldn't eat?

746
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,990
Not really.

747
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,260
Just keep his spirits up.

748
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,470
Hear that? Mood is everything.

749
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,950
Thank you, Dr. Fang.

750
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,590
Dear, you're back.

751
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,444
Just sleep, Honey.

752
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:19,590
Don't mind me.

753
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:22,990
Maybe you should take a shower.

754
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,180
It'll help you feel better.

755
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,340
I can't.

756
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:27,910
You can't?

757
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,340
I can't...

758
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:33,911
Those bunch of losers...

759
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,700
Who gave them this bad habit?

760
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,870
Do they think I can't do without them?

761
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,070
You reek of cigarettes.

762
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,110
You quit when I was pregnant

763
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,870
with Tiao.

764
00:43:58,990 --> 00:43:59,820
Now...

765
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,820
If you're working late,
just sleep at the office.

766
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,260
You didn't have to come home.

767
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,220
Honey, if I don't come home,
who's going to help you to the bathroom?

768
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,780
Holding it in is bad for you.

769
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:19,930
Do you think I won't pee
if you're not here?

770
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:20,911
Go.

771
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,030
Don't watch me.

772
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,422
I can't go if you're standing there.

773
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:33,700
Okay.

774
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,660
Stop teasing me!

775
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,590
Dear?

776
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,870
You're awake?

777
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,590
What time is it?

778
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,180
11 PM.

779
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,340
I slept for that long?

780
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,070
I had a dream.

781
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,220
I couldn't wake up. It was awful.

782
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,990
Are you hungry?
Do you want something to eat?

783
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,820
I have no energy at all.

784
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,820
That's why you need to eat.

785
00:46:23,111 --> 00:46:25,110
You only get your energy back
after you eat.

786
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,260
Get up.

787
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,510
Let's go sit in the garden for a bit.

788
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,070
It's too cold.

789
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,030
Once the surgery's done,

790
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,510
who knows how long it'll be
before I can go again.

791
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,470
I'll get your hat, then.

792
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,088
This will keep you warm.

793
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,510
Keep this safe.

794
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:44,044
(Bank account PIN. Stock account PIN.
Insurance policy number.)

795
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:54,990
Dad, what is...

796
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:57,822
What is the meaning of this?

797
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,070
Don't worry.

798
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,740
I'm just planning ahead, just in case.

799
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,910
The surgery probably

800
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,070
won't come to that.

801
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,950
In the worst case,

802
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:15,510
even if it's malignant,
and even if it's spread, so what?

803
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,820
There's still chemo.

804
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,660
There's still hope.

805
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,260
Don't stress yourself out.

806
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,340
I'm just sorry

807
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,550
to trouble you.

808
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:28,340
I'm really sorry.

809
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,070
You're my dad.

810
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,340
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

811
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,390
Don't apologize to me.

812
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,590
I know you too well.

813
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,620
You've always been so proud.

814
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,870
You came all this way

815
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:04,550
to the big city on your own.

816
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,820
Your mother and I couldn't help

817
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,030
with anything.

818
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,430
We always felt guilty about that.

819
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,740
And you've got that personality.

820
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,510
Smart on the outside,

821
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:18,620
but soft and stubborn underneath.

822
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,870
Just like me.

823
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,910
You've taken your fair share of hits.

824
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,340
I just...

825
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:27,740
In case...

826
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,470
And I mean just in case.

827
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,590
If anything were to happen,

828
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,950
I wouldn't worry

829
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,820
about your mother.

830
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,550
I know you'll take care of her.

831
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,740
But

832
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:43,950
what about you?

833
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,300
You're all alone.

834
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,140
Who's going
to take care of my little girl?

835
00:50:03,577 --> 00:50:05,070
What time is the surgery tomorrow?

836
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,780
First one in the morning.

837
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,550
Maybe the doctor will be more focused.

838
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,550
Right?

839
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:13,470
Are you coming back

840
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,590
to my place tonight?

841
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,070
Not tonight.

842
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,590
I got a room across from the hospital.

843
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,030
I'm just going to crash there.

844
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,740
I have something for you.

845
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,820
I asked the Moon Pavilion chef

846
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,590
to prepare some food just for you.

847
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,140
All your favorites.

848
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,070
No matter how busy you are tomorrow,
you have to eat something.

849
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,740
Your body won't make it otherwise.

850
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,660
And these supplements
for after the surgery,

851
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,140
to help your father recover.

852
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,180
Check with the doctor

853
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,820
which ones are okay to take.

854
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,550
All right.

855
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,620
I'm heading up.

856
00:51:02,177 --> 00:51:04,000
Is the kid behaving at preschool?

857
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:05,780
He's okay. Just keeps talking about you.

858
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,700
Really? That's good.

859
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:10,780
Don't spoil him too much
when you go back.

860
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,820
Well, a little spoiling never hurts.

861
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,030
That's what childhood is for.

862
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,030
Do you want

863
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,550
to come up too?

864
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:44,320
(Guess I've finally
seen Yancheng at 5 AM.)

865
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,700
(Luo Man: Guess I've finally
seen Yancheng at 5 AM.)
