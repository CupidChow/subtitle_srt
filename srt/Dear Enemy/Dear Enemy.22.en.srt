1
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,880
=Dear Enemy=

2
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,460
Ms. Xu, how will you be heading back?

3
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,510
Want me to have the driver take you?

4
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,133
Thank you, but I already called a ride.

5
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,030
Luo Man.

6
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,510
Don't worry.

7
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,750
I'm a woman of my word.

8
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,590
I really liked that story of yours.

9
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,460
I read the whole thing in one sitting
after Mr. Zhou sent it to me.

10
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,510
Let's talk more next week.
Get into the details.

11
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,190
Sounds good.

12
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,260
I'll call you.

13
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,790
Watch out.

14
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,190
I've got to keep

15
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,540
our precious screenwriter safe.

16
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,700
Not to lie, Ms. Xu.

17
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,910
I've been following that story

18
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,350
since the first page.

19
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,540
I like to think

20
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,670
I've contributed a little.

21
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,888
A huge contribution, actually.

22
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,470
Maybe when the credits roll,

23
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,790
I should get something like...

24
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,190
Story consultant?

25
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,510
Original concept?

26
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,790
Mr. Zhou.

27
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,950
Fund us and your name
can go anywhere you want.

28
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,510
Right?

29
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,670
Sure. You're the boss.

30
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,470
My ride's here.

31
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,190
Luo Man, it's a date.

32
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,977
See you next week.

33
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,700
Bye-bye.

34
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,540
Take care.

35
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:50,980
Bye.

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,910
Ms. Xu's got

37
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,350
a sharp eye.

38
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,980
That Chinese New Year hit?

39
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,630
She rescued it from a pile

40
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,580
of rejected scripts.

41
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,140
She's got a serious pull.

42
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,070
Thanks again.

43
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,910
Well, I should...

44
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,860
Would you like

45
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,580
to take a walk?

46
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,790
I'm kind of tired,

47
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,820
and I'm wearing heels.

48
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,230
That's fine.

49
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,470
I can

50
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,260
carry you.

51
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,860
Walking a bit

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,580
after drinking

53
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,790
helps clear the head.

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,470
Otherwise,

55
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,466
you'll have a headache
when you get in the car.

56
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,390
Come on.

57
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:40,020
(Life is bright. Flowers are lovely.
15 per bouquet.)

58
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:40,910
Done.

59
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,420
Here's to a lovely couple.

60
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,300
Thanks.

61
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,420
Thank you.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,790
Even the prices of flowers have gone up.

63
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,110
15 for a bouquet now.

64
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,590
You've been

65
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,910
rather quiet today.

66
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,710
Have I?

67
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:37,540
I think I've been all right.

68
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,150
We're all familiar enough,

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,860
so no need to put on a show.

70
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,590
No need for the cheeky banter either.

71
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,540
What's this?

72
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,470
You can't even be bothered
to pretend anymore?

73
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,910
So what?

74
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,540
If there's no work excuse,

75
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,060
I can't even get you out for dinner?

76
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,500
Do you really think
I'm that calculating?

77
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,940
Actually, yes, I am.

78
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,980
No need to be so brutally honest.

79
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,740
Isn't honesty

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,860
one of my better traits?

81
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,270
What's wrong
with grabbing dinner with me?

82
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,860
Bad wine?

83
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,110
Bad food?

84
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,030
Or am I just

85
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,420
wasting your time?

86
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,860
What?

87
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,540
Running low
on dining partners these days?

88
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,470
Can't be.

89
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:38,500
At most, you're just short
one bickering partner.

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,670
Feeling lonely lately?

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,266
It's still more fun
hanging out with you.

92
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,030
You've got plenty
of interesting people around.

93
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,230
You don't need me.

94
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,060
But you're different.

95
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,180
No, I'm not.

96
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,670
We're all

97
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,710
the same.

98
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,620
Hold this for me.

99
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,710
I should...

100
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,980
Would you like to come over

101
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,910
to my place?

102
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,910
It's late. A man and a woman, alone...

103
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:52,620
It's not exactly appropriate.

104
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,940
We never finished

105
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,940
that movie last time.

106
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,300
I'd like to finish it.

107
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:11,960
=Episode 22=
(Oh, Women)

108
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,060
Men really are

109
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,940
slower than women.

110
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,980
Sometimes,

111
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,910
they lose things
without even realizing it.

112
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,470
No clue what they've let slip away.

113
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,790
And it always hits late.
Way, way after the fact.

114
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,940
Isn't this kind of talk
a little inappropriate,

115
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,380
given our current situation?

116
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,540
I think it's perfectly appropriate.

117
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,860
In fact,

118
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,300
I feel like now,

119
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,670
we can actually be real.

120
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,590
Say what we actually mean.

121
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,380
Have you ever held back?

122
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,070
You've always just done
whatever you wanted.

123
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,380
As we get older,

124
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,260
people start

125
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,780
to lose interest,

126
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,830
in life and in everything.

127
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,660
But even someone like that,

128
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,500
clumsy and unsure,

129
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,260
he still once tried, really hard,

130
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,860
to prove to a woman

131
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,500
that he still had some fire left

132
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,140
for her.

133
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,260
It's late.

134
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,070
I should go.

135
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,310
When I was one,

136
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,070
my parents got divorced.

137
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,830
They left me with my grandfather.

138
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,500
There were so many people in that house.

139
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,860
Siblings, cousins,

140
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,830
and a whole crowd.

141
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,020
Too many kids and too many mouths.

142
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,380
I didn't even

143
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,590
have my own bed growing up.

144
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,020
Forget about having my own room.

145
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,190
My grandfather was good to me.

146
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,550
But he was the strict,

147
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,470
no-nonsense type.

148
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,830
I had to work so hard,

149
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,950
and be the absolute best,

150
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,070
just to get a rare smile of approval

151
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,020
from him.

152
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,430
That's when I started learning

153
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,710
how to read people.

154
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,740
How to get along.

155
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,660
And also, since then,

156
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,900
the only time I could truly relax

157
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,500
was when I was alone, all by myself.

158
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,190
Intimacy has always been hard for me.

159
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,260
I've tried.

160
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,830
I've worked at it.

161
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,740
I've failed.

162
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,140
So,

163
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,550
Luo Man,

164
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,550
you're not the only one feeling lost.

165
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,660
Talk to me.

166
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,310
You didn't give it to him?

167
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,860
What are you waiting for?

168
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,190
It doesn't matter if he wants it or not!

169
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,860
Chen Kaixi, listen to me.

170
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,500
Keeping the peace
doesn't always lead to peace.

171
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,780
Let me be clear.

172
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,070
You need to listen to me on this.

173
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,244
If not, you'll regret it
for the rest of your life!

174
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,110
All right.

175
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,230
Okay. Sure. Whatever.

176
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,950
Thanks.

177
00:13:20,044 --> 00:13:21,230
Everything all right?

178
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,550
I just don't get it.

179
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,430
What's the point of marriage?

180
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,620
How can there be no bottom line?

181
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,740
If you ask me,

182
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,140
I think

183
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,740
you should try not to get
too involved in their mess.

184
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,950
Why not?

185
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,650
At the end of the day,
they're still husband and wife.

186
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,140
They're family.

187
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,140
And sometimes,

188
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,830
there is no bottom line with family.

189
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,230
So what,

190
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:55,740
you just keep swallowing it down?

191
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:57,380
Pretend nothing's wrong and carry on?

192
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,500
Couples fight, sure.

193
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,310
But they also make up.

194
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,660
Think about it.

195
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,230
After all these years,

196
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,590
do you think
Chen Kaixi can live without Chen Mian?

197
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,550
Her dependency on him

198
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,860
might not just be financial.

199
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,430
It could be

200
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,430
emotional too.

201
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,260
So...

202
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,260
Just

203
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,380
be careful.

204
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,350
Don't get caught in the crossfire.

205
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,710

206

about divorce,

207
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,310
it's you.

212
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,110
maybe even envying,

213
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,830
that fire

214
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,260
in you.

215
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,070

turn around?

219
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,710
Just turn around.

When I first saw it,

221
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,190
I thought it suited you perfectly.

222
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,230
So, I bought it.

223
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,190
I do not think it suits me.

like wearing necklaces.

Yes, that is right.

00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,350
Why did you not consider

265
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,310
sending Tiao to Qiaowei Elementary?

What made you choose Zuanshi?

267

We chose Zuanshi

268
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:56,940
because we believe
in the school's educational philosophy.

269
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,750
Education is not just
about taking exams.

270
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,110
It is about guiding children

271
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,800
to explore their relationship
with themselves and with the world.

272
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,590
It sounds like
you have done your homework.

273

When it comes
to your child's growth and education,

274
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,590
what matters most to you?

275
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,940
We hope he can develop

276
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,420
a global perspective

277
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,620
and the capabilities to match.

278
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,750
Zuanshi offers
a multilingual curriculum.

279
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,790
We are very optimistic

280
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,070
about this approach to education.

281
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,860
What my wife said is quite right.

282
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,830
But actually, we value

283
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,420
our child's self-motivation

284
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,460
and independence even more.

285
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,030
We believe that every child

286
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,660
has unique strengths.

287
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,030
If you let them grow freely,

288
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,830
they will eventually shine
in their own way.

289
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,550
And we believe that children

290
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,030
should not be restricted

291
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,030
by too many frameworks.

292
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,070
Frameworks become shackles.

293
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,830
But each child is like an ocean.

294
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,140
Trying to constrain the ocean

295
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,940
is unwise.

312
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,700
take me on trips.

313
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,700

333
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,380
Okay. Look at the camera.

334
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,070

337
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,550
I had a lot of fun today.

338
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,220
Why is that?

339
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,030
I've never seen

340
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,270
such a big library before.

341
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,990
It was like Hogwarts.

342
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,700
Like Hogwarts? That cool?

343
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,644
Next time, take me with you.

344
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:46,180
We can read books together there.

345
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,270

346
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,900

I'll sleep in the guest room.

380
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,700
Honey.

381
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,940
Honey, don't go!

382
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,220
The baby is gone.

383
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,070
She fell.

384
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,355
I gave her money and sent her abroad.

385
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,940
She signed the papers.

386
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:03,070
She's completely out of the picture now.

387
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,380
Honey...

388
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,620
I was wrong.

389
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,700
I was so wrong.

390
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,350
But no matter how lost I get,
deep down, I know,

391
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,110
in this life,

392
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,220
I have only ever had
one wife, Chen Kaixi,

393
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,420
and one son, Tiao.

394
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,420
Kaixi,

395
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,380
I might've had countless women.

396
00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:42,755
They have all seen me at my best,
when I was proud and arrogant.

397
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,380
But only you've seen me at my lowest.

398
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,420
Only you stayed

399
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,380
by my side.

400
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,550
When I finally reach the finish line,

401
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,110
when I can

402
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,070
hold my head up

403
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,110
and say,

404
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,750
"Look,

405
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,350
I did it.

406
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,750
I really did it",

407
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:13,620
the only person
I want to say that to is you.

408
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,860
Only you.

409
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,380
Chen Kaixi.

410
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,510
You were there at the beginning,

411
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,750
and I want you to be there at the end.

412
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,990
Do you understand?

413
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:01,960
(What's going on?
I'm coming over right now.)

414
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,220
Tiao.

415
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:11,070
Well, look who it is.
The famous screenwriter.

416
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,180
You're here early.

417
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Ms. Luo Man!

418
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,460
Tiao, heading to kindergarten?

419
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,790
Daddy's taking me today.

420
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,660
Then, you better hurry.
This doesn't happen everyday.

421
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,220
Say goodbye to Mommy.

422
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,750
Bye-bye, Mommy.

423
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,030
Give Mommy a kiss.

424
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,620
Have fun, all right?

425
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,310
Honey.

426
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,830
I'm off.

427
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,510
Come on, Tiao.

428
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,180
Let's go, Tiao.

429
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,750
Let's talk inside.

430
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,070
No need. This won't take long.

431
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,830
We can talk here.

432
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,310
He is still my son's father.

433
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,420
Tiao is still young.

434
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,860
Then, why bother doing all of this?

435
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,110
Why not just save yourself the trouble?

436
00:29:24,244 --> 00:29:25,900
Beautiful people are so photogenic.

437
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,488
You look great on camera no matter what.

438
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,750
Let me see.

439
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,700
You made me look great.

440
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,420
Thank you.

441
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,220
You're welcome.

442
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,220

450
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,700
Oh, women.

452
00:30:33,688 --> 00:30:36,200
Zhou, have you eaten?

453
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,660
Hey, Li.

454
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:59,133
No issues with the list for
Hong Kong, China bell-ringing event.

455
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,070
Looks good.

456
00:31:01,022 --> 00:31:02,790
Add my wife and son to the list as well.

457
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,350
It's a big day.

458
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,733
The most important thing is to have

459
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,750
the whole family together.

460
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,350
All right.

461
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,030
Enjoy.

462
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,350
Thank you.

463
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,660
I said it'd be my treat.

464
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,590
You don't have
to watch out for my wallet.

465
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,220
We know each other well enough.

466
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,030
No need for formalities.

467
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,830
By the way,

468
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,350
did Ms. Xu send you the contract?

469
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,110
She did. I'm reviewing it.

470
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:57,460
If you need help, just send it over.
I can go through it for you.

471
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,310
Mr. Zhou,

472
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:07,422
your service has been
quite thorough lately.

473
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,620
Just trying

474
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,110
to rack up some points for myself.

475
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,550
Points?

476
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,620
What for?

477
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,750
I don't have a prize counter here.

478
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:20,990
All right.

479
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,790
It's up to you

480
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,533
whether I get to redeem anything.

481
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,660
How are things with Kaixi?

482
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,700
Back on good terms?

483
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,380
I don't think
there are any terms to speak of.

484
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,590
You were right.

485
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,270
Really.

486
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,900
It's their marriage.

487
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,380
Who am I to interfere with it?

488
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,420
I should be

489
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,180
focusing more on myself.

490
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,700
I'm exhausted enough as it is

491
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,030
these days.

492
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,380
Every extra minute of sleep
feels like gold.

493
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,700
Seems like dealing

494
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,510
with young people

495
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,350
really does drain you.

496
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,070
Here.

497
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,180
Eat something good.

498
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,660
Dealing with anyone

499
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,620
is tiring.

500
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,830
Elephant attack!

501
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,700
Come on, Tiao.

502
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,550
Why is he still in the bath?

503
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,140
I'm bathing him.

504
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,270
Were you playing with water?

505
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,990
Come on, Honey.

506
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,420
We just made

507
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,860
a little splash earlier.

508
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,140
Tiao, it's time for bed.

509
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,550
Honey,

510
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,420
you go ahead.

511
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,790
I'll tuck him in.

512
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,700
Is Daddy awesome or what?

513
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,300
Awesome.

514
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,340
Do you know why Daddy is awesome?

515
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,390
Why?

516
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,430
Because we are men.

517
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,820
When men stick together,

518
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,430
we can do anything.

519
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,820
Got it?

520
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:34,910
Cheers!

521
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:40,950
You must be exhausted these days.

522
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,950
Doing roadshows day and night.

523
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,510
Drinking, speaking,

524
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,550
and running around nonstop.

525
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,950
And then having to go home
to entertain your wife and son.

526
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,110
I'm impressed.

527
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,180
It's not like I have much choice.

528
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,510
Thankfully, it's almost over.

529
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,070
Zhang Fan,

530
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,950
all those big promises I made back then
are finally coming true.

531
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:00,088
Back in school, I told him in our dorm.

532
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,430
Follow me and I'll make sure
we ring that bell someday.

533
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:03,555
And I was right, right?

534
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,510
And I have been following

535
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,070
that line ever since.

536
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,300
All right, enough talking.

537
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,140
Let's drink.

538
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,820
Cheers!

539
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,910
In the end,

540
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,700
you guys are the ones I can count on.

541
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,740
Zhou,

542
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,990
how are things going on your end?

543
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,620
Women, anyway.

544
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:21,870
When has Mr. Zhou ever failed
to win over a woman?

545
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,110
You really gave it your all

546
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,660
on the roadshow, Mr. Zhou.

547
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,590
Much appreciated.

548
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,340
Cheers.

549
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:30,860

We're all buddies.

550
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,070
Drop the courtesy.

557

Don't mess up anything.

558
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Relax.

559
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,110
I know what I'm doing.

560

I'm off.

love hiking so much?

563
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,390
Well, we're all just fools.

564
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,510
Get a bit of money

565
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,030
and suddenly think we are Superman.

566
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,780
Man versus nature.

567
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,700
But this doesn't count.

568
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,470
This is more like a stroll in the park.

569
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,660
So, why did you ask to meet me here?

570
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,030
Walking in the park is great.

571
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,110
Think about it.

572
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,140
Close to nature,

573
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,390
and get some exercise.

574
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,620
What's not to love?

575
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,180
Besides,

576
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,910
eating, singing,
and going to the movies?

577
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:57,444
Doing all that feels like an affair.

578
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,110
But a walk in the park?

579
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,110
Platonic. Pure.

580
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,300
Almost romantic.

581
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,260
People always try
to fill what they lack.

582
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,470
You're killing me.

583
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,430
I need to take this call.

584
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,510
Go ahead.

585
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,740
Yes?

586
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,470
Nothing can go wrong
with our final roadshow.

587
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:26,870
Also,

588
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,620
that wine from last time?

589
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,510
Not good enough.

590
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,390
Change it.

591
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,910
Okay.

592
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,030
Got it.

593
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,470
See you.

594
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,700
You really are hands-on.

595
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,220
I can handle it.

596
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,260
Silly guy.

597
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,390
Qingcheng,

598
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,470
how about...

599
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,430
How about we give it a try?

600
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,220
Where do you get this confidence?

601
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,340
Come on.

602
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,950
We are clearly the youngest people
in this park.

603
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,620
Right?

604
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,555
You even came all the way here with me.

605
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,180
That's a kid right there.
And a group of elementary schoolers.

606
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,030
Do you not see them?

607
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,950
I'm not joking.

608
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,140
I'm serious.

609
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,180
Give us a chance.

610
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,910
Qingcheng,

611
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,340
I know what you're worried about.

612
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:38,390
I've already set aside a huge sum

613
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,620
for my wife and son.

614
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,590
Whether we divorce or not,

615
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,660
that money is theirs.

616
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,070
Of course,

617
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,550
I know no amount of money

618
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,300
can make up for the youth she gave up.

619
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,820
But this is...

620
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,660
This is me buying back my own freedom.

621
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,340
I'm objectifying myself.

622
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,140
That makes it fair, right?

623
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,820
Zhong Qingcheng.

624
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,220
I really, really want to be with you.

625
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,070
I mean it.

626
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,590
So...

627
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,950
We get together,

628
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,820
then what?

629
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,470
Then...

630
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,300
Then,

631
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,300
we live happily ever after.

632
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,180
The most exciting countdown moment.

633
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,990
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

634
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,300
five, four, three, two, one.

635

(HKEX, Shishi Technology)

636
00:40:06,264 --> 00:40:07,960
(Congratulations
to Yancheng Shishi Technology)

637
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,600
(on its successful listing
in Hong Kong, China)

638
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:44,400
(12 Hours Ago)

639
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,340
What's on your mind?

640
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,510
I was thinking

641
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,180
about the first time I came to Shanghai

642
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,590
when I got into college.

643
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,140
I stayed in a tiny hotel

644
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,300
near the school.

645
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,390
It was 80 yuan a night.

646
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,590
When I took a shower,

647
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,870
the water ran down the steps

648
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,070
and soaked the floor.

649
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:10,990
I was too scared to call the front desk.
I was afraid they'd scold me.

650
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,910
So, I grabbed a rag

651
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,220
and mopped it all up myself.

652
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,550
Honey.

653
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:23,377
I never imagined

654
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:25,220
that some broke kid like me
would end up here.

655
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,180
Seriously.

656
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,510
When I was a boy,

657
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,660
I played marbles.

658
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,110
And my son?

659
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,140
He plays golf.

660
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,260
When I think of it like that,

661
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,740
everything I've been through
was worth it.

662
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,110
Tomorrow's the big day.

663
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,110
Don't go down memory lane tonight.

664
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:55,111
Think about something else.

665
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,990
Something else?

666
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,220
Honey.

667
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,180
Did you

668
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,590
prepare something special for me?

669
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,110
Take a guess.

670
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,300
Open it.

671
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,470
I wonder what it is?
