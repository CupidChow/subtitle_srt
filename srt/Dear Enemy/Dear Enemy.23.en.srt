There's also a video.

Do you want to see it?

6
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,630
I want a divorce.

7
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,100
I want custody of Tiao.

8
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,910
I want half of your assets,

9
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,940
including your shares in the company.

What does this mean?

13
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:51,780
I'm ringing the bell tomorrow morning.

14
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,220

17
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,380
Honey.

18
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,790
What are you doing?

19
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,310
Why put on this whole show?

20
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,550
Why waste so much effort

21
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,670
just to go against me?

22
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,670
Honey.

23
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,140
Honey.

24
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,380
Tomorrow is a big day for our family.

25
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,820
Can't we just have peace for once?

26
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,700
I'm begging you, please.

27
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,550
Didn't you say you wanted
to buy back your freedom?

28
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,940
I'll let you go.

29
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,422
Thanks for the hard work.

30
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,700
Almost done.

31
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,790
Can you

32
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,550
do me a favor?

33
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,230
Taste this for me.

34
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,190
It's hot now.

35
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,110
How is it?

36
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,940
It feels like it has
an extra layer of aroma.

37
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,870
I added a little bit of

38
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,500
caramelized onion.

39
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,750
You really are something, Mr. Zhou.

40
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,260
Your cooking has really leveled up.

41
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,260
Do you

42
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,790
want to build that together?

43
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,820
(Didn't you say you wanted
to buy back your freedom?)

- MOUSSE, Zhongshan Ave, Yancheng)

47
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,870
I'll call you later.

48
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440

00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:08,200

51
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,460
Women are always like this.

52
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:16,940
(- Where are you?
- Jingshan Park. Come over.)

53
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,670
Qingcheng.

54
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,380
Let me be honest with you.

55
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,260
I really, really want to be with you.

56
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,340
I mean it.

57
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,750
I know

58
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,670
you have concerns.

59
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,140
I left a big sum of money
for her and the kid.

60
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,900
Of course, I know

61
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,820
that money

62
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,140
can't make up for her lost youth.

63
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,870
But I just thought...

64
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,670
It's like I'm buying my own freedom.

65
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,750
I'm objectifying myself.

66
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:50,430
That should be fine, right?

67
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,020
What are you thinking?

68
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,580
Yes or no?

69
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:02,333
Have you seen
"Comrades: Almost a Love Story"?

70
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,500
There's a line in that movie.

71
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,750
"Comrade Li Xiaojun,

72
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,070
you didn't come
to Hong Kong, China, for me.

73
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,630
And I didn't come to Hong Kong, China,

74
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,500
for you either."

75
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,380
Chen Mian.

76
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,870
Let's not see each other anymore.

77
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:55,310
Zhong Qingcheng told you, didn't she?

78
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,030
When did you women
form a resistance squad?

79
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:09,340
Honey.

80
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,820
I admit it.

81
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,510
Zhong Qingcheng did ask me
about divorce.

82
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,460
But I turned her down right away.

83
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,700
I told her it was impossible.

84
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,150
Chen Kaixi and I are family.

85
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,550
Can you just walk away from family?

86
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,100
Chen Mian.

87
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,510
Why did I never notice

88
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,580
how slick you are with words?

89
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,510
Buying your freedom?

90
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,740
Objectifying yourself?

91
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Forget a young girl being moved.

92
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,220
Even I'm a little touched.

93
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,190
Honey.

94
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,340
Don't listen
to Zhong Qingcheng's nonsense.

95
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,150
Please?

96
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,070
Do you know your biggest weakness?

97
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,620
You're too naive.

98
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:58,310
Do you know what kind of person she is?

99
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,340
She's a player.

100
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,100
She's capable of anything shady.

101
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,740
She...

102
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,580
She just wants to break us up

103
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,910
so she can get what she wants.

104
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,270
Don't you see?

105
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,030
She thinks she has a chance.

106
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,150
Honey.

107
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,790
Please, Honey.

108
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,190
Don't fall for her tricks, okay?

109
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,150
I'm begging you.

110
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,430
Wake up already.

111
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,510
Chen Mian, you're disgusting!

112
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,910
How can you be so disgusting?

113
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,150
Calm down.

114
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,070
When you slept with the TV host,

115
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,580
I told myself

116
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,220
that every guy

117
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,270
would have a thing for pretty hosts.

118
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,270
Your dream came true, and it's fine.

119
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,860
When you slept with Tiao's tutor,

120
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,220
I told myself

121
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,820
she must've come on to you first.

122
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,220
She must've seduced you.

123
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:57,510
When you were messing
with Zhong Qingcheng,

124
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,790
I told myself

125
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,070
she's beautiful

126
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,580
and hard to get.

127
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,820
What man

128
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,190
could resist that?

129
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,220
Just to...

130
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,270
Just to

131
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,860
keep the two of you apart,

132
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,860
I became her friend.

133
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,220
Do you know how that feels?

134
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,390
It's not just her looking down on me.

135
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:32,700
Luo Man looked down on me too.

136
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Even I despised myself!

137
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,190
Honey.

138
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,790
Everything you said is true.

139
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,580
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,340
I'm a jerk. A real jerk.

141
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,510
From now on,

142
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,270
I'll never do it again.

143
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,510
I swear I'll never
do anything like that again.

144
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,620
Please, just give me one more chance.

145
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,150
Honey, please...

146
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Honey...

147
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,460
Honey...

148
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,460
I know you're hurting.

149
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,460
I know you're hurting.

150
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,030
But we don't have

151
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,070
to let it come to this.

152
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,430
We really don't.

153
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,430
You always ask
if I've grown tired of you.

154
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,940
I haven't. I swear I haven't!

155
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,580
Because I love you.

156
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,430
What's left between people in the end?

157
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,700
All that's left is
what we have between us.

158
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,740
Feelings.

159
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,740
Trust.

160
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,190
Dependence.

161
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,030
Honey.

162
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,790
Just give me one more chance, please.

163
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,070
Tomorrow's a big day

164
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,390
for our family.

165
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,700
Tiao is still asleep in the next room.

166
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
I'm begging you.

167
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,910
Please calm down, okay?

168
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,150
Honey, please.

169
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,430
Let's get some rest.

170
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,310
Let's start over tomorrow, okay?

171
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,940
Really, let's start over.

172
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,390
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,030
I made a huge mistake, Honey.

174
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,390
I was so wrong.

175
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,270
I get it now.

176
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,860
What?

177
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,790
The gift you wanted
to give me wasn't Lego.

178
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,620
You wanted to give me

179
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,700
moments we spent building Lego together.

180
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,670
Right?

181
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:50,910
Silly.

182
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,510
If I...

183
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,670
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

184
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,390
I would've believed you.

185
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,510
Just like every other time.

186
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:29,510
(Lang)

187
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,190
Where did you get this?

188
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,980
During the second year of the company,

189
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,740
you signed this with Zhang Fan.

Trustee: Chen Mian, Nominee: Zhang Fan)

191
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,340
Who were you guarding against?

192
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,620
A trust fund?

193
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,580
And you said

194
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,740
90 percent of your assets

195
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,550
would go to me.

196
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,940
How generous of you.

197
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,620
However,

198
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,100
those shares aren't included, are they?

199
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,070
What do you actually want?

200
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,860
I told you right from the start.

201
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,100
I want a divorce.

202
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,150
I want custody of Tiao.

203
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,620
I want half of your assets,

204
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,820
including your shares in the company.

205
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,220
No way.

206
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,740
Right now, Luo Man is with Zhou Musun.

207
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,510
If you don't sign the divorce agreement,

208
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,510
she'll use Zhou Musun's phone

209
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,430
to post everything online.

210
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,510
Whether or not
you get to ring that bell tomorrow,

211
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,510
is entirely up to you.

212
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,780
(Zhou Musun)

213
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,790
Hello, Mr. Chen.

214
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,620
Congratulations.

215
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,310
The big day is finally here.

216
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,900
Who taught you this dirty trick?

217
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,990
Who?

218
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,510
Luo Man?

219
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,510
Zhong Qingcheng?

220
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,990
Chen Mian.

221
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,790
Before I met you,

222
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,660
I was already
standing on my own two feet.

223
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,230
Did you forget

224
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,820
we went to the same university?

225
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,470
All these years,

226
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,860
you really took me for a fool!

227
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,660
Chen Kaixi.

228
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,340
Are you still even yourself?

229
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,710
Chen Mian.

230
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,140
A long time ago,

231
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,270
you stopped being you.

232
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:52,540
(Husband)

233
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,510
Chen Kaixi.

234
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,340
Let me ask you one last time.

235
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,580
Is this really what you want?

236
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,100
If I sign this,

237
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,070
our family will fall apart.

238
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,990
You see?

239
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,620
Chen Mian?

240
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,510
Come quick! Someone's proposing!

241
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,620
Check this out!

242
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,820
Someone's proposing!

243
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,340
Chen Kaixi,

244
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,140
would you...

245
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,380
Sure!

246
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,750
Sure.

247
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,860
Chen Mian.

248
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,180
Sure.

249
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,900
Sure.

250
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,550
Chen Mian.

251
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,529
(Husband: Chen Mian)

252
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,860
It's getting late.

253
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,380
Why don't we

254
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,990
stop here today?

255
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,990
Get some rest.

256
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:15,030
We continue tomorrow.

257
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,820
Let's finish this page first.

258
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,510
Alright.

259
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,510
What's wrong?

260
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,270
Maybe it's just...

261
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,030
You're being too good.

262
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,990
So good that it feels

263
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,710
a little weird.

264
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,230
Sounds like Mr. Zhou is feeling lonely

265
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,750
and itching for a fight.

266
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,510
Fighting? That's easy.

267
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,230
Let's go.

268
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:49,900
Let's argue.

269
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,580
Pick a topic. I'm in.

270
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,380
Great.

271
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,990
Let me pour a drink first.

272
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,790
We'll argue over wine.

273
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,550
What are you doing?

274
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
I...

275
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,380
need to head back.

276
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,030
Why so sudden?

277
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,380
It's already so late.

278
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,380
A script just came in last minute.

279
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,550
You've rushed scripts here before.

280
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,950
Next time, okay?

281
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,990
Do you even know how much money that is?

282
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,230
It's billions!

283
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,230
My gosh!

284
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,550
How did you let that happen?

285
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,710
I don't care how you do it.

286
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,790
Just fix it! You hear me?

287
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,790
Here we go.

288
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,310
Come on.

289
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,660
Cheers.

290
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,820
Booze, huh.

291
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,660
Just so you know,

292
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,140
I don't drink cheap stuff.

293
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,230
♪Don't think about getting drunk
and forgetting everything♪

294
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,030
Let me take a look.

295
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,550
Wow, Chen Kaixi, you've lost your mind!

296
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,420
This is expensive.

297
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,820
I can't handle it.

298
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,180
Exactly, I have.

299
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,340
I totally lost it.

300
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,990
I'm celebrating today.

301
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,310
Today,

302
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,310
I heard a dark joke.

303
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,860
Why is divorce so expensive?

304
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,550
You know why?

305
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,820
Do you?

306
00:25:16,864 --> 00:25:18,329
♪No one should force anything♪

307
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,230
Because it's worth it.

308
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,710
Chen Kaixi, that's not funny.

309
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,950
Not even a little.

310
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,620
Terrible punchline.

311
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,100
It totally fell flat.

312
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,660
Come on. Cheers.

313
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,180
I'd love to know

314
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,266
where Chen Mian is venting
his emotions right now.

315
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,100
But me?

316
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,340
I don't care
where he's venting emotions.

317
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,270
What I really want to see

318
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,580
is how Mr. Chen

319
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,990
picked up the pen

320
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,710
with hatred the other night

321
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,180
and then

322
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,990
shed his tears

323
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,750
all over Victoria Harbour.

324
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,380
All thanks to the great script.

325
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,510
The script plays a big part.

326
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,470
Only our top screenwriter
could pull this off.

327
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,100
Come on.

328
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,860
Luo Man's brainchild!

329
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,790
- All on you.
- Brilliant work.

330
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,180
But honestly,

331
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,180
what you said was spot on.

332
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,380
Why? Because

333
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,860
I can say with no exaggeration

334
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,230
that the script I wrote for our Xi

335
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,340
is hands down

336
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,100
the greatest work

337
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,710
of my career.

338
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,230
It's peerless.

339
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,750
Right?

340
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,310
Cheers.

341
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,030
What's wrong?

342
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,380
Let me say something real.

343
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,270
Today,

344
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,950
if it weren't for

345
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,660
you

346
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,470
and you...

347
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,580
I wouldn't get to be who I am.

348
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:13,360
(A Few Days Ago)

349
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,140
Qingcheng,

350
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,470
I know

351
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,270
you're still in contact with Chen Mian.

352
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,710
No, Ms. Kaixi, listen to me.

353
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,470
You don't have to.

354
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,070
I believe you.

355
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,030
I trust that you feel nothing for him.

356
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,790
It must be Chen Mian
still pestering you.

357
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,470
Just like last time with that game.

358
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,750
I had no idea he was in the group.

359
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,750
Someone just added me in.

360
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,950
It's okay.

361
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,550
It's perfect.

362
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,340
Keep talking to him.

363
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,310
All these years,

364
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,070
I've had enough.

365
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,660
Now I only have you all.

366
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,950
I hope you'll help me.

367
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,990
Take it. Don't be a stranger.

368
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,030
You and Mr. Chen
have been too good to me.

369
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,030
When I finally make it big,

370
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,030
there's one person I want to brag to.

371
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,380
I'll tell her, "Look,

372
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,180
I really did it."

373
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,660
And that person can only be you.

374
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,470
Chen Kaixi,

375
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,230
you were my beginning.

376
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,420
And you'll be my end.

377
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,310
You get that?

378
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,710
(Kaixi.)

379
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,620
(When it comes to business,)

380
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,380
(I don't know much.)

381
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:24,955
(But...)

382
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,019
(You need to be more watchful.)

383
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,044
(Zhang Fan: main stakeholder, 30% stake,
Chen Mian: 27.5% stake)

384
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,230
I'm off.

385
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,340
Bye.

386
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,720
(Entrusted Shareholding Agreement
Trustee: Chen Mian. Nominee: Zhang Fan)

387
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,550
Your husband's current assets

388
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,750
are just the house you live in,

389
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,270
a car, and some savings.

390
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,710
If you file for divorce now,

391
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,470
you'll get at most half of that.

392
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,950
And if you want custody of the child,

393
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,990
your chances are very slim.

394
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,550
But with this shareholding
entrustment agreement,

395
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,420
everything changes.

396
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,990
Since it was signed after your marriage

397
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,100
and there's no agreement promising

398
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,340
to keep the assets separate,

399
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,660
I can draft a new agreement for you

400
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,710
and include these shares.

401
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,310
But now it's up to you.

402
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,380
How are you going to get him to sign?

403
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,750
You need to be mentally prepared.

404
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,140
Your husband is a tiger.

405
00:32:37,577 --> 00:32:38,750
Snatching food from a tiger

406
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,790
will mean a tough fight.

407
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,550
This is the trump card.

408
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,070
Once it's out, it's gone.

409
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,140
You only get one shot.

410
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,340
You have to hit the mark.

411
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,180
And when you strike, strike hard.

412
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,710
With someone like Chen Mian,

413
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,990
once he snaps out of it,

414
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,340
he'll definitely strike back hard.

415
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,510
We have to finish him in one blow.

416
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,420
I'm ready for that.

417
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,100
If I do it,

418
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,310
it has to be foolproof.

419
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,340
The first step is to break down

420
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,380
his guard.

421
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,790
A blunt and arrogant man like Chen Mian

422
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,510
who has too much confidence in himself

423
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,310
thinks that everyone else

424
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,310
is an idiot

425
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,950
except him.

426
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Especially you.

427
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,230
So, act weak.

428
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,660
Keep acting weak.

429
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,340
Wear down his guard.

430
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,750
Chen Kaixi.

431
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,990
You were my beginning.

432
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,710
And you'll be my end.

433
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,310
My wife was right.

434
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,180
Don't be afraid to show real emotion.

435
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,550
Don't be afraid to break down.

436
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,310
It makes you look real.

437
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,950
One, two, three.

438
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,230
Why aren't you done yet?

439
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,310
I'm not done yet.

440
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,990
He's still the kid's dad.

441
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,270
Why all the drama?

442
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,900
Just say it already.

443
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,270
Cut.

444
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,300
I'm heading out.

445
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,390
Just a few days left.

446
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,910
Don't mess it up now.

447
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,550
Relax.

448
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,550
I know what to do.

449
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,470
When we write scripts,

450
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,550
we have this trick.

451
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,070
It's called "the golden last minute."

452
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,470
It means you pull your biggest move

453
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,260
right at the very end.

454
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,870
Hit them when they least expect it.

455
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,740
So you're saying

456
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,180
we bring this out

457
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,470
right before the bell rings?

458
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:52,990
Exactly.

459
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,350
The night before he rings that bell.

460
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,260
Just the two of you.

461
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
Force him to sign.

462
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,260
Between two evils,
pick the lesser one.

463
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,220
Your marriage

464
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:02,990
and those shares

465
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,950
will be the lesser evil to him.

466
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,180
You have to force him.

467
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,910
Willingly or not, he has to sign it.

468
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,910
What do you want?

469
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,870
I said it from the start.

470
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,180
I want a divorce.

471
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,220
I want custody of Tiao.

472
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,910
I want half of your assets,

473
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,740
including your shares in the company.

474
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,220
No way.

475
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,990
Whether or not
you get to ring that bell tomorrow,

476
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,430
is entirely up to you.

477
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,070
But what if Chen Mian gets violent?

478
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,390
I mean, what if.

479
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,550
I always prepare for the worst.

480
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,140
What if he

481
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,870
locks Ms. Kaixi up

482
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,990
and goes to ring the bell?

483
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,780
What then?

484
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,780
That could really happen.

485
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,390
Qingcheng has a point.

486
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,950
We need a backup plan.

487
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,470
Something to keep him in check

488
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,070
so he doesn't dare use force.

489
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,700
Keep him in check?

490
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,780
Is there anything else
that can do that?

491
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,550
Zhou Musun?

492
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,260
He texted me this afternoon.

493
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:11,900
(Let's have dinner tonight.)

494
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,550
Yes.

495
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,470
This is Chen Mian's bane.

496
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,390
Chen Mian is afraid of Zhou Musun?

497
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,990
He's afraid of the escalation.

498
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,990
This agreement
can't see the light of day.

499
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,030
If Mr. Zhou knows and says nothing,

500
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,430
then he is in violation too.

501
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,780
They'll both go down for it.

502
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,220
I'm betting

503
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,830
Chen Mian will definitely

504
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,830
call Zhou Musun.

505
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,390
He'll only make one phone call.

506
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,950
So, we need to make sure

507
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,390
no matter when Chen Mian calls,

508
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,100
that call

509
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,350
will be answered by you.

510
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,740
I get it now.

511
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,430
What?

512
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,830
The gift you wanted
to give me wasn't Lego.

513
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,870
You wanted to give me

514
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,030
moments we spent building Lego together.

515
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,430
Right?

516
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,350
Silly.

517
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,350
Here.

518
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,830
It's about the script.

519
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,700
Hello, Mr. Chen.

520
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,140
Congratulations.

521
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,950
You finally made it to this day.

522
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,990
I can't think of any holes in the plan.

523
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,100
Let's go with it.

524
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,510
Ladies,

525
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,620
are we really doing this?

526
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,140
I just think this plan is way too risky.

527
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,660
There is no room for error.

528
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,830
If we fail,

529
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,300
I won't lose much.

530
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,470
But for Ms. Kaixi,

531
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,140
the cost will be steep.

532
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,430
Xi.

533
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,100
Why don't we

534
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,390
take a step back and rethink the plan?

535
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,180
We go slow and wear him down bit by bit.

536
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,390
You might still get

537
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,830
what you want in the end.

538
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,300
Like I said before,

539
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,470
when making big decisions like this,

540
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,030
you need a calm heart.

541
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,070
So,

542
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,430
are you sure?

543
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,470
Are you sure you want to do this?

544
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,780
If it fails, then it fails.

545
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,580
I'm sick of this life anyway.

546
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,390
You know what?

547
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,470
The way Chen Mian

548
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,030
looks at me most days...

549
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,180
Give me a break.
You're making me nervous.

550
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,870
You are useless

551
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,140
and full of excuses.

552
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,140
Order some fried chicken for me.

553
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,910
It's like I'm some kind of fool.

554
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,070
I really want to know...

555
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,470
I really, really want to know...

556
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,830
If in the end

557
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,660
we win,

558
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,430
will he still look at me

559
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,470
like I'm a fool?

560
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,550
Let's do it.

561
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,300
You know what?

562
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,780
The way Chen Mian looked at me

563
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,510
was like

564
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,830
he'd seen a ghost.

565
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,180
Like

566
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,300
he never even knew who I was.

567
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,300
We blew his mind, huh?

568
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,740
Let's give him a real eye-opener!

569
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,140
Doesn't it feel a little

570
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,740
like an epic heroine moment?

571
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,620
Yeah, it really does.

572
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,780
Lady Xi is back in the palace.

573
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,220
You know...

574
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,100
I am the protagonist of the day

575
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,550
for sure!

576
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,550
I am the one and only

577
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,580
protagonist.

578
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,700
I can't even imagine it.

579
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,870
Look at us.

580
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,990
We're a makeshift crew.

581
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,950
Yet,

582
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
we managed

583
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,910
to swindle

584
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,830
those sneaking and thieving men!

585
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,910
I think we are truly...

586
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,550
Amazing.

587
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,300
Totally.

588
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,180
Impressive.

589
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,030
But all things aside,

590
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,140
perhaps heaven

591
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,580
has finally

592
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,300
opened its eyes for us!

593
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,740
Xi finally got the justice

594
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:33,990
she deserved.

595
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,390
But honestly...

596
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,580
I mean...

597
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,300
Luck played a big part.

598
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,390
I've been really on edge too.

599
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,220
I've had nightmares

600
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,700
every night.

601
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,030
I know what you mean.

602
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,870
Speaking of feeling scared,

603
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,260
do you know what is the scariest thing?

604
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,070
When I had to build that dumb Lego set

605
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,990
with Zhou Musun,

606
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,510
my heart

607
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,390
was pounding like crazy.

608
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,740
I swear I could hear

609
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,950
my own heartbeat.

610
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,580
I had to look at him,

611
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,780
and make him feel like

612
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,260
we were reliving the good old days.

613
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,470
And I still had to tell him

614
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,470
that both hands

615
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,830
had to stay on the build.

616
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,470
Then, I had to grab his phone.

617
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,100
You know what that's like?

618
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,300
Trust me...

619
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,580
That sounds impossible.

620
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,470
As a scriptwriter,

621
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,510
that was way too dramatic.

622
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:38,740
- Wait.
- So dramatic.

623
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,140
After that night,

624
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,430
I came to realize something.

625
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,550
Zhong Qingcheng

626
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,390
must have

627
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,870
had it tough

628
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,740
as an actress.

629
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,580
You think being an actress is easy?

630
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,870
You think it's that easy?

631
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,260
It's seriously tough, Qingcheng.

632
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,950
It's so darn hard.

633
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,990
Come on,

634
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,070
let's drink to that.

635
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,390
It's really so tough.

636
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,620
Cheers to

637
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,350
a mission accomplished.

638
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,350
Cheers again

639
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,990
for justice has been served.

640
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:21,580
It's not easy being a woman.

641
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,180
So silly.

642
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,350
It's okay.

643
00:43:59,140 --> 00:43:59,780
It's okay.

644
00:44:16,711 --> 00:44:19,820
(Small things, use your head.
Big things, use your heart.)

645
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,640
(Fang Chi:  Small things, use
your head. Big things, use your heart.)

646
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:25,499
(Liked by Kaixi, Liu Yiran, Mr. Chen)
(Liu Yiran: Take care!)

00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,566

Ai Di: Go get them, Fang Chi!)
