(Life is the Best Screenwriter)

3
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,820
You know, I never really got it before,

4
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,260
why people always felt the need
to drink for no reason.

5
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,580
Now I understand.

6
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,980
Sometimes you need that haze

7
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,950
just to deal with all the changes.

8
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,860
Honestly? I'll admit it,

9
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,260
my imagination as a screenwriter

10
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,910
fell short.

11
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,790
Real life really does
make the best stories.

12
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,288
Don't drink too much though.
It might turn into an addiction.

13
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,540
Speaking of, do you
have enough booze at home?

14
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,510
If not,

15
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,110
I can have my driver drop some off.

16
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,580
Qingcheng, did you hear
what she just said?

17
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,540
One minute she's telling me
not to drink too much,

18
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,680
and the next she's offering
to send me booze.

19
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:49,790
Should I drink or not?

20
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,330
Well, if you're going to drink,
at least make it something good.

21
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,470
Ms. Kaixi is not wrong.

22
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:55,933
I've got a few bottles at home too.

23
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,300
Want me to send some over?

24
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:58,690
Okay. That's enough from you two.

25
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,470
It's not like I'm an alcoholic.

26
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,300
I just enjoy a drink
every now and then, okay?

27
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,700
Seriously.

28
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,300
Besides, these days I'm dragging

29
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,350
that little tablet around all the time,

30
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,980
upstairs, downstairs,

31
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,470
picking up packages,
and getting takeout.

32
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,670
It's exhausting.

33
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,950
By the way, Qingcheng,

34
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,420
has your project resumed work?

35
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,420
All the ones around me
are still suspended.

36
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,500
They keep saying we'll resume,

37
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,670
but it's fallen through
multiple times now.

38
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,670
What can we do? The whole
industry's like this right now.

39
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:28,270
There's no use stressing over it.

40
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,300
It's really tough these days.

41
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,060
But I see you're still keeping
up with your fitness posts.

42
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,500
At least your spirits seem high.

43
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,620
Not really.

44
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:37,109
I had my slump too.

45
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,470
I should thank you
for that watchlist you made for me.

46
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,620
I've been watching one a day,

47
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,150
and I've learned a lot.

48
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,110
Hey, I want that list too.

49
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,860
And Luo Man, stop staying glued
to the internet all day

50
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,790
reading the news.

51
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,150
You're just like Chen Mian.

52
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,420
Those emotional roller coasters

53
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,590
aren't good for you.

54
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,860
Then give your husband
some chores to do.

55
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,180
Have him pick up packages,

56
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,910
grab the groceries,

57
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,620
wash and chop the veggies.

58
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,110
There are lots he can help out with.

59
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,230
Don't go too easy on him.

60
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,230
Put him to work!

61
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,270
He is doing all that, actually.

62
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,740
He's like a hardworking ox,

63
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,380
huffing and puffing around the place.

64
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,910
But I guess it's good exercise.

65
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,420
You feel bad for him.

66
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,500
But maybe try feeling bad
for yourself for once, huh?

67
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,060
You're the one cooking
three meals a day for the family.

68
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,690
You're the one
who's really got it tough.

69
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,540
I'm just grateful if he
could stay out of my way.

70
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,910
Yesterday I made dinner rolls,

71
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,620
but then he demanded steamed buns

72
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,980
with lamb and scallions!

73
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,980
That gamy smell

74
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,740
lingered for hours.

75
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,150
What's going on there?

76
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,830
What happened?

77
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,940
I think it's a power outage.

78
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:40,710
I should go check it out.

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,980
Okay.

80
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,230
Text me then.

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,670
Dear.

82
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,300
Honey.

83
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,800
- Looks like we lost power.
- Yes.

84
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,030
Should I go check it out?

85
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:02,980
Maybe just leave it. We can
get through one night without it.

86
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,800
I'll call the building's
electrician tomorrow.

87
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:06,620
A lot of the staff haven't returned yet.

88
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,533
There's no guarantee
anyone will come tomorrow.

89
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,860
It's just

90
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,740
basic high school physics stuff anyway.

91
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,980
I can handle it.

92
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,940
I'll go.

93
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,180
Wait here for me.

94
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,830
Okay.

95
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,540
Okay.

96
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,030
Everything is good here.

97
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,110
Don't worry about me.

98
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,500
Just remember,

99
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,620
buy Dr. Fang a nice meal.

100
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
We owe him our thanks.

101
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,740
Don't worry. I will.

102
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,110
But

103
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,150
restaurants aren't even open these days.

104
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,420
I'll do it once they are.

105
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,030
Speaking of which,

106
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,060
well,

107
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,620
is Dr. Fang still doing his PhD?

108
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,980
Has he graduated yet?

109
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,980
I don't think so.

110
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,230
What school

111
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,740
is he at again?

112
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,470
Where would I even go to find out?

113
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,830
Probably some medical university.

114
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,500
Dr. Fang is quite the catch though.

115
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,060
So tall and handsome

116
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,270
Hang on, don't tell me you're...

117
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,420
It's perfectly normal for us
to have that idea.

118
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,230
If everyone waited around like you,

119
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,980
nothing would ever move forward.

120
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,500
You guys are unbelievable.

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,540
Do you know how old he is?

122
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,830
He's only 27!
That's way too big an age gap.

123
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,350
That's not much of a gap at all.

124
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,180
Your cousin is only 23.

125
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,500
It's just right.

126
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,300
She's coming here

127
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
for grad school in a few months.

128
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,940
The kids could get to know each other.

129
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,590
What's wrong with that?

130
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,150
Right...

131
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,180
Yes...

132
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,500
Cousin?

133
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,830
You mean Min?

134
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,710
Is her family
pressuring her to get married?

135
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,540
If they aren't even concerned about it,

136
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,590
why are

137
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,940
you worrying about

138
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,910
her prospects?

139
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,830
Just make it happen. Talk later!

140
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:27,022
(Dad: Just get them
to exchange contacts first!)

I think my blood sugar just spiked.)

(Fang Chi: No.)

146
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,980
So is that like you've never had one?

147
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,860
Or just currently single?

148
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,310
Do you want to change that status?

149
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,070
Tell me,

150
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,710
what's your type?

151
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,590
(Luo Man's Voice Message)

152
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,244
(Fang Chi: Just currently.)

153
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:44,852
(I like smart women.
The kind who know their own mind.)

154
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,380
So, listen,

155
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,780
I've got a few questions for you.

156
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,140
Ask away.

157
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,830
What's

158
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,950
your take on marriage?

159
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,310
I mean,

160
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,350
lots of young guys
just want to play around first

161
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,900
before settling down.

162
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,550
They're all just going with the flow.

163
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,980
What about you?

164
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,260
How do you feel about marriage?

165
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,660
I'm not

166
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,780
against marriage.

167
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,470
I'd just go with the flow.

168
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,470
Go with the flow?

169
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,550
That's such a canned answer!

170
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,950
I've noticed something.

171
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,980
Even though you usually act

172
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,230
all cool and aloof,

173
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,900
you've got shockingly
good parent appeal.

174
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,310
My dad

175
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,590
and mom

176
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,860
praised you like
you're some prize-winning orchid.

177
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,350
Your parents are just being kind.

178
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,710
Why don't

179
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,230
you send me

180
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,310
a photo of yourself?

181
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,740
Who are you trying to set me up with?

182
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,260
My cousin.

183
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,860
I'm telling you,

184
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,980
she majored in English in college,

185
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,500
but she didn't like it,

186
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:09,660
so she decided to apply
for law school for her master's.

187
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,740
And guess what? She actually got in.

188
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,710
See?

189
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:14,140
She's got a mind of her own

190
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,070
and she's smart.

191
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,550
She's totally your type.

192
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,070
Does your cousin

193
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,710
look like you?

194
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,900
I...

195
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,350
She's

196
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,350
a little sweeter than me.

197
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,310
And

198
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,980
cuter.

199
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,780
You know,
the bubbly and sweet kind of girl.

200
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,020
She doesn't

201
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,740
share your temper, does she?

202
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,500
What temper? I don't have a temper!

203
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,020
Watch it now!

204
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,900
I said she's a bubbly sweetheart!

205
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,980
Did you not get that?

206
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,380
And since when do

207
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,620
I have a temper anyway?

208
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,070
I've been restraining myself with you!

209
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,780
Why?

210
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,830
What do you mean why?

211
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,020
I needed your help.

212
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,760
I had to act nicer, didn't I?

213
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,110
Besides, I know I didn't exactly make
the best first impression.

214
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,470
I figured I should make up for it.

215
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,020
Just the first impression?

216
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,660
If you're going to be like this,
we're done talking.

217
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,140
Just send the photo.

218
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,950
It was actually good.

219
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,710
I mean,

220
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,660
my first impression of you

221
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,550
was actually pretty great.

222
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,920
(Unknown Number)

223
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,500
Hello?

224
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,950
Who is this?

225
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,550
I'm going to hang up if
you don't say something.

226
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,590
Cheng.

227
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,550
It's me.

228
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,310
I want to see you.

229
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,660
Do you have time?

230
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,190
Please enjoy.

231
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,950
Thank you.

232
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,190
Thank you.

233
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,470
This is so good.

234
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,950
So satisfying!

235
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,980
We can finally dine in again.

236
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,310
Yes.

237
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,380
This is literally

238
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,980
our modest version of paradise!

239
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,620
I've been eating
my own cooking every single day.

240
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,740
I was going insane!
No one should have to endure that.

241
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,266
Come on.

242
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,190
Cheers!

243
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,590
Thank goodness.

244
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:01,400
Where is Zhong Qingcheng?

245
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:02,860
What's taking her so long?

246
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,780
Traffic.

247
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:04,980
Now that dine-in's open again,

248
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,020
the whole city's jammed.

249
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,590
Let me check on her. I'll hurry her up.

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,140
So how are you holding up?

251
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,550
Working on any scripts?

252
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,590
Don't even ask.

253
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,400
The whole industry is
still at a standstill.

254
00:14:17,177 --> 00:14:20,110
But you know what's weird?
My mindset has changed.

255
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,900
Before,

256
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,860
just seeing my bank balance

257
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,830
would send me

258
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,430
into panic mode.

259
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,350
But now?

260
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,430
I feel

261
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,660
okay.

262
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,070
Like, I can still get by.

263
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,070
But you've still got mortgage payments.

264
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,350
If you really hit a wall,
just say the word.

265
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,590
See?

266
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,020
This is why having a rich bestie rocks.

267
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,310
I'll bankroll you.

268
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,500
No worries, I can still manage.

269
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,710
I've made up my mind.

270
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,740
If it really comes to it, I'll go back

271
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,430
and just write whatever gigs I can get.

272
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:54,350
My dad's being ridiculous again.

273
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,070
Why?

274
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,400
The second he recovered,
he went right back to meddling.

275
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,780
Guess who he's trying
to set my cousin up with?

276
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,780
Who?

277
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,980
Fang Chi.

278
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,380
Good luck with that.

279
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,230
Chen Mian tried playing
matchmaker before.

280
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,620
Fang Chi is impossibly picky.

281
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,950
He turned every single girl down.

282
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,980
Every single one?

283
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,276
(Unknown Number)

284
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,344
(Warrior Princesses,
Missed Call, Unknown Number)

285
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,200
(Warrior Princesses)
(Xi: Where are you, Qingcheng?)

286
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,740
(Zhong Qingcheng:
Something came up. I can't make it. Sorry.)

287
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:39,380
(Unknown Number)

288
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,230
Hello.

289
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,070
Li Wei'an's case dragged on forever,

290
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,740
but it finally got a verdict.

291
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,190
How did it turn out?

292
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,310
She lost.

293
00:16:57,777 --> 00:16:59,600
Custody of her kid
went to her ex-husband,

294
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,044
and she walked away with nothing.

295
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,830
That's going to be rough for her.

296
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,700
She

297
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,180
went back to what she used to do,

298
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,790
teaching dance.

299
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,550
But you know

300
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,140
how hard that is these days.

301
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,990
Where is Qingcheng?
Why isn't she here yet?

302
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,450
She said in the group chat
that she couldn't make it.

303
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,860
She can't?

304
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,070
Why not?

305
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:30,960
(Mr. Zhang)
Something doesn't feel right.

306
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,266
(Luo Man, check the trending searches.)
The trending searches?

307
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,800
A friend just told me to check
the trending searches.

308
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,620
What is it?

309
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:41,990
What's going on?

310
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,220
"Actress abandons
cancer-stricken father."

311
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,620
It's fine if my illness goes untreated.

312
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,180
I don't mind dying.

313
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,940
But I just want everyone
to seek justice for me.

314
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,220
is this how a child

315
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,620
should treat their parent?

316
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,400
Not a single cent. Even if I had it,
I wouldn't give it to you.

317
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,460
However you want to die,
that's your choice.

318
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,550
Do whatever you want.

319
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,750
That's obviously edited.

320
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,270
Yes.

321
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,790
But public opinion
has turned against her.

322
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:16,510
(If this is true, she's cruel!)
The crowd always roots for the underdog.

323
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,180
Even if she clarifies now,

324
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,310
the damage is done.

325
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,620
Well? What did your agent say?

326
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:27,620
He told me not to respond.

327
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,830
They'll handle it.

328
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:30,900
And how exactly are
they planning to handle it?

329
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,620
Probably just issue a legal notice.

330
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,590
Useless anyway.

331
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,380
As netizens say,

332
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,550
those lawyer letters

333
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,110
are just 5,000 yuan toilet paper.

334
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,111
The more you speak up,
the guiltier you look.

335
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,940
It's okay. We'll figure
something out ourselves.

336
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,990
Yes, we'll find a way.

337
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,220
(Mom)

338
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,380
Come on...

339
00:18:58,606 --> 00:18:59,770
(Mom)

340
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,510
(Missed call)

341
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,140
I actually thought...

342
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,070
This time when he came back,

343
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,660
I thought maybe getting older

344
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,030
would've changed him.

345
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,830
Was I just being stupid?

346
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,620
Qingcheng,

347
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,550
you can't just let him
control the narrative.

348
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,590
You have to speak up too.

349
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,844
You were just a kid
when he ran off with some rich woman.

350
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:25,140
And now, after all these years,

351
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,310
he suddenly shows up

352
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,460
demanding five million?

353
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,700
Who does that?

354
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
You're not stupid.

355
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,620
A leopard can't change its spots.

356
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:34,380
It just proves you are kind.

357
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,380
Your phone.

358
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,310
He said...

359
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,420
He said he's going on television.

360
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,350
He said he has got media connections.

361
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,460
What... What do I do?

362
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,830
Please take these phones out.

363
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,955
And we won't need further
interruptions. Thank you.

364
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,270
Please close the door. Thank you.

365
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,140
Yes, ma'am.

366
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,070
I've said

367
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,750
all there is to say over the phone.

368
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,990
I just wanted

369
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,550
five million at first.

370
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,270
Now I'm demanding six million.

371
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,070
I think

372
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,350
the emotional damage alone warrants it,

373
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,550
not to mention my deteriorating health.

374
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,030
Wait any longer,

375
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,310
even six million won't cover it.

376
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,940
In your darn dreams!

377
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,420
Six million?

378
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,311
Are you insane?

379
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:49,620
Don't you know she's been trending
because of this scandal?

380
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,909
She's losing roles by the minute!

381
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,990
Do you know how much
we've lost because of this?

382
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,860
Six million?

383
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,460
We wouldn't give you six yuan!

384
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,940
Amanda, we're in a public place.

385
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,860
Calm down.

386
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,900
Michelle, I told you,
there's no negotiating with him.

387
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,550
Worst case? We burn this bridge.
So what?

388
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,110
We agreed to talk this through.

389
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,180
Come on.

390
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,420
Sit down.

391
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,460
Mr. Zhong,

392
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,070
we really came today

393
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,590
with the intention of talking
things through calmly.

394
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,510
You're her father.

395
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,220
We understand that you're sick

396
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,660
and in need of money.

397
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,070
Could you

398
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,070
show some sincerity

399
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,590
and lower the price a bit?

400
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,510
Fine.

401
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,940
Four million.

402
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,940
My final offer.

403
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,620
Four million my foot!

404
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,990
You hearing me?

405
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,110
This discussion is over. Let's go!

406
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,380
Calm down.

407
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:38,860
Let's go!

408
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,270
If that's how it is,

409
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,460
then I'll just tell my story on TV.

410
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,750
The date's set.

411
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,460
March 25th,

412
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,420
my birthday.

413
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,420
With attitudes like yours,

414
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,110
you've left me no choice

415
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,350
but to expose you.

416
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,070
Go ahead!

417
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,900
Be my guest!

418
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,310
We'll expose

419
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,550
how you abandoned your family

420
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,860
for some sugar mama!

421
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,790
Bring it on!

422
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,620
Just wait and see.

423
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,110
- I'll be waiting!
- Mr. Zhong!

424
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,350
Your birthday is April 17th.

425
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,140
You're 50 now.

426
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,660
You left mom and me

427
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,990
for that rich woman

428
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,940
when I was ten, on April 17th.

429
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,180
After that,

430
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,460
my mom

431
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,110
never loved another man again.

432
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,350
Neither did I.

433
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,380
Because I learned never to trust anyone.

434
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,180
Even when I was hurt, I never spoke up.

435
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,420
Even when I was bullied,
I never made a scene.

436
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,460
Because I always remembered
what my mom said to me,

437
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,070
"You're not like the other kids.

438
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,270
You don't have a dad."

439
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,940
All these years,

440
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,110
I just want to ask you one thing.

441
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,310
Did we ever cross your mind?

442
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,420
In all this time,

443
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,900
have you never felt
even a shred of guilt?

444
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,350
Not even once thought,

445
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,700
"I owe them an apology"?

446
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,700
Have you?

447
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,420
I'm sorry.

448
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,380
Of course, I feel bad for what I did.

449
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,550
But...

450
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,030
So your apology comes
with a five-million-yuan price tag?

451
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,830
Is that it?

452
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,380
That's not the same thing.

453
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,380
This is about me being sick.

454
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,860
I need the money for treatment.

455
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,220
You're not the one who's sick.

456
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,900
Also,

457
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,030
listen carefully.

458
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,620
When I'm on TV,

459
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,070
the whole country will know.

460
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,070
It'll be too late for regrets then.

461
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,750
Wasn't my acting
just now pretty convincing?

462
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,900
You were great.

463
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,860
Did I fool you two too?

464
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,510
Did I?

465
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,140
You...

466
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,220
You could sweep a bunch of
film festivals with that performance.

467
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,620
So true.

468
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,310
Unlike Luo Man,
she kept going off script.

469
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,030
I actually think
Ms. Luo Man's acting was amazing.

470
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,350
And you too, Ms. Kaixi.

471
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,940
You both had such presence just now.

472
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,070
Really?

473
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,422
I worried this designer suit
made me look too polished.

474
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:01,590
Please. You reeked of

475
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,990
old-money energy,

476
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,110
exactly the vibe to dazzle

477
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,790
a gold-digger like him.

478
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,660
That old guy really
kept his cool though.

479
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,590
We tried good cop, and bad cop,

480
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,900
but he wasn't buying either.

481
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,900
Relax.

482
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:16,900
We haven't even served
the main course yet.

483
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,140
In all this time,

484
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:28,900
have you never felt
even a shred of guilt?

485
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,270
Not even once thought,

486
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,750
"I owe them an apology"?

487
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,030
Have you?

488
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,750
I'm sorry.

489
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,660
Of course, I feel bad for what I did.

490
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,420
But...

491
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,590
So

492
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,750
your apology comes with
a five-million-yuan price tag?

493
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,460
That's not the same thing.

494
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,070
Mr. Zhong,

495
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,420
based on this recording,

496
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,088
you've committed extortion.
The amount involved is five million.

497
00:25:58,111 --> 00:26:00,030
That carries a sentence
of around ten years.

498
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:04,066
You say it's extortion,
so that makes it true?

499
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,790
What, do you own the court?

500
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,270
We definitely don't own the court,

501
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,940
and neither do you.

502
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,380
As for whether it counts as extortion,

503
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,420
we'll let the judge decide.

504
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,460
And by the way,

505
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,030
we haven't tampered

506
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,700
with that recording at all.

507
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,350
As for your version,

508
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,830
just a friendly reminder, Mr. Zhong,

509
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,990
technology is
pretty advanced these days.

510
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
Even deleted files can be recovered.

511
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,350
30,000 yuan or ten years. Your choice.

512
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,550
Sign it.

513
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,830
And you and Zhong Qingcheng will
have nothing to do with each other.

514
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,110
Can we talk about this?

515
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,550
Can you give a little more?

516
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,790
Even just an extra 10,000 yuan?

517
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:23,180
(qingcheng94: Get up and
have late-night snacks!)

518
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:24,548
Alright, Qingcheng.

519
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,080
It's over now. Don't dwell
on it anymore.

520
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,290
(Qingcheng is the real victim here
but gets blamed instead.)

521
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,180
Okay, I'll stop looking.

522
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,620
Still, you really took
a risky path through all this.

523
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,380
Every step was tough.

524
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,310
Just promise me,

525
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,270
don't let yourself get lost in it.

526
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,070
Got it.

527
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,140
Did you not tell Jiang about this?

528
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,830
He texted me asking what was going on.

529
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,660
I didn't.

530
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,900
No need to trouble him with everything.

531
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:57,420
So, where are you two at now?

532
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,140
Yes, where?

533
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,860
Come clean now.

534
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,350
I know how Jiang is.

535
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,550
He's a relentless pursuer.

536
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,550
Nowhere, really.

537
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,700
Really?

538
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,030
Really.

539
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,110
I'm not ready for that

540
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,510
with anyone.

541
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,460
I just want to focus on work.

542
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,220
I just want to act and make money.

543
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,940
Just focus on acting, huh?

544
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,711
A career woman!

545
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,180
Just need her job and nothing else.

546
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,590
Jiang's going to be heartbroken!

547
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,140
After all this,

548
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,590
I realized something.

549
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,140
Besides my mom,

550
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,420
you two are my family now.

551
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,380
Don't worry.

552
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,270
I'll repay you.

553
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,350
How?

554
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,760
Yes, how are you going to repay us?

555
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,830
Tell us now.

556
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,030
Give us something concrete.

557
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,830
Yes.

558
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,030
Well, the money I make, I'll...

559
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,900
Wait, for real?

560
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,700
Record this!

561
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:51,860
You want to split it with us?

562
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,030
Sounds good to me.

563
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,220
I accept!

564
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,350
My turn for some outrageous fortune!

565
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,550
Oh my god, help!

566
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,860
Okay, whatever I earn,

567
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,420
however much it is,

568
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,700
I'll

569
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,030
take you two out.

570
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,620
We'll travel,

571
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,750
and eat amazing food.

572
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,350
Okay!

573
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,830
That's good too!

574
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,380
And you, of all the places
you could've chosen,

575
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,990
why did you pick Zhou's place?

576
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,350
Because it's familiar.
Makes things easier to arrange.

577
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,070
Besides,

578
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,900
that's where you put on
your best performance, huh?

579
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,660
That's so mean!

580
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,700
Was it?

581
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,030
Zhou Musun...

582
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,940
Speaking of Zhou Musun,

583
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,700
what's going on between
him and Luo Man now?

584
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,070
What's the current status there?

585
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:37,180
No nosy questions!

586
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,940
Don't pry.

587
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Just spill it.

588
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,460
I don't know...

589
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,380
We're just...

590
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,377
The kind who occasionally pop
up in each other's Moments

591
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,644
but don't even like the posts?

592
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,030
Barely acquaintances.

593
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,350
It's whatever.

594
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,140
It's good for us.

595
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,550
It's good.

596
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:56,733
Let's focus on our job.

597
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,169
Come on.

598
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:57,800
Here.

599
00:29:57,955 --> 00:29:58,819
To get rich!

600
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,400
Getting rich!

601
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,620
To get rich! Cheers!

602
00:30:13,904 --> 00:30:15,240
(Mrs. Gu)

603
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,180
She's selling her bags?

604
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,380
Did she forget to block me?

605
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,830
Suddenly, I realized

606
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,750
so many things have lost their magic.

607
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,030
Just like that, an era driven by desire

608
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,590
is just gone.

609
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,310
And me?

610
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,350
I've been stripped back
to who I really am.

611
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,350
Hello?

612
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,070
A male-oriented time-travel drama?

613
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,110
Sure, I can write that.

614
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,990
No problem.

615
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,860
No name credit?

616
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,750
Then...

617
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,940
How much are they offering?

618
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,220
Okay.

619
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,030
I'll think about it.

620
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,700
Luo Man,

621
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:55,750
I don't think
I can keep going like this.

622
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,860
My friend's company
is hiring assistants.

623
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,420
But if I take it,

624
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,733
I won't have time to co-write
scripts with you anymore.

625
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,420
It's okay.

626
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,310
Take it. Go for it without any guilt.

627
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,355
Go crush it out there!

628
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,860
Hello, Man.

629
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,550
What's up?

630
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,110
Don't you think

631
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,590
that Dr. Fang's been
acting a little weird lately?

632
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,750
Weird how?

633
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,830
In our group chat,

634
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,590
he replies to
every single message of yours,

635
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,590
but ghosts mine.

636
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,030
That's probably just a coincidence.

637
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,660
Awfully specific coincidence.

638
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,180
Anyway, he doesn't have a shot.

639
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,140
You don't date younger guys,

640
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,110
right?

641
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,380
Okay, you sure know everything,
don't you?

642
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,310
I have to go.

643
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,460
(Pancake-Wrapped Skewers)

644
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,590
What is this?

645
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,110
Let me tell you.

646
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,620
This is our hospital
cafeteria specialty.

647
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,750
Three skewers per wrap.

648
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,180
Let me guess,

649
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,220
there are also four skewers per wrap,

650
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,220
five skewers per wrap,

651
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,310
and maybe even six?

652
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,110
Smart.

653
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,270
Are you really going to be that stingy?

654
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,990
This is what you're treating us to?

655
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,590
It's delicious, okay?

656
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,270
But

657
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,270
you owe me a meal first.

658
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,220
Fine.

659
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,110
I'll take you both

660
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,030
somewhere fancy when my cousin visits,

661
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,750
okay?

662
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,510
Just you and me.

663
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,550
(City Police Series)

664
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,860
Honey,

665
00:33:58,022 --> 00:33:59,466
I'm just going to play LEGO with him.

666
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:00,510
It won't take long.

667
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,550
He's got a cello class
online in ten minutes.

668
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,990
He can play after it's over.

669
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,740
I don't really want to learn the cello.

670
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,510
Tiao,

671
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,550
we don't quit things halfway.

672
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,220
Remember?

673
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,140
Honey,

674
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,620
if he doesn't like it,

675
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,660
let's not force him.

676
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,340
And come on,

677
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,590
what can you possibly

678
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,700
learn from an online music class?

679
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,030
He can learn it when we
can do in-person lessons again.

680
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,820
That's not the way to teach him.

681
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,040
If he learns to quit now,
he'll quit everything later too.

682
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:30,430
And remember, he was the one

683
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,800
who asked to learn cello back then.

684
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,110
I know, but Honey,

685
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,780
Tiao was four

686
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,590
when he said that.

687
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,390
And look at me, I'm almost 40

688
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,340
and I still do things I regret.

689
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,030
Right?

690
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,390
Come on. Let's play.

691
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,300
Chen Zhi, stop right there!

692
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,200
Dear, one parent's rules at a time.

693
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,420
Otherwise you're saying one thing,
and I'm saying another,

694
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:56,133
who's he supposed to listen to?

695
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:58,420
And when you get busy,
it'll make things hard for me.

696
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:01,000
Do you have any idea how hard
it is for me to set up rules for him?

697
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,340
Yes, you're right.

698
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,470
Tiao,

699
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,740
I have to listen to your mom too.

700
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,590
Can't help you, buddy.

701
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,180
Go on.

702
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,990
Come.

703
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,030
Your class is about to start.

704
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,260
I'll give you a reward
after your lesson, okay?

705
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,780
Here.

706
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:28,110
Hold your hands like this.

707
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,950
A little higher. Good.

708
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,700
What about you?

709
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,990
You're alone.

710
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,430
Who's going to take care of my daughter?

711
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,620
Hello?

712
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,950
Um...

713
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,740
My...

714
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,950
My stomach hurts so much.

715
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,260
I can't get up.

716
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,950
I'm coming.

717
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,030
Luo Man!

718
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,180
Luo Man!

719
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,340
Let's go.

720
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,220
Say something to distract me.

721
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,510
Did you...

722
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,910
Did you break up with Zhou Musun?

723
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,660
Seriously? You really want
to talk about that now?

724
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,510
Why not?

725
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,990
You're not trying to hit on me, are you?

726
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,620
Why not?

727
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,550
No.

728
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,340
Here?

729
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,340
No.

730
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,070
What about here?

731
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,620
Sudden lower abdominal pain.

732
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,590
Doctor,

733
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:24,740
I...

734
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,910
Fang Chi, your diagnosis?

735
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,430
Hemorrhoids.

736
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,070
And why would hemorrhoids
cause acute abdominal pain?

737
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,822
Possible fecal impaction due
to enlarged hemorrhoidal tissue,

738
00:38:35,844 --> 00:38:37,660
causing referred
gastrointestinal distress.

739
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,550
Good. Let's do a rectal exam.

740
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,990
We're getting that specific?

741
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,030
Miss, please lie down.

742
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,990
Please stay still.

743
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,070
Lower your pants to your knees.

744
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
It'll be over soon.

745
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,660
Almost done.

746
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,390
Where should I help you to?

747
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,220
The couch.

748
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,700
Come.

749
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:38,910
Thank you.

750
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:42,030
You should stay in bed
as much as you can

751
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,590
for the next couple of days.

752
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,620
Try lying on your side

753
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,820
or stomach.

754
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,390
And maybe ease up

755
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,910
on work for now too.

756
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,550
Please pass me my phone.

757
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,070
Answer it.

758
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,470
Hello?

759
00:40:09,555 --> 00:40:12,019
Ms. Luo Man, why haven't you
replied to my texts?

760
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,533
We're on a daily update schedule.

761
00:40:13,555 --> 00:40:16,133
If you don't submit your draft,
we'll miss tomorrow's release!

762
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,390
I just got back from the hospital.

763
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:20,820
What am I supposed to do then?

764
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,470
Where do I find
a last-minute replacement?

765
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,390
It's fine.

766
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,140
It's just 3,000 words.

767
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,620
I can write it. Don't worry.

768
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,110
Okay then.

769
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,070
You really think

770
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,644
you can still work in this condition?

771
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,300
I think I can.

772
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,470
Please hand me my laptop.

773
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,910
I'll write lying down.

774
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,110
Dictate it.

775
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,660
I'll type.

776
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,740
Well...

777
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,550
My current project

778
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,260
isn't really dictation-friendly.

779
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,140
Is this the one?

780
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,030
"Seven Years On The Run With His Child,

781
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,740
The CEO Finally Found Me"?

782
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:33,160
(Seven Years On The Run With His Child,
The CEO Finally Found Me)

783
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,780
People actually

784
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,180
publish this kind of stuff?

785
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,260
Sure they do.

786
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,340
It's pay-to-read.

787
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,740
There's a market for it.

788
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,950
We just provide what readers want.

789
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,660
So...

790
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,550
You think you're up for it?

791
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,620
Yes.

792
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:08,780
Okay.

793
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,870
Are you sure?

794
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,590
Let's get started then.

795
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,470
Let me see where I left off.

796
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,220
Got it. I know where to go next.

797
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,220
Here we go.

798
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,990
"She said..."

799
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,030
The female lead.

800
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,030
"Do you like me?"

801
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,700
Then "His..."

802
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,660
"His eyes were cold and sharp."

803
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,660
Cold and sharp...

804
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,700
"He gave a wicked smile and said,

805
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,510
"I like doing that with you."

806
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,660
"She replied,

807
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,390
"Liking doing that with me,
and liking me,

808
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,300
aren't exactly the same."

809
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,660
What's wrong?

810
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,740
Is the "doing that" you said

811
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,140
what I think

812
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,260
it is?

813
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:46,300
The male lead is so cold and heartless.

814
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,910
And women readers

815
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,470
like this?

816
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,340
It's all about

817
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,700
expressing emotional needs

818
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,820
they can't let out in real life.

819
00:43:58,888 --> 00:44:00,430
They enjoy reading it, so I write it.

820
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,300
So, you still good?

821
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:05,700
Yes.

822
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:06,660
Okay.

823
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,550
Let's continue then.

824
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,140
"Under the bright moonlight,

825
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,260
she clung to him

826
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,110
like a vine, entwining him tightly."

827
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,620
Give me a second.

828
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,070
"She gently

829
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,620
ran her slender fingers

830
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,990
across his ear,

831
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,620
and then began to explore downward.

832
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,780
He trembled

833
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,030
all over."

834
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:45,820
You know how to spell "tremble," right?

835
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,140
Yes.

836
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,070
Thanks for staying up so late with me.

837
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,620
And for doing me such a huge favor.

838
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,070
So?

839
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,110
Do you feel like you've gained
a new appreciation for literature?

840
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,620
I've gained a better understanding

841
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,140
of women's mindset.

842
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,030
I should get going.

843
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,660
Good night.

844
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:26,870
Thank you.

845
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,340
A documentary?

846
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:24,470
Yes.

847
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,620
It's my current company's project.

848
00:46:26,622 --> 00:46:28,990
They want to film the growth
of intern doctors in a hospital.

849
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,700
They're putting
a lot of importance on it

850
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,180
and want an experienced screenwriter.

851
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,740
You were the first person I thought of.

852
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,140
The pay's decent,

853
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,070
but the work is a little scattered.

854
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,444
It'll run for three to four months.

855
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,260
Let me think about it.

856
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,812
(Good evening, Man.
Your balance: 23,500.)

857
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,140
If you don't like it,

858
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,740
should I just turn it down?

859
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,740
No.

860
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:52,910
I'll take it.

861
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:55,870
I can start anytime.

862
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,820
We've been reviewing

863
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,260
hospital recommendations.

864
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,888
(Director Liu)
There's actually this one young doctor.

865
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:02,660
Really impressive.

866
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,070
Good appearance, very professional too.

867
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,030
The problem is, he doesn't
want to be on the show.

868
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,870
We've approached him multiple times,

869
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,030
but he's not budging.

870
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,820
What does he look like?

871
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,990
Do you have his photo?

872
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:15,620
Let me check.

873
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:16,950
Okay, sent it.

874
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,660
Director,

875
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,070
I think I can get him on board.

876
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,550
(Chen Kaixi: Someone insisted
on showing off their soccer skills,)

877
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,199
(almost played themselves
into jelly legs.)

878
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,760
(Luo Man: Every boast you make will
be paid for in sweat and tears.)

879
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,000
(Chen Mian: Onward to greater heights
in the business world.)

880
00:47:40,003 --> 00:47:42,720
(Zhong Qingcheng: What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger. You got this!)

882
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,198

Keep on trying!)
