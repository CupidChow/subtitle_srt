1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,887
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,972
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:05,899
He…

4
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,651
did that?

5
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,362
Finish things up nicely,

6
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,990
then disappear for a while.

7
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,242
I'll go get the stuff when it's time.

8
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,203
Who are you to be getting my stuff?

9
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,540
So why didn't you
do it right in the first place?

10
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,751
You're the one who brought in the snitch.

11
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,008
I told you, I got rid of him nicely.

12
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,845
Sure.

13
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,348
So we have one less thing to worry about.

14
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,498
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,922
Nice mask.

16
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,260
Hey.

17
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:16,928
What are you doing here?

18
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,054
What about you?

19
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,061
That's him.

20
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,647
He's the one who killed me.

21
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,694
And…

22
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,280
I was with them.

23
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,282
I am…

24
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,536
also a murderer.

25
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,595
Wook.

26
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,057
Get out of here.

27
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,282
Where did he go?

28
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,496
He's gone. Let's go.

29
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,414
Go where?

30
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,252
Who is that guy?

31
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,883
He's a friend from middle school
and he sells drugs on social media.

32
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,801
His name is Kim Pil-jung, and he and I--

33
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,887
You were with them?

34
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,804
Murder?

35
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,640
Did you sell drugs and kill people?

36
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,517
I was suspicious of you from the start.

37
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,852
But I didn't think…

38
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,272
that it would be this bad.

39
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,404
Pil-jung will be back.

40
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,740
Hurry up and go.

41
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,991
Does Captain Kang…

42
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,871
know what you're really like?

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,418
But you didn't mean to do it.

44
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,593
I practically killed that kid.

45
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,765
Yes, what you did was wrong.

46
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,642
So what?

47
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,145
Whenever I lie down to sleep,

48
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,232
I'm reminded of his face.

49
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,572
I guess guilt

50
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,325
doesn't disappear even when you die.

51
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,207
This is neither heaven nor hell.

52
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,584
It's not a place
where people are punished.

53
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,879
And it's also not a place
where your past is erased.

54
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,257
I know.

55
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,428
Il-yong.

56
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,724
Don't you ever tell others
about yourself from now on.

57
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,517
The things you just told me.

58
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,602
What you did when you were alive.

59
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,939
Never tell others
what happened before you died.

60
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,817
Why not?

61
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,820
Even without your story,

62
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,198
everyone here carries a heavy burden.

63
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,617
So just keep your story buried inside.

64
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,162
As for the price of your sins,

65
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,288
bear it on your own.

66
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,499
Do you hear me?

67
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,381
I'll tell you everything,

68
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,883
so let's go somewhere else.

69
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,594
He's someone who stabbed me
without even blinking an eye.

70
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,596
You don't know what he may do to you.

71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,434
Let's go.

72
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,696
Damn it.

73
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,449
Yes?

74
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,494
Understood.

75
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,011
When I was young,

76
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,139
my family was really poor.

77
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,726
It was just me and my mom.

78
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,937
But…

79
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,981
my mom was sick
and had to stay home all day.

80
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,735
So I took on all kinds of jobs
since middle school.

81
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,821
I worked myself to the bone,

82
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,908
but I couldn't pay for her medication,
let alone her hospital bills.

83
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,495
Then Pil-jung came to see me.

84
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,918
Your mom's hospital bill.

85
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,590
Ten million won?

86
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,136
That's a huge amount of money.

87
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,389
We were close in middle school.

88
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,601
But I didn't see him around for a while,
and then he showed up rich.

89
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,353
He said he could help me make money.

90
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,730
So I quit all my part-time jobs

91
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,650
and made deliveries as he told me to.

92
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,987
I made so much money
even though the work was easy.

93
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,952
But it was drugs I was delivering.

94
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,792
Drop-off complete.

95
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,879
The mailbox at 26, Gahyeon-ro 47-gil.

96
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,207
Shut the hell up.

97
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,297
Dad, don't do it.

98
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,674
Dad…

99
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,551
Dad!

100
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,304
Dad…

101
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,972
Don't…

102
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,935
-Come on. Let's go.
-Dad…

103
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,438
Dad!

104
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,732
-Hurry up.
-Dad…

105
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,363
Mr. Min, who beat his son to death,
was arrested by the police.

106
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,824
Around 11 p.m. on the 20th,
Mr. Min, from Gahyeon-dong,

107
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,620
started beating his son
who wouldn't stop crying out of hunger.

108
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,748
The eight-year-old
was later found by neighbors

109
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,459
and was sent to a hospital,
but ended up dying.

110
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,337
Mr. Min was under
the influence of drugs at the time…

111
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,469
A few days later, I saw the news
that a druggie father killed his son.

112
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,138
I checked the date

113
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,140
and it was the day

114
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,643
that I delivered the drugs.

115
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:23,896
It was…

116
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,315
so horrible and scary.

117
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,778
That's when I came to my senses.

118
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,114
If I had stopped him,

119
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,532
if I had reported it…

120
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,495
That boy died because of me.

121
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,999
That's why I'm no different
from a murderer.

122
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,757
And how did you die?

123
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,885
On my way to the police to turn myself in,

124
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,805
I met with Pil-jung
to get him to come with me.

125
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,224
And he stabbed me.

126
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,978
Do you think you paid for
your sins by dying?

127
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,689
No.

128
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,401
My death isn't going to
bring that boy back.

129
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,112
And there was no way
to let the world know what I did

130
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,239
or change what I did.

131
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,579
I guess me dying
and feeling this guilt for eternity

132
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,582
is my punishment.

133
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,674
Not everyone feels guilty
like you do even after they die.

134
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,095
There are many
who never feel guilty to the end.

135
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,100
My mom

136
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,728
passed away in the hospital.

137
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,481
Thankfully, before I died.

138
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,610
I'm a pathetic son.

139
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,614
So you know that?

140
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,327
That's why I couldn't tell you before.

141
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,411
I was ashamed.

142
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,913
So why are you telling me now?

143
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,543
If there's something
that upsets you or makes you angry,

144
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,379
it doesn't have to be me, but…

145
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,758
if there's someone you want to confide in,
talk to that person. Okay?

146
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,595
Just because.

147
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,097
Then…

148
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,517
you went to find him at that club?

149
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,435
It's been a while since I found him.

150
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,938
I was digging into Pil-jung
when I saw Detective Goh.

151
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,481
According to Detective Goh,

152
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,567
that Goliath guy gave all the orders.

153
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,319
Is he also Goliath's henchman?

154
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,445
Henchman?

155
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,073
Pil-jung is Goliath.

156
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,393
Get rid of your phone
and go off the grid for a while.

157
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,436
Right now.

158
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,027
So you're saying…

159
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,572
that Goliath guy

160
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,781
killed you,

161
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,367
kidnapped Se-yeong,

162
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,910
and killed Detective Goh?

163
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,663
-Yes.
-You know where he lives, right?

164
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,040
He moves from one hotel to another.

165
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,210
You're not thinking of going, are you?

166
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,753
Why would I go there?

167
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,005
I'm going to report this.

168
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,424
By the way, Wook.

169
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,884
-In that room--
-Wait!

170
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,804
Don't move.

171
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,142
What? Who?

172
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,143
Me? Why?

173
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,273
He's here, isn't he?

174
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,817
Or here?

175
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,778
What's wrong, Jong-a? You're scaring me.

176
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,405
I know he's here.

177
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,327
What are you talking about?

178
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,828
Mr. Oh Il-yong.

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,293
You heard from Wook, right?

180
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,837
I was the one
who found the detective's home.

181
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,089
I'm not bragging or anything,

182
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,466
but I'm pretty skilled.

183
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,886
I'm good at finding people
and things that people hide.

184
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,972
-Hey, Jong-a--
-Anyway,

185
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,643
I'm working hard here
to find things just like you.

186
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,479
So let's compete in good faith.

187
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,148
Here.

188
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,735
We should find everyone
who suffered wrongful deaths, right?

189
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,740
He's not there.

190
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,742
No?

191
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,702
Here.

192
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,208
Not there either.

193
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,709
No?

194
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,712
Here.

195
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,757
What an interesting family.

196
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,354
He held your hand just now.

197
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,147
Really?

198
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,945
Nice to meet you,

199
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,321
Mr. Oh Il-yong.

200
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,491
It's nice to meet you too.

201
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,164
-Get in!
-Yes, sir.

202
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,207
Search the left side.

203
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,125
Yes, sir.

204
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,754
He's not here.

205
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,350
-Stay still.
-Let go of me!

206
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:54,935
What's this?

207
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,229
You're under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

208
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,358
They're completely knocked out.

209
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,318
Wake them up.

210
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,028
Yes, sir.

211
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,254
-Sir.
-Yes?

212
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,255
Turn off the engine.

213
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,549
Stay in your seats.

214
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,308
Gwang-taek. Let's do this the easy way.

215
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,855
-Let go of me!
-Hurry.

216
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,190
Let go!

217
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,611
A raid on the largest drug cartel in Korea
was carried out last night.

218
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,198
The drug cartel operated
chat rooms on social media

219
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:54,161
and distributed drugs nationwide…

220
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,829
-Proceed.
-Yes, sir.

221
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,333
The leader of the cartel, Goliath,
is a man in his twenties,

222
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,170
and he was found to have disappeared
to escape the police.

223
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,672
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

224
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,298
I saw the news.

225
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,509
I heard you busted the whole cartel.

226
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,678
Oh, please.

227
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,889
Junkies don't disappear
just by catching some underlings.

228
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,101
We let them operate
for six months on purpose.

229
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,688
We've been working hard
to catch their leader.

230
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,481
But we lost Goliath.

231
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,401
Any news about Sang-cheol?

232
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,862
Detective Shin is working hard on it.

233
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,822
Okay.

234
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,657
-I'll call you soon.
-All right.

235
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,660
That was Man-sik.

236
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,620
I was about to go meet the informant now.

237
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,622
The informant? They saw Goh Sang-cheol?

238
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,749
Well, I'll have to go find out.

239
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,667
I'll get going.

240
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,712
-Sir, may I join you?
-It's fine, I'll go alone.

241
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,588
-I'm your partner though.
-It's really…

242
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,590
Hey! Did you write up the report?

243
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,300
You didn't, did you?
Go finish that right now.

244
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,594
You are so slow.

245
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,804
I'm off.

246
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,645
You lost him even when
I told you his name and room number?

247
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,273
He's the one who killed Il-yong
and Detective Goh.

248
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,316
And also the one who kidnapped Se-yeong.

249
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,318
Goodness.

250
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,864
He was already gone
when the Drug Squad got there.

251
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,287
Please ask him if there's anywhere
that Kim Pil-jung frequents

252
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,330
or where he might go to.

253
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,792
He moves from one hotel to another,
so we don't have his address.

254
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,795
I think I've seen it all.

255
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,798
To see Detective Shin
asking a ghost for help.

256
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,093
I'm asking you, not the ghost.

257
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,889
So you finally acknowledge my skills.

258
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,059
Where are we going anyway?

259
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,687
To find the car that you mentioned.

260
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,522
Detective Goh's car?

261
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,903
The black one.

262
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,196
Thank you.

263
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,413
Is this his car?

264
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,082
Look at the back seat.

265
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,746
So this is the needle
used on Choi Jeong-ah?

266
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,639
No, sir.

267
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,015
You must not approach.

268
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,809
This is a scene of a crime.

269
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,436
The forensics will be here soon.

270
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,771
Do not touch the evidence.

271
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,772
All right.

272
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,190
The evidence.

273
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,445
This is why I came with you.

274
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,239
What?

275
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,950
You find evidence as if you're a psychic.

276
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,326
It's suspicious.

277
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,579
What do you mean suspicious?

278
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,122
I heard it directly
from the person involved.

279
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,331
That's what I mean.

280
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,041
The person involved is dead.

281
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,251
And you heard it

282
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,128
from a dead man.

283
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,547
Right.

284
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,009
But you should be used to this by now.

285
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,720
I am, but other people will…

286
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,222
Forget it.

287
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,727
I can stay home by myself.

288
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,730
I don't feel comfortable
leaving you here by yourself.

289
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,732
You can study at the café.

290
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,859
White noise is supposed to
help you concentrate.

291
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,320
I feel like a kid when I'm with you.

292
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,155
You take me to and from school.

293
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,242
We met under unique circumstances.

294
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,163
So I wanted to say thanks.

295
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:08,957
Let's go.

296
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,293
We caught the criminal

297
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,878
and found the needle.

298
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,380
So Detective Goh will be leaving soon.

299
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,592
We haven't found his body yet.

300
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,511
We first have to find
evidence that he's dead.

301
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,513
It's not going to be easy.

302
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,973
We haven't caught Goliath yet.

303
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,142
He's like a rat.

304
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,686
He's a pro at escaping
and getting off the grid.

305
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,522
You really don't know
where he could have gone to?

306
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,776
He's probably far gone by now.

307
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,027
Wasn't he a friend?

308
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,446
What friend stabs you with a knife?

309
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,324
You should have been careful
when choosing friends.

310
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,034
I'm regretting that even when I'm dead.

311
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,161
Good for you.

312
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,330
You have a comeback
for everything, don't you?

313
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,251
I know I don't have the right.

314
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,045
I'm glad you know that.

315
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,421
Oh, dear.

316
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,548
Here we go.

317
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,883
I'll take it.

318
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,554
I'm so happy that there are
so many strong men in this village.

319
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,765
Men are not all the same.

320
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,475
I do the work of 100 men by myself.

321
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,060
Then you take this.

322
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,770
The kids will be waiting. Let's go.

323
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,688
What?

324
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,023
Wait for me.

325
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,528
Be careful.

326
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,075
Goodness, they fight and play
like brothers do.

327
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,369
How nice.

328
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,044
Let's start on the pumpkins.

329
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,963
Oh, dear.

330
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,047
This will do.

331
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,050
What is it?

332
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,260
Did you leave something?

333
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,313
It must have been the wind.

334
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,986
Ro-ha, raise your knees
and pull back your chin.

335
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,994
Tuck in your stomach.

336
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:15,125
"Spread the strawberry jam on soft bread."

337
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,212
"Don't forget the salty ham."

338
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,173
How are you doing, Detective Goh?

339
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,051
What took you so long to bring the snacks?

340
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,011
You left all these kids to me.

341
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,392
Mr. Jung, Alice.

342
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,895
We brought snacks.

343
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,700
What's wrong?

344
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,119
Take a look at this, Ms. Ahn.

345
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,209
Do you see these yellow parts here?

346
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,543
What do you think they are?

347
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,671
These look like tree trunks.

348
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,925
But I have no clue
what these yellow parts are.

349
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,052
When you look at this,

350
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,762
This yellow

351
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,764
looks like it's blocked by the trees.

352
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,476
Goodness. This is really frustrating.

353
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,647
Do you think we can ask Ro-ha about this?

354
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,986
I won't if it's bad for the kid.

355
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,032
The kids will be here soon, right?

356
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,076
-Yes.
-Okay.

357
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,369
-I should go.
-Okay.

358
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,669
Where are the customers?

359
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,171
Welcome!

360
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,263
You didn't go to work today, Seul-gi?

361
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,556
She quit her job.

362
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,766
And I guess you don't care about me
since I'm jobless.

363
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,560
-You quit?
-Yes.

364
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,855
Everything felt meaningless
after what happened to Jeong-ah.

365
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,273
I've been working too hard.

366
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,692
I plan to take it easy from now on.

367
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,820
Your café is so pretty.

368
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,282
What's the concept here?

369
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,951
I thought this was the wrong place
because it's so deserted around.

370
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,662
Hey, this café will be popular soon.

371
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,874
Industrial-style café alley.
Don't you get it?

372
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,084
It's going to be a hotspot.

373
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,210
-A hotspot?
-Yes.

374
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,880
Then where are your customers?

375
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,299
Did you advertise properly?
Like an opening event?

376
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,426
-Opening event?
-Jong-a.

377
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,344
I'll go see if the dogs are okay.

378
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,345
Sure.

379
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,934
Who's that? A part-time worker?

380
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,936
Just a kid I know.

381
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,939
-You have a barista certificate, right?
-Yes.

382
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,942
-Do you want to work here?
-Sure.

383
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,944
Hey, Jong-a. Why Seul-gi and not me?

384
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,322
She's going to take it easy, remember?

385
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,699
But I'm always hard working
even if I'm unemployed.

386
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,784
Forget it. Let's talk over some coffee.

387
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,578
-All right.
-You can have anything you want.

388
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,079
It's free for today.

389
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,289
Free?

390
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,916
-Really? Then…
-I want the matcha…

391
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,709
I want three pieces of this cake

392
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,378
and an AA Kenyan iced frappuccino
with dulce caramel syrup

393
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,965
and mint chocolate chips
topped with whipped cream.

394
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,342
-Have all three.
-That's all.

395
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,843
-Have everything.
-What is that?

396
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,886
-Jong-a?
-Yes?

397
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,513
SO GOOD COFFEE

398
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,640
Where's Jjamppong?

399
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,142
Jjamppong?

400
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,894
Jjamppong!

401
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,480
Jjamppong!

402
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,315
Where did he go?

403
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:33,990
FALLING DEBRIS
DO NOT ENTER

404
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,903
It's a puppy.

405
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,240
Hi, puppy.

406
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,917
Hey.

407
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,627
Have you seen Alice?

408
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,172
Everyone else is in the classroom,
but I don't see Alice.

409
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,926
I think I saw her here just a moment ago.
Where did she go?

410
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,428
Maybe she's in the backyard.

411
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,762
-I'll go take a look.
-Okay.

412
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,015
-Then I'll look outside.
-All right.

413
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,016
Hey, Detective Goh.

414
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,100
You go that way.

415
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,644
I'll go take a look
inside the building again.

416
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,603
Okay.

417
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,818
Alice!

418
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,903
What are you doing here by yourself?

419
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,452
There's a puppy in this village?

420
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,287
Gosh.

421
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,750
Let me take a look.

422
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:08,877
Jjamppong?

423
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,588
Did you…

424
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,298
die?

425
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,510
Alice, where did you find this puppy?

426
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,970
Was it under that tree?

427
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,013
No.

428
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,933
He came from over there.

429
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,311
I see. From there?

430
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,146
Alice!

431
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,522
Alice!

432
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,903
Why do you sound so desperate,
running out of breath?

433
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,654
Did you bring Alice here?

434
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,615
No, I met her on the way here.

435
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,035
-She was playing with Jjamppong.
-Why would Jjamppong be here?

436
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,411
He should be at home.

437
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,333
He looks… Hey, Jjamppong!

438
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,670
Are you dead?

439
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,672
No, I don't think he is.

440
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,341
Alice says

441
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,009
that he appeared from there.

442
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,639
You…

443
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,849
Is he here alone?
Where are Janggun and Meonggun?

444
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,684
I don't see them. He must be here alone.

445
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,484
Ro-ha.

446
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,111
Have you been here?

447
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:17,946
Yes.

448
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,448
With whom?

449
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,160
I went there alone
because my mom was gone.

450
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,204
I see.

451
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,874
There are so many trees here.

452
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,338
What's this?

453
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,968
I don't know.

454
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,681
Was this next to the tree?

455
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,016
Yes.

456
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,360
-You shouldn't wander around.
-Jjamppong!

457
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,695
Jjamppong.

458
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,988
Bo-ra.

459
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,364
Jjamppong!

460
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,242
Jjamppong…

461
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,078
I've been looking for him everywhere.

462
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,955
Where was he, Mr. Jang?

463
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,042
He was wandering around there
so I brought him.

464
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,336
You must have been worried. Let's go.

465
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,923
My heart almost stopped.
I thought it was another disappearance.

466
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,842
"Another"?

467
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,052
Has Jjamppong disappeared before?

468
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,763
No.

469
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,389
It's not that.

470
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,476
I was just reminded of my mom

471
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,935
and I got scared.

472
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,064
I see.

473
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,570
-Hello.
-Hey, Jun-ho.

474
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,780
Did you get the results?

475
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,032
Not yet. I just got the call myself.

476
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,077
How did you know
that Sang-cheol hid the needle there?

477
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,956
If it were me,
I would have hidden it there.

478
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,625
So I looked there just in case.

479
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:55,919
Is that so?

480
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,504
That was smart.

481
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,465
-You're here.
-Hello, Doctor.

482
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,675
What are the results?

483
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,096
During the autopsy on Choi Jeong-ah,
we found methamphetamine and zolpidem.

484
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,933
There were also traces
of zolpidem inside the needle.

485
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,227
And the DNA?

486
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,896
Choi Jeong-ah's bloodstains
were found on the needle.

487
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,357
It also matched the mark on her neck.

488
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,316
The conclusion

489
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,777
is that this is the needle used on her.

490
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,658
There are no traces of other people?
Like fingerprints or hair?

491
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,700
No.

492
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,785
Lee Gwang-taek did it.

493
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,703
And Detective Goh hid the evidence.

494
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,580
But how do we prove it?

495
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:34,958
Shin Jun-ho.

496
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,502
How do you know Lee Gwang-taek?

497
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,506
I told you that I went to see him once.

498
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,967
He didn't seem like a good man.

499
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,386
I heard he went around with Detective Goh.

500
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,596
So he was probably with him
when they kidnapped Choi Jeong-ah.

501
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,806
He probably stuck the needle,

502
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,308
and Detective Goh
probably hid it in his car.

503
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,938
Probably.

504
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,611
Sir, I'll go have a talk
with Lee Gwang-taek.

505
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,571
You?

506
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,073
We aren't done investigating yet.

507
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,576
And don't you know
that our team hates you?

508
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,786
We must find Detective Goh quickly.

509
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,705
Is Lee Gwang-taek in the detention center?

510
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,381
Let's go.

511
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,678
What's up, Ro-ha?

512
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,101
What happened?

513
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,229
I came in last in the race again.

514
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,773
I wanted to come in first.

515
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,155
It's all right.

516
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,532
So what if you didn't come in first?

517
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,075
I know you did your best.

518
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,952
Then should I always be the last?

519
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,622
I want to win!

520
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,918
That's not what I meant.

521
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,677
I never said
you should always be the last.

522
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:18,436
Lee Jin-seong went to prison

523
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,688
in February of 2013
for vehicular manslaughter.

524
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,149
And a month later in March,

525
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,568
his wife, Goh Eun-jeong, went to see him.

526
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,947
So she was with her son,
Ro-ha, until then.

527
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,074
When was she admitted
to the mental hospital?

528
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,284
In November of 2014.

529
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,662
Did you check
the national health insurance bills?

530
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,163
She failed to pay for eight years.

531
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,249
Really?

532
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,836
I knew it.

533
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,173
Apparently, there are
26 hospitalized patients here

534
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,467
who haven't paid their bills.

535
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,887
We can't turn away patients
just because they don't have money.

536
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,140
You get about 70 million a month
from the government for that, don't you?

537
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,601
That can't even cover
the cost of running the hospital.

538
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,103
In 2013,

539
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,064
your monthly support
was nearly 200 million won.

540
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,024
I heard there were many cases of patients

541
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,319
being forcefully hospitalized
through brokers back then.

542
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,988
We've never done that.

543
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,948
Of course not.

544
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:16,327
We applied for a warrant
for your records going back a decade.

545
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,499
Hey.

546
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,459
Where did you bring Goh Eun-jeong from?

547
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,129
Yes, sir.

548
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,717
The ambulance company
that took Goh Eun-jeong disappeared.

549
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,261
They erased all records
before they were investigated.

550
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,471
Those bastards.

551
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,266
Hello.

552
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,600
-Hello.
-Hi.

553
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,478
Have you seen these people, by any chance?

554
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,732
I don't recognize them.

555
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,649
You?

556
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,738
Hello.

557
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,740
The food's here.

558
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,699
Hello.

559
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,451
-You must be hungry.
-Yes.

560
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,244
Please wait just a minute.

561
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,126
I'll give you plenty.

562
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,502
-I'd like a lot.
-Sure.

563
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,421
I'll give you plenty.

564
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,137
These are Ro-ha's shoes.

565
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,180
LEE RO-HA
FROM NOVEMBER 6, 2014

566
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,182
Ro-ha was wearing those when he came here.

567
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:23,227
They were so worn out
that I got him a new pair and kept those.

568
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,189
He must have been through so much.

569
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,357
How did he get here?

570
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,193
He lost his mom.

571
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,904
He lost his way in the mountains
looking for his mom

572
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,739
and came all the way here.

573
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,451
He doesn't remember
any of the hardship he went through.

574
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,036
But look at those shoes.

575
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,121
It's all there.

576
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,005
I can feel fear from the drawing.

577
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,342
I think it's a place
somewhere in his memories.

578
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,367
Ro-ha.

579
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,078
This is where you were?

580
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,668
-Try to make that straight.
-Hey.

581
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,503
Hold on tight.

582
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,882
I used to do this all the time
when I was a student.

583
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,675
You keep getting it crooked.

584
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,137
No.

585
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,055
To the left.

586
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,683
You shouldn't go left like this.
Go right like this…

587
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:27,977
Hey!

588
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,231
I told you to…

589
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,651
I'll do it.

590
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,323
Where did Detective Goh go,
leaving this to me?

591
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,785
Well…

592
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,330
I heard

593
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,707
that you're the best at drawing.

594
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,460
I'm not good at drawing.

595
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,465
Want to know a secret?

596
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,555
I'm actually…

597
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,475
a crybaby.

598
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,646
But you're a policeman.
How can a policeman be a crybaby?

599
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,147
Be quiet.

600
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,941
I told you, it's a secret.

601
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,109
But policemen are supposed to be brave.

602
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,027
You're right.

603
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,655
Policemen are supposed to be brave.

604
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,906
Do you know

605
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,575
what I did to be brave?

606
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,291
I held this tightly

607
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,001
and recited in my heart.

608
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,545
"I'm not a crybaby."

609
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,756
"I'm not a crybaby."

610
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,634
And guess what happened next?

611
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,428
What happened?

612
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,766
I really became brave.

613
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,979
That's a lie.

614
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,439
No, it's not. A policeman can't lie.

615
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,692
Look. This is a real policeman's medal.

616
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,734
HONOR AWARD
POLICE ACADEMY

617
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,486
You're right.

618
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,113
A real policeman's medal.

619
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,030
Right?

620
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,365
This is my treasure.

621
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,702
It's my gift to you.

622
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,708
Here. When you run tomorrow,
hold this tight.

623
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,167
And as you run,

624
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,963
recite in your heart
that you're going to come in first.

625
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,009
Then can I really come in first place?

626
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,803
Yes.

627
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,806
-Mr. Jung.
-Yes?

628
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,182
Where's Ms. Ahn?

629
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,600
She's over there.

630
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,519
She went to the office to get the flags.

631
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,478
-Okay.
-Okay.

632
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,774
Ms. Ahn, let me take that.

633
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,443
Show me Ro-ha's drawings.

634
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,944
-Okay.
-Thanks.

635
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,782
He definitely went to the mountains.

636
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,744
And he certainly saw trees.

637
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,621
You're sure he really saw this?

638
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,040
Yes.

639
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,585
He saw this next to the trees,
but he said he didn't know what it was.

640
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:02,298
I went to every mountain
in the country for over 15 years

641
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,716
looking for Hyeon-ji.

642
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,803
Every time I did,
I resented how the mountains

643
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,889
were so tall, steep, and thick with trees.

644
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,892
But it wasn't the mountains' fault.
It was because I was anxious.

645
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,436
I'm sure it was the same for Ro-ha.

646
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,025
That young boy must have been
so scared, lost in the woods.

647
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,236
I saw that in his drawings.

648
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,488
Yes.

649
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,447
But…

650
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,866
we missed one thing.

651
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:34,163
Those trees must have looked
ten times bigger to Ro-ha.

652
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,376
So if you want to draw all those trees,

653
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,878
one sheet of drawing paper
wouldn't be enough.

654
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,674
You mean all of these are…

655
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,600
This is what Ro-ha saw that day.

656
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,527
This was it.

657
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,490
There's nothing I can do
to change anything now.

658
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,159
But I still want to know

659
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,954
where Hyeon-ji went and what she saw.

660
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,998
I feel the same for Ro-ha.

661
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,586
Even though we failed
to protect the kids as adults,

662
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,465
I would still like to find out
what happened to them.

663
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,217
I could do that at least.

664
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,261
The kids here

665
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,306
are just like Hyeon-ji to me.

666
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,482
Is it already kimchi-making season?

667
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,817
Why are you making so much?

668
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,528
There are so many people in this village.

669
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,655
We need lots of food on the table

670
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,948
to satisfy all the ghosts.

671
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,324
You already made rice cakes.

672
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,453
And you prepared so much
glass noodles for japchae.

673
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,705
Il-yong, when will the cabbages be ready?

674
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,415
They're ready!

675
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,502
Anyway, it's all thanks to you
that the villagers all look so healthy.

676
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,754
I'm glad you know.
Add more red pepper powder.

677
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,840
Here you go.

678
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,050
-Put it there.
-Okay.

679
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,719
-Put the cabbages in here.
-Okay.

680
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,430
Again.

681
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,684
I didn't take you for a slacker.

682
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,060
But you are.

683
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,188
I didn't see you at the field earlier.

684
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,815
That was because of Ro-ha.

685
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,817
What about Ro-ha?

686
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,363
I assured him that he would finish first
in tomorrow's race.

687
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,908
But Ro-ha has always come in last.

688
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,784
You're bad at lying.

689
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,869
Why did you do that?

690
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,954
He wanted it so desperately

691
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,333
that I didn't want to hurt him.

692
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,544
Detective Goh.

693
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,754
You've finally grown up.

694
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,465
Don't worry.

695
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,842
I'll make Ro-ha's wish come true.

696
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,428
Tomorrow, he's going to come in first.

697
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,932
But how?

698
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,192
Stop putting that in.
It's going to be too spicy.

699
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,570
I remember you from the underpass.

700
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,364
Right.

701
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,950
We're actually looking for a kid

702
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,078
who stayed there
with his mom eight years ago.

703
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,456
But there's no one who remembers them.

704
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,043
I heard you've been
volunteering there for over ten years.

705
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,586
Volunteering?

706
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,923
Handing out leftover food
is nothing so grand.

707
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,883
Sir.

708
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,801
By any chance…

709
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,471
do you know these people?

710
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,560
-I know them.
-You do?

711
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,271
Wait.

712
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,154
Here.

713
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,283
He drew this for me.

714
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,829
It looks like you.

715
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,291
Your hair must have been black back then.

716
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,128
Years go by so fast.

717
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,844
I saw them for the first time
at that underpass.

718
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,681
The kid looked so hungry

719
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,101
that I brought them
to the restaurant and fed them.

720
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,735
Is it good?

721
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,777
Yes.

722
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,905
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

723
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:37,823
Here.

724
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,370
Oh, dear.

725
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,706
How did you hurt your hand?

726
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,001
While working at a construction site.

727
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,420
I'm not used to the work yet.

728
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,357
And about a month later…

729
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,401
She seemed to be doing worse

730
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,236
and was living
on the streets with her son.

731
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,113
The mother

732
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,449
cared so much for her son.

733
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:22,951
Eat up.

734
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,955
Thank you.

735
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,834
That afternoon, I saw them eat lunch.

736
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,336
But the next day,

737
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,796
I couldn't find them.

738
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,466
I heard that an ambulance
took her in the morning.

739
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,219
I asked them if her son went with her

740
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,887
and was told that the boy

741
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,724
ran after the ambulance, crying.

742
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,477
I haven't seen them since.

743
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,104
I was worried,

744
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,314
so I even went
to the springs in the mountains.

745
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,649
Wait a minute.

746
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,567
Do you mean…

747
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,027
Cheonjung Mountain?

748
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,531
Why did you go there?

749
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,366
His mom used to

750
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,993
take her son there for a walk.

751
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,794
Wait.

752
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,588
Here it is.

753
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,382
This is it.

754
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,468
-Is that it?
-This is it.

755
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,389
You really found the place
thanks to all your early morning hikes!

756
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,724
No, it wasn't me.

757
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,476
Ro-ha gave me a hint.

758
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,645
And I just realized what it meant.

759
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,315
Found it.

760
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:38,777
Look closely.

761
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:44,241
The signpost in Ro-ha's drawing
exists in 13 mountains in Korea.

762
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,161
Nine of them were installed
during the past seven years,

763
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,078
so take them out.

764
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,248
There are these four left.

765
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,958
The Daebong Mountain trail

766
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,961
was closed eight years ago
because of a mountain fire.

767
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,548
That one is on an island
that takes three hours by boat.

768
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,507
So that's also out.

769
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:05,137
Now among these two,
the most likely would be…

770
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,389
CHEONJUNG MOUNTAIN

771
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,307
…this one.

772
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,396
Cheonjung Mountain?

773
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,319
Hurry up.

774
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,029
Here it is. 1-1.

775
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,198
It's just like how it looked
in the drawing.

776
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,991
Come on. We have to hurry.

777
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,076
We're a long way away from 1-8.

778
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,411
Right. Let's hurry.

779
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,997
Get a move on, Wook.

780
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,956
Mr. Jang!

781
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,208
-What?
-Mr. Jang!

782
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,126
Isn't that Detective Baek?

783
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,211
Is that you, Mr. Jang?

784
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,546
Hey, Detective Baek!

785
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,173
What are you doing here so early?

786
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,257
Hello.

787
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,301
-Hello.
-Hi.

788
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,802
What do you think?

789
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,096
I'm here to find someone.

790
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,600
I asked a few questions
near the underpass yesterday,

791
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:55,062
took a brief nap at the local substation,
then came here to look around.

792
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,483
Wait.

793
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,571
If all three of you are here, then--

794
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,115
I coaxed them to come with me.

795
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,243
They're too weak for their age.

796
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,912
He woke me up at dawn to go hiking.

797
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,539
Such a hassle.

798
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,041
Who are you looking for anyway?

799
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,503
It's a boy who disappeared
eight years ago.

800
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,046
His father was in prison

801
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:24,132
but was released last week
and reported him missing.

802
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,886
Great!

803
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,429
I had something to report.

804
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,598
-Report?
-Yes.

805
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,142
Hanging around Mr. Jang,

806
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,520
I became interested in missing children.

807
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,398
I joined an online forum,
and I've been doing volunteer work.

808
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,483
I looked up and found out

809
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,361
that quite a lot of people die
from losing their footing.

810
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,405
Especially here in Cheonjung Mountain,

811
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:50,576
at the cliff near the 1-8 signpost.

812
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,411
Apparently, it's very dangerous.

813
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,163
Here. 1-8.

814
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,709
-Signpost 1-8?
-Yes.

815
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,668
Signpost 1-8.

816
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,964
That's pretty convincing.

817
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,507
Right?

818
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,342
Let's check it out together.

819
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,594
We're on our way there.

820
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,887
We're nearly there.

821
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,514
No, thanks.

822
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,767
The search dog and team are on their way,

823
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,352
so don't worry.

824
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,646
-Just go your way.
-Is that right?

825
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,231
Then we'll just be on our way.

826
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,733
Hey, Wook. Let's go.

827
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,859
Ms. Lee, come on.

828
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,527
Let's go.

829
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,653
But--

830
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,863
Let's go.

831
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,906
-We're already here.
-The detective is busy.

832
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,700
-Good luck.
-Will there be drones too?

833
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:32,659
-It's 1-8.
-Come on.

834
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,660
Come here.

835
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,870
Bye.

836
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,830
I heard that it's really dangerous there.

837
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,832
Okay. 1-8.

838
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,961
Looks like he saw something again.

839
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:49,551
The cliff near the 1-8 signpost…

840
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,184
Day 10,896.

841
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,271
Today is field day.

842
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,673
Don't you think it's too much
for a kids' field day?

843
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,675
I think

844
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,302
you and Mr. Jang are too dressed up.

845
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,721
I'm not dressed up.

846
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,764
I just look good in anything.

847
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,268
Hey, Detective Goh.

848
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,854
What's with you? You look tired.

849
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,190
I was nervous
and couldn't sleep well last night.

850
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,655
I don't have to worry
about the race today, do I?

851
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,241
I'm Kim Wook.

852
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,034
I can do this.

853
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,995
Did you all have breakfast?

854
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,330
Of course not.

855
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,624
You cooked so much
and I'm going to eat it all.

856
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,878
Let's eat until we die today.

857
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,130
Die again?

858
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,091
Come on.
You still haven't gotten used to it yet?

859
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,843
This is why you won't do.

860
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,345
Being so rigid won't help you.

861
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,347
I'm not rigid.

862
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,515
I was just joking.

863
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,684
Come on. The kids must be waiting.

864
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,769
Right. Welcome!

865
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,686
-Hi!
-Let's go!

866
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,896
Let's go.

867
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,189
Let's go!

868
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,273
Hurry up.

869
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,859
There's no need to search anywhere else.

870
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,445
There's a signpost that says 1-8.

871
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,155
We'll begin searching from there, got it?

872
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,156
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

873
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,073
Let's go.

874
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:18,867
Hey.

875
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,452
What's going on?

876
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,414
Remember Lee Ro-ha
who was reported missing a few days ago?

877
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,416
The one who was reported
by his dad after prison?

878
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,626
That's him.

879
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,628
We found a witness from eight years ago.

880
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,547
A kidnapping case?

881
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,258
No.

882
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,259
It's an accidental fall.

883
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,637
It's still an assumption,

884
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,014
but I've received credible information.

885
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,017
You monitor the drone footage,
Detective Shin.

886
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,104
We're searching the whole mountain
without sectioning it?

887
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:54,194
There's a cliff to the north
of the 1-8 signpost.

888
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,737
Exactly that spot.

889
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,073
Let's begin the search from there.

890
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,032
Let's go.

891
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,200
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

892
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:12,379
The Complex 3 field day will now begin!

893
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,520
That's it!

894
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,773
Put the rice cake in your mouth
and go that way.

895
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,108
To where she is standing.

896
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,485
Good job. Now, run!

897
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,653
Let's go.

898
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,367
Can I eat one more?

899
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,536
What? You can't.

900
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,996
Let's go.

901
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,414
You can't…

902
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,838
Show this stamp later,
and you'll receive your prize.

903
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,381
Thank you.

904
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,261
The prizes are awesome.

905
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,637
-Thank you.
-Sure.

906
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,139
There are so many of them.

907
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,100
How about a stamp for me?

908
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,479
A participation prize for Mr. Jang.

909
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,483
I don't know what the prize is,
but it's already making me happy.

910
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,195
Everyone will be getting a prize

911
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,698
so why did you make them practice so hard?

912
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,035
So our kids

913
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,245
can dream.

914
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,291
So they can have goals.

915
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,418
That's wonderful.

916
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,754
But it's also a bit sad.

917
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,299
Thank you, Mr. Jung.

918
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,554
For giving the kids a chance to dream.

919
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,699
You can do it! Go!

920
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,910
Hey, don't throw them at me!
Throw them up!

921
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,870
-Go, team blue!
-You can do it!

922
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:09,788
We can do this!

923
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,083
Go! Yes!

924
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,002
-You can do it!
-Go, team, go!

925
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,587
Go, team! Hey!

926
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,631
Oh, dear.

927
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,176
Ha-yun! Throw harder!

928
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,095
You're doing great.

929
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,700
Good job, Ha-yun!

930
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,951
Good job.

931
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,059
My goodness.

932
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,857
Why are you crying on such a good day?

933
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,735
It's because I'm so happy.

934
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,030
If they had been alive,

935
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,909
Yeong-rim and Ha-yun
would be 22 years old,

936
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,952
and Ro-ha would be 17.

937
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,414
What about you?

938
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,665
Me?

939
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,459
I don't know.

940
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,127
I don't even want to know.

941
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,546
Me too.

942
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,926
Sometimes…

943
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,970
time being stopped like this

944
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,015
isn't too bad.

945
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,475
Look at that.

946
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,435
The schoolyard

947
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,937
is full of blooming flowers.

948
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,565
Flowers of people.

949
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,735
What's the point?

950
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,198
All those beautiful flowers
have been cut and are here.

951
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,243
And what's wrong with here?

952
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,037
What do you think?

953
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,123
It's a village of ghosts.

954
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,210
Sometimes…

955
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:07,257
I think that this is heaven.

956
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:12,345
People say heaven
can't exist without kids.

957
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,723
Is that true?

958
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,393
Look at them.

959
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,603
All those kids…

960
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,315
What else can they be if not angels?

961
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,240
Where did you hear that nice saying?

962
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,286
I don't remember.

963
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,456
Mr. Jung.

964
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,880
Don't just tap lightly, poke deep!

965
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:47,881
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

966
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:51,342
Spread far on the inside
and search there too!

967
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,386
There's nothing over there.

968
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,305
Is that so? Look there.

969
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,432
That's the signpost right there.

970
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,267
Then we went too far.

971
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,604
Gather them closer here,
and tell them to stay close to the cliff.

972
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:03,980
Tell them to all come here.

973
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,775
Stay close to the cliff and go inside!

974
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,613
Kids, get in line.

975
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:19,996
Ro-ha.

976
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,665
Are you ready?

977
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,254
HONOR AWARD
POLICE ACADEMY

978
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:36,763
Yes.

979
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:43,978
Get ready.

980
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,950
-That's it, Ha-yun!
-Ro-ha!

981
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,076
You're doing great!

982
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,328
-Just a bit more.
-That's it!

983
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,247
-No!
-Just a bit more!

984
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,748
Ro-ha!

985
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,003
But Ro-ha,

986
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:13,633
why do you want to come in first?

987
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,554
So that I can go to my mom.

988
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,806
Where's your mom?

989
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,685
I don't know. She left in an ambulance.

990
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:27,730
I couldn't run fast enough, so I lost her.

991
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,657
But Ro-ha, that…

992
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,160
That wasn't because you were slow.

993
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,168
It was because the ambulance was too fast.

994
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,631
So I'll only have to run
faster than a car.

995
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,593
Then I can run to wherever my mom is.

996
00:59:58,636 --> 00:59:59,470
Uncle Sang-cheol.

997
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,975
If I win first place,
I can run as fast as a car, right?

998
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,563
-That's it! Go, Ha-yun!
-Let's go!

999
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,856
Run, Ha-yun!

1000
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,278
Ro-ha!

1001
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,529
Ro-ha!

1002
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,989
Go faster!

1003
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,075
That's it! Good job!

1004
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,449
Wook!

1005
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,575
What did you do?

1006
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,785
Ro-ha is in first place.

1007
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,203
I told you not to worry.

1008
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,081
That's it, Ro-ha! You can do it!

1009
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,249
Yes! You're doing great, Ha-yun!

1010
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,417
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1011
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,335
-Ha-yun!
-Let's go!

1012
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,641
Detective Shin, Detective Oh!

1013
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,017
Come here!

1014
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,102
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1015
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,274
Mom!

1016
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,485
Mom!

1017
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,529
Mom!

1018
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,989
Mom…

1019
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,575
Mom…

1020
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,913
Mom…

1021
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:51,874
Mom!

1022
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,752
Mom…

1023
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,236
-You can do it!
-Ro-ha!

1024
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,571
Come on!

1025
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,449
Run!

1026
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,284
Ro-ha!

1027
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:28,536
Run, Ro-ha!

1028
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,329
-That's it!
-Run, Ro-ha!

1029
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,591
-That's it!
-Yes!

1030
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,051
They found Ro-ha.

1031
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,470
Thank you.

1032
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,058
Goodbye, Ro-ha.

1033
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,821
Bye, Ro-ha.

1034
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,698
Ro-ha…

1035
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,158
Goodbye.

1036
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,916
The lonely boy
who came here eight years ago,

1037
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,043
left today…

1038
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,923
as everyone clapped for him.

1039
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,824
You shouldn't drink banana milk!

1040
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,660
It's already been 15 years.

1041
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,537
They don't know who she is?

1042
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,248
So how are we going to find the one
who gave them banana milk?

1043
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,624
Someone broke into my home.

1044
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,128
He came back and did more bad things.

1045
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,881
Have you seen anyone
suspicious around here?

1046
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,048
What's this about?

1047
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,383
Who disappeared?

1048
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,467
Ha-yun.

1049
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:50,553
We have to search quickly.

1050
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,597
So that he can never get back out.

1051
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:54,348
Who's there?

1052
01:04:55,224 --> 01:05:00,229
