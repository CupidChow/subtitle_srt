Just because I,
by my lonesome, disappear,

176
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:55,674
do you think the world
will become a better place?

177
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,670
Yes.

178
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,206
I don't know about anywhere else but

179
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,100
here... it will for sure become better.

180
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,800
Sunbae, did the results of the forensics
on Jang Myeong Gyu's cellphone come out?

181
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,016
Not yet.

182
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,586
You weren't around for a
few days and now look at you.

183
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,456
Have you been searching for Yeo Na?

184
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,776
Did you find anything?

185
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,576
I searched surrounding motorcycle-bikers
near here but nothing was found.

186
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,236
Nothing to connect the two cases, either.

187
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,230
Team Leader has been hinting
that we should close the case, too.

188
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,880
Yes, this is Bok Min Ho at the
Criminal Investigations Department.

189
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,580
Yes, where is that?

190
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,526
Yes.

191
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,720
They discovered an
unidentified female corpse.

192
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,200
- Please text the address to me.
- Hey, Jun Ho!

193
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,200
Hey, Sin Jun Ho!

194
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,516
Just a moment!

195
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,620
Go ahead and confirm it.

196
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,810
It looks like she's been
dead for at least 6 months.

197
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,296
Yeo Na has been missing
for less than one month. So...

198
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,610
Thank you.

199
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,966
You came early.

200
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,016
You have to be diligent to find people.

201
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
I may look like nothing
much but among the police,

202
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:07,586
the homeless,
and the civil servants...

203
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,656
there isn't a place throughout the
country where I don't have an informant.

204
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,210
Any way, I am glad that it wasn't her.

205
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,836
She is probably alive. Let's believe that.

206
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,570
Yes.

207
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,661
[When you see this memo, please contact
Detective Sin Jun Ho (010-4001-690).

208
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:34,685
[From Choi Yeo Na]

209
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,806
Are you okay?

210
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,276
While they were collecting these, the kids

211
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,290
were captured by Woo Il Seok
and Joon Soo's mom got hurt, too.

212
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,836
I am sorry. It's because of me.

213
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,460
Why is that your fault?

214
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,910
I am actually thankful.

215
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,912
All those colorful lanterns...

216
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,106
dancing together
in the darkness,

217
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,295
flying away somewhere...

218
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,886
they looked like ourselves.

219
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,026
It was somewhat sad, but also beautiful.

220
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,016
What Woo Il Seok did, it's his fault.

221
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,600
One regretful thing is that

222
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:26,746
the light that you lit up can
not light up the other side.

223
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,023
So many flew.

224
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,756
There should be at
least one that landed.

225
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,876
Someone passing by might have picked it up,
too.

226
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,930
It's useless.

227
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,986
How do you know that?

228
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,860
What are you going to do if someone
makes a contact after seeing this?

229
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,482
I know that this place is special,
too.

230
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,086
Still,
do I just give up? I should do something.

231
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,986
You should at least have hope. Then,
there might be a miracle.

232
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,580
Do you think it's easy

233
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,110
for me not to have hope?

234
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,936
There is nothing useful.

235
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,816
What is your taste in fashion?

236
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,886
Taste in fashion, my foot!

237
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,250
After a good dinner, what the hell
are you doing messing with my clothes?

238
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,486
Well, then, since the choice is limited,
let's wear this.

239
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,156
This, this.

240
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,082
My mind is filled
with so many things.

241
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:32,156
What? Are you going
to a summer vacation?

242
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,106
I need to catch Woo Il Seok.

243
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,606
Wearing this?

244
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,820
Wearing this, too.

245
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,326
Ahjussi, can you act?

246
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,776
Of course I do. If I
weren't here like this,

247
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,546
I might have become a somebody.

248
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,606
People often told me that since I have
a lot of talent and I am good looking,

249
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,900
I should become an actor.

250
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,410
Do you think anyone can become an actor?

251
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,940
What do you mean by "anyone"?

252
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,066
Am I "anyone"?

253
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,640
And, what's wrong with me?

254
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,070
If you get upset like that, I...

255
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,730
How is my acting? Pretty good, right?

256
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,540
Ah, Ahjussi, you surprised me!

257
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,220
This is what you call acting.
Life Force Energy (Chi )

258
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,310
Turn the lights off.

259
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,216
Ah, geez, that surprised me.

260
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,530
Move them. They will get in
my way when I am sleeping.

261
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,940
You can wear these clothes tomorrow.

262
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,420
Hey, let me have the bamboo body pillow.

263
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,210
Here.

264
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,396
Can you really do it?

265
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,586
If not, I will do it...

266
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,316
and you can just help me.

267
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,566
You talk too much.

268
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,146
Use the time you spend worrying about
me to find Woo Il Seok's killer instead.

269
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,166
You know,
there is a huge difference between

270
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,166
what you imagine and
the actual field work.

271
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,226
Why do I have to keep repeating
myself? My mouth is hurting.

272
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,516
While living in Duon Village,
I've lied for over 10 years.

273
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,196
Acting like a ghost when I am
with the dead and pretending

274
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,446
not to see anything
when I am with the living...

275
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,516
You still don't know after seeing all that?

276
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,146
- I understand.
- You just do your part right.

277
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,426
Just a moment!

278
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,150
If you are setting up to be a
someone who became rich,

279
00:21:24,174 --> 00:21:25,127
there should be something showy,

280
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,356
but you don't have any of that.

281
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,427
Looking rich...

282
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:31,454
You don't even have
any gold accessories.

283
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,810
It's a prop so be careful with it.

284
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,156
Is it pure gold?

285
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,280
Ahhh, really!

286
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,866
You cheapskate!

287
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,300
This is an imitation, isn't it?

288
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,916
What brings you here?

289
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,776
Ah, it's just that...

290
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,756
I want to build a building in
front of that convenience store.

291
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,446
It will be about the size
of 30 one bedrooms.

292
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,496
I will install five to six
CCTVs at the entrance as well.

293
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,716
Nowadays,
the residents care most about safety.

294
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,786
So, what brings you here?

295
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,846
I am telling you now.

296
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,913
When I looked into it,

297
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:26,016
it looks like there are about 3 sex
offenders living in this neighborhood.

298
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,406
They are wearing electronic
ankle bracelets and we,

299
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:32,176
along with their probation officers, are
monitoring them so you don't need to worry.

300
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,476
How could I not worry?! According to the
news, they cut the bracelets and run away.

301
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,056
The monitoring officers are not even aware.

302
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,006
That kind of electronic ankle
bracelet accident rarely happens.

303
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,626
Really, it is a rare mishap.

304
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,306
See, that kind of mishap does occur.

305
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,336
We don't have such a mishap.

306
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,856
Don't just say it. Confirm it for me.

307
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,996
See if they are staying quiet.

308
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,876
Just confirm it for me.

309
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,600
- Go ahead and confirm it.
- Yes.

310
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,076
Sunbae, I think you need to look at this.

311
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,060
One of the electronic
ankle bracelets is turned off.

312
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:13,166
Call the probation officer.

313
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,396
Is anything wrong? Did someone escape?

314
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,196
No, there's nothing. We will resolve
the matter so it's okay for you to go.

315
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,076
Go where? I am not going.

316
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,000
I am not taking a single
step until you confirm it to me.

317
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,596
Then, I will put my trust in you and go.

318
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,356
So please catch the person
who ran away for sure.

319
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,000
Yes.

320
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,566
What?

321
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,896
It is my Hyeon Ji?

322
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,066
Yes, I will meet you there in 30 minutes.

323
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,270
Ah, I told you I would give you the money!

324
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,610
Why isn't he coming?

325
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,916
Are you here? Where
are you? I can't see you.

326
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,686
I got into an accident on my way there.

327
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,326
I am at the hospital.
I don't think I can go.

328
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,536
How badly are you hurt?

329
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,546
Then, at least let me know
where the store is so I can go there.

330
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,756
Ah, that's a little difficult.

331
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,106
Difficult? I am in a
more difficult situation.

332
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,886
I even got the money,
although it was difficult.

333
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,806
If, perhaps, you are kidding me,
using my Hyeon Ji...

334
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,156
How are you talking like that?

335
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:30,826
To the person who got into an
accident on my way to meet you?

336
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,540
I just texted you a photo, so check it.

337
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,096
Where is this place?

338
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,266
Doesn't it look exactly like the flier?

339
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,746
So, where is this?

340
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,658
I will send you the deposit now and then,

341
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:51,116
I will send you the remaining
balance when I get there.

342
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,900
Ok? Yeah,...

343
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,176
Make a right turn at the convenience store,

344
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,600
you go a few steps,
and you will see a house with a green door.

345
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,480
Who is this?

346
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,576
I'm Attorney Kim Wook Hyeon
from Tae Baek Law Firm Group.

347
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,336
I'm here to tell you something.

348
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,036
Why would a lawyer come
to our house? For what?

349
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,566
Because of what happened at your place,
not that long ago,

350
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,506
there's something I need to verify.

351
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,316
I have a nothing to say. Please leave.

352
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,640
Hello? Hello?

353
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,425
Oh, no...

354
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,224
I'm not even done with what I
want to say... What should I do?

355
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,576
CCTV Operating

356
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,816
Oh, yeah, Hyung, do you know a Kim
Wook Hyeon from Taebak Law Firm?

357
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,150
Yes, please.

358
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,030
I came here knowing everything.
Shall I report to the police?

359
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,820
Receipt for transfer ₩2,580,000

360
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,736
New message: YOU Convenience store
in Sueon-dong, Wuyeong-gu, Seoul City.

361
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,000
YOU Convenience store in Sueon-dong,
Wuyeong-gu, Seoul City.

362
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,616
What do you know that you came here?

363
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,340
On that day,

364
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,020
I know what the intruder did.

365
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,816
What do you mean by "what the invader did?"

366
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,676
You know better, Ms. Kim Hyeon Seo.

367
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,836
The police have been searching for the man.

368
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,590
Who is that man? I-I don't know anything.

369
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,086
His name is Woo Il Seok.

370
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,276
He disappeared from
this house for the last time.

371
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,700
The police believes that the
intruder escaped but that's not true.

372
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,076
As an attorney,
I advise you to turn yourself in.

373
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,296
If I report you or the
police find him first,

374
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,336
you'll be at a disadvantage.

375
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,926
What are you talking about? I
do not know anybody like that.

376
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,166
Of course, it was self-defense.

377
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,876
But, indeed, it was an excessive defense.

378
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,076
If you ever got arrested by the police,
it would be about 4-7 years in the prison,

379
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,780
except for negligently
abandoning the corpse.

380
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,930
You know what I mean
by the abandoned corpse,

381
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,390
don't you?

382
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,776
We don't have much time left.

383
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,176
Don't ruin your remaining life
because of someone like Woo Il Seok.

384
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,390
I came intentionally all the
way here to deliver this message.

385
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,700
Stay still, shhhhhhhhhhhhhh....

386
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,896
You know what'll happen if you
report to the police, don't you?

387
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,070
I will come back.

388
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,720
Honey, are you OK?

389
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,630
I'm sorry. Thank you. Work hard.

390
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,136
Well

391
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,876
Shall I scan to figure out the total?

392
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,656
When does the other part-time
employee come to work?

393
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,444
I am the only one
part-time worker here.

394
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,846
At night,
the owner comes to cover.

395
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,406
Is the owner female? How old is she?

396
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:08,366
The owner is a male.
About 50 years old. Why?

397
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,530
Well

398
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:16,070
Here, this is the person I am looking for,
the part-time worker?

399
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:21,656
Min Na Yeong? It is me. Look

400
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,626
Look.
Min Na Yeong

401
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,096
But, the face looks so different.
Is this photo-edited? synthesized?

402
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,324
The reason I am
looking for a person is...

403
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:32,016
that someone told me that
he saw her working here...

404
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,506
Don't you know it is illegal to synthesize
someone else's photo without consent?

405
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:41,346
Oh, I am so sorry. I apologize.
Because I felt it was so urgent...

406
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,530
I am not buying that.

407
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,642
The person you are
calling is not answering...

408
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,276
when you hear the Beep,
please leave a message.

409
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,076
Give me my money back.

410
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:00,580
You crook.

411
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,026
Why didn't you tell me
before you went there?

412
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,440
You said, you had his contact?

413
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,616
Yeah... but he is not answering.
Not checking the texts.

414
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,730
Give me his phone number,
bank, bank account number

415
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,690
I am too embarrassed to face you,
Detective Baek

416
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:36,940
It's not the first time to be conned
like this to find a missing person.

417
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,730
I really thought this was true!

418
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:48,140
I would do the same if I were you,
Mr. Jang. Let's catch him first.

419
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,440
It seems like you have
something you are worried about.

420
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,616
Ou said you were the head of this village,
right?

421
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,547
You said you were
the president of the

422
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:13,716
Homeowner's Association of this village,
right?

423
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,700
How long has

424
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,970
Jun Su's Mom been here?
Did she come by accident?

425
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:30,206
We neither ask each other nor
do we mention the inside story.

426
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,696
Because it must have been something
tragic and tortuous to come as far as here.

427
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,430
If you are really curious,
go and ask her directly.

428
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,500
I didn't even ask the
guy studying for the exam

429
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:44,736
last time even though he
was mumbling to himself.

430
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,300
He was a wierdo.

431
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:53,000
Why do you not like Jun Su's mom so much?

432
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,420
Family Relationship Registry

433
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,746
Where have you been?

434
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,306
Oh, I went to meet someone...

435
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,330
What do the police say?

436
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,220
How did you know I had met the police?

437
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,696
Oh, yeah... I met the
police at the police station.

438
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,356
In the beginning, the policemen were
boasting that nothing would have gone wrong

439
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,713
Yet, when the policeman next to me checked,
he found out that

440
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:31,056
one of the electronic anklet
wearing criminals was missing..

441
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,266
Only then was a fire lit
in their pants to find him,

442
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,946
calling here & there,
to find out what was going on.

443
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,706
Then, what happened next?

444
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,266
So,
I told them they should locate him quickly.

445
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,000
I have been chasing around all day so

446
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,350
I feel like dying. Turn off the light.

447
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,120
Well, am I a remote control?

448
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:07,406
Turn off the light, turn on the TV
off and on. Where is the necklace?

449
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,167
Necklace?

450
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:10,496
Oh, well, first, I...

451
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,236
Did you lose it? Do you know how
expensive it is? It was pure gold.

452
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,146
I know it was a pure gold. I will
not bilk you. I will pay you back.

453
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,226
I put it in a very safe place.

454
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,640
Just turn the light off

455
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,170
There is no road even...
Where is the bed & breakfast?

456
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,946
That punk used a fake
number & burner phone.

457
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,217
I have been fine so far... but,

458
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:05,296
I lost my reason when I
heard it was about Hyeon Ji.

459
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,266
Ok, I will look into this more.

460
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,966
Ok, I will look into this more.
Such as CCTV, or anything else.

461
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,957
Thank you.

462
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:12,046
Hello?

463
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,736
Someone must be here. Ok,
hang off the phone

464
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,210
Is there anybody here? Is thee no one?

465
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,540
Hello!

466
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,036
Are you a god of the
mountain? Living here all alone?

467
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,556
So what if I live here, because I want
to live here, who are you criticizing?

468
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,470
Oh,
so loud... I cannot sleep because of noise

469
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,376
Are you dead?

470
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,056
What? What do you mean am I dead?

471
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,956
Why are you doing this? As
if you saw a ghost? Wake Up!

472
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,756
You are not dead, but alive? Right?

473
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,060
Stop speaking nonsense but, wake up!

474
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,590
Wow., this place is sooooooooo beautiful.

475
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,156
It seems like that old man must
be the owner of this mountain.

476
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,836
That's why there is only one house
in this large spacious mountain.

477
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,130
Isn't it?

478
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,560
Why are you looking like that
ever since you met me? why?

479
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,536
Ouch... It hurts.

480
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,086
Are you sure you did not die, right?

481
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,406
Are you crazy? If I were dead,
how could I come here?

482
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,896
Why are you visiting all
of sudden to confuse me?

483
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,146
Why? Because you have
not answered my phone calls.

484
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,645
I found a common factor among those
three dead people Oppa Nam Gook,

485
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:40,786
Jang Myeong Gyu and Choi Yeo Na.

486
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,406
- Other than Blue Sunshine Orphanage?
- Yeah.

487
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,036
All three of them do not have
real biological parent records.

488
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,886
Nam Book's birth certificate
was registered by the orphanage.

489
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,586
Then who the heck did it?

490
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,406
Oppa Nam Gook was registerd
by a director of the orphanage,

491
00:35:55,431 --> 00:35:57,536
Choi Yeo Na by,
a nun of the Catholic church,

492
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,366
and Jang Myeong Gyu,
was found in a church baby box, by a pastor

493
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,000
who recorded his birth in the registry.

494
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,050
Is not knowing your real
parents a reason to be murdered?

495
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,606
- Ms. Jo Myeong Soon?
- Yes?

496
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:21,626
You heard from our employee? I'm
Choi Seung Construction's Han Yeo Hui..

497
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,726
Please come on in

498
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,646
Why don't you go to the car? Stay there.

499
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,491
Han Yeo Hui,
President of the Choi Seung Construction,.

500
00:36:28,515 --> 00:36:30,995
Established the North and South
Peace Communication Foundation.

501
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,636
Did the forensics report for Jang
Myyeong Gyu's cell phone come out?

502
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,180
Here's the report.

503
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,176
He has searched Choi Seung
Construction many times.

504
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,586
He also wrote a news article
about Choi Seung Construction.

505
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,706
Right, didn't you hear from your mother?

506
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,746
He went to visit your
mother about 6 months ago.

507
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,946
He asked her who left him at the orphanage.

508
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,640
So?

509
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,006
I am searching for my
blood related grandchild.

510
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:03,986
About 30 years ago,
s/he was sent to the orphanage.

511
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,006
I am looking for a grandchild now,
after so long... this late.

512
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,326
Was s/he at our orphanage?

513
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,896
I don't even know.

514
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,016
I thought my daughter had a miscarriage,

515
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,106
but I've recently found
that among her belongings,

516
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,786
there is a clue she
gave a birth to her baby.

517
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,646
Why don't you ask your daughter directly?

518
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,970
She died.

519
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,986
It has been already 27 years since then...

520
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,076
I see.

521
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,305
So, I am looking for the
orphanages near the convent

522
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:41,000
where she was staying
while she was pregnant,

523
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,166
Nowadays, many people have been
looking for me because of that orphanage.

524
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,346
What do you mean?

525
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:53,566
There were accidents to the
kids who were at that orphanage.

526
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,646
Accident?

527
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:00,410
There were auto accidents
and they lost their lives.

528
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,916
Why did you call me?

529
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,496
Where did you visit with the
President? Why only with you?

530
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,036
What are you going to do,
after knowing where?

531
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,711
All of sudden, she has been looking
for a grandchild and she makes a

532
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,336
trip outside without letting her
secretary know where she's about...

533
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,176
So, I worry about it...

534
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:36,500
Is the president sick?
Perhaps dementia or cancer?

535
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,860
Ask her directly at tomorrow's
event if you are that curious.

536
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,700
Jong Ah is leaving.

537
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,776
Good bye....

538
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,566
If you came all the way down here, you
need to leave after eating a meal. Sit down

539
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,786
Meal?

540
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,366
What do you mean,
eating a meal? Let's go. We need to leave.

541
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,016
He may ask you to pay for
the meal since he is greedy!

542
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,206
Stop! At least,
send her away after feeding her.

543
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:15,620
You sit here, too. Sit!

544
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,270
I told you she ate well. Better than I do.

545
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,180
Go get the lettuce from
the yard instead of fighting

546
00:39:36,204 --> 00:39:38,646
over those veggies like a cheapskate,
you man.

547
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,486
What's being a man have
to do with eating lettuce?

548
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,226
You don't have any
gender sensitivity at all.

549
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,660
What does he say?

550
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,016
- Does Wook know as well?
- About what?

551
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,816
Did you get conned by that
man who you met last time?

552
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,046
What are you talking about being conned?

553
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,166
I overheard all about your
phone conversation a while ago.

554
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,920
Whenever you hear about Hyeon Ji,
you lose your mind and get conned.

555
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,576
Anyway, who is Hyeon Ji?

556
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,416
Eat, eat. So good to see you eat well.

557
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,690
Wow... You always give me hard time
for eating too much, but, look at you,

558
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,906
treating her so differently,

559
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,886
even giving her lettuce.

560
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,448
I didn't see you that way but...

561
00:40:23,473 --> 00:40:25,454
you discriminate a lot.

562
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,506
I've gathered smart kids without
any criminal record to search for him.

563
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,086
Then why is there no news yet?

564
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,836
I'm sorry for that.

565
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,820
Shove that word "sorry" up your ass!

566
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,300
If that bastard doesn't die,
you know, I'm going to kill you.

567
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,940
Do you understand what I'm saying?

[The Truly Good Pawn Shop]

569
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,476
This is my name card. Please
give me a call and come to my office.

570
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,826
I'll catch those jerks who conned you.

571
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,186
In what methods can you, Miss?

572
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,030
I'm an expert to find something.

573
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,436
- Oh, that scared me.
- You should've just come in.

574
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,360
Come in, please.

575
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,136
Are you running this place by yourself,
Miss?

576
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,966
It hasn't been too long.

577
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,016
Originally, it was Oppa Nam Gook's shop,

578
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,986
but I think I have some
knack of running a business.

579
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,416
It's more interesting
than I expected.

580
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,790
Ajussi, I have something to show you.

581
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,636
That punk...

582
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,716
That's right,
this is that punk! How did you find him?

583
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,454
Just in case,
I took a photo of him with my cell phone,

584
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,026
when you met this man last time.

585
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,156
As I ran a search through
ex-convict data base,

586
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,106
he's three-time convicted for fraud.

587
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,876
So he approached me to
con me from the beginning.

588
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,746
His name is Ha Chang Soo? Then,
can you find his phone number or something?

589
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,476
I can even find where he is right now.

590
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,100
Where is he?

591
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,780
Number three?

592
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,800
Where are you now, Number Three?

593
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,997
What the heck?

594
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:32,436
Are you here again, not studying?

595
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,796
And you quit your part-time
job after just one week?

596
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,236
When are you going to get it together?

597
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,026
What the hell?

598
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,026
Why are you beating me? Who
do you think you are, Ajussi?

599
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,476
Aju...? You brat,
how dare you, to your father?

600
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,806
Look at how you talk to your father!

601
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,786
Anyone, please call the police, huh?

602
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,130
This man is not my dad.

603
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:55,106
Oppa! Don't you think you're too harsh?

604
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,568
You've made Dad worry
about you all the time,

605
00:42:56,592 --> 00:42:57,926
and now are you
going to call the police?

606
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,226
And saying he's not your dad?

607
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,199
What are you looking
at? Is this your first time

608
00:43:03,224 --> 00:43:04,836
watching somebody
else's family argument?

609
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,676
Dad, let's get out of here.

610
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,516
You punk...

611
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,616
You're embarrassing me to death, come on!

612
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,330
Let go, let go!

613
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,056
Ah, seriously, let go!

614
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,823
You crooked bastard!
Didn't you say you're on your

615
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,476
way to the hospital
because of a car accident?

616
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,676
Is this a hospital?

617
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,236
Why are you beating me? I'm
going to get a medical certificate.

618
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,246
I'm going to put you in jail, Ajussi!

619
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,840
You gotta be kidding me.

620
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,506
Oh, hey, here!

621
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,876
This man suddenly
showed up and beat me up...

622
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,906
You sh♪t!

623
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,556
You should've been beaten by me,
you bastard.

624
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:49,176
Come here. For such a punk like you,
it's a waste to abuse police authority.

625
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,746
Mr. Jang, come with us, as I need to
get your statement about the victim. Come!

626
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,776
Yes, what nice timing!

627
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,556
- Ajussi, hurry up and follow him.
- Okay.

628
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,706
I owe you one, I'll definitely pay it back.

629
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,230
- Yes, please pay it back later.
- Yup.

630
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:10,836
Why didn't you have your meal yet?

631
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,676
By the way, how did you know
that punk was at the internet cafe?

632
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,116
That young lady told me.

633
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,446
- Who is that young lady?
- She is my guest's...

634
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,776
Never mind,
it's too complicated to explain.

635
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,870
Anyway, she's not an ordinary girl,
she's very smart.

636
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,596
Here it is.

637
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,606
What is that?

638
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,316
The money you gave him.

639
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,388
As I told him that I could help him
get the punishment extenuated,

640
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:32,117
he confessed everything.

641
00:44:32,141 --> 00:44:34,576
He even said he would pay interest as well,
but I stopped him.

642
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,426
Thank you. Thanks to you,
Detective Baek, I'm now relieved.

643
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,570
Next time, when something like this
happens again, please contact me first.

644
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,910
I really want to find Hyeon Ji too.

645
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,910
Alright.

646
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,786
Hello?

647
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,970
Ajussi, it worked.

648
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:02,056
When I was waiting in front of their house,

649
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,986
I saw that woman coming out of the house.

650
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,330
Just in case, I followed them and
confirmed they went to the police station.

651
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,106
Do you think they went
there to turn themselves in?

652
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,176
That's very likely what happened,
don't you think?

653
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,486
Because of such an insect-like bastard,
those poor people will get punished.

654
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,816
Although their punishment would
get extenuated to some extent,

655
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,316
abandonment of a corpse is another problem,
so I guess so.

656
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,195
Once they find Woo Il Seok's body,

657
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,926
we will be able to sleep
well starting from tonight.

658
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,640
You've been sleeping well so far anyway.

659
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,770
Here it is!

660
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,996
So, he's gone.

661
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:24,500
Even after committing such a heinous crime,
he's gone so easily like this.

Oh, all correct.

- Good bye.
- Bye.

This year, I'm not in that mood at all,
but I guess we should still do it.

Of course,
the kids are looking forward to it so much.

Honey, you should join us too.

673
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,416
If you have any good ideas, tell us.

674
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,780
What is this about?

00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,346
In a few days,
we will have "The Memory Day".

It's the day when the town's
people will remember each other.

678
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,726
It's a party, party.

679
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:23,246
All of us will gather, take pretty pictures
of us and enjoy delicious food too.

680

And giving some blessing
words to each other.

What should we prepare?
Is there some sort of event?

683
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,020
Event?

684
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,566
So far,
I was the one who has prepared food.

685
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,276
And for any matters involving labour,
Mr. Jang and I have taken care of them.

686
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,826
Unni and Brother-in-law,
you guys are too old-fashioned.

687
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,916
So tacky.

688
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,616
Anyway, this year's chairwoman
for the preparation committee is me.

689
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,960
What shall we do this year?

690
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:56,116
It would be nice if
there is some cool event.

691
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,656
So that it can become the
memorable Memory Day

692
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,210
all of us would remember for a long time.

693
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,726
Detective Sin. Hey.

694
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,370
Detective Sin.

695
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,960
I dozed off a bit.

696
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,766
Go home and get a good sleep,
so that your body can keep up.

697
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,610
Otherwise, you will get knocked down first.

698
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,940
What are all these?

699
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,096
These are the last articles Jang Myeong
Gyoo had searched before he died.

700
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,616
When he had searched this stuff,

701
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,340
he also had called Kim Nam Gook and Yeo Na.

702
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,456
Have you eaten any?

703
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,456
No, I don't have any appetite.

704
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,680
I'm going home.

00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:03,570
Did you come all the
way here just to say that?

717

If you don't have anything else to say, go.

Excuse me.

You ask all sorts of questions.

722

I came here when you were this big.

when you come and go and meet my Jun Su.

728

They were reluctant and checked it
out. They couldn't really contact him.

729

The policemen's faces turned white.

730

Only then did their pants get
on fire and they phoned all over.

I would have scolded them.

Except for having to follow him for
a few days, I didn't have a hard time.

Why wasn't it hard? How
hard it is to follow someone.

744

I mean, in that case.

745
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,900
One day I slightly bumped
into the man I was following.

a chill ran down my spine.

- Yes.

way his eyes look.

in the morning so I went back that day.

Hey,
Choi Seung Construction Chairman Han

785
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:16,926
pledged all her real
estate and money to charity.

786
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,406
The rumor is she is giving the
shares of the company to a grandchild.

787
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:24,196
The pledge of assets came out in
the news. Does she have a grandchild?

788
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,516
Chairman Han has a grandchild? I know she
doesn't have any immediate family members.

789
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:31,946
So I guess that's why the staff have
been muffled on the Choi Seung end.

790
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:34,476
Are you going somewhere?

791
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,323

Chairman Han directly.

792

Maybe I can see her there.

795
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:44,703
You'll see her when you go there
but if they refuse to talk to you,

796
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:46,376
she is the only
person you can ask.

797
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,176

news when you come here.

I'm sorry.

806
00:58:58,663 --> 00:59:00,964
I spoke to the
public relations team.

807
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,900
- This event is closed to the public.
- Is the news about your will true?

investigated that case are gone.

- Are you here to leave something?

What's the point of all this?

820

Nobody outside knows
that we're doing this.

we can find Choi Yeo Na as well.

She is still here.

825
