1
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:40,083
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,665
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,632
Detective Shin?

4
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,639
What brings you here?

5
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,920
Welcome.

6
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,882
This is Su-yeon's diary.

7
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,972
I found it recently while cleaning.

8
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,180
It made me think a lot.

9
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,980
It helped me see
what was going through her mind.

10
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,730
I'm embarrassed to admit this,

11
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,567
but for the first time in my life,
I finally understand how she felt.

12
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,620
Su-yeon is no longer around
to listen to me,

13
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,697
but I hope this helps you.

14
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:03,997
You can take it.

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,130
Are you asking us
to find your grandchild with this?

16
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:16,683
How many were murdered or went missing
after my will was disclosed?

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,807
Three.

18
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,150
Those things happened to them
because of me.

19
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,989
If I insist on finding my grandchild,

20
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,952
the tragedy won't just stop here, right?

21
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:47,077
All I'm asking is that
you redress this wrong.

22
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,874
Detective Shin, let's talk.
Detective Shin!

23
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,983
{\an8}We've got an arrest warrant
for Hwang Du-cheol.

24
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,275
{\an8}Are you alone, Detective Shin?

25
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,862
{\an8}Yes.

26
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,156
{\an8}We're going to send his case
to the Crimes Division.

27
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,754
{\an8}His statement isn't reliable at all.

28
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,119
{\an8}I'll talk to him.

29
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,291
{\an8}Okay.

30
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,758
{\an8}I thought we had
a solid witness this time.

31
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,717
How did you know

32
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,522
I proposed to Yeo-na

33
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,249
and about the framed painting in her
apartment that I bought for her?

34
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,613
Gosh, how many times do I have to say it?
Yeo-na told me!

35
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,031
It's true! In Duon Village!

36
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,533
- What the hell is that village?
- It's where the dead live.

37
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,906
Plus, only those who went missing!

38
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:51,748
Yeo-na isn't dead!
You said that you saw her yourself!

39
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,287
That she told you to call me!

40
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,257
I'm telling you the truth!

41
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,718
You may not be able to see her,
but I saw her.

42
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,050
The people there know
they're invisible to the living.

43
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,058
That's why she asked me

44
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,850
to bring you there.

45
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,283
There are many other people there
besides Choi Yeo-na.

46
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,820
Thomas.

47
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,954
Thomas is Korean. Park Yeong-ho.

48
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,912
He used to be a cop when he was alive.

49
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:37,093
Anyway, I saw over dozens
of people in that village.

50
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,125
<i>People who are dead,
but whose bodies haven't yet been found.</i>

51
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,512
I can see them.

52
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,892
Yeo-na is here too.

53
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,312
That's impossible.
How can such a place exist?

54
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,477
You jerk, you're a scammer.

55
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,494
You're pretending to be crazy, right?

56
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,660
You're trying to get a reduced sentence
by putting on a show, right?

57
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,909
Yeo-na isn't dead, is she?

58
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:13,213
- Tell me she isn't dead, you bastard!
- I swear I'm telling the truth!

59
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,337
SHIN JUN-HO AND CHOI YEO-NA'S
WEDDING DAY

60
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,060
It's all over…

61
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,325
I'd like to speak with you.

62
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,890
Wook is very worried about you.

63
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,179
Did you know

64
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,433
about Wook?

65
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,063
Right.

66
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,403
You know everything.

67
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,527
That's not true.

68
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,071
There are so many things
I don't understand about this place.

69
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
In particular,

70
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,949
the living who can see us.

71
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,708
The first guy was Hwang Du-cheol.

72
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,173
Then ten years ago,

73
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,545
another living man
who could see us showed up.

74
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,303
That man stayed here,

75
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:35,555
shared our pain,
and tried to solve unsolved cases.

76
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,976
He still does, to this day.

77
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,479
Who is he?

78
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,565
Mr. Jang.

79
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,817
Mr. Jang is also alive?

80
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,574
That's right.

81
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,494
And then, Kim Wook came.

82
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,196
And now Wook is helping us too.

83
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,171
He found the culprit who killed Ha-neul

84
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,129
and he made Woo Il-seok disappear.

85
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,208
Not long ago, on Memory Day,

86
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,594
it was Wook who brought your fiancé here.

87
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,891
<i>We don't have time!
Someone's life is at stake!</i>

88
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,432
<i>It's been more than ten days.</i>

89
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,056
Do you believe she's still alive?

90
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,329
That's why I'm willing to do
anything I can to find her.

91
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:08,523
<i>Don't waste your time on an innocent guy.
Go and catch bad guys out there instead.</i>

92
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,278
For example, the guys who abducted me.
Once you catch them…

93
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,357
<i>Are you sure you saw Yeo-na?</i>

94
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,947
Answer me, you jerk!

95
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,832
Why didn't you tell me
when I asked you before?

96
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,365
I'll get it done.
I'm going to catch him no matter what.

97
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,962
And I'll find her too.

98
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,919
Yeo-na.

99
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,052
Choi Yeo-na!

100
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,546
Choi Yeo-na!

101
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,770
I'm here.

102
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,953
WEDDING

103
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,712
Jun-ho.

104
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,988
It's our wedding day,

105
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,608
but there's no bride.

106
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,329
I'm right here.

107
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:32,496
<i>"I don't need anything else.
I only need you to come to me."</i>

108
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,802
That's what Bernard Buffet said.
Isn't it romantic?

109
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,472
I'd be really touched
if I heard something like that.

110
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:50,103
Buffet? Is it a restaurant?
That's really cheesy.

111
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:55,766
- Gosh, I got goosebumps.
- You know nothing about women.

112
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,608
I know everything.

113
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,664
I know what you want
just by looking into your eyes.

114
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,449
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

115
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,913
Then tell me. What does my face say?

116
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,285
Do I need to show you?

117
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,632
- Forget it. Go away.
- Come on.

118
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,589
Come back. Where are you going?

119
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,709
Come here!
Why do you keep trying to get away?

120
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,223
Just stay right here in my arms.

121
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,889
I'll make you happy
for the rest of your life.

122
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,726
- Really?
- Of course.

123
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,663
How does the wife
of a commissioner-general sound?

124
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,067
- Pretty great, right? In ten years.
- Sounds good.

125
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,778
Promise me.

126
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,359
You want me to make a promise?
Is this really necessary?

127
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,908
Should we get down to business now?

128
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,624
What's wrong?

129
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,636
SHIN JUN-HO, CHOI YEO-NA

130
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,597
So we got

131
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,982
our wedding invitations.

132
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,613
I promised to make you happy
and protect you

133
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,610
for the rest of your life…

134
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,325
But I couldn't even be there for you.

135
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:31,995
At least…

136
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,537
You're beside me now.

137
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,417
I'm sorry for pretending to be busy.

138
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,386
You did all the wedding planning
by yourself.

139
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,060
No, I should apologize to you.

140
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,733
I'm sorry for canceling
the bridal shop appointment

141
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,770
and changing my pass code.

142
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,320
I didn't do it because I was mad.

143
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,195
I was just throwing a tantrum.

144
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,786
Everyone keeps

145
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,125
telling me

146
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,753
that you

147
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,088
are dead.

148
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,884
But…

149
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,470
Even if everyone tells me that,

150
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,522
I shouldn't believe them.

151
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,691
I'm the only one you have.

152
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,526
If I give up…

153
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,118
No one else will look for you.

154
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,286
But if you're really dead,

155
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,213
why should I keep living?

156
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,542
I can't live without you.

157
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,591
No, Jun-ho.

158
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,255
Please don't say that.

159
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,515
Jun-ho.

160
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I was…

161
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,361
Really happy

162
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,120
when I was with you.

163
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,830
I mean it.

164
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,915
Please bring her back.

165
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,421
I'll do…

166
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,588
I'll do anything you ask.

167
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,312
Please…

168
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,219
Please bring Yeo-na back.

169
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,685
Please…

170
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,565
I'm begging you. Please!

171
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:10,821
There are so many bad guys out there!
Why did it have to be Yeo-na?

172
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,664
You should have taken me instead!

173
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,624
Please bring Yeo-na back…

174
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,210
Please…

175
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,496
Please bring her back.

176
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,140
Please bring Yeo-na back…

177
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,042
Jun-ho.

178
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,792
I can't stand

179
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,919
to see you miserable.

180
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,676
I promise I'm going to find you.

181
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,021
I'm going to find you…

182
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,935
No matter what.

183
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,908
Please hang in there.

184
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,448
Okay?

185
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,411
Okay.

186
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,425
{\an8}MISSING: JANG HYEON-JI

187
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,850
What's all this?

188
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,640
Everything I've collected
for the past decade.

189
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,394
You're really old school.

190
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,960
PARK SEONG-EUN, 18 YEARS OLD
DIED JANUARY 2020

191
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,404
Are all these people living
in that village?

192
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,992
Park Yeong-ho.

193
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,323
Kim Hyeon-mi.

194
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,778
Kim Hyeon-mi?

195
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,832
Yes, it's Wook's mom.

196
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,080
How did she end up there?

197
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,631
Does she know Wook is her son?

198
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,671
At first, she didn't, but now she knows.

199
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,755
How are your wounds?

200
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,553
They're fine.

201
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,769
Do you have a girlfriend?

202
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,729
No.

203
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,939
I'm popular,

204
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,234
but I don't have time to date anyone.

205
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,398
Of course.

206
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,486
I understand.

207
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,739
Where do you live?

208
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,035
Sang won-dong.

209
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,369
Jang-mi told me that

210
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,206
it's pretty much impossible

211
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,631
to buy a house even if you
work your entire life.

212
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,460
Yes, it's not easy.

213
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,298
I'm glad.

214
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,553
I was worried about you

215
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,810
being here.

216
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,943
I'm really glad

217
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,601
that you're alive.

218
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,065
Mr. Jang told me not to tell anyone

219
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,446
because it might confuse people here.

220
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,618
You came here 27 years ago?

221
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,287
It was that day

222
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,711
when you wrote me a letter
and left, right?

223
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,461
The day Aunt Su-yeon died,

224
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,968
there was a guy standing over her.

225
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,135
I saw him.

226
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,718
That's why I was so scared.

227
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,229
I thought, "What if you saw something
you shouldn't have?"

228
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,073
"What if the police come?"

229
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,692
"What if something happens to you?"

230
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,567
By the way, how did you end up here?

231
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,040
Was it

232
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,949
the same guy?

233
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,247
I don't know.

234
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,293
I didn't see anything.

235
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,510
Plus, it was 27 years ago.

236
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:45,550
I'm just happy that you grew up
to be such a fine man.

237
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,807
I mean it.

238
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,189
Where are you going?

239
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,108
And what's all this?

240
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,651
Documents for the case
that I was working on.

241
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,238
We're going to have a meeting
about this at Café Hawaii.

242
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,451
Why now all of a sudden?

243
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:12,124
Mr. Jang and your son
keep asking for some advice.

244
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,129
I thought it'd be buried for good,
but the time has come.

245
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,628
You said you ended up here
because of this.

246
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,483
Why are you dredging up
such a dangerous case?

247
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,547
We must find the truth.

248
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,220
The crime needs to come to light

249
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,812
so that the people who were wronged
can clear their names.

250
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,520
Don't you feel that you were wronged?

251
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,018
I'm more concerned

252
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,483
that someone might get hurt.

253
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,074
I know what you're saying.

254
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,152
I don't want that either.

255
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,788
When Chairwoman Han's daughter
was murdered 27 years ago,

256
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,660
there was a man standing over her.
I saw him.

257
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,828
- There was a man?
- Yes, a man in a suit.

258
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,668
I was told no one was there. I knew it.

259
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,588
I suspected that
someone could've murdered her.

260
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,264
Does anyone come to mind?

261
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:11,103
I died trying to figure that out.
Your mom also died around that time.

262
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,979
Kim Su-yeon. Mom. Detective Park.

263
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,442
All of your deaths are connected.

264
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,022
What did Su-yeon use to do?

265
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,858
During their redevelopment project,
Choiseung Construction

266
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,074
often came into conflict
with the residents.

267
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:30,534
But Chairwoman Han's daughter
protested together with the residents.

268
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,407
So she was against her mom's business.

269
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,294
In the end, she ran away
and went to live with her boyfriend.

270
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,962
Then she became pregnant,
but she got into a car accident.

271
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:42,211
It caused her to have a miscarriage
and she became disabled.

272
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,420
I don't think she had a miscarriage.

273
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,878
What? Why do you think that?

274
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,758
Chairwoman Han wrote a will saying that

275
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,346
she would give her shares
to her grandchild.

276
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:57,521
Then some guy killed three innocent people
while looking for that grandchild.

277
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,400
That's how Yeo-na ended up here.

278
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:05,151
After all these years, someone is trying
to look for her grandchild and kill them?

279
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,945
Do you know who it might be?

280
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,164
I was investigating three people.

281
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,489
Han Sang-gil, Yoo Seong-ho,
and Lee Dong-min.

282
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,405
But it wasn't for Kim Su-yeon's death.

283
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,704
HAN SANG-GIL
YOO SEONG-HO

284
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,367
Who are these people?

285
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,955
The people closest to Chairwoman Han.

286
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:24,131
That means one of those three men
is going around and killing people

287
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,672
just to find a child

288
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,973
who may or may not exist.

289
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,050
Then

290
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,393
where is the grandchild?

291
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,606
Thomas, why did you want to see me?
We could've just talked down there.

292
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,107
I didn't call you.

293
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,359
She did.

294
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,406
What? Jun-su's mom?

295
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,068
Have a nice talk.
I need to get some work done downstairs.

296
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,656
Why does she want to talk up here?

297
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,373
Jun-su's mom, is that you?
Detective Park just left.

298
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:06,205
I know. I came here because I didn't want
to run into him downstairs.

299
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,416
- Did you two fight again?
- No, this isn't about him.

300
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,465
Then who? Wook?

301
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:18,517
I'm sure you already know,
but I wasn't the best mother to Wook.

302
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,020
I left him when he was young.

303
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,394
I feel like he might've seen something
that he shouldn't have because of it.

304
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,565
But you guys got to reunite
in this village.

305
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,775
He finally got to see his mother again.
He's very lucky.

306
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,867
I don't want him
to do anything dangerous because of me.

307
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,544
What if something bad happens to him

308
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,000
while looking
for dead bodies and criminals?

309
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,841
I was also really worried about you
when you went to look for bodies.

310
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,931
I don't care if my body doesn't get found.

311
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,099
I feel bad
about leaving poor Jun-su alone.

312
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,314
But more importantly,

313
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,182
I just want Wook

314
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,189
to put everything behind him
and have a comfortable life.

315
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,821
He grew up well.

316
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,318
He's responsible and smart.

317
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,201
I'm sure he can handle himself.

318
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,188
"February 16th, 1990."

319
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,316
"The 15th day of the protest."

320
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:58,073
<i>The National Alliance of Squatters
and Evictees, college students,</i>

321
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,598
<i>and residents of the neighborhood
stood with their arms linked</i>

322
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,910
<i>and stopped the demolition.</i>

323
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,245
<i>I can't believe the government
and the gangsters have joined forces.</i>

324
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:10,296
<i>Capitalism is eating up humanity.</i>

325
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:18,473
<i>August 9th, 1990.
I felt Sunshine kick for the first time.</i>

326
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,971
<i>Someone from Choiseung Construction
came to me.</i>

327
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:27,232
<i>He loitered around my boyfriend's place
and rushed into a car when he saw me.</i>

328
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,732
<i>I'm sure Mom sent him.</i>

329
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:35,147
<i>Does she think she can buy
her daughter's affection with money?</i>

330
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:40,083
<i>I'm going to become a mom
who gives love, not money.</i>

331
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,075
SO GOOD PAWNSHOP

332
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,253
It feels different
to see the villagers on this board.

333
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,634
I can't find anything on Thomas.

334
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,801
What is his real name?

335
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,589
Cha… Cha something.

336
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,343
Cha Gwon-muk.

337
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,835
What a strong name.

338
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,297
What is his age?

339
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,007
He's 22 years old. He's old, but young.

340
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,928
He's not old but young. He's just old!

341
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,079
I bet he's been living there
for more than 100 years.

342
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,603
What?

343
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,397
- One hundred years?
- That's right.

344
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,231
He's like a grandpa to you,
so show him some respect.

345
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,278
I knew it. He talks like he has just
stepped out of a period drama.

346
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,750
JANG-MI
PARK BEOM-SU

347
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,457
KIM HYEON-MI
PARK YEONG-HO

348
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,297
CHOI YEO-NA
KIM JUN-SU

349
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:49,691
So everything that happened
can be traced back 27 years?

350
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,399
I haven't figured everything out,

351
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,109
but I'm certain it's all related
to Choiseung Construction.

352
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,990
In her diary,
Kim Su-yeon also wrote that someone

353
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,148
from Choiseung Construction
came to see her.

354
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,494
Someone from Choiseung? Who?

355
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,197
There was no name.

356
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,997
Han Sang-gil,

357
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:14,381
Yoo Seong-ho, and Lee Dong-min.
Are they still at the company?

358
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,841
- Why do you ask?
- Detective Park told us about them.

359
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,421
He said he'd been investigating
these three men back then.

360
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,337
If Chairwoman Han
can't find her grandchild,

361
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,346
those three each get
a third of the company's shares.

362
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,850
- That's what her will says.
- Then it must be one of them.

363
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,813
But now it's down to two.

364
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,194
Yoo Seong-ho recently left
the company for bribery.

365
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,362
So one of those two men

366
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,072
killed Wook's mom and Nam-guk?

367
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
MISSING: JANG HYEON-JI

368
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,792
<i>Hey, the kindergarten backpack.
You got anything on that?</i>

369
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,210
<i>You dropped it off a couple of days ago.
Stop calling me three to four times a day!</i>

370
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,831
<i>Give me some time to work!</i>

371
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:59,048
Okay, I'll let you get back to work.
Take your time.

372
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,304
But don't take too long.

373
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,309
Is this the car Cho Won-uk
sold second-hand?

374
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,848
Yes, the car was in another province,
so we took an early train to get it.

375
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,144
So what did you find?

376
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,387
Blood.

377
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,608
He changed the carpet
in the trunk to a new one,

378
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,128
but we found some bloodstains
on the spare tire underneath it.

379
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,276
- Compare it with Jang-mi's DNA.
- Okay.

380
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,069
- Goodness!
- My gosh!

381
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,235
What's this?

382
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,833
It's for you, Jang-mi.
Go take it for a spin.

383
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,751
Did you make this yourself?
Did you put flowers in the basket too?

384
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,922
I found an old bike, so I fixed it up.

385
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,421
Thank you.

386
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,508
I really wanted to ride a bike.

387
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,592
Go on.

388
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,219
Let me try.

389
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,679
Your wish came true. Let's see.

390
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,766
I'm moving!

391
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,901
She's good.

392
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,583
Shouldn't we give her a heads-up?
Her killer will be caught soon.

393
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,155
We still need to give her some time
to say goodbye.

394
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,455
You have a point.

395
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,594
Thanks.

396
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,143
That's so refreshing. I feel much better.

397
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,428
I heard from someone

398
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,345
who recently arrived here

399
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,934
that the police are looking for you.

400
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,495
It seems like someone
reported you missing.

401
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,099
Me? Who did that?

402
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,398
My mom passed away three years ago

403
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,571
and there's no way that
bastard who killed me did it.

404
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,031
Could it be the bar manager?

405
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,157
But I've been missing for a year. Why now?

406
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,489
Still, it means someone
is worried about you.

407
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,414
I really hope they don't find me.

408
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,577
So that I can live here with you
and Thomas for a long time.

409
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,037
What if I disappear?

410
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,047
You've been here for more than 20 years.

411
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,799
There was someone who left
after staying here for 30 years

412
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,052
and someone who left
after just three days.

413
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,604
You can't predict the future.
Not here, nor out there.

414
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,559
He's right. You must assume

415
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,640
that people here will leave one day.

416
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,021
I understand.

417
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,855
We've secured field support,
so go find the victim now.

418
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,863
The forensics team is on their way too.

419
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,702
Get up, punk.

420
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,910
If Jang-mi is not where you say she is,
I'll bury you myself.

421
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,031
Got it?

422
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,407
She's there.

423
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:39,121
If I could have my way,
I'd like to bury him myself with a spade.

424
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,287
Stop it already.

425
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,837
Watch Detective Baek.
Otherwise, he might actually bury him.

426
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,551
Walk faster, you jerk!

427
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,755
Go!

428
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,730
- Who is he?
- Jang-mi's murderer.

429
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,308
Jang-mi?

430
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,983
JANG-MI, AGE 29
WENT MISSING ON JULY 1ST, 2019

431
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,028
<i>Think about it.</i>

432
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:17,406
Do you still want to stay here
if Thomas, Yeo-na, and I all leave?

433
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,576
Of course not.

434
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,714
I feel the same way.

435
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:26,924
Over the years, I felt so lonely and sad
every time I had to see my friends leave.

436
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,415
There were no words
to describe the sadness I felt.

437
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,967
So I don't want you
to feel that pain, Jang-mi.

438
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,892
And it's why I want you
to leave before me.

439
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,850
This is why I don't want to leave.

440
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,107
Because you care for me so much.

441
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,710
Hello.

442
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,418
- Detective Lee, did you find anything?
- Not yet.

443
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,879
Where?

444
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,749
Is it here?

445
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,836
Give me a reagent.

446
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,803
Damn, you're worse than an animal.

447
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,803
Sir, do it one more time. Hit him hard.

448
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,770
You moron.

449
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,102
Goodness!

450
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,728
Look!

451
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,608
How beautiful.

452
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,112
The roses or me?

453
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,204
Both.

454
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,318
You're so smart.

455
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,243
- Here.
- Gosh.

456
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:42,036
Place it in a breezy and sunny spot.

457
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,332
If the soil seems dry,
give it some water too.

458
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,126
It won't die if you care for it well.

459
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,304
Why are you giving me these flowers?

460
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,838
They looked so pretty in the garden,
so I wanted to give them as a gift.

461
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,724
As you said, we never know
when we'll disappear.

462
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,104
If someone who's been good to me
were to leave before me,

463
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,350
I wouldn't even have time to say goodbye.

464
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,562
Look at you, Jang-mi. You're all grown-up.

465
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,983
I think so.

466
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:09,231
- You brought them here on your new bike.
- Yes, aren't they beautiful?

467
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,741
I'll get going then.

468
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,740
- Come by for dinner later.
- Okay!

469
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,750
- Do you see anything yet?
- Dig a little deeper, carefully.

470
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,881
Hey! Where are you going?

471
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,127
- I'm going to Café Hawaii.
- One second.

472
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,644
For you.

473
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,720
I grew them myself.

474
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,885
They're roses.

475
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,557
How lovely.

476
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,432
Hey, Thomas!

477
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,689
I was on my way to Café Hawaii.

478
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,941
- Café Hawaii?
- Here you go.

479
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,284
- What's this?
- You've been through a lot recently.

480
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,200
I hope this makes you feel better.

481
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,815
Right. Thanks to you, I feel a lot better.

482
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,624
I'll get going.

483
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,964
Take care.

484
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,368
Take care.

485
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,691
<i>Goodbye, everyone.</i>

486
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,308
Where do you think she went?

487
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,481
She loved this place.

488
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,017
Mr. Jang had given it a lot of thought,

489
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,148
but she left earlier than I expected.

490
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,606
What do you mean?

491
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,775
Mr. Jang and Wook had already found
the culprit who killed Jang-mi

492
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,275
and had even secured evidence,

493
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,869
but since Jang-mi loved it here so much,

494
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,414
they were wondering what to do.

495
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,264
<i>A man in his twenties
who had killed his girlfriend</i>

496
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,968
<i>and buried her body
was arrested by the police.</i>

497
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,509
<i>Mr. Cho killed his girlfriend a year ago</i>

498
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,224
<i>and buried her body on his family's farm.</i>

499
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,715
That son of a gun.

500
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:52,438
How could he still go to bars
after what he did?

501
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,437
Right, Mr. Jang?

502
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,443
Where are you going all of a sudden?

503
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,249
Goodbye.

504
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,207
Forget all your bad memories

505
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:24,219
and keep the good ones you made here.

506
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,110
Farewell, Jang-mi.

507
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,967
It was a goodbye gift.

508
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,930
Without you,

509
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,390
it will be quiet around here.

510
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:37,714
SO GOOD PAWNSHOP

511
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,132
I have a plan.
Since everything that has happened

512
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,972
all started from the will,
my plan is to take advantage of it.

513
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,974
The key to this plan is me.

514
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,564
I'm the bait.

515
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,731
No, I'm totally against this.

516
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,110
Do you think you're a phoenix?
You almost got killed last time,

517
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,109
and yet you want to be the bait again?

518
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,781
No. Not a chance.

519
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,069
Hey, Jong-a.

520
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,492
You tend to make up your mind
before hearing someone out.

521
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,616
It's a different bait this time.

522
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,912
Different bait, my ass.
But let's let him finish.

523
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,749
She should be here by now.

524
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,295
It's nice to meet you all.
I'm Han Yeo-hui.

525
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,635
Hello.

526
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,969
You came alone, right, ma'am?

527
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,265
Please take a seat here.

528
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,733
You said you had a plan? Let's hear it.

529
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,356
I need to know what I have to do.

530
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,277
I'm going to be

531
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,660
your grandchild.

532
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,417
The chairwoman is really cool.

533
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,214
"Sure, go ahead with the plan."

534
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,546
"I'll call for an extraordinary
general meeting."

535
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,091
"I'll give you all the support you need."

536
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:17,851
It's not easy growing
a huge business all by herself.

537
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,193
She's no ordinary person.

538
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,231
That must be why she has a lot of enemies.

539
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,070
Let's install security cameras
in her office tomorrow night.

540
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,951
Sure. I'll give you
all the support you need.

541
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,869
<i>If you tell people
that you found your grandson,</i>

542
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:41,123
<i>the culprit will show himself.</i>

543
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,713
He'll be my grandson?

544
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,844
Who gave you the name Wook?

545
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,923
My mom did.

546
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,887
She named me that
so I would brighten the world.

547
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,236
MISSING: JANG HYEON-JI

548
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,411
Dad, I want some ice cream.

549
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,275
Sure.

550
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,164
Wait here.

551
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,601
Mr. Jang, you're here.

552
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,477
How have you been?

553
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,939
I've been good.

554
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:49,232
I'll place these flyers
at the ticket booth, so don't you worry.

555
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,436
Gosh, you're always helping me.
Thank you so much.

556
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,658
This will be the last time.
I'm retiring next month.

557
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,618
The higher-ups don't want these
around the park

558
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,831
because they're worried
attendance might drop.

559
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,424
But during my stay,
I'll put them up in a visible spot

560
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:08,128
and hand them out to people,
so hang in there.

561
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,420
Thank you so much.

562
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,966
Thank you.

563
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,050
Mr. Jang!

564
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,181
What? What brings you here?

565
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,352
Do I need your permission
to come to an amusement park?

566
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,095
Thanks to the emergency tracker.

567
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,524
If you'd told us where you were going,

568
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,608
we wouldn't have had
a hard time finding you.

569
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,243
- We wouldn't have had to use the tracker.
- So why are you guys here?

570
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,704
What did you do to my phone?

571
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,999
Look!

572
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,536
Jong-a gave the flyers a new design.

573
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,755
I used a bigger font that is more visible

574
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,008
and inserted a more realistic
age-progressed photo of Hyeon-ji.

575
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:00,551
I asked the printers to use thicker paper
that can withstand the rain.

576
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,973
And the banner too.
I asked them to use a material

577
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,388
that reflects light,
so it's more visible at night.

578
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,477
I also did that.

579
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,403
How…

580
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,281
I already posted this on social media too.
It's the fastest way to get the word out.

581
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,110
But still, a lot of elderly
people aren't online,

582
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,486
so we need to give out flyers
on the streets too.

583
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,867
I wanted to tell you sooner,

584
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,137
but Wook said we should tell you
after the printing is done.

585
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,791
Let's hurry up.
We have a busy day ahead of us.

586
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,248
MISSING: JANG HYEON-JI

587
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,218
Wook, your side is drooping.
Pull it up a bit.

588
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,681
- Is that good?
- Mr. Jang, hold the bottom too.

589
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,723
Let's move it to the left.

590
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,677
Just a little more.

591
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,979
That's it. Perfect!

592
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,271
Please take a look.

593
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,863
Thank you.

594
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,241
- Please take a look.
- If you see her, please call this number.

595
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,985
Thank you.

596
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,292
You guys must be tired.

597
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,627
Thanks to you, I'm not tired at all.

598
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,090
Come on, don't lie.
I know you're exhausted too.

599
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,762
I'm serious. I've never rested
a day at home for the past 15 years.

600
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,763
I feel sorry for Hyeon-ji
when I'm at home.

601
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,845
I'm just saying I have better
physical endurance than you, Wook.

602
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,141
You're really amazing, Mr. Jang.

603
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,515
It must have been really hard
to keep hope alive for that long.

604
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,193
How can I give up?
That's what keeps me going.

605
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,242
Hurry and come along.
I'll treat you to dinner!

606
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,821
Of course.

607
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,736
Let's go eat some barbecue!

608
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,905
Okay, sure.

609
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:53,671
Then when did Yeo-na arrive
in Duon Village or whatever it's called?

610
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,960
I don't know because I was locked up.
I'm not sure when she got there.

611
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,723
But according to Yeo-na,
it's been about a month.

612
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:05,511
She said some strangers came
to her house and kidnapped her.

613
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,266
So she tried to get away,
but she ended up getting caught again.

614
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,637
<i>Maybe she got kidnapped</i>

615
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,148
<i>and tried to run away
when the car stopped.</i>

616
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,270
<i>And then she got caught again.</i>

617
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,452
Then did Yeo-na tell Kim Wook too?

618
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,635
How are you feeling?

619
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,765
I'm fine.

620
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,152
What happened to Hwang Du-cheol?

621
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,859
Your plan actually worked.

622
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,191
He tried to scam Detective Shin
and got arrested.

623
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,694
I knew it.

624
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,913
He always plays by the book,
so it can be difficult at times,

625
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,201
but Detective Shin

626
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,793
is a good person.

627
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,579
He's really stubborn.

628
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,708
He never listens to others.

629
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,790
So you know.

630
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:25,053
I'm sorry for not telling you at first.

631
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,386
Honestly, I was really confused back then.

632
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,056
I understand.

633
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,560
I heard about everything

634
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,808
you did for me

635
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,316
and the people here.

636
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,229
You only heard that just now?

637
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:47,199
I was hoping lots of people
would talk about it,

638
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,661
but nobody said a word.

639
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,163
No one knows about it!

640
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,332
And you know

641
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,673
how Detective Shin treated me
like a lunatic?

642
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,012
I think he's starting to believe me now.

643
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,844
It might be because the guy
who killed Jang-mi got caught.

644
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,887
He looks at me differently.

645
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:14,726
Wook, I think you're a good person.

646
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,353
The other day, you said
you'd been wrong about me.

647
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,984
Even though you hold a grudge.

648
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,909
Chairwoman Han called
for an extraordinary general meeting.

649
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,230
And rumors that she has found
her grandson are spreading.

650
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,710
What do you think? Do I look like
a business mogul's grandson?

651
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,580
Why don't you make a fake business card?

652
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:44,497
That's your problem.
Don't just believe what you see.

653
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,298
You must look at the meaning behind it.

654
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,932
Do you think
I made a fake business card for fun?

655
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,300
It was for a great cause.

656
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,388
How can I say I see something
when I can't?

657
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,894
It really exists.

658
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,268
So trust me.

659
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,335
{\an8}WILL

660
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,761
What are you doing over there?

661
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,016
What about you? What brings you here?

662
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,435
Did you just go through
the chairwoman's safe?

663
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,192
What are you talking about?

664
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,859
What do you take me for?

665
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,414
I know you very well, Director Han.

666
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:00,079
You made Director Yoo resign, didn't you?

667
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,163
What?

668
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,680
One day, your crimes will catch up to you.
Especially a heinous crime like this.

669
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,219
It's one that has lasted for 27 years.

670
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,143
Who do you think is the culprit?

671
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,182
- Did you show this to Chairwoman Han?
- Yes, she's watching it right now.

672
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,517
We need to follow those two.

673
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,306
- I'll do it.
- Count me in.

674
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,228
Leave me out. You guys take care of this.

675
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:31,986
I'll follow Lee Dong-min
and you take Han Sang-gil.

676
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,990
Jong-a, you stay here.
I'll ask if I need any information.

677
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,868
Let's start from tomorrow.

678
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,457
Bye, Detective Shin.

679
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,578
See you!

680
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:47,788
Wook, when are you going to tell him?
You already know where Yeo-na's body is.

681
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,338
I just know she was dumped in the sea.
I don't know the exact coordinates.

682
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,223
I'll tell him once I'm sure.

683
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,010
Then we should look for her.

684
00:50:55,719 --> 00:51:00,139
Leave it to Detective Shin.
When someone's waiting for someone,

685
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,433
it's better to hear bad news
than nothing at all.

686
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,805
The best thing you can do
is tell him as soon as you can.

687
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,991
I know rumors have spread already,

688
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,294
but I finally found my grandson.

689
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,754
Pardon?

690
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,001
I'm pretty sure
fake rumors will go around,

691
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,133
so I'm going to make
an official announcement.

692
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,627
I thought I should tell
the two of you first.

693
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,757
Congratulations, Chairwoman Han.

694
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:42,305
Congratulations, ma'am.
Where did you find him?

695
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,230
You'll meet him tomorrow
at the general meeting.

696
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,518
I'll see you then.

697
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,654
Choiseung Construction.

698
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:58,946
Chairwoman Han Yeo-hui
has found her long-lost grandson.

699
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,912
We expect a big commotion
after the official announcement.

700
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:04,753
Gosh, it's the calm before the storm.

701
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,880
Now that her only heir has shown up,
he'll be given all her wealth.

702
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,459
It's not the calm
before the storm. It's a party!

703
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,915
Party, my ass.

704
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,053
If life were that simple,

705
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:19,221
no one would ever get killed
or go missing. How naive of you.

706
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,009
We got it, sir!

707
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,347
Got what?

708
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,576
The guy who killed the scrap paper lady.
It's Kang Myeong-jin!

709
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,940
The DNA on her belongings
was Kang Myeong-jin's!

710
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,317
I knew it! What did I tell you?

711
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,940
Should I get ready
for another press conference?

712
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,777
Why is everything working out so well?

713
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,202
Nice work, Detective Baek!

714
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,702
Did you see the news?

715
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,121
Your DNA was found
on the scrap paper lady's clothes.

716
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,458
You killed her, didn't you?

717
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,464
I don't remember

718
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,675
since it's been too long.

719
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,009
That means you do.

720
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,682
You just said it's been too long.

721
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,024
I never told you when it happened.

722
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,191
You said it was on the news.

723
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,531
No, it wasn't.

724
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,322
I just said it to feel you out.

725
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,624
I came as soon as I got a call
from the National Forensic Service.

726
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,828
There are more victims, right?

727
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,795
You won't be able to get away anyway.

728
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,762
I'll find everyone
while you're locked in here.

729
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,558
Do you get it? You crazy psychopath!

730
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,369
Yes.

731
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,457
Did you see the news?

732
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,514
Chairwoman Han stabbed us in the back.

733
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,838
What are you talking about?

734
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:23,178
She told us before the news broke.

735
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,178
What's going to happen to us now?

736
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,767
Is that no-name grandson
going to be the major shareholder?

737
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,517
All my efforts went to waste,
and so did yours.

738
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,185
- If you're done, I'm hanging up.
<i>- No, wait.</i>

739
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:41,784
<i>I called you to ask for a drink.
To clear up yesterday's misunderstanding.</i>

740
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,824
I know you're also upset.

741
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,541
You could've been a judge
or a prosecutor after you passed the bar.

742
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,409
You must've had big dreams
when you first entered the company.

743
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,708
Fine. Let's have a drink.

744
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,153
- Step on it.
- I'm keeping a distance.

745
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:29,914
- Hurry. Step on it. Come on!
- Okay, fine.

746
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:36,957
What?

747
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,747
Why are they meeting
at a hotel at this hour?

748
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:43,303
- Do you think they're in this together?
- I don't think so.

749
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,680
But something sure smells fishy.

750
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,970
Detective Shin, aren't you hungry?
Let's get inside and eat.

751
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,723
We might get caught.

752
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,311
We don't know when they might
come out, so let's wait here.

753
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,457
I'll follow Lee Dong-min,
so you keep an eye on Han Sang-gil.

754
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,455
What are you waiting for?

755
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,129
- Get out.
- Right now?

756
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,936
That's strange.

757
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,148
He still hasn't grown on me.

758
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,531
What does Yeo-na see in him?

759
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,280
I don't get it.

760
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,290
This is Detective Baek.

761
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,873
<i>I'm calling about the backpack.</i>

762
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,538
Yes, the backpack. What about it?

763
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,251
Did you find anything?

764
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:07,167
<i>We've got a minute trace of DNA.
What should we do with it?</i>

765
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:16,144
What? Slow down and say it again.

766
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:20,194
We found DNA on Hyeon-ji's backpack!

767
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,859
It doesn't belong to Hyeon-ji,
so it's likely the suspect's.

768
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:25,862
Oh, God.

769
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,400
Thank you.

770
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,776
<i>It takes a few days to compare the DNA,</i>

771
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,744
but we'll get something this time, right?

772
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,124
Thank you so much, Detective Baek.

773
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,541
If we find Hyeon-ji,

774
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,159
I'll make it up to you
for the rest of my life.

775
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,884
<i>That's not necessary.
You did all the work.</i>

776
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,709
<i>You've been keeping
the evidence safe until now.</i>

777
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,955
All right.

778
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,299
Call me right away
once you get the results.

779
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,392
Okay. Bye.

780
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,307
Goodness.

781
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,194
Hey, honey.

782
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,023
I'll bring you news of Hyeon-ji soon.

783
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,821
No.

784
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,282
No…

785
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:00,081
<i>While the mother</i>

786
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:05,081
<i>Is out at sea</i>

787
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:14,629
<i>Catching oysters in the shade</i>

788
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:24,939
<i>The baby is left</i>

789
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:33,237
<i>All alone at home</i>

790
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:42,365
<i>Listening to the lullaby</i>

791
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:48,786
<i>That the sea sings</i>

792
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:18,868
<i>The baby falls asleep</i>

793
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,276
{\an8}- I know you're putting on a show.
- You're too smart. I can't fool you.

794
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,038
{\an8}Hey, jerk! Tell me where Hyeon-ji is!

795
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,790
{\an8}<i>I don't remember.</i>

796
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,372
{\an8}It's been too long.

797
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,893
{\an8}<i>Where is Kim Wook now?
He's not picking up.</i>

798
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,353
{\an8}<i>I think Lee Dong-min
kidnapped Chairwoman Han.</i>

799
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:15,707
{\an8}Where is the woman
you told Manager Wang to abduct?

800
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,757
{\an8}My mom, who was murdered by him…
She doesn't know where her body is.

801
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:19,881
{\an8}What more do you need?

802
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,967
{\an8}Everyone died a wrongful death,
and the ones who should be dead are alive.

803
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:27,055
{\an8}You said you have a question for him.
Then go and ask.

804
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:30,141
