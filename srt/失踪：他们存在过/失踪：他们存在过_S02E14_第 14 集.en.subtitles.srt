00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,012
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,972
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,020
This is Juwon. Requesting a rescue.

4
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,773
We're evacuating to Seonggu Port
from our current location.

5
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,067
Juwon is on its way to take refuge.

6
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,902
Juwon?

7
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,279
Can you repeat what you said?

8
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,364
Jong-yun, that idiot.

9
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,451
Jong-yun!

10
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,244
Go inside the cabin, right now!

11
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,288
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

12
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,452
This is Juwon.

13
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,955
We can't find our captain
who went out on the deck.

14
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,706
I killed her.

15
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,545
Why did you do it?

16
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,633
After my finger got cut off,

17
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,678
I did some gambling while recovering

18
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,054
and got into some debt.

19
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,725
I had no way to get that kind of money.

20
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,185
Then…

21
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,398
I remembered Eun-sil mentioning
some insurance money.

22
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,573
My wife doesn't know what I've done.

23
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,867
But one day,

24
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,120
she started saying
that she keeps seeing Eun-sil

25
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,621
and that she hears things.

26
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,749
I thought my wife
was being punished for what I did.

27
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,128
And I felt guilty
every single day of my life.

28
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,548
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,595
I don't even need a trial.

30
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,346
Please…

31
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,765
give me the death penalty!

32
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,397
You are unbelievably selfish.

33
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,026
You should be apologizing to the victim.

34
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,072
The corpse was damaged.

35
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,908
Why did you do that?

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,751
Welcome.

37
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,808
Why are you just standing there?

38
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,697
You're all dressed up.

39
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,408
Were you at a funeral or something?

40
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,578
Yes.

41
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,540
I have some spicy beef soup,
so come and eat.

42
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,170
Did it have to be spicy beef soup?

43
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,301
How is this possible?

44
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,096
What should we do now?

45
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,556
About what?

46
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,976
Are you going to tell her?

47
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,398
She has a right to know.

48
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:40,905
SUPERMARKET

49
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,163
That's not funny.

50
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,791
I told you, I drowned at sea.

51
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,626
The wind and waves were so bad

52
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,671
that the boat was shaking left and right.

53
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,214
I remember clearly.

54
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,304
Did Jong-yun

55
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,515
really kill me?

56
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,478
He confessed to the police.

57
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,653
Does Sun-hee know?

58
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,949
He said he didn't tell his wife.

59
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,244
But she kept seeing and hearing things

60
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,332
so she's been receiving
psychiatric treatment.

61
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,793
Why would he do that to me?

62
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,213
For the insurance money?

63
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,843
It seems like it.

64
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,695
Leave her be.

65
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,826
Do you think she'll be okay?

66
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,204
I doubt it.

67
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,584
I couldn't even tell her
that we found her body.

68
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,714
You found whose body?

69
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,926
And where's Captain Kang going?

70
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:27,804
Mr. Jung.

71
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,771
Hey!

72
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,232
You bastard!

73
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,904
You should have just let me die.

74
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,449
You should have…

75
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,663
let me go in peace
instead of sending me here!

76
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,331
You bastard!

77
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,795
Ju-won…

78
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:06,592
Honey, take me with you!

79
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,554
My baby.

80
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,225
I miss you so much.

81
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,353
Hey!

82
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,065
Why do I have to be punished?

83
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,069
Why must I be punished?

84
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,948
Why?

85
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,244
Why can't I even die on my own terms?

86
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,501
Why do I have to be here?

87
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,135
Why…

88
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,023
Are you done crying?

89
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,694
That's enough for today.

90
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,905
You'll faint if you cry anymore.

91
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,577
You can come here to cry tomorrow,
then the day after that.

92
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,830
You'll feel better if you keep doing that.

93
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,875
Or you may not.

94
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,297
I'm being punished.

95
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,802
I said to you before

96
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,679
that I think it's horrible

97
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,977
what your son did to you.

98
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,397
It is horrible.

99
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,111
And all this time,

100
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,865
I had no idea what happened to me.

101
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,328
The 50 years of my life

102
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,413
and 30 years after death…

103
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,333
They're all meaningless.

104
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,253
They're not meaningless.

105
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,090
You should blame the people
who betrayed those who cared for them.

106
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,720
What's the point?

107
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,350
We're the ones who are stuck here.

108
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,926
Who are you?

109
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,470
Don't you know me?

110
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,266
I thought Pil-jung told you about me.

111
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,730
I'm Mr. Noh.

112
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,065
The person who paid your wages.

113
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,528
Where is Pil-jung?

114
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,490
Right. You wouldn't know
since you were unconscious.

115
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,410
There was an accident.

116
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,831
I warned him again and again
that he shouldn't do drugs.

117
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,965
Looking for this?

118
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,385
That's mine.

119
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,720
Before I give this back,

120
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,598
I'm also looking for something
that belongs to me.

121
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,142
What is it?

122
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,396
Pil-jung said you have it.

123
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,981
How reckless of you.

124
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,151
What were you trying to do
after stealing it?

125
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,821
What are you talking about?

126
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,828
You stole what belongs to me.

127
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,790
I didn't steal anything.

128
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,298
Pil-jung

129
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,801
told me you hid it.

130
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,552
You're saying he lied?

131
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,724
What are you talking about?

132
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,019
What on earth are you talking about?

133
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,730
It makes no sense.

134
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,775
If you really don't know
anything about it,

135
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,779
why did Kim Pil-jung
keep you alive all these years?

136
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,615
And…

137
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,161
there's no reason to keep you alive
if you don't know anything.

138
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,663
Don't you agree?

139
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,512
But perhaps…

140
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,309
some pain will jog your memory.

141
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,455
Why is the captain still here
when we found her body?

142
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,581
I don't know.

143
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,125
-This is all very confusing.
-Wook!

144
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,418
Mr. Jang!

145
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,713
Why didn't you answer my calls?

146
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,591
Mr. Oh Il-yong disappeared.

147
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,634
What?

148
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,803
What are you talking about?
He can't even walk yet.

149
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,721
What do we do?

150
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,764
All right.

151
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,392
-Let's go. Come on!
-Yes, sir!

152
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,643
-Let's hurry.
-Yes, sir.

153
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,145
We'll be back, sir.

154
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,188
Where are you going?

155
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,981
We'll call you.

156
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,029
The numbers.

157
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,703
The numbers.

158
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,543
What is this place?

159
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,628
What are you doing?

160
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,382
What do you think you're doing?

161
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,926
I like the way you look.

162
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,344
What are you doing?

163
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,970
I'm taking pictures.

164
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,138
Stop taking them.

165
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,682
Give me your phone.

166
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,392
I said, give it to me.

167
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,061
Hey, wait a minute.

168
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:32,978
Damn it!

169
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,190
Jong-a.

170
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,274
I'm at the door.

171
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,318
Okay, hold on. I'm nearly done.

172
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,200
Done!

173
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,541
That was weird.

174
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:57,962
What the…

175
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,478
-Mr. Jang, are you okay?
-Yes.

176
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,691
You didn't know
how fast I could run, did you?

177
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,110
I used to be a runner.

178
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,031
Would Wook be okay?

179
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,742
That's why I said I'd go with him
and dressed accordingly,

180
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,578
but he said he'd rather do this alone.

181
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,289
I have to get the timing right.

182
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,147
One must be fair when doing business.

183
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,486
This is how business should be done.

184
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,824
Il-yong.

185
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,455
That bastard.

186
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,791
That annoying bastard is back.

187
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,294
Just send Il-yong over here.

188
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,213
Then you'll never have to see

189
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,216
my face again.

190
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,344
Do you know him?

191
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,305
I told you, I don't know him.

192
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:37,436
He doesn't know you,
so why do you keep ruining things for me?

193
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,233
I really wanted to know
who was behind Goliath.

194
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,529
You're Mr. Noh?

195
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,531
Noh Yoon-gu?

196
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,923
You're the real Goliath, aren't you?

197
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,425
You bastard.

198
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,263
You get people addicted to drugs.

199
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:17,768
A few days later, I saw the news
that a druggie father killed his son.

200
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,228
What's worse,

201
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,647
you also kidnap people.

202
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,900
If any of their clients fail
to pay back their due credit,

203
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,777
they cut out their organs and sell them.

204
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,946
And sell their organs overseas.

205
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,785
And you still call yourself human?

206
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,582
The people that we can't find

207
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,085
because you killed them without a trace.

208
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,845
Have you ever thought
about their families?

209
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,310
Is it wrong for a debt collector
to collect debts?

210
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,062
Okay. Got it.

211
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,188
I've heard enough.

212
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,606
Take him.

213
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,817
Go ahead. Take him.

214
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,007
We're getting out of here.
Don't look back.

215
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:40,893
Wait.

216
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,521
Did you say your goodbyes?

217
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,191
Take your time for your farewell.

218
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,401
Hey.

219
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,449
You may not remember,

220
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,285
but you helped a lot of people.

221
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,579
On behalf of those people,

222
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,208
I'm going to help you this time.

223
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,010
Keep things clean.

224
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,439
Let's end things now.

225
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,985
Row M, 13.

226
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,114
Now, Jong-a.

227
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,033
Run, Wook!

228
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,372
Are you okay, sir?

229
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,581
Get that bastard!

230
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,671
Hey! Stop right there!

231
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,588
Hey!

232
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,787
Don't move.

233
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,292
Detective Shin.

234
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,501
Noh Yoon-gu is inside.

235
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,794
Row S, 35.

236
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,753
Detective Yu, take him.

237
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,088
-Yes, sir.
-You two, follow me.

238
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,149
Wook!

239
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,610
Oh, my…

240
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,696
-Are you all right?
-Yes. I'm okay.

241
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,117
Hey, Il-yong.

242
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,162
Are you okay?

243
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,331
Yes, I guess so.

244
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,875
But who are you, anyway?

245
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,418
You want to know?

246
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,754
But you don't even remember.

247
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,756
I'm sure it'll come to him gradually.

248
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,884
I'm glad that you're okay.

249
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,554
Do you know me too?

250
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,223
Of course.

251
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,434
EMERGENCY WARD

252
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,105
How did you know
Noh Yoon-gu would be there?

253
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,357
I didn't.

254
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,609
I went there to find Il-yong.

255
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,319
What I mean is,

256
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,072
how did you know
Oh Il-yong would be there?

257
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,033
After Il-yong got hospitalized,

258
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,911
I started preparing for this.

259
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,705
A GPS tracker?

260
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,498
On me?

261
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,544
Where?

262
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,054
Ta-da.

263
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,599
This may look funny,
but it's quite effective.

264
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,687
You know this is illegal, right?

265
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,523
Look.

266
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,983
We do know that,

267
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,985
but please understand why we had to do it.

268
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,946
You guys are unbelievable.

269
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,614
But…

270
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,867
do we really know each other?

271
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,829
You guys are like a private commando unit.

272
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,541
Did you three start
a private detective agency or something?

273
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,961
Oh, a detective agency.

274
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,422
I haven't thought that far.

275
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,632
It was a joke.

276
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,633
Goodness.

277
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,553
Anyway, I'm so glad to know
that you have my back.

278
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,763
Thanks.

279
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,848
Not at all.

280
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,559
It's the police's duty
to protect citizens.

281
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,855
So how do you start an agency?

282
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,815
Mr. Oh Il-yong.

283
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,777
Do you remember everything that happened
before you fell unconscious?

284
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,945
You tried to convince
Kim Pil-jung to turn yourselves in?

285
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,156
Well…

286
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,077
He still has a lot of tests.
Let's talk after he's done.

287
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,912
INSURANCE POLICY

288
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,438
Captain Kang!

289
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,689
Are you in there?

290
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,234
Yes. Coming!

291
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,948
Oh, come on.

292
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,785
Don't look at me
as if I'm a child by dangerous waters.

293
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,036
Come on now.

294
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,540
You had me so worried
out by the water earlier.

295
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,584
You are a child out by the water.

296
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,295
Have you eaten anything?

297
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,422
Yes, I have.

298
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:46,883
Captain Kang.

299
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,010
Have you eaten?

300
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,971
I just said that I have.

301
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,057
I'm really okay.

302
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,517
Don't worry about me.

303
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,810
If you say so.

304
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,520
If you're that worried about me,

305
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,605
could you look after
the store for a while?

306
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm going to pick up Alice
from Hye-ju's place.

307
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,901
Sure. Go ahead.

308
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,028
And Mr. Jang,

309
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,699
how about a drink with me
if you have the time?

310
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,162
I have something to tell you.
And a favor to ask too.

311
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,830
A favor?

312
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,583
Wook.

313
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,629
Where's Mr. Jang?

314
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,506
He went to see Captain Kang

315
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,883
but isn't back yet.

316
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,676
How come you two came together?

317
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,555
He dragged me here.

318
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,349
He was discharged from the hospital

319
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,767
but had nowhere to go.

320
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,644
It's weird being here,

321
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,938
at a stranger's home.

322
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,190
What's wrong with it?

323
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,524
Welcome.

324
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,277
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Lee Jong-a.

325
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,697
Okay.

326
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,823
I'm Oh Il-yong.

327
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,247
Nice to meet you,

328
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,540
Mr. Oh Il-yong.

329
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,375
It's nice to meet you too.

330
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,051
Awesome.

331
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,011
I'm holding your hand for real this time.

332
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,014
We shook hands before.

333
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,098
Do you remember?

334
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:18,934
No.

335
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,523
What's wrong? Are you okay?

336
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,486
What? Oh, I'm fine.

337
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,364
You've been on your feet too long.
Let's go inside.

338
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,165
Mr. Jang.

339
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,168
Please find me out there.

340
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,547
So that Ji-hoon can pay for his sin

341
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,841
and move toward the right path.

342
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,262
Well…

343
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,472
Why are you asking me?

344
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,184
Because you're Hyeon-ji's dad.

345
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,312
At first,

346
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,400
I thought you came here
where Hyeon-ji used to live

347
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,529
because you missed your daughter so much.

348
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,658
I pitied you.

349
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,994
But…

350
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,414
after a while,

351
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:26,418
watching Hyeon-ji's friends
leave one by one,

352
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,045
I realized…

353
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,882
that it was your work.

354
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,594
Wook wasn't the only one
doing those things.

355
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:42,267
You were working with him.

356
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,270
Then…

357
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,772
you knew already?

358
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,863
I had a complicated relationship
with my own son,

359
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,325
so I couldn't talk to you about it.

360
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,536
I see.

361
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,456
I know I'm being shameless.

362
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,417
But after a long time has passed,

363
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,796
when Ji-hoon can accept the situation,

364
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,010
please go see him

365
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,221
and comfort him.

366
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,102
When he was a kid,

367
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,941
he was just as innocent
and good as Hyeon-ji.

368
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,322
Okay.

369
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,035
I'll be sure to go see him.

370
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,757
SON AFTER INHERITANCE,
BLOODY BOOK IN THE STUDY, EVIDENCE

371
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,674
JUNG JI-HOON

372
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,520
Enjoy your food.

373
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,437
Thanks.

374
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,485
So what brought you here
so early in the morning?

375
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,153
What is this?

376
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,655
Were you out all night?

377
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,657
I'll get right to the point.

378
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,535
We may not actually be private detectives,

379
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,829
but there are those
who come to us for help.

380
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,624
They can come directly to the police.

381
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:34,504
I came on their behalf because they can't.

382
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,803
Could you find this man for me?

383
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,764
Everything I know is written there.

384
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,436
JUNG YOUNG-JIN,
WENT MISSING IN 2012

385
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,438
SON AFTER INHERITANCE?
BLOODY BOOK IN THE STUDY, EVIDENCE?

386
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,355
What?

387
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:53,773
Is this…

388
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,859
all true?

389
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,739
Look for a bloody book in the study.

390
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,035
Jung Young-jin's credit card
has been used until now.

391
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,375
So a 70-year-old man
used his card at a hotel club?

392
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,502
Get the security camera footage.

393
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,670
Yes, sir.

394
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,131
-And Detective Do.
-Yes, sir?

395
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,091
What happened with the search warrant
on Jung Young-jin's house?

396
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,509
Detective Oh is at the court.

397
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,727
Who is the informant? It's so detailed.

398
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,689
This sounds as if
the missing person himself told him.

399
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,359
You said you wanted to protect your son

400
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,487
even though he committed murder.

401
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,864
So what changed your mind?

402
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,492
I saw hope.

403
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,828
Hope?

404
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,081
Il-yong returned from the dead.

405
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,460
He was different from the start.

406
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,587
What is it?

407
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,799
Do you want to live again?

408
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,760
I'm not talking about myself.

409
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,679
I like living here in peace.

410
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,224
Not me.

411
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,313
My son, Ji-hoon.

412
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,610
Mr. Jung Ji-hoon?

413
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:22,862
Who are you?

414
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,906
This is a search and seizure.

415
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,618
-Let us in now.
-What's going on? Hey!

416
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,245
-We're the police.
-What's this?

417
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,163
What search and seizure?

418
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,625
My wife made me promise something

419
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,586
before she passed from her illness.

420
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,258
She asked me to take care of Ji-hoon

421
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,927
and raise him as a good person.

422
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,305
But he ended up

423
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,809
becoming a murderer

424
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,645
who killed his own father for money.

425
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:03,027
Before Wook and Mr. Jang came,

426
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,363
I taught the kids

427
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,741
that hope was something to dream about.

428
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,369
But now,

429
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,204
I teach them

430
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,040
that hope is something that comes true.

431
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,045
My only hope left

432
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,007
is that Ji-hoon…

433
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,177
will turn over a new leaf.

434
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,391
For him to acknowledge his sin,
pay the price,

435
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,854
and become a better person
than he was before.

436
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,441
Then…

437
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,651
I think

438
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,030
I can forgive.

439
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,200
How dare you go into my room
without my permission?

440
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,118
Hey.

441
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,081
Let go of me! Hey!

442
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,041
Don't touch that.

443
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,208
Don't!

444
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,752
Damn it!

445
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:04,047
Look for a bloody book in the study.

446
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,424
The second shelf on the right end.

447
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,551
The book title is Scab.

448
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,222
Hey, Hye-ju.

449
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,140
Hi.

450
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,351
You're here too, Mr. Jung?

451
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,436
I ran out of cooking oil.

452
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,856
Hey, Ms. Ahn.

453
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,566
Have a cup of tea with us.

454
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,609
Yes, have a seat.

455
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,361
Shall I?

456
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,587
Here.

457
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,214
What is that book?

458
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,925
Something Mr. Jung gave me.

459
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,512
For the past few days,

460
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,305
I've been struggling

461
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,307
to understand
what Rilke was talking about,

462
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,726
and I found something.

463
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,478
Let's hear it.

464
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,230
He wrote a lot of letters.

465
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,400
Listen to this.

466
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,573
"If there is something else
I'd like to say,

467
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,410
it's this."

468
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,498
"Don't think that the person
who is trying hard to comfort you

469
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,002
is comfortably living

470
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,755
a life free of pain."

471
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,633
Right?

472
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:39,934
SCAB

473
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,020
"This person's life

474
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,523
also has difficulties and sadness."

475
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,649
Hey.

476
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,860
Call the NFS.

477
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,155
"And is in fact

478
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,199
far behind you."

479
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,540
Is this what you were feeling
all this time?

480
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,641
Mr. Jung.

481
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,067
Let go of everything.

482
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,944
Leave in peace.

483
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,989
Goodbye.

484
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,299
Goodness.

485
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,426
That's where he was.

486
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,472
Thank you, Detective Baek.

487
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,858
Let's see.

488
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,918
How is this here?

489
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,248
How is this possible?

490
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,600
Get ready, Detective Kim.

491
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,227
Noh Yoon-gu is here.

492
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:15,900
Noh Yoon-gu.

493
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:17,818
Let go of me.

494
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,987
Drop the bag.

495
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,379
Sir.

496
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,178
Where's Noh Yoon-gu?

497
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,017
Your ticket has been confirmed,
Mr. Hong Jeong-gyun.

498
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,811
Enjoy your flight.

499
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,604
Thank you.

500
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,233
Noh Yoon-gu.

501
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,655
It's been a while.

502
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,562
Just how many men did you bring for me?

503
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,657
I'm…

504
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,160
going to turn myself in.

505
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,454
Turn yourself in?

506
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,416
But…

507
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,834
you still

508
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,379
have a lot of rehabilitation
to go through.

509
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:05,217
And we still have to find out
what had happened to you.

510
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,262
I still have some questions too.

511
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,109
Bo-ra, you're allowed to go out now.

512
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,904
You can meet your friends
after your academy classes.

513
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,156
Okay.

514
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,909
Why do you look sad?

515
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,577
Aren't you excited?

516
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,873
There's a house that Mom picked out.

517
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,500
But because of that bad guy,

518
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,336
we've been postponing our moving day.

519
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,094
Come visit for a housewarming party.

520
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,305
Sure, of course.

521
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,528
Hyeon-ji.

522
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,446
Dad.

523
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,783
Did you see the letter I wrote to you?

524
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,952
Of course I did.

525
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,415
Then you must've met Ha-yun and Yeong-rim.

526
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,707
My teacher too.

527
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,792
Yes.

528
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:25,256
The headband you gave Ha-yun
looked great on her.

529
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:29,051
You bought it for me
at the amusement park.

530
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:29,969
You're right.

531
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,472
Ms. Yang is so pretty when she smiles.

532
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,015
Right.

533
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,811
Ha-yun already knew I took you away.

534
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,354
I told her

535
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,898
that you'll come to get me.

536
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,987
I promised them
that you'd find them after you found me.

537
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,157
I kept that promise.

538
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,327
Ha-yun and Yeong-rim left
while having fun on the swing,

539
00:40:55,411 --> 00:41:00,624
and Ro-ha left
when he came in first place in a race.

540
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,042
Really?

541
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,211
Dad, you're the best!

542
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,838
Hyeon-ji, you're the best.

543
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,008
Dad.

544
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,180
Thank you so much
for keeping your promise.

545
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,769
So are my friends
all gone from the village?

546
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,231
Well, now…

547
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,859
there are new friends

548
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,194
and younger kids as well.

549
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,822
I wish they'd stop coming.

550
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,242
Don't worry. I'll find them all.

551
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,538
Then I'm going to brag
to my friends again.

552
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,416
Are you leaving already?

553
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,377
Yes.

554
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,213
I have to go now.

555
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,683
Thank you for being my daughter.

556
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,734
In your next life,

557
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,196
be my daughter again.

558
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,496
Next time…

559
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,333
Daddy will…

560
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,462
Next time…

561
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,260
Daddy will…

562
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,721
Next time…

563
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,563
Daddy will…

564
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,530
Hey, Mr. Jang!

565
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,906
You're looking spiffy today.

566
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,533
Are you going somewhere?

567
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,285
I was just…

568
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,328
Well…

569
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,497
I'm going to go see Hyeon-ji and my wife.

570
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,125
-Are you off to work?
-Yes.

571
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,294
I'm going to discuss
the missing children's campaign.

572
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,420
Oh, thank you.

573
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,346
Il-yong, what are you…

574
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,097
Are you going out?

575
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,477
He's going to the police station
to turn himself in.

576
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,022
You should go after you recover a bit.

577
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,691
Many innocent people
got hurt because of me.

578
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,818
I should have done this sooner.

579
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,779
I'm way past due.

580
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,157
Then we can't see you anymore?

581
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:21,909
We wouldn't know.

582
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,829
That's very nice of you.

583
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,041
You've made a very courageous decision.

584
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,628
Thank you.

585
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,840
Call us if you ever need anything there.

586
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,258
Okay.

587
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,594
Il-yong.

588
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,389
Can I give you a hug?

589
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,026
Goodbye.

590
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,866
Wook, you help him.

591
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,380
Then is Il-yong going to prison?

592
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:19,675
He has no priors
and is cooperative with the investigation,

593
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,301
but I don't know.

594
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,720
Il-yong may look weak,

595
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,264
but he is dogged.

596
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,099
And his ability to survive is amazing.

597
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,518
He even came back from the dead.

598
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,648
Wrap this for me.

599
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,194
You didn't use drugs, turned yourself in,

600
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,821
and you're repentant?

601
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,698
Yes.

602
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,201
But working under Goliath
still counts as organized crime.

603
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,538
I know.

604
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,415
Do you have any useful information?

605
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,671
I don't know if this will help.

606
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,593
But this is Goliath's,
or Kim Pil-jung's ring.

607
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,386
He and I had matching rings,

608
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,221
and I secretly switched his with mine.

609
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,931
He said the evidence

610
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,976
was in this ring.

611
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,853
What's in there?

612
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,981
That, I don't know.

613
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:32,414
THE LATE JANG HYEON-JI

614
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:50,015
THE LATE OH YUN-GYEONG
THE LATE JANG HYEON-JI

615
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,017
Honey.

616
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,230
I met Hyeon-ji in my dream.

617
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,068
She never came to see me
for the past 17 years,

618
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,530
but she came and we talked up a storm.

619
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,661
You must be so happy
up there with Hyeon-ji.

620
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,250
I wish I could be there too.

621
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,297
But Hyeon-ji gave me
tons of homework to do.

622
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,300
So I can't go there

623
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,636
for a while.

624
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:33,600
Hyeon-ji.

625
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,270
I'm…

626
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,773
going to keep the promise I made to you.

627
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,257
Goodbye.

628
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,398
We'll organize a supporting group
and let them join in the search

629
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,775
so this doesn't end up as a mere gesture.

630
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,029
It's all good.

631
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,906
But it's going to take
a lot of money to do all this.

632
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,953
We also have a budget plan.

633
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,419
SO GOOD
MISSING CHILDREN'S CAMPAIGN

634
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,301
I knew that this day would come.

635
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,054
What day?

636
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,889
These three people here

637
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,975
denied ever being a part of any searches.

638
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,811
Now they're going to do it openly.

639
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,939
This means that they plan
to compete with us.

640
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,734
Come on.

641
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,614
SEARCHING FOR MISSING CHILDREN

642
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,704
You said you had something to tell me.

643
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,748
So why aren't you saying anything?

644
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,587
Are you here to say goodbye?

645
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,635
We should've said goodbyes.

646
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,053
Oh, my.

647
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,973
I guess you're really planning
on not coming here anymore.

648
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,642
Not us.

649
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,185
It's about you, Captain Kang.

650
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,190
We found your body

651
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,110
in Lim Jong-yun's cold storage.

652
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,863
We held a funeral too.

653
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,201
What do you mean?

654
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,871
You found my body?

655
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,167
Yes.

656
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,295
The day we came here in suits

657
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,340
was your funeral.

658
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,884
We thought

659
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,055
you had already left.

660
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,353
So that was why you looked shocked
as if you'd seen a ghost.

661
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,607
Then…

662
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:32,112
why am I still here?

663
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,245
Say something.

664
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,416
I did it.

665
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,378
I had no idea that she would be

666
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,005
in that cold storage.

667
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,425
If I had known…

668
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,635
I wouldn't have

669
00:50:56,178 --> 00:51:00,348
dumped her leg that was caught in a net

670
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,644
into the sea.

671
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,690
I thought my husband

672
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,944
pushed her into the ocean.

673
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,074
So I wanted her to rest in peace

674
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,368
with her body intact.

675
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,788
If you found my body,

676
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,916
shouldn't I be moving on?

677
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,085
When others die,

678
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,379
it's all over.

679
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,050
But I can't even move on.

680
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,472
After they all leave,

681
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,434
I'd be here alone.

682
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:49,481
We're not going to leave you here alone.

683
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,194
What would that change?

684
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,740
After you two came,

685
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,077
Il-yong came back to life.

686
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,205
And all those kids

687
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,292
and even Mr. Jung moved on.

688
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,630
I thought a miracle would really happen.

689
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,136
That my hope would come true.

690
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,307
It was all false hope.

691
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,437
Like you said,

692
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,774
it's not over yet.

693
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,736
We'll find out what happened.

694
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,032
We'll never give up.

695
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,618
Yes.

696
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:49,165
No matter what happens,
we'll never leave you alone.

697
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:57,007
Captain, don't cry.

698
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:37,339
DAY 10,942

699
00:53:55,023 --> 00:54:00,236
SUPERMARKET

700
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,602
SO GOOD COFFEE

701
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:36,481
We found evidence from the USB drive
inside the ring Il-yong gave us.

702
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:40,276
Noh Yoon-gu's smuggling routes, dates,

703
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,737
sales of organs, orders given, and such.

704
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:45,824
Kim Pil-jung must have kept it
as insurance.

705
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,868
Is that going to help Il-yong?

706
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,246
It's definite evidence,

707
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,706
so it will help him.

708
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,791
That's great.

709
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,843
Captain,

710
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,179
they found a lot of evidence
from Il-yong's ring.

711
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,100
They say he may be released early.

712
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,321
YANG OK-YEON
KIM JIN-AH

713
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,039
OH IL-YONG

714
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,999
Other people's things are all here

715
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,711
except for Il-yong's.

716
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,885
Bo-ra, your home is so nice.

717
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,012
-You chose a good one.
-Yes.

718
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,180
It's sunny too.

719
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,391
Thank you all for helping.

720
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,560
I'll treat you to black bean noodles.

721
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,854
What about sweet and sour pork, Mom?

722
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:01,941
I already ordered other dishes as well.

723
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,402
Then let's finish moving these and go eat.

724
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:12,786
What is it?

725
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,081
I want to talk to you.

726
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:18,500
About what?

727
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,045
You scare me whenever you say
you want to talk to me.

728
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,047
Did I do something wrong again?

729
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,964
No.

730
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,636
I just wanted to thank you
for all you did.

731
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,098
Come on.

732
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,350
Aren't we going to keep in touch?

733
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,062
I heard everything from Mom.

734
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,773
My real dad

735
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,776
ran away when he found out
that Mom got pregnant

736
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,237
and has never called once since then.

737
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:53,618
I'm sorry for insisting
that you were my dad

738
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,121
when you kept telling me that you weren't.

739
00:56:59,124 --> 00:56:59,999
And…

740
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,420
thank you for taking care of me

741
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,215
like I was your real daughter.

742
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,013
Who says?

743
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:16,641
Bo-ra,

744
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,353
you are my daughter.

745
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,192
Go ask your teachers and your friends.

746
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,195
They'll tell you that I'm your dad.

747
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,242
-I'll explain everything to--
-Bo-ra.

748
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,202
I'm…

749
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,374
really glad that you're my daughter.

750
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:43,751
And I am

751
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,131
very proud to be your dad.

752
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:54,846
In this world,

753
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,893
there are also dads and daughters like us.

754
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:05,440
Mr. Jang, Jong-a,

755
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,317
you, and me.

756
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,403
When we four lived together,

757
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,072
we were a family.

758
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,040
Thanks, Dad.

759
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,259
You can't have a boyfriend
until you graduate from high school.

760
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,512
Okay.

761
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,282
That dream again.

762
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,703
A merry-go-round?

763
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,546
Day 10,985.

764
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,382
It's winter again.

765
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,011
Mr. Jang and Wook

766
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:02,265
are still searching for the reason why

767
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,935
I'm still here.

768
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,481
It's strange

769
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,360
how you don't age or grow old here,

770
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,821
but time goes by

771
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,032
and seasons change.

772
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,702
Maybe because this village is a place

773
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,664
where some stay forever,
and some leave so easily.

774
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,668
Sweetie.

775
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,128
Be careful with that.

776
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,298
That belongs to Uncle Yoon-ho
who was here seven years ago.

777
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,387
Are you okay?

778
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,058
You're not hurt?

779
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,520
Some books fell.

780
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,647
Let's see.

781
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,027
This is Yoon-su's.

782
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,278
Captain.

783
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,280
We have to go.

784
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,616
You want to go when it's cold out?

785
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,306
Welcome.

786
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,641
Welcome.

787
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,441
What is this place?

788
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,319
It's a place where people live.

789
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,074
I cooked some
really delicious sweet potatoes.

790
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,160
The radish water kimchi
is also cooked just right.

791
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,412
If you eat them together…

792
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,373
Just thinking about it makes me drool.

793
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,708
I'm drooling too.

794
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,801
Anyway, every day here

795
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,971
begins with waiting

796
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,890
and ends with longing.

797
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,189
It's cold.

798
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,399
Come on in.

799
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,404
For anyone without exception.

800
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:27,034
Just like I've been doing
for the past 30 years.

801
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,375
How can flowers bloom right now?

802
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,139
PLEASE HELP WITH THE SEARCH
SO GOOD MISSING CHILDREN'S CAMPAIGN

803
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,266
-Thank you.
-Hello.

804
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,435
Please take a good look.

805
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:59,025
-Thank you.
-Your interest and help

806
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,027
-will be of big help to the families.
-Thank you.

807
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:01,986
-Hello.
-Here.

808
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,446
Thank you.

809
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,072
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

810
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,991
Please take a look at the child's face.

811
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,287
Please take a good look at the picture.

812
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,705
Thank you.

813
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,917
We're helping people
find missing children.

814
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,220
We're looking for missing people.

815
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:12,640
Excuse me!

816
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,058
Over here!

817
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,102
Check out the guy in front of me!

818
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,897
What's going on?

819
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:39,834
EMERGENCY ESCORT
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

820
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:53,681
Hello.

821
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,434
This is Shin Jun-ho.

822
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,612
Are you feeling better now
that you're paying for your sins?

823
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:12,533
Just because you're paying for your sins
doesn't mean they go away.

824
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,118
But I do feel lighthearted.

825
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,121
Or maybe not.

826
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,999
It's just so-so.

827
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,794
I'm glad that you're alive.

828
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:25,963
I'm happy.

829
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:30,217
But I still have a lot of things
I'd like to know.

830
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,345
Why…

831
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,598
you came to me.

832
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:39,393
Have you ever

833
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:42,980
gone for a ride on a merry-go-round?

834
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,984
Or maybe you've seen someone there.

835
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,155
No.

836
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,449
I've never been to an amusement park.

837
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:55,993
Is that so?

838
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,794
It's enough to see that you're doing okay.

839
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:12,927
Wook.

840
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,225
You can see this place

841
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,768
probably because of me, right?

842
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:24,730
You said that there are

843
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,525
no coincidences in this world.

844
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,531
Thank you for coming.

845
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:39,996
I'll be back.

846
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:55,928
Desperation…

847
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,931
always creates a miracle.

848
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,051
Noh Yoon-gu!

849
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,305
If we don't give up,

850
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:45,186
a world where bad acts
get rightfully punished will come.

851
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:08,626
NAME: KIM SANG-YEON

852
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:10,628
KIM SANG-YEON

853
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:17,051
-Hello.
-Hey.

854
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,514
What's she doing?

855
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:25,559
What's with her?

856
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:30,689
Who threw all these away?

857
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:35,820
The countless people
whose lives are unaccounted for

858
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,239
and that the world has forgotten.

859
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,943
They desperately wish

860
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,072
for someone to find them.

861
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,409
And that they won't be forgotten.

862
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:31,041
Central Korea will be foggy
with a visibility of less than 200m.

863
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,336
The fog will be thicker
on roads and bridges

864
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,673
near lakes and rivers.

865
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:41,844
So please drive safely.

866
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,709
And again, they were there…

867
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,340
on the other side.

868
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:33,854
Welcome.

869
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:34,999
