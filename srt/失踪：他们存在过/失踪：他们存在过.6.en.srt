1
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,619
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,747
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,467
This goes down smoothly,

4
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,641
but it feels fiery inside. I like it.

5
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,693
Let me tell you about this liquor.

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,522
When Chun-hyang and Mong-ryong parted,

7
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,066
Chun-hyang had her maid Hyang-dan
bring a bottle of this.

8
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,857
Mong-ryong drank it
and fell for Chun-hyang,

9
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,447
and ended up staying with her.

10
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,082
So Chun-hyang used this liquor
to seduce him?

11
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,747
When I was young,

12
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,924
my mother told me this story

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,460
as she made me sterilize the bottle
with burning straw.

14
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,594
Whenever I drink this liquor,
I'm reminded of my mother.

15
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,642
Now that I've had a glass

16
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,346
I'm reminded of my mom.

17
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,394
What was your mother like?

18
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,478
My mom?

19
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,231
My mom was…

20
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,407
Chan-ho is Sung Chan-ho
and Jin-hee is Jung Jin-hee.

21
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,989
Why am I Kim Wook?

22
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,789
- What do you mean by that?
- Their names are three syllables.

23
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,619
But mine is only two.

24
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,892
Why do you think
your name is two syllables?

25
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,876
You're not just Wook.
You are Sunshine Wook.

26
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,629
A person who brightens up the world.

27
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,678
Sunshine Wook.
It's more than two syllables!

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,550
Mine is the longest!

29
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,767
Of course! You're my son.
Aunt Su-yeon will be waiting.

30
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,849
Let's go!

31
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,734
<i>A person who brightens up the world.</i>

32
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,687
Sunshine…

33
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,264
<i>Gosh. He reeks of alcohol.</i>

34
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,426
You didn't give him a drink.
You showered him in alcohol.

35
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,009
He's a weaker drinker than he looks.

36
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,314
We drank the same amount,
but he passed out.

37
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,678
He shouldn't drink as much as you.
It will kill him!

38
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,305
Hey, wake up!

39
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,189
Damn, he's heavy. Hey!

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,400
You guys have gotten pretty close.

41
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,486
Don't just stand there
and talk like an old man. Give me a hand!

42
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,371
He's awake. Goodness, he's alive.

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,165
Hey!

44
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,251
Goodness!

45
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,923
My mom…

46
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,853
She left me when I was this little.

47
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,062
But she doesn't recognize me.

48
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,351
She says she came here
when I was about this big.

49
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,691
Then again,

50
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,895
I didn't recognize her either.
But how was I supposed to recognize her?

51
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:54,983
How could I?

52
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,028
She said she would come home soon.

53
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,033
Is this her home?

54
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,254
Is this home?

55
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,776
You're still suffering from a hangover

56
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,951
when you had a whole pot
of dried pollack soup?

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,490
I'll sober up eventually.

58
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,536
How long have you been living here?

59
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:55,043
- About ten years.
- Are there any people who came before you?

60
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,048
Yes. You know Detective Park, right?

61
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,630
He and his wife have been here
for over 20 years.

62
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,724
Then did those two meet here
or come together?

63
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,468
They met here.

64
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,848
They came around the same time
and have been here for so long.

65
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,646
They relied on each other, got along well,

66
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,071
and were on the same wavelength,
so they decided to stay together.

67
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,651
Why didn't you find their bodies?

68
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,447
It's not that I didn't. I couldn't.

69
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,454
I went to their neighborhoods
and where they worked,

70
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:30,163
but found nothing.
They don't know who killed them or why.

71
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,293
Plus, it's been so long.

72
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,711
But why are you asking so many questions?

73
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,969
I was just curious.

74
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:45,179
Well, the house where Jun-su's mom
used to live now belongs to someone else.

75
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,851
The old landlady moved out.

76
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,429
She's famous. She's even on TV these days.

77
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,272
- Famous?
- The chairwoman of Choiseung Construction.

78
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:00,279
Do you know everyone's story
inside and out?

79
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,279
I don't know all the details.
I just know enough.

80
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,912
Let's work together next time.

81
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,657
I'll help you look for their bodies.

82
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,495
Did Thomas spike your alcohol?

83
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,964
- You said it was bothersome.
- Of course. It still is.

84
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,881
But there's something
that goes beyond that.

85
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,264
I have this sense of justice right here.

86
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,762
- Do you see it?
- What?

87
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,843
It's useless…

88
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,470
Anyway,

89
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,138
where is the chairwoman's house
that Jun-su's mom used to work at?

90
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,583
Hey, Jong-a.
Can you look up someone for me?

91
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,791
Chairwoman Han Yeo-hui
of Choiseung Construction.

92
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,089
{\an8}Chairwoman Han!
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

93
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
{\an8}Chairwoman Han!

94
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:15,305
{\an8}- I told you not to call any reporters.
- I'm sorry. I did tell the PR team.

95
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:19,233
{\an8}- This event is not open to the public.
- Is the rumor about your will true?

96
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,283
{\an8}<i>There's a charity event at 3:00 p.m.</i>

97
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,461
{\an8}<i>It's a children's home that the company
has been sponsoring for ten years.</i>

98
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,895
{\an8}<i>The event is closed to the public.</i>

99
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,357
{\an8}Chairwoman Han! Let me go.

100
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,119
{\an8}Can we talk?

101
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,576
{\an8}Okay, fine. Give me a moment.

102
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,794
{\an8}You remember my mother, don't you?

103
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,081
She lived in your house 27 years ago.

104
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,211
Kim Hyeon-mi.

105
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,983
I don't know what you're talking about.

106
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,401
The children have been looking forward
to this day for a long time.

107
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,820
Don't you think it's really rude
to barge in here without an appointment

108
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,242
and rob them of their time?

109
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,198
Come, children.

110
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:28,593
So your mother worked
at Chairwoman Han's house 27 years ago?

111
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,351
Right, she worked there.

112
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,522
I vaguely remember.

113
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,517
But you said you grew up
in a children's home.

114
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,693
That was after my mom left me.

115
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,896
So what, you're looking for your mom?

116
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,155
Pretty much.

117
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,037
By the way,
why are you speaking casually to me?

118
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,707
What's wrong with you?

119
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm a sociable person.

120
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,459
If it feels unfair, you can do the same.

121
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,300
I don't ask people to use honorifics
just because I'm older,

122
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,095
or criticize them for not being polite.
I'm open-minded enough not to do that.

123
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,824
- Hello?
- Mr. Jang, what are you doing today?

124
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,700
What's taking him so long?

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,500
- Mr. Jang!
- Why did you ask me to come?

126
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,296
Let me cash in the favor you owe me.

127
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,339
The ledger is up on the screen.
If a client comes, check the item,

128
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,434
then give them cash or do a wire transfer,
whichever they ask for.

129
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,510
Make sure to get the contract
and a copy of their ID. Easy, right?

130
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,347
No, I didn't get any of that.

131
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,682
Call me if you have questions.
I'll tell you then.

132
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,348
I'll pay you minimum wage.
I'll be back before evening.

133
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,978
So what exactly do you want me to do?

134
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,025
Ms. Lee!

135
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,704
There's no evidence to connect
Jang Myeong-gyu and Kim Nam-guk.

136
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,910
Stop investigating their cases for now
and help Detective Kang's case.

137
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,333
I can't do that, sir.

138
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,621
These guys are meticulous.

139
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,914
They made the suspects
disappear without a trace.

140
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:24,918
If I have more time,

141
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,589
I'll find the connection
and the people behind them.

142
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,338
It's still just a hit-and-run
that no one cares about.

143
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,801
You must give me something
so that I can talk to the higher-ups.

144
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,677
Yes.

145
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,638
Yes, sir.

146
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,432
Okay.

147
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,386
Hey, Detective Shin.
The Chief wants to see you.

148
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,985
Have a seat here.

149
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,665
So you're in charge of the mugging
and the hit-and-run cases.

150
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,751
That's right.

151
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,091
This is Mr. Lee Dong-min
from Choiseung Construction.

152
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,512
He has some questions about the cases.

153
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,931
Both investigations are still ongoing.

154
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,927
Why are you curious about them?

155
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,722
It's not me.
Chairwoman Han is curious about them.

156
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,394
She recently heard about an accident

157
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,516
after visiting a few children's homes
and felt sorry for the victims.

158
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,027
I need to head to headquarters,

159
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,399
so talk with Detective Shin.

160
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,315
Sir, ongoing cases are confidential.
I can't share...

161
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,905
I'm sure you have questions too,

162
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,033
don't you?

163
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,832
I'll leave it to you two.

164
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,223
- How do you know the Chief?
- We went to the same school.

165
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,640
Don't worry. There was no bribery
or illegal transaction involved.

166
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,390
Why does Chairwoman Han
want to know about these cases?

167
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,694
Chairwoman Han is looking for someone.

168
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,401
She doesn't have many leads,
due to lack of information.

169
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,275
Then she happened to hear
about an accident.

170
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,860
- So she wants to confirm something.
- Oh.

171
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,568
So the rumors must be true.

172
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,737
I heard she's planning to give
her shares to the grandchild.

173
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,169
Jang Myeong-gyu was mugged

174
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,711
and Kim Nam-guk died
in a hit-and-run accident.

175
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,916
There's no link between the two cases,

176
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,797
so they'll be closed soon.

177
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,224
If you want, I can let you take a look.

178
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,363
<i>Please keep the content of her will
regarding her grandchild to yourself.</i>

179
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,273
<i>Although when the time comes,
everyone will find out.</i>

180
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,505
CHOISEUNG CONSTRUCTION
LEE DONG-MIN

181
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,159
<i>Let's close these cases now.</i>

182
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,761
- I won again!
- I lost again…

183
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,634
Big brother!

184
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,637
Do you have to shoot it to spin it?
Instead of using your hands?

185
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:34,194
This is Jun-su's. He's the best player.
Jun-su always wins.

186
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,981
Jun-su, can I have a go?

187
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,500
- What? Is this broken?
- That's not how you do it.

188
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,759
Do it like this. This is how you play.

189
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:04,218
Gosh, you're really good, Jun-su!
You're an expert.

190
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,011
Jun-su, when I was little,

191
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,017
I used a stick to spin the top.

192
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,270
- What kind of stick?
- What kind?

193
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:20,694
A stick with a string attached at the end.
You use it to slap the top.

194
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,856
You keep slapping it and when
it's about to fall, you slap it again.

195
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,700
And later, when it's about to fall,
you slap it like this again.

196
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:35,168
It would be beautiful
if the walls of Café Hawaii sparkled.

197
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,299
I can't imagine that.
The walls aren't blank canvases.

198
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,668
How can we make that happen?

199
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,554
- There is a way.
- What's that?

200
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,009
I saw something useful
in Thomas's storage room.

201
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,682
I think we'll be able to
make your idea work.

202
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,143
To make the walls sparkle,

203
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,848
Mr. Jang and I will probably
end up with colorful bruises.

204
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,515
What bruises?

205
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,979
Is there another bad guy in the village?

206
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,067
Hey.

207
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,284
He's the cute guy.

208
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,072
You should join us this year.

209
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,656
The men do all the physical work
on Memory Day.

210
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,742
Memory Day?

211
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,624
What's that?

212
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,463
It's an event that
takes place once a year.

213
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,749
Like a holiday.
Wook, you want an iced America no, right?

214
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,754
Yes, with an extra shot.

215
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,548
Is your name Wook?

216
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,267
What's your full name?

217
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,558
It's Choi Wook.

218
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,779
How old are you?

219
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,359
I'm 30.

220
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,827
He's handsome,
but he's not younger than he looks.

221
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:01,963
Where's Thomas?

222
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,174
He went to the storage room
to work on something.

223
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,514
Can you bring the coffee to the room?

224
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,605
Did you make this yourself?

225
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,530
It might sound like bragging,

226
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,398
but I made most
of the furniture at the café.

227
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,526
Goodness.

228
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,073
Since you're already bragging,

229
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,662
can you make something for me?

230
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,243
Sure.

231
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,161
But nothing comes for free in life.

232
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,247
You really are a businessman.

233
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,383
Do me a favor too, brother.

234
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,380
Sure. What is it?

235
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,797
Smart phones, tablets…

236
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:54,428
People used to pawn their gold teeth,
but I guess times have changed.

237
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,892
Hello.

238
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,651
This place looks different.

239
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,149
Or is the owner someone else?

240
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,950
Do you want to pawn something?

241
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,989
No, I'm not here for that.

242
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,952
Are you the owner?

243
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,038
Yes, I'm the owner.

244
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,054
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,755
Gosh, what a nice pawnshop.

246
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,136
You made a lot of money.

247
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,645
Ms. Lee, where are you?

248
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,355
I think you should come back right now.

249
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,952
You want to make this place like this?
Just like in the drawing?

250
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,619
Just the thought of it
makes me happy already.

251
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,908
This isn't like any other house parties
I had before.

252
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,460
See? We have to do everything
to make it happen.

253
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,464
No wonder you end up with bruises.

254
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,134
I'm hungry. Should we eat something?

255
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,928
Sounds nice. What should we eat?

256
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,891
- Instant noodles…
- Instant noodles, of course.

257
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,982
Okay, I'll cook it.

258
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,139
I'm going to add eggs.
What else do you want?

259
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,938
- Put some bean sprouts on the bottom.
- Some bean sprouts…

260
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,215
I had a lot to drink last night,
so I need some aspartic acid.

261
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,988
Then I'll go and boil the water.

262
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,989
I'll go with you.

263
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,790
I should go home and bring a tape measure.

264
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,962
Come back before
the instant noodles get soggy!

265
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,434
Instant noodles taste best
with bean sprouts.

266
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,022
Mr. Jang?

267
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,649
What? Did he leave the repeater on?

268
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,913
Damn, he's so careless.

269
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,159
How is he going to protect
the village this way?

270
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:24,655
<i>Some strange men dropped by the pawnshop.
They had a Yanbian accent.</i>

271
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,166
<i>You said the guys who killed
your friend had the same accent.</i>

272
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,669
<i>Come to the pawnshop
as soon as you read this message.</i>

273
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,592
{\an8}SO GOOD PAWNSHOP

274
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,172
Jong-a.

275
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,099
Relax. We're all fine.

276
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,760
I had to go somewhere for a while,

277
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,848
so Mr. Jang was by himself
when they came by.

278
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,313
I'm checking the CCTV footage.

279
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,307
Okay. Detective Shin is on his way too.

280
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,478
There he is.

281
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,570
Wait a second.

282
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,994
I think I've seen him somewhere.

283
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,204
He was in front of
the cold storage warehouse.

284
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,995
- Right?
- What did he say to you?

285
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,869
He scanned me up and down

286
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,707
and asked if I was the owner,
so I said yes.

287
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,712
He gave off a bad vibe,
so I said I was the owner.

288
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,505
I was worried he might try
to harm Ms. Lee.

289
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,684
The fact that he knows
the owner has changed means

290
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,007
he knows who Kim Nam-guk is.

291
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,635
The car Nam-guk's killers were driving
stopped by the cold storage warehouse.

292
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,272
Send this footage to me.

293
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,063
- Where are you going? I'll come with you.
- No, stay here.

294
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,707
The police will get things done faster.

295
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,281
He's right.
It'll be dangerous if you get involved.

296
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,821
But why did they come here
when Nam-guk is gone?

297
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,372
- No way.
- Did they come for you?

298
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,289
It looks that way.

299
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,372
What do we do, Wook?

300
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,794
No worries.
A cop has just gone to arrest them.

301
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,746
And a fortune-teller told me
that I'll live for a long time.

302
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,506
Wait.

303
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:06,767
What's going on between the two of you?
Jong-a, you left the pawnshop.

304
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,678
When did you start working here part-time?

305
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,137
We had our reasons. I'll tell you later.

306
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,650
ILGONG COLD STORAGE

307
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,943
- I heard you asked for a transfer.
- That's right.

308
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,027
Just take a few days off
and look for Yeo-na.

309
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,573
The Violent Crimes Unit can do...

310
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,009
What happened to Jang Myeong-gyu
and Kim Nam-guk wasn't an accident.

311
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,333
- I'm sure Yeo-na is also...
- Who the hell are you?

312
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,380
- We're the police.
- I can't see because it's too dark.

313
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,126
What brings the police here?

314
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,884
- We have some questions to ask.
- Go ahead.

315
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,100
Gosh, I can't see you
because it's too dark.

316
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,727
Let's go somewhere with better lighting.

317
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,775
<i>I'm sorry about this.</i>

318
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:08,702
There are some noisy gangsters outside.
This is the only bright and quiet place.

319
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,245
You're just here as a witness,
so don't worry too much.

320
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,867
All right. It's fine.

321
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,043
By any chance,

322
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,257
do you know these people?

323
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,416
I've never seen them before.

324
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,468
What about these people?

325
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:33,268
I know them. Where are they now?
They used to work at our factory.

326
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,311
They just went off the grid
and disappeared.

327
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:39,105
- I can't get a hold of them.
- What did they do?

328
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,571
They did deliveries, collected money,
and sometimes did manual labor.

329
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,242
A bit of this and that.
Did they cause trouble?

330
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,775
Why did you go to
a pawnshop this afternoon?

331
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:56,921
- Going to a pawnshop is not illegal.
- Of course not.

332
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,505
<i>I have to deal with all sorts of things</i>

333
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,052
as I work with Yanbian people.

334
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,215
I went there to find
some guys who disappeared.

335
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,934
I was there for the same reason as you.
To catch these men.

336
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,105
Have you seen this woman?

337
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,278
I can name all 70 employees
at our factory,

338
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,069
but I've never seen her before.

339
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,077
Thanks for your cooperation.

340
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,293
- I'm going to get going.
- Okay.

341
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,487
What did he say? Is he the one who
ordered to have Nam-guk killed?

342
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,971
Why did he come to the pawnshop?

343
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,524
The guys who fled to China
are his employees.

344
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:57,482
They went off the grid,
so he went there to find them.

345
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,941
That's ridiculous.
Nam-guk's never even seen them before,

346
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,442
but he went there to look for them?
That makes no sense.

347
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,566
I'm sure he's lying,

348
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,741
but I let him go for now.

349
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,122
He needs to roam around feeling safe
so that we can find a lead.

350
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,040
The guy who killed Nam-guk…
I'm going to catch him.

351
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,705
- Don't do anything stupid.
- I'll set a trap.

352
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,174
So just come and arrest him.

353
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:29,264
Illegal evidence is invalid.
Don't cause trouble by getting involved.

354
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,852
- Just stay put.
- Aren't you going to find Choi Yeo-na?

355
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,215
- What do you mean?
- You asked me if I saw her.

356
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,308
Did you see Yeo-na?

357
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,307
- Where?
- When I got kidnapped.

358
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,230
They were forcing a woman into their car.

359
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,608
I yelled at them to stop
and took some pictures of them.

360
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:54,027
That's why they chased after me
and even abducted me.

361
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,947
And you're telling me this just now?

362
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Are you sure you saw Yeo-na?
Answer me, you jerk!

363
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,837
Why didn't you tell me
when I asked you before?

364
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,730
If we get Manager Wang,

365
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,273
we can find Choi Yeo-na too.

366
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,315
There's no evidence! None!

367
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,656
I'll get it done.

368
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,575
I'm going to catch him no matter what.

369
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,366
And I'll find her too.

370
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,808
- Are you sure you saw Yeo-na here?
- Yes.

371
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,231
- What time was it?
- It was before I got hit by your car.

372
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,105
So around noon?

373
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,233
I was walking out of the market

374
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,649
when I heard something over there.

375
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,065
<i>Please help!</i>

376
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,113
<i>Help me!</i>

377
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,621
So I was over there taking photos
and the car was right here.

378
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,787
Yes, this is the place.

379
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:28,003
This place is far from Yeo-na's house
and she didn't even come here often.

380
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,666
Maybe she got kidnapped

381
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,674
and tried to run away
when the car stopped.

382
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,926
When the car stopped, I ran away.

383
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,347
And then they caught me again.
Next, I was here.

384
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,753
I'll get going first.

385
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,997
Wait a second.

386
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,251
I have something to show you.

387
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,545
Come this way.

388
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,368
Have a seat.

389
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,698
- What is this?
- I made it for you, Yeo-na.

390
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,285
You made it yourself?

391
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,075
So this is what you've been working on?

392
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,666
It's your personal chair.

393
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,045
What for?

394
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,718
- Why did you put this here?
- So that you can sit here and wait.

395
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,258
- Wait for what?
- I know why you wanted to work here.

396
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,887
To wait for the gate to open.

397
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,648
- You knew all long?
- I gave up hope a long time ago.

398
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,613
But I can't force you to give it up too.

399
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,531
Thank you.

400
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,581
<i>Yu-ji-ja sa-gyeong-seong.</i>

401
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,949
"When there's a will, there's a way."

402
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,920
I hope you find a way.

403
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,998
I'm going to make it happen.

404
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,670
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

405
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,093
This missing person's name is Jang-mi.

406
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:45,007
She was working at an adult establishment
and suddenly disappeared a year ago.

407
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,308
What? She disappeared a year ago,
but they only reported it now?

408
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,153
- Well, many barmaids quit without notice.
- So why did they report it now?

409
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,527
The female body we found
a few days ago was identified as

410
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,738
Lee Ji-hye, who worked at the same place.

411
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,779
She was close to Jang-mi,
who's currently missing.

412
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,863
Who reported it?

413
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,717
- The manager of the establishment.
- Detective Park.

414
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,451
- Yes.
- You and Detective Baek take this case.

415
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,956
What? You know
I'm looking for Choi Yeo-na now.

416
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,369
I don't even have time to eat

417
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,998
as I'm busy looking up
sex offenders in her neighborhood.

418
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,665
I know. And you have my full support.

419
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,876
Keep helping Detective Shin with that.

420
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:24,636
Just think of this one as a long-term case
and work with Detective Park.

421
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,311
Hey. Why don't you pay me double
when you give me double the work?

422
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,811
Why are you complaining to me
about your salary?

423
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,439
- What's going on?
- You actually came.

424
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,489
Your boss called me.
You asked for a transfer?

425
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,608
Are you serious?

426
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,655
He asked me to change your mind,

427
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,370
but I have no intention of doing that.

428
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,121
That's right.

429
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,213
Why reject a talented detective
who came willingly?

430
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,288
That would be rude.

431
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,787
- Where should I put this?
- Over here.

432
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,626
Right here. You can use this desk.

433
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,050
I came to look for Yeo-na.

434
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:10,176
Of course you should find a missing person
at the Missing Persons Team.

435
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,556
Right. Thank you, sir.

436
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,230
Welcome to the team.
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

437
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,493
Why are you in a daze?

438
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,660
Jeez, what are you wearing?

439
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,918
I went up the mountain
to check on the bees.

440
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,959
Gosh, it's awfully hot.
Give me some water.

441
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,714
Goodness.

442
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,051
Here you go.

443
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,221
Did you do something?
Why are you so obedient all of a sudden?

444
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,166
Why are you wearing black
when it's scorching outside?

445
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,320
- Are you going somewhere?
- To see Manager Wang.

446
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,361
Do you have a death wish?

447
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,405
Why go see someone
who's dying to catch you?

448
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,123
Isn't it obvious?
I must catch Manager Wang

449
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,541
to avenge Nam-guk and find Yeo-na.

450
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,620
I'll come with you.
You can't catch him all by yourself.

451
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,747
- Wait. I'll get changed.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

452
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,165
I'm just doing a preliminary survey today.

453
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,375
Hey, wait.

454
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,223
My goodness. What now?

455
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,557
RESTRICTED NUMBER

456
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,821
<i>Wang Myeong-cheol?</i>

457
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,450
<i>Should I call you Manager Wang?</i>

458
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,414
<i>I see you're desperately looking for me.</i>

459
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,042
Call me whatever you want.
You'll soon be dead anyway.

460
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,301
<i>I know you killed Nam-guk
and Jang Myeong-gyu.</i>

461
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,799
<i>You killed Choi Yeo-na too, right?</i>

462
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:10,721
- There's no evidence I did those things.
- <i>Choi Yeo-na told me herself.</i>

463
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,013
<i>Someone rang the doorbell,</i>

464
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,991
<i>so she opened the door,
thinking it was a delivery.</i>

465
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,425
<i>But your underlings were
standing outside instead.</i>

466
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,687
Are you out of your mind?

467
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,856
Did a dead woman talk to you herself?

468
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,109
<i>Yes.</i>

469
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,860
<i>I have that kind of power.</i>

470
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,741
I'm going to find her body.

471
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,988
You can't cover up your murder

472
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,910
by simply taking away my phone.

473
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,205
This will only end if you die.

474
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,498
Or…

475
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,625
If you die.

476
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,709
What did you say, you bastard?
Where are you now?

477
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,256
<i>Don't yell.</i>

478
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:50,506
What if you have a heart attack
because your blood pressure spikes?

479
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,513
That would be a painless death.

480
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:56,095
You must pay for your crimes.

481
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,352
What can a loser like you do?

482
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:02,398
<i>I'm sure you're looking forward to
seeing how I'll catch you.</i>

483
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,072
<i>While you wait, try to imagine</i>

484
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:10,864
how scary and distressing
it must've been for Nam-guk.

485
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:15,244
I'll at least make your death
more painful than his.

486
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,580
Go easy on the food and head home.

487
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,933
"Year 1993, M to J." Is this it?

488
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,636
- It looks like it.
- Yes, this is it.

489
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,096
When I was just a rookie,

490
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,266
there was this senior
who rode high like you.

491
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,404
He was good at his job
and had a nasty temper.

492
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,116
Oh, here it is.

493
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,949
REDEVELOPMENT CORRUPTION CASES

494
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,616
He investigated corruption
in redevelopment.

495
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,615
CHOISEUNG CONSTRUCTION
CORRUPTION CASE

496
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,997
It's Choiseung Construction.

497
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:13,088
Chairwoman Han's daughter Kim Su-yeon.
She fell to her death at home?

498
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,466
She became disabled due to a car accident.

499
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,893
She fell when she was alone
and hurt her head badly.

500
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,392
The cause of death was excessive bleeding.

501
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,478
Where's Detective Park,
the one who investigated the case?

502
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,105
He vanished during that investigation.

503
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,112
What?

504
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,783
Like I said,
he just vanished without a trace.

505
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,114
Here.

506
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,242
I joined the Missing Persons Team
to find Detective Park.

507
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,658
It was my first case.

508
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,803
Is Detective Park's disappearance
connected to Choiseung Construction?

509
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,708
They said they'd never seen him.

510
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,797
The case was closed because
there was no evidence.

511
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,100
But it is still an ongoing case for me.

512
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,726
I don't know how Choiseung Construction
is related to your case,

513
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,770
but if the chairwoman's daughter
is linked to it, refer to that.

514
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,273
It might help you.

515
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,156
If this was in 1993…

516
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,080
It was 27 years ago…

517
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:27,165
<i>So your mother worked
at Chairwoman Han's house 27 years ago?</i>

518
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,002
<i>Right, she worked there.
I vaguely remember.</i>

519
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,300
What the hell is going on
with these cases?

520
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,425
ILGONG COLD STORAGE

521
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,972
<i>Ilgong Cold Storage
is a food distribution company.</i>

522
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:46,773
They distribute livestock products
and provide cold storage services.

523
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:50,063
<i>Their sales keep rising
and they have no tax issues at all.</i>

524
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,193
That's how it looks on the outside,
but they had issues with power trips

525
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,777
and changing labels.

526
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,032
The men who came here the other day
weren't Ilgong employees.

527
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,525
I think Manager Wang
personally hired them.

528
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,367
Can you hack the security system?

529
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,750
- What will you do after picking the lock?
- I'll start by taunting them.

530
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,665
Right. You're an expert at that.

531
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,723
Come on, that's not true.

532
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,513
- What do you get from taunting them?
- Time.

533
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,017
Manager Wang came
all the way here to catch me.

534
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:29,269
He completely trashed my place.
I can't live my life

535
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,863
because I have to avoid him.
I'll tie him down first.

536
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:38,244
- Then buy some time to freely move around.
- What if he gets back at you?

537
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,621
I won't give him the chance.
I'm going to constantly harass him

538
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,719
until I find concrete evidence
to give to the police.

539
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,453
I like the idea,

540
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,161
but what is the plan?

541
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,377
Maybe this is going too far, but…

542
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,168
ILGONG COLD STORAGE

543
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,391
This is the blind spot.

544
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,561
I tweaked the cameras to automatically
keep playing the recorded footage.

545
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,018
And I just unlocked the entrances.
Let's go.

546
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,541
Stick them on top of the original labels
and make sure they're visible.

547
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,048
Gosh, I can't believe
I'm switching the labels.

548
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:42,681
Article Six of the Act on Origin Labeling
of Agricultural and Fishery Products.

549
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,600
Don't falsely label the place of origin.

550
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,601
If you violate this, you must either
serve up to seven years in prison

551
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,983
or pay a fine of up to 100 million won.

552
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,650
Mr. Jang, it looks like
you're a pro at this.

553
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,610
- Did you work as a part-time packer too?
- Part-time?

554
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,646
There were no part-timers at my company.
Everyone was full-time.

555
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,567
Why did you quit such a good job?

556
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,502
They must've figured out that the cameras
are playing the same footage.

557
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,288
We should wrap this up and get out.

558
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,372
Okay.

559
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,931
What? I can't come in?

560
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,483
You've been sewing.
You're making an outfit for tomorrow.

561
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,565
Right.

562
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,240
- What happened to that thing I asked for?
- What about you? Did you do what I asked?

563
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,121
- Did it go well?
- Of course. It went well.

564
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,745
Here you go.

565
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,666
- Not bad.
- I wish I was bad at something.

566
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,251
You're terrible at drawing.

567
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,378
See you tomorrow.

568
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:10,055
Mr. Jang, this makes no sense.
There's been no trace of her for 27 years.

569
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,389
How is that possible?

570
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:15,564
A lot of things in this world
don't make sense. I'm not surprised.

571
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:20,404
Eat up before your food gets cold.
Can I order another dish after this?

572
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,693
Since you're buying today?

573
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,486
Order anything you want,
so that you'll feel indebted to me.

574
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,703
But Wook doesn't even want to know
where his mother is.

575
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,793
He even told me not to find her.
So I'm going to give up.

576
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,326
Ms. Kim Hyeon-mi.
Born on October 25th, 1957.

577
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,583
Where on earth are you?

578
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,045
Who?

579
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,222
Kim Hyeon-mi?

580
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,894
Is that the name of Wook's mother?

581
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,258
Born in 1957?

582
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,813
Yes.

583
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,679
I used to be a civil servant,

584
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,886
so I have a habit of always stating
someone's name and date of birth.

585
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,145
She left me when I was this little.

586
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,775
But she doesn't recognize me.

587
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,989
<i>That's why he said that. I get it now.</i>

588
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,500
Mr. Jang, are you all right?
Do you have an upset stomach?

589
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,587
You should have eaten slowly.
Drink some water.

590
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,296
My goodness.

591
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,409
<i>Where should I put this?</i>

592
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,619
I already got all the pieces.

593
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,410
Why are you here? You didn't even call.

594
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,958
You're in your uniform today.

595
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,462
You look hot.

596
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,876
Get changed. Let's go on a date.

597
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,891
Wait here. I'll be quick.

598
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,311
Is summer sweet? No way.

599
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,316
- <i>Dragon's Breath.</i>
- Isn't it fun?

600
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,497
All of the pieces here represent food.
Come here.

601
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:51,342
<i>Sweet Summer</i> is a watermelon.
<i>Happy Birthday </i>over there is seaweed.

602
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,836
This is my favorite piece.

603
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,635
Choi Yeo-na.

604
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,722
What?

605
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:02,345
I don't care where or how you grew up.

606
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,436
I don't care about your past.

607
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,977
I don't need anything else.

608
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,777
I only need you

609
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,154
to come to me.

610
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,951
That's what Bernard Buffet said.

611
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,037
Well…

612
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,036
I practiced a lot

613
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:28,594
so I could propose
to you like your favorite painter.

614
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:33,761
Are you proposing to me?

615
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:37,432
Well, I was going to take you
to a fancy restaurant and surprise you,

616
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,350
but you looked so beautiful that
I blurted out what I memorized.

617
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,229
I ruined it.

618
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,821
I didn't know the mighty Shin Jun-ho
could get nervous too.

619
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,812
This is a necklace that my mom
gave me when I was young.

620
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,994
I've been saving it until the proposal.

621
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,250
It's beautiful.

622
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,471
I will protect you
for the rest of your life.

623
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,177
Will you marry me?

624
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,519
Yes.

625
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,803
Come here. Gosh, okay!

626
00:43:56,258 --> 00:44:01,308
Come on.
This is not right! What's all this?

627
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,223
Done!

628
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,309
Lighten up!

629
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,071
- I'm coming!
- This is too tight.

630
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,225
What's taking you so long?

631
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,534
I'm coming!

632
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:21,532
Why are we dressing up anyway?
It's a party for the dead.

633
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,504
Just for the mood.
It doesn't matter if you're dead or alive.

634
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,964
- How do I look?
- Well, not as good as me.

635
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,174
But not bad.

636
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,173
Let's go. They must be waiting for us.

637
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:46,016
Let's go see Jun-su.
We'll eat delicious food and have fun too.

638
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,350
Okay.

639
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,107
- How ironic.
- What?

640
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:58,031
They look so happy
despite their sad situation.

641
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,569
Of course they're happy.
They shouldn't have to feel sad here.

642
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,407
I didn't say it was a bad thing.

643
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,122
I'm glad to see them so happy.
You should let me finish.

644
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,203
Why are you mad at me?

645
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,122
Big brother!

646
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,052
What are you today? I'm a traffic light.

647
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,259
Me?

648
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,721
- I'm a cool guy.
- I see.

649
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,680
I'm a cooler guy, right?

650
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,514
Yes.

651
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,514
Jun-su.

652
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,308
Ta-da!

653
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,316
- This is a wooden top.
- Is that a real top?

654
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,939
Of course! Take a closer look.

655
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,409
Gosh. I used to be very good
at this when I was little.

656
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,834
- Would you like to try it?
- Yes!

657
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,253
When I spin it, you slap it. Okay?

658
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,625
- You can have it.
- For real?

659
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,426
You could say I made this for you myself.

660
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:09,101
Jun-su, I'll take a nice photo of you.
Go and sit on the slide.

661
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,773
- I want to be in it too.
- Sure.

662
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,766
- Sit down, Beom-su.
- Okay.

663
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,355
How cute. Smile.

664
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,493
Can you move a bit to the side?
Yes, right there.

665
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,333
One, two, three!

666
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,446
Detective Park, let's take a picture.

667
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,117
Look over here.

668
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,164
Come on, look!

669
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,174
That's it, yes!

670
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,472
What use is all this?

671
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,892
No one on the outside knows

672
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,814
we're doing all this.

673
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,893
No.

674
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,811
But that's all the more reason to do this.

675
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:03,529
There's a saying.
"The dead move further and further away,"

676
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,869
but as long as we remember each other,
we will remain

677
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,408
"either in their memories or ours."

678
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,128
That's what they all wish right now.

679
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,927
Oh, right. Can I borrow the photos?

680
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,351
What are you going to do with them?

681
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:33,975
I'll tell you later.

682
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,290
It's so cool! It's amazing!

683
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,715
This is what he was making with
a sewing machine every night?

684
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,640
Thomas is really something.

685
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,060
- His 100 years were worth it.
- Jun-su, would you like to go for a ride?

686
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,100
The big balloon will take you
up to the sky.

687
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,309
- I'm scared.
- I'd like to go for a ride!

688
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,358
Yeo-na, you should join too!

689
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,574
What? Are you favoring her
because she's your employee?

690
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,993
- Come with me.
- It's okay. I'm afraid of heights.

691
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,822
Everybody go on and have fun!

692
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,656
Where did Wook go?

693
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,554
Detective Shin!

694
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,064
You came just in time.

695
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,854
Why do you keep asking me
to come to see you?

696
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,227
The roads here are terrible.

697
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,984
Sorry for calling you here
when I know you're busy.

698
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,526
Detective Shin. You and Yeo-na are
in a special relationship, right?

699
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:13,493
- We're going to get married.
- Right. You told me the wedding is soon.

700
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,197
You must miss her a lot.

701
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,286
Of course I miss her.

702
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,475
Did you call me here just to say that?
I'm swamped with work.

703
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,789
Of course not!

704
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:27,206
You went to meet the chairwoman
of Choiseung Construction the other day.

705
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,304
Did you find out anything?

706
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:34,223
Your mom worked at Chairwoman Han's house
27 years ago, right? In 1993.

707
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,314
Yes.

708
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:41,309
Chairwoman Han had a daughter
named Kim Su-yeon who died 27 years ago.

709
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,605
She died around the time your mother left.

710
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,939
Kim Su-yeon?

711
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,482
Aunt Su-yeon will be waiting.

712
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,817
<i>Go see what Aunt Su-yeon is doing.</i>

713
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,855
Aunt Su-yeon…

714
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,658
Do you know her?

715
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:00,120
- Do you remember anything?
- No. It's just her name sounds familiar.

716
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,915
Detective Shin, stay right here.

717
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,763
I need to go get something
from Mr. Jang's house.

718
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,510
Stay right here.

719
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,679
Here. Play with this.

720
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:19,642
Just give me ten minutes. No, five.
Don't go anywhere, okay?

721
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,055
What do you need to get?

722
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,115
I never thought I'd get to fly.

723
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,371
Thanks, Thomas.
I never even got to ride a plane.

724
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,035
- I've never even seen a plane.
- What? That's nonsense.

725
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,995
- Have you been on a plane before?
- Of course I have.

726
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,796
When I went on a backpacking trip
to Europe and Jeju Island.

727
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,761
Hey, it's big bro's friend.

728
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,428
- What?
- Over there.

729
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,515
Jun-ho.

730
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,021
Jun-ho!

731
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,226
Shin Jun-ho!

732
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,991
He's Jun-ho. My fiancé!

733
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,909
- Jun-ho!
- Jun-ho!

734
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:18,198
Over here! I'm right here!

735
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,367
Jun-ho!

736
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,249
Jun-ho, I'm over here!

737
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,832
Jun-ho!

738
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,056
Jun-ho…

739
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,731
He came…

740
00:51:56,696 --> 00:52:00,276
You came to see me, right?

741
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,471
So what do you need from me?

742
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:29,228
- Please bring Yeo-na's boyfriend here.
- Detective Shin? To here?

743
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,272
Just to a place
where Yeo-na can see him from afar.

744
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:35,687
- Why? What for?
- It's a special day.

745
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,697
A day to remember someone
and to be remembered.

746
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,793
I think it'd be nice to make
her dreams come true.

747
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,529
Are you ready?

748
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,786
Will you please just wait?
I'm working on it.

749
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,330
Why won't it work? Is it broken?

750
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,633
- What's going on?
- Turn it on already!

751
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,844
All right, it's ready now!

752
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,838
- One.
- Two, three!

753
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,756
It looks amazing!

754
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,182
It's so beautiful!

755
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:49,767
Red!

756
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,270
Green!

757
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,356
My whole body aches.

758
00:53:56,441 --> 00:54:00,491
Detective Park made us do all the work
while he's out there having fun.

759
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,534
Traitor.

760
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:18,419
- This place is starting to change.
- You're right.

761
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,256
How was the hot air balloon? Was it nice?

762
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,102
Yes, it felt like I was flying.

763
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,064
All thanks to Thomas.

764
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,194
It was like a miracle.

765
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:44,605
I wish I could see him just once.

766
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,034
If that happens,

767
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,370
I'd have nothing more to ask for.

768
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,628
My son…

769
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,140
Hey, Wook.

770
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,978
Can you give me a hand?

771
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,516
Of course. What is it?

772
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,653
- Does this look okay?
- Yes, it's perfect.

773
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,992
Are you going to play a movie?

774
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:35,326
No, not a movie. But I want to play that.

775
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:39,625
So you're asking me
to turn that on, right?

776
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:43,796
Yes. I'll go and get everyone.

777
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,882
Okay.

778
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,593
Sure.

779
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:55,346
Everyone, let's all go inside now.
There's an event waiting for you.

780
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,765
An event?

781
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:57,853
Let's go.

782
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,694
Jun-su, come with us.

783
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,773
Hurry. Come here.

784
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,444
Let's go.

785
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,367
<i>When it's red, you stop and wait.</i>

786
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:19,455
<i>Yes. I must cross when it's green
while checking if a car is coming or not.</i>

787
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:24,092
<i>That's it. Who do you take after?
You're such a smart boy, Beom-su.</i>

788
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,215
Three, five, E.

789
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,891
Zero, eight, two, nine.

790
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,010
Three, five, E. Zero, eight, two, nine.

791
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:34,973
Beom-su.

792
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,768
Come inside.

793
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,980
Yes, Yeo-na.

794
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,691
So this is why she wanted the photos…

795
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,518
<i>Thank you.</i>

796
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:29,069
<i>My mom took everything from me.
My friends conned me.</i>

797
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,744
<i>And then there was that bastard.</i>

798
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,657
<i>Because of them,
I thought all people were trash,</i>

799
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,123
<i>but things are different here.</i>

800
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,498
<i>I'm really happy here.</i>

801
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,887
<i>Look, comrades.</i>

802
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,849
<i>The world has changed so much.</i>

803
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,224
<i>It is a peaceful time.</i>

804
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,650
<i>I have so much to tell you,
but there's no way to reach you.</i>

805
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,074
<i>Jun-ho.</i>

806
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,828
<i>I will never give up.</i>

807
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:24,708
<i>So don't lose hope and wait for me.</i>

808
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,595
She still hasn't come.

809
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,057
How cruel of you.

810
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:28,856
You made me see what I shouldn't have,
so at least send me my daughter.

811
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,740
Or at least send someone
who's seen Hyeon-ji.

812
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:39,284
I haven't been able to move
a step forward since that day.

813
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,036
I'm still right here.

814
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,264
This is unfair.

815
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:56,973
So unfair.

816
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,324
Jun-su, let's go outside and look around.

817
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,900
- Sure.
- Okay.

818
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,235
- Don't go too far.
- Okay.

819
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,796
Let's go.

820
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,214
Just a moment.

821
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,465
Just a few more minutes.

822
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:42,471
How long are you going to keep staring?
There's so much to do.

823
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,520
There's still more left to do?

824
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,227
Gosh…

825
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,359
Do this twice and we'll die of exhaustion.

826
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,070
I haven't suited up in a while,
and you just made me work.

827
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,486
Okay, fine. Let's go.

828
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,868
Let's go. So what do we have to do next?

829
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,366
Catch Manager Wang.

830
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,416
- We can start that tomorrow…
- And the bastard who killed your mom.

831
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:14,915
We must find them.

832
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,088
What are you talking about?

833
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,721
I mean your mom.

834
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,391
Speaking of which,
I'll go and ask her myself.

835
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,024
Jun-su's mom.

836
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,890
{\an8}But how did he know I was here?

837
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,431
{\an8}I'm planning to look into Detective Park,
who investigated Choiseung Construction,

838
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,726
{\an8}<i>and a 27-year-old case.</i>

839
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,349
{\an8}How do you know Kim Mi-ok?

840
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,396
{\an8}- There's a reason why you see dead people.
- Please keep this a secret.

841
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,791
{\an8}Do you know how I feel these days?

842
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,105
{\an8}<i>It's like I'm looking for a ghost
that doesn't exist.</i>

843
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,032
{\an8}- What are you doing?
- Hey.

844
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,464
{\an8}- You're going to find Thomas?
- Why do you look so surprised?

845
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:25,368
{\an8}How could you send Wook here too?

846
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,620
{\an8}<i>What did my son do wrong?</i>

847
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,872
{\an8}<i>I miss you even more today.</i>

848
