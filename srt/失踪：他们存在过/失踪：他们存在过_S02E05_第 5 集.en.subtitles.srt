THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,389
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,981
CUSTOMER 15 HAS MADE THE DEPOSIT

4
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,280
Deposit confirmed.

5
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,907
Where is the location?

6
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,201
CUSTOMER 15: SANGAK-DONG

7
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,206
I'll text the address after the drop-off.

8
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,592
Drop-off completed.

9
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,260
At 27 Sangak-ro.

10
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,095
Under the mailbox.

11
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,216
Please, let me see my daughter.

12
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,759
Please.

13
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,303
Let me see Bo-ra just once.

14
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,430
Let me see Bo-ra just once.

15
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,808
Is anyone there?

16
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,851
Please help me!

17
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,312
If you don't want to die,

18
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,857
stay quiet.

19
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,235
No!

20
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,236
Mister, help--

21
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,179
Who are you?

22
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,098
What do you mean?

23
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,641
The murder of the phone scammer,

24
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,436
the kidnapping of the woman
in the wedding dress,

25
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,937
and now, the kidnapping of Se-yeong.

26
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,439
You were there every time.

27
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,233
Approaching me was
part of your plan, right?

28
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,486
And if it was?

29
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,615
You…

30
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,951
Look who's here.

31
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,414
It's you.

32
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,166
Right?

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,336
I hardly recognized you
with your long hair.

34
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,338
It's been two years, right?

35
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,423
No.

36
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,426
You were at the club a few days ago.

37
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,896
You bastard!

38
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,233
Stop fooling around.

39
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,570
Mang-chi, grab him.

40
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,184
Wook, run!

41
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,771
Hey! Get him!

42
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,693
Hey, you go that way!

43
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:42,865
Damn it!

44
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,951
What are you doing?

45
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,577
Go get him!

46
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:47,912
Damn!

47
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,332
Hurry, get him!

48
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,460
-Hey!
-Hey!

49
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,770
Get him!

50
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,064
Get up, you fools!

51
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,508
Wook!

52
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,801
Oh, okay!

53
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,304
Come here!

54
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,263
Damn it!

55
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,599
-Come down!
-Hey! Come here!

56
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,310
Come down!

57
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,442
Don't throw that!

58
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,164
Stop him!

59
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,593
Get him. Hurry.

60
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,208
What are you doing?

61
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,459
Hey!

62
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,586
Let's go!

63
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,596
Wook.

64
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,348
Wook!

65
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,349
They're gone.

66
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,559
You can come down now.

67
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,286
I nearly died.

68
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,412
Hey.

69
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,165
Who are they
and what were they doing here?

70
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,332
I don't know.

71
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,709
Don't lie to me, you punk.

72
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,879
The villagers might believe you
because they're naive,

73
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,380
but I don't.

74
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,299
Why did you ask
if you weren't going to believe me?

75
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,633
You punk!

76
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,719
You said it yourself.

77
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,388
You approached me on purpose.

78
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,056
Who the heck are you?

79
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,726
Why is it that everywhere you show up,
bad things happen?

80
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,728
The pot calling the kettle black.

81
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,938
Those people were going to kill you.

82
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,565
Is that why you brought me here?

83
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,983
To offer me to them?

84
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,943
Was this supposed to end with my death?

85
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,613
Now it makes sense.

86
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,739
You punk.

87
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,034
-You're with them, aren't you?
-What?

88
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,454
If anything ever happens to Se-yeong,
I'm going to kill you.

89
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,583
What can I even do in this state?

90
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,918
I warned you.

91
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,712
If anything happens to her,
it's all your fault.

92
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,964
Hey.

93
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,299
Where is Se-yeong?

94
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,592
I don't know!

95
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,473
I saw her here a few days ago.
That's the last I saw of her.

96
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,557
Tell me the truth.

97
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,560
Who are those people that kidnapped her?

98
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,189
-Let go of me!
-Tell me now!

99
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,451
Hey, Goh Sang-cheol.

100
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,787
You didn't get rid of that hostess bitch?

101
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,708
-I did.
-Then why is it on the news?

102
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,503
Her picture is everywhere.

103
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,463
They say she's still alive.

104
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,431
She's dead. I took care of everything.

105
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,225
Actually, that day,

106
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,519
I lost her in the mountains.

107
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,730
I'd been looking for her since then.

108
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,440
I took care of her yesterday
before the delivery.

109
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,192
You should have told me!

110
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,694
I took care of it, didn't I?

111
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,779
I hid it because I didn't want
Goliath to distrust me.

112
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,157
I've been working for him for six months
and I've never even seen him.

113
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,286
I didn't want to be dismissed
over something like this.

114
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,287
Damn it!

115
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,833
You…

116
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,836
You pathetic idiot.

117
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,964
You're sure you took care of it?

118
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:50,881
Yes.

119
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,967
Goliath is tense
over the incoming shipment.

120
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,137
If she had gone to the police
and said some bullshit…

121
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,724
Then…

122
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,018
you would've been the one to die.

123
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,772
Who's the witness?

124
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,317
Oh Il-yong, the one who saw
the wedding dress woman.

125
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,693
You know him, right?

126
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,611
A ghost?

127
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,451
How did he end up
witnessing all those crimes?

128
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,994
My thoughts exactly.

129
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,581
Okay. Talk to me.

130
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,667
They're drug dealers.

131
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,130
They delivered drugs to places
in Sangak-dong a few days ago,

132
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,673
and Mun Se-yeong was in the car.

133
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,426
There's… a person who saw her.

134
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,179
That's all I saw.

135
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,348
Then what about the drug dealers?

136
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,099
Why were you tailing them?

137
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,185
Because of personal reasons.

138
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,020
That's how I saw
the people they kidnapped.

139
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,688
I just wanted to help.

140
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,898
Are you satisfied now?

141
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,364
So what are your personal reasons?

142
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,324
Hey!

143
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,202
There's a witness?

144
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,578
Who is it?

145
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,622
I'll tell you later.

146
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,623
What?

147
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,208
Hey, Detective Oh.

148
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,626
That man over there.

149
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,087
-You still haven't identified him yet?
-No.

150
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,381
I think we need to put out an APB
with his photo.

151
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,883
This is urgent, sir.

152
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,470
Darn it. This is driving me nuts.

153
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,265
They're definitely members of the gang
the Drug Squad is investigating,

154
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,018
but if we barge in,
we can ruin their investigation.

155
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,937
But that's their problem.

156
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,939
We need to find Mun Se-yeong quickly!

157
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,525
Right?

158
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,110
Well… Goodness.

159
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,278
Man-su will flip out over this.

160
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,952
Bo-ra, are you okay?

161
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,370
I heard your dad was here earlier.

162
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,622
I saw him. He's really handsome.

163
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,665
You're lucky.

164
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,126
My dad's an old man.
I never let him come to school.

165
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,461
Jo Dan-bi and Nam Eun-ji
got what they deserved.

166
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,338
Your friends?

167
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,591
Yes.

168
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,301
Thanks to my mom, I'm famous.

169
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,930
Wook and Mr. Jang will be late today.

170
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,057
Let's go get some food.

171
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,475
It's on me.

172
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,687
No, thank you.

173
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,314
I don't even know where my mom is.

174
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,608
I'd feel bad
enjoying things like that by myself.

175
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,279
I just want to go home and watch the news.

176
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:22,783
I wish I could go look for her
with the police but…

177
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,579
You want to go look for her?

178
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,207
Then let's do that.

179
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,434
When did you get here?

180
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,522
You didn't answer when
I called out to you from way over there.

181
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,733
As if you were mesmerized by something.

182
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,486
I was definitely mesmerized.

183
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,821
Did something happen?

184
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,741
Nothing happened.

185
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,326
Probably thinking about Hyeon-ji.

186
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,911
By the way, did you meet Il-yong?

187
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,829
He said he'd go to the house to see you.

188
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,081
Don't even mention his name.
I never want to see him.

189
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,333
Did you two fight?

190
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,335
What's the use of fighting with a ghost?

191
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,338
Anyway, Se-yeong…

192
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,133
Bo-ra's mom has been kidnapped.

193
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,301
What?

194
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,802
Il-yong said he saw it.

195
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,138
Isn't it suspicious?

196
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,474
Why is he always
at the scene of the crime?

197
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,808
Even just a few hours ago…

198
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,353
What?

199
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,396
Nothing.

200
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,398
Does Bo-ra know about this?

201
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,152
This isn't the time to be
hanging out like this.

202
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,695
We should go right now and--

203
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,614
There was a call from Se-yeong yesterday,

204
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,783
so I went off to find her
with Detective Shin.

205
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,828
The police searched for her all night
and have begun an open investigation.

206
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,915
If she called,
then she must still be alive.

207
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,625
That's good news.

208
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,504
Oh? Wook, you're here.

209
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,591
I heard some people talking outside.

210
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,386
Step in for a minute.

211
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,137
Stay there.

212
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,976
Did you meet with Il-yong?

213
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,564
-Yes.
-Then you must've heard about Ro-ha.

214
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,983
Ro-ha? No.

215
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,609
That's strange.

216
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,655
He said he needed your help
with something to do with Ro-ha.

217
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,907
Did something happen to Ro-ha?

218
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
No. Nothing happened here.

219
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,746
But Il-yong must have seen something
when he visited Ro-ha's home outside.

220
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,833
He was frustrated that he could see
but not touch anything.

221
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,002
I told him to ask you for help.

222
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212
My goodness.

223
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,798
This is why I don't like Il-yong.

224
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,092
What's wrong? Did something happen?

225
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,512
He never tells me anything,
yet goes around doing suspicious things.

226
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,180
What suspicious things?

227
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,224
Ask him yourself.

228
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,854
What's gotten into him?

229
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,108
There's no clue as to the whereabouts
of Mun, a woman in her 30s

230
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,818
who's been missing since the 6th…

231
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,819
Jong-a.

232
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,822
The news report just said
the police are expanding their search.

233
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,157
Okay.

234
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,578
That means she's not
near the pay phone she used yesterday.

235
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,539
What if she was recaptured by that man?

236
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,541
What?

237
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,710
Recaptured?

238
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,878
I know what's going on.

239
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,215
Detective Shin showed me
a picture of a man,

240
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,218
and he said she didn't run away with him.

241
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,889
But since they're looking for her
and it's even on the news,

242
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,182
it can't be anything good.

243
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,895
It could be something bad,

244
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,773
but it could also end up being nothing.

245
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,024
No one knows.

246
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,444
What's important right now is
that your mom can't be reached

247
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,613
and we don't know where she is.

248
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,406
That's why the police are looking for her

249
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,367
and why we're looking for her too.

250
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:52,910
Right?

251
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,792
MISSING WOMAN IN SINMI-DONG
CALLS IN 15 DAYS

252
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,713
And you see that I'm putting
everything I can into this search, right?

253
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,507
Not just for your mom,

254
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,092
but for the kidnapper as well.

255
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,219
Just wait.

256
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,595
No matter what,

257
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,056
I'm going to find him.

258
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,771
Listen up.

259
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,273
The shipment is arriving
at Yangcheon Port tonight.

260
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,442
We have intel
that Goliath himself is coming.

261
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,403
Are you ready?

262
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,779
-Yes, sir!
-Let's go!

263
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,948
-Let's go!
-Go!

264
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,541
-Hello.
-Man-su, it's me, Il-du.

265
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,751
You know that guy
your team also has an eye on?

266
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,294
We're putting out an APB on him.

267
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,964
What? An APB? You can't!

268
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,633
I told you we've been working hard
on this for six months.

269
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,677
Someone's life is on the line here.

270
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,928
That's not the only one.

271
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,263
We have several lives on the line too.

272
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,265
If we mess up this operation, we all die!

273
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,642
So we're supposed to wait
and let someone die?

274
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,728
Come on, man.

275
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,358
Three hours.

276
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,609
Give me just three hours.

277
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,320
After that, do whatever you want.

278
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,658
What did he say?

279
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,786
Let's just wait three more hours.

280
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,291
What if we lose the victim?

281
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,334
It's been 32 hours
since she last contacted.

282
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,336
You know we don't even know
if she's alive.

283
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,588
I know.

284
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,423
I want to find her as much as you do!

285
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,717
But what can I do?
They're also mid-operation!

286
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,386
If anything goes wrong,
it will be the end for both of us!

287
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,555
Damn it!

288
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,102
Come on. Let's give them just three hours.

289
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,063
After that, I'll put out the APB myself.

290
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,524
All of you, stop what you're doing
and go out and join the search.

291
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,013
What are you doing?

292
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,310
What is it?

293
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,774
Nothing. Let's go.

294
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,279
Nothing, my ass.

295
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,699
What?

296
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,168
There's not a soul in sight.

297
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,590
The location has been changed! Wondo Port!

298
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,008
-Wondo Port?
-Hurry.

299
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,086
Sir.

300
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,464
I think there's been a leak.

301
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,549
What happened?

302
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,761
LOCATION CHANGED TO WONDO PORT

303
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,614
Do what you want with him.

304
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,450
Hurry!

305
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,829
-Search every corner. Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

306
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,497
-Run!
-Go this way. Here.

307
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,634
Where is that bitch?

308
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,261
I told you.

309
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,680
I got rid of her.

310
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,350
How can I believe a rat?

311
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,728
You're just a snitch for the pigs.

312
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,855
Gwang-taek.

313
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,565
It's a misunderstanding.

314
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,233
It's a misunderstanding.

315
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,737
Gwang-taek…

316
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,988
It's a misunderstanding.

317
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,406
A misunderstanding--

318
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,738
Sir, there's no one here.

319
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,075
What should we do?

320
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,827
What do you think?

321
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,495
Pull out.

322
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,456
Pull out.

323
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:45,006
This reminds me of how
I woke up in your room in Duon Village.

324
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,217
What is this place?

325
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,468
Who am I?

326
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,597
That's how I feel right now.

327
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,016
It feels like another world here.

328
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,518
It is another world.

329
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,562
I like staying here.

330
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,816
When you have a home outside?

331
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,402
I like having you at home.

332
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,116
Here. Look.

333
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,702
You can see this, right?

334
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,663
Do you still like it here?

335
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,081
Wook.

336
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,792
I can see Hyeon-ji.

337
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,962
Get a hold of yourself, Mr. Jang.

338
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,922
You held a funeral for Hyeon-ji.

339
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,466
The living must live on.

340
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,803
I saw her here.
Wherever I turn, I see her.

341
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,639
She shows up at school
and when I'm walking on the street.

342
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,557
It's true.

343
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,195
Go home by yourself.

344
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,197
I'm not saying
I plan to stay here forever.

345
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,547
The man who took Jeong-ah.

346
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,424
-Choi Jeong-ah?
-The one in the wedding dress?

347
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,592
Yes.

348
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,637
Jeong-ah exited the bridal shop
and got in his car.

349
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,641
We have a picture of an unknown man.
I wanted to know if she knew him.

350
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,642
But I think that man

351
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,937
took Mun Se-yeong.

352
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,571
Where is he
and why isn't he contacting me?

353
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,203
The phone is off…

354
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,382
That's strange.

355
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,968
I could've sworn
I heard the tree rustling.

356
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,386
Who's there?

357
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,598
What are you doing?

358
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,893
I heard the leaves rustle in my sleep,
so I came out to see.

359
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,146
I think someone new has arrived.

360
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,982
If someone had arrived,
they would've come here.

361
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,109
Be quiet.

362
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,278
Don't you hear footsteps?

363
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,492
Over there!

364
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,118
Who's there?

365
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,461
Did you see him?

366
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,963
I followed him to that alley,
but I lost him.

367
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,340
Who?

368
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,092
Se-yeong's kidnapper.

369
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,098
Are you sure?

370
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,225
How did he get here?

371
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,519
If he died,
then Se-yeong is also in danger.

372
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,437
Before they find his body,

373
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,731
we have to catch him
and find out where Se-yeong is!

374
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,403
Why are you still here,
talking loudly at night?

375
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,030
Se-yeong's kidnapper is here.

376
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,616
-So he died?
-Yes!

377
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,659
He's here!

378
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,203
Or did he come here
even though he's alive like us?

379
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,581
I don't think so.
He couldn't see me when I saw him outside.

380
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,043
Then he must have died.

381
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,671
Jeez. Where is he hiding?

382
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,381
Is he a scary one?

383
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,465
How bad is he?

384
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,633
He's a murderer.

385
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,386
Then we shouldn't just stand here!

386
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,140
-Il-yong, you know the empty house, right?
-Yes.

387
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,599
Where was it…

388
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,685
the last one in the alley near the school.

389
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,520
-Across from the tearoom.
-And…

390
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,982
-Search the empty houses as well.
-Okay.

391
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,734
Let's go. Hand me that flashlight.

392
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,069
No. You go with Il-yong.

393
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,739
I'm going to go outside
and make a call to Detective Shin.

394
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,323
-Okay.
-Damn it!

395
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,825
-Where is it?
-Over there.

396
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,076
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

397
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,244
Be careful.

398
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,329
Kids.

399
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,957
Our kids. The kids.

400
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,615
What's going on?

401
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,367
I was definitely stabbed.

402
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,337
What is this?

403
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,508
My goodness. This is serious.

404
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,343
Should I announce it
over the school's PA system?

405
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,053
This late at night?

406
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,763
You'll wake up the whole village.

407
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,307
I was just worried about the kids.

408
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,060
I'll look after the kids.

409
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,646
Anyway, I hope we catch him fast.

410
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,606
I agree. Goodness.

411
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,317
What a fuss such late at night.

412
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,126
What's this?

413
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,587
This is just like my home.

414
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:49,908
Yes, Wook.

415
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,451
Se-yeong's kidnapper is dead.

416
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,202
-What?
-He's dead.

417
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,496
But I saw him in the village
Oh Il-yong lives in.

418
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,832
What that means is…

419
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,208
There is no body?

420
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,794
Yes, that's it! That's exactly right.

421
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,630
What about Mun Se-yeong? Where is she?

422
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,298
That I don't know.

423
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,635
The minute I recognized him, he took off.

424
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,095
There's a commotion in the village
looking for him.

425
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,639
I just left to inform you.

426
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,976
They're looking for a person who's dead
and whose body is missing?

427
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,103
I know it sounds ridiculous.

428
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,481
But that's the situation here.

429
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,777
Anyway, the important thing is
that the kidnapper is dead.

430
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,113
Then what about Se-yeong?
Is she in more danger?

431
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,158
His accomplice might have taken her
after he killed the kidnapper.

432
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,078
They'll be careful
since this is an open investigation.

433
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,622
But we don't know what they'll do
when cornered.

434
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,375
So yes, she's in danger.

435
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,627
But thanks to you,
I get the situation. Thank you.

436
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,921
We can share pleasantries
after we find Se-yeong.

437
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,925
Call me back after you find him
and find out where Mun Se-yeong is.

438
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,802
I'll do my best on my end until then.

439
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,387
Okay. Thanks, Detective Shin.

440
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,519
He wasn't over there.

441
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,145
He wasn't in the alley either.

442
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,981
Hey, Wook.

443
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,483
Are you sure you saw him?

444
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,068
Yes.

445
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,362
I saw him clearly and chased after him.

446
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,280
This is a mystery.

447
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,491
It's not that big of a mystery.

448
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,702
Don't worry about it.

449
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,329
Like Wook said,

450
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,831
someone did arrive today.

451
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,291
But we can't spend the night like this.

452
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,127
It's pitch-dark and we can't see anything.

453
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,379
He may be hiding somewhere
and may show up soon.

454
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,589
So let's go to bed
and look for him tomorrow.

455
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,718
-Okay.
-I'm tired, so good night.

456
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,348
It's late, Wook. Go home now.

457
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,933
Go where?

458
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,601
Se-yeong's kidnapper is here.

459
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,527
Why does he sound so angry and cold?

460
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,320
I know, right?

461
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,421
Oh, my gosh!

462
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,758
What? What is it?

463
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,301
I found it.

464
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,927
I found it!

465
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,972
You found my mom?

466
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,265
No, that guy.

467
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,144
We can't use this.

468
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,190
-Why not?
-I hacked into security cameras.

469
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,693
I can't make you my accomplice.

470
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,780
I won't tell them I saw this, okay?

471
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,950
No.

472
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,703
Jong-a, please.

473
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,256
Okay. In that case,

474
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,801
if anyone ever asks,
you didn't see anything.

475
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,012
Actually, even if you saw something,
it's all my responsibility.

476
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,347
Okay?

477
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,359
It's this guy?

478
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,527
Yes.

479
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,530
The night your mom called
from a pay phone,

480
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,490
he was seen in two places.

481
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,699
Once here.

482
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,244
I think he looked
at the camera on purpose.

483
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,121
You think so too, right?

484
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,126
And here later on.

485
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,337
Here, he tried not to be seen.

486
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,383
I think your mom must be here.

487
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,728
You're here.

488
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,730
Let's go!

489
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,074
I didn't know there was such a place.

490
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,756
Is that it?

491
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,635
Ms. Ahn.

492
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,012
You said we'd practice
for the field day today.

493
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,597
Aren't we going out to the field?

494
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,766
Oh…

495
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,936
So we are going to practice
for the field day.

496
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,354
In here.

497
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,357
-But why did you close the curtains?
-Right.

498
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,443
We should practice outside on the field.

499
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:24,200
You saw the flags hanging
on the strings on field day, right?

500
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,701
-Yes, why?
-Yes.

501
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,037
-I don't know.
-The ones hanging on the strings?

502
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,748
That's right. Those.

503
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,667
You're going to make them yourselves.

504
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,793
Wow!

505
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,091
The school is safe.

506
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,759
It should be.

507
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,636
We must protect the kids no matter what.

508
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,305
I'll take a look around the village,
so keep them safe.

509
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,723
-Be careful.
-Okay.

510
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,110
What?

511
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,778
I think I was here earlier.

512
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,021
Am I…

513
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,815
stuck here?

514
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:48,326
SUPERMARKET

515
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,183
What brings you here?

516
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,477
May I use your phone?

517
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,645
My cell phone doesn't work here.

518
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,483
Oh. Let's see.

519
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,361
Just sit here and wait.

520
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,509
I just need to make a phone call--

521
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,303
Your face is haggard.
You haven't had anything to eat.

522
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,097
Am I right?

523
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,475
Don't just sit there and stare at me.

524
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,560
Eat up before it gets cold.

525
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,438
-I'm okay.
-I'm not okay.

526
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,357
Since you're here,

527
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,235
I can't let you leave without feeding you.

528
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,319
So eat up.

529
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,907
I'm not trying
to keep you here or anything.

530
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,826
Sorry?

531
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,495
What did you just say?

532
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,080
What?

533
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,915
Did I say something just now?

534
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,170
Oh, I told you to
eat up before the food gets cold.

535
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,508
I just cooked this rice in an iron pot.

536
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,009
It is unbelievably tasty.

537
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,761
Eat up now.

538
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,351
Thank you for the food.

539
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,538
It's delicious.

540
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,958
I always thought
the food I cooked tasted delicious.

541
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,299
You don't look like someone
who'd do bad things.

542
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,761
Sorry?

543
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,555
What?

544
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,432
Did I say something again?

545
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,476
I didn't say anything.

546
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,729
Go ahead and eat.

547
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,818
Try this too.

548
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:40,873
He's not there?

549
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,291
No.

550
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,709
Not there either?

551
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,212
Where can he be
in a small village like this?

552
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,463
He's hidden himself well.

553
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,089
Goodness!

554
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,467
You didn't hide him?

555
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,677
What?

556
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,013
I told you, I don't know him!

557
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,474
If you don't, you don't. Why so angry?

558
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,809
Getting angry makes you
look more suspicious.

559
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,104
Damn it!

560
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,398
Why do I bother saying anything?

561
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,609
Eat some more.

562
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,488
Even ghosts that ate well
before they died look healthier.

563
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,993
What? People don't say that anymore?

564
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,246
They do, but…

565
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,207
Thank you for the food.

566
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,130
Sit.

567
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,636
You punk.

568
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,429
Here you are.

569
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,017
You really feel like eating right now?

570
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,563
Glad you're here.
I was wondering how to contact you.

571
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,232
Let him finish eating first.

572
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,234
No one should be disturbed when dining.

573
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,610
Captain.

574
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,947
The whole village is in DEFCON 1
because of him, you know that?

575
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,616
The kids are stuck inside the classroom,

576
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,744
and we've been patrolling since dawn,
unable to eat anything.

577
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,704
Hey.

578
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,164
Where's Mun Se-yeong?

579
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,624
Tell me that first!

580
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,685
Put that down and let's talk.

581
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,146
Who are you?

582
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,565
Did Gwang-taek send you?

583
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,524
Or…

584
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,402
Goliath?

585
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,491
Who sent whom?

586
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,410
Who?

587
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,745
Gwang-taek?

588
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,204
Who's Gwang-taek?

589
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,874
And Goliath?

590
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,669
Is that a real gun?

591
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,212
It's real.

592
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,380
Ma'am, you go outside.

593
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,924
This is my store. I'm not going anywhere.

594
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,636
You only die once.

595
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,847
Listen to him, Captain Kang.

596
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:03,891
Go outside.

597
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,813
Don't do something you'll regret here.

598
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,868
If Gwang-taek didn't send you,

599
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,787
who are you?

600
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,789
The woman you took…

601
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,124
Mun Se-yeong.

602
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,293
She's my friend.

603
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,346
We can't harm those of the outside world.

604
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,183
No matter how we struggle and resist,

605
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,188
we can't touch them.

606
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,454
This is just crazy.

607
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,000
You may not know this,

608
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,211
but it's no use trying
to shoot that gun here.

609
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,547
Don't be stupid.

610
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,216
Don't come near me!

611
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,846
I think it's time for the kids' snacks.

612
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,597
We're in trouble.

613
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,892
Inside, Wook is talking to that new guy
who came yesterday.

614
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,649
Hey, what was that sound?

615
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:37,985
He shot him.

616
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,069
He shot him!

617
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,245
You!

618
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,204
Go away!

619
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,414
You punk!

620
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,582
Let go of me!

621
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,542
Hey, Wook! Are you okay?

622
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,003
Oh, I'm fine.

623
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,464
I don't think he is, though.

624
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,506
What?

625
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,091
He was the one who got shot?

626
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,093
You murderer! How dare you?

627
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,386
You deserve to be shot.

628
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,680
-This is hard.
-No, he wasn't shot.

629
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,265
The truth did him in.

630
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,683
What? The truth?

631
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,393
I'm not dead.

632
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,061
I'm not dead!

633
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,521
Let go!

634
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,024
Oh, dear.

635
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,610
You just found out you're here
because you're dead?

636
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,653
How dare you yell at us, you punk?

637
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,114
It's okay to kill others
but not okay for you to die?

638
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,115
Is that unfair?

639
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,701
This is hard. Grab him.

640
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,370
-Goodness.
-Come here.

641
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,289
Come here, you jerk.

642
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,876
What did you do to Se-yeong?

643
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,338
Tell me where she is right now, you punk!

644
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,132
Wook, are you hurt? I heard a gunshot.

645
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,055
I wasn't shot. It went off by mistake.

646
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,891
Thank goodness, no one was hurt.

647
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,228
No way.

648
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,193
No!

649
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,239
No!

650
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:09,368
Did you check both videos, Detective Shin?

651
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,370
The second was recorded just two days ago.

652
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,539
We also have the first one.

653
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,082
And I just checked the second.

654
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:15,999
But…

655
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,336
Why would he show himself
on the first one, then hide?

656
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,422
Because he had something to hide. Right?

657
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,967
I'm on my way there now.
I'll go and check.

658
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,802
Any word from Wook?

659
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,596
No. He went to get Mr. Jang
and isn't back yet.

660
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,474
They stay out like it's a habit.

661
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,059
What a bad example for Bo-ra.

662
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,194
Stop crying like a baby.

663
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,491
We need to talk, so stop crying.

664
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,328
I understand that you're shocked
about all this.

665
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,622
But could you tell me
where Se-yeong is first?

666
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,001
Haven't you thought about how scared
she and her daughter must be,

667
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,168
just like you are now?

668
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,682
She's at my home.

669
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,268
What?

670
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,895
Tell me the address.

671
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,994
Hey, backup is on the way,
so don't go off on your own and wait.

672
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,080
Get here as fast as you can! Hurry!

673
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,552
If you go out the bathroom window,
you'll reach the back alley.

674
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,889
If someone else comes other than me,
run as fast as you can.

675
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,617
SHIN JUN-HO

676
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,786
Answer the phone, Detective Shin.

677
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:10,841
Help!

678
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,344
-Save me!
-Come back down!

679
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,470
I'm the police!

680
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,403
Damn it!

681
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,782
Where did that
stupid Goh Sang-cheol hide her?

682
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,326
Not that house.

683
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,204
My real home is somewhere else.

684
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,752
I got that house…

685
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,505
to infiltrate the drug cartel.

686
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,674
Are you a detective?

687
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:54,801
Yes.

688
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,140
I infiltrated the drug cartel
six months ago.

689
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,810
The shipment will be arriving
at Yangcheon Port soon.

690
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,312
Goliath will show up in person.

691
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,440
While delivering drugs,

692
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,735
I sent the evidence
and information to the police.

693
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,737
You were a police officer?

694
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,614
I knew it.

695
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,908
You didn't look like someone
who'd do bad things.

696
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,911
You should have told us that
when you got here.

697
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:24,206
Then why did you put the woman
in the trunk and threaten her?

698
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,833
Yes. Why did you take Bo-ra's mom?

699
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:28,835
If she was caught,

700
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,464
she and I…

701
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,675
both would have died.

702
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,513
People are gathering.
Go and control the crowd.

703
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,473
-Hurry up and go.
-Yes, sir.

704
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,682
Come here for a second.

705
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,387
Wook.

706
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,681
Detective Shin.

707
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,599
Mun Se-yeong is safe.

708
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,976
She wasn't hurt badly.

709
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:26,935
That's great.

710
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,813
Bo-ra will be thrilled.

711
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,898
That little runt
must have been so worried.

712
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,194
I got here quickly thanks to Jong-a.

713
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,780
Jong-a? How is she involved?

714
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,157
She found out that he had come by here,

715
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,367
so we were in the area.

716
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,285
Really?

717
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,579
That brat.

718
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,374
-You can go. I'll call you later.
-Okay. Good work.

719
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:53,837
Il-du.

720
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,590
-Where's Sang-cheol?
-What brings you here?

721
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,383
This is Sang-cheol's home.

722
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,467
Where is he?

723
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,219
Mun Se-yeong was alone in the house.

724
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,930
Mun Se-yeong's kidnapper's name
is Sang-cheol?

725
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,473
He's not a kidnapper.

726
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,143
Then what is he? Your informant?

727
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,478
A detective.

728
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,023
He was working undercover.

729
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,029
PUBLIC SAFETY MESSAGE
MUN SE-YEONG SAFELY FOUND…

730
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,322
That's great.

731
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,325
I told you we could find her.

732
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:27,829
Wook!

733
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,999
They found Bo-ra's mom.

734
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,711
I actually came to tell you that.

735
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,922
Guess you saw
the public safety message first.

736
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,731
How's the detective?

737
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,025
I put him to bed
and left when he fell asleep.

738
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,278
I don't know if he's asleep
or passed out from crying so much.

739
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,114
He won't eat anything and keeps crying.

740
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,199
-Mr. Jang.
-Goodness.

741
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,158
We found Se-yeong.

742
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,703
You found Bo-ra's mom? How is she?

743
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,872
Let's talk about that later.

744
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,457
Jong-a's buying dinner tonight.

745
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,459
Let's have a feast tonight.

746
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,379
She told me not to come
if I don't bring you.

747
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,089
Okay, I'll have to go home tonight.

748
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,174
Wait here. I'll go get my bag.

749
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,842
Hurry up, I'm hungry!

750
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,135
Be quiet.

751
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,555
Must be nice to have someone
waiting for you at home.

752
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,727
Today is a special day.

753
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,355
Usually, we don't have
anyone waiting for us.

754
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,607
Don't mind me.

755
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,943
This ghost is just talking foolishness.

756
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,488
Stop calling yourself that.
You're making me sad.

757
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:47,617
I've never once thought of the people here
as any different from me.

758
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,537
Okay, I hear you.

759
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:57,002
The police found Ms. Mun
17 days after she went missing.

760
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,379
She looked unstable when found,

761
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,717
but currently, there are no
major problems with her health.

762
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,470
The police are interviewing her
to figure out the circumstances.

763
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:12,976
CLOSED TODAY

764
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,699
Be careful, kids.

765
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,161
Will Bo-ra be going home right away?

766
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,122
No. Detective Shin says
they need to investigate further.

767
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,583
He said they could still be in danger.

768
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,210
The house will feel empty
after she leaves.

769
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,547
I liked that the house was full of people.

770
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,633
You feel that way and yet
you still leave home all the time?

771
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,850
Stop following me and go do your thing.

772
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,477
I'm not following you around.

773
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,271
I'm going to see that crybaby detective.

774
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,190
Then see to your business and leave.

775
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,275
Don't wait for me and all that.

776
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,818
What a joke.

777
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,237
Why would I hang around waiting for you?

778
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,822
Listen closely.

779
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,242
We need to carpool
to reduce pollution and save energy.

780
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,203
That way, we can save money, pay rent,

781
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,121
and make Jong-a less mad at us.

782
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,915
I'm looking at the big picture here.

783
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,958
You don't know anything.

784
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,961
You're all talk and no walk.

785
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,653
Ro-ha, could you tell me
what this picture is about?

786
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:51,950
I'm having a picnic
in the mountains with my parents.

787
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,663
Your family went on a picnic
in the mountains?

788
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,289
No.

789
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,250
Then?

790
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,294
I was alone in the mountains.

791
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:07,632
I was so cold and hungry. I missed my mom.

792
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,218
That's why I imagined this.

793
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,263
Why did you rip it?

794
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,687
What's going on?

795
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,814
Ha-yun tore up my drawing!

796
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,441
This is a bad drawing.

797
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,737
Ha-yun, may I take a look?

798
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:53,928
Wow.

799
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,059
Is this a boat?

800
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,979
A motor boat.
The kind that you can see on a lake.

801
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,523
There's no boat here.

802
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,442
I didn't see one.

803
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,570
There used to be, but not anymore.

804
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,448
It's a bad boat,
so the grown-ups got rid of it.

805
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,006
Wow.

806
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,349
Captain Kang also needs to rest
once in a while.

807
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,308
Captain Kang!

808
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,143
Captain Kang!

809
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,144
Mr. Jung.

810
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,689
Have you seen Alice?

811
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,899
What about her?

812
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,317
This is terrible.

813
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,611
Alice has gone missing.

814
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,112
Alice is gone?

815
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,822
We were having a class by the lake…

816
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,157
-Yes?
-She disappeared.

817
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,868
You shouldn't have
taken your eyes off her!

818
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,495
Wait for me.

819
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,829
Oh, dear.

820
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,752
Alice is missing?

821
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,922
We were going back to school
after drawing,

822
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,465
and I couldn't find Alice.

823
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,008
She was just there.

824
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,760
All that's left is her sketchbook.

825
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,807
You take the rest of the kids and go.

826
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,517
I'll go look for Alice.

827
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,352
Alice!

828
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,358
Alice!

829
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,865
This is all because of that bad drawing.

830
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,201
I didn't do anything.

831
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,749
Ha-yun, you have to hold
Yeong-rim's hand. Come on.

832
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,586
Let's go.

833
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:11,399
EPILOGUE

834
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,610
What is that?

835
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,194
It's nothing.

836
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,448
Come on. Let me see that.

837
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,075
If it's nothing,
why are you being so careful with it?

838
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,411
Is it Ha-yun's?

839
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,704
No.

840
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,872
It's Hyeon-ji's.

841
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,791
Hyeon-ji's things

842
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,002
are still here?

843
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,755
If you give it to someone as a gift,
it remains.

844
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,891
It's Hyeon-ji's letter.

845
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,851
A letter she wrote to me.

846
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,355
Sure.

847
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,486
Dad.

848
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,614
I can now read difficult letters.

849
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,449
And I can write well too.

850
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,202
You're coming to find me, right?

851
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,454
Find Ha-yun as well.

852
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:09,499
Yeong-rim and my other friends too.

853
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:13,252
They all want to see their parents.

854
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,630
So please find all of us.

855
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,467
I told them that
there's nothing you can't do.

856
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,637
I miss you, Dad.

857
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,806
I love you.

858
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,099
She wants you to find them all?

859
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,728
She is so like her dad.

860
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,022
She's quite meddlesome.

861
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,316
Right?

862
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,195
And her uncle is just as meddlesome.

863
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,489
-You know.
-Of course, I do.

864
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:42,865
So don't worry.

865
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,784
And don't carry this all by yourself.

866
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:48,204
We can find all of Hyeon-ji's friends.
We can find Alice too.

867
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,997
Right?

868
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:52,750
Yes.

869
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,049
Goodness.

870
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,302
So this is why you wouldn't come home.

871
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,451
Why did she call it a bad boat?

872
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,995
How did a small girl like her
get up there?

873
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,330
Who did you play with on the boat?

874
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,790
Fish?

875
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,251
Don't you think there's also
a secret to this village?

876
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,919
I would also like to know

877
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,713
what I did wrong to be kidnapped.

878
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,089
They're afraid of nothing.

879
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,467
Why is a drug cartel kidnapping
and killing people?

880
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,927
I only have my suspicions,
so I can't tell you.

881
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,388
Who's the owner of this mask?

882
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,266
That's him.

883
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:57,231
