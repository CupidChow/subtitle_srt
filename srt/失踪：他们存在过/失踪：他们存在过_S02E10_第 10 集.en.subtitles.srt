00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,887
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,972
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,426
You punk.

4
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,678
Get out. Come out.

5
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,722
Hey, come out!

6
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,307
Come on out.

7
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:41,851
Hey!

8
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,069
Hey! Stop right there!

9
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,088
I couldn't see the license plate.

10
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,798
It's 40G 1408.

11
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,056
Detective Shin, it's me.

12
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,599
I just saw Kim Pil-jung,

13
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,268
but I lost him.

14
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,770
Yes, 40… What was it again?

15
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,564
It's 40G 1408.

16
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,190
It's 40G 1408.

17
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,650
A gray SUV.

18
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,822
Locate a gray SUV,
40G 1408 within the Seohwa-ro area.

19
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,615
Hello.

20
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,242
How have you been?

21
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,703
Me?

22
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,080
I arrived just a little while ago.

23
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:44,998
Here?

24
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,085
I'm…

25
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,506
under the same sky as you.

26
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,762
We should meet.

27
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,307
Yes.

28
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,268
Tomorrow?

29
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,604
All right, sir.

30
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,452
Where's Kim Pil-jung?

31
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,163
I think he switched cars
and left about ten minutes ago.

32
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,374
Detective Kim.

33
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,627
Secure the nearby security footage
and screen the cars within a 10km radius.

34
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,920
Yes, sir.

35
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,588
Il-yong.

36
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,053
The cops are looking for him,
so let's just wait.

37
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,055
He was right in front of me,
and I couldn't do anything.

38
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,682
That's not true.

39
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,434
You let me know,
so I was able to go after him.

40
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,813
The cops are looking for him now.
You did what you could do.

41
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,984
I don't care.

42
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,318
Let them look if they want.

43
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,116
I'm sorry for making you
go through so much.

44
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,785
Il-yong.

45
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,537
Were you there

46
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,540
because you knew
Kim Pil-jung would be there?

47
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,210
That was our old neighborhood.

48
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,047
He never visited after he moved,
saying it's a slum.

49
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,634
I just went to see
in case he was hiding there.

50
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,553
And was he there all this time?

51
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,388
I don't think so.

52
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,724
I checked it out a few days ago
and he wasn't there.

53
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,643
It also felt like
he was there to meet someone.

54
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,021
Who?

55
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,522
I don't know.

56
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,525
It seemed like he was waiting
for someone in the alley.

57
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,527
Then he just left.

58
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,989
But why were you there?

59
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,081
I saw the woman
I keep seeing in my dreams.

60
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:32,999
So…

61
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,751
I followed her.

62
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,420
Your dreams?

63
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,215
Yes, she seemed to be in her thirties.

64
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,135
She had no makeup on

65
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,012
and tied her hair back like this.

66
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,766
And she has a mole under one eye.

67
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,767
That's right.

68
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,976
You know her?

69
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,895
I think I saw her
while looking for Pil-jung.

70
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,229
Where does she live?

71
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,190
I don't know that.

72
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,649
I just passed her by,

73
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,027
but she felt familiar for some reason.

74
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,695
I'm sure I don't know her though.

75
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,823
How do you know her?

76
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,826
She's a stranger to me too.

77
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,744
But…

78
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,080
I keep seeing her in my dreams.

79
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,125
That's strange.

80
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,379
That's why I'm looking into her.

81
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,353
Are you ready yet?

82
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,814
Why is getting a T-shirt
taking you so long?

83
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,194
But…

84
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,447
why do you need this?

85
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,407
Why do you think?

86
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,367
To clear your name.

87
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,620
I want to show
that Ha-yun wasn't afraid of you

88
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,831
but that she was scared by the T-shirt.

89
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
-So give it here.
-But

90
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,543
what if…

91
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,920
this scares her more?

92
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,799
Don't worry.

93
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,051
Hye-ju said she'll be careful
when she explains.

94
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,021
The kids were playing in the playground…

95
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,903
when a woman came to talk to them

96
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,237
and gave them something.

97
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,781
Are they me and Ha-yun?

98
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,159
I was crying then.

99
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,203
Why were you crying?

100
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,665
Mom and Dad

101
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,919
said they weren't going
to live together anymore.

102
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,969
So you cried because you were sad.

103
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,182
Then what did this woman give you?

104
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,393
Banana milk.

105
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,814
She gave these kids

106
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,317
banana milk.

107
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,821
Ha-yun.

108
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,449
I'm right here.

109
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,785
They…

110
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,080
shouldn't drink that.

111
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,748
She's a bad woman.

112
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,169
Was this bad woman…

113
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,673
wearing this?

114
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,010
It's all right.

115
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,887
I'm right here.

116
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,898
My goodness…

117
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,443
What on earth has she done
while wearing a volunteer group T-shirt?

118
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,655
I'm more worried about
all the bad things she could've done.

119
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,948
We must catch her quickly.

120
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,410
But can we find her with just a T-shirt?

121
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,120
We have to find her no matter what.

122
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,997
How?

123
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,166
Well, Wook will do it.

124
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,711
He's a genius when it comes to scheming.

125
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,550
Wook will do it, not me.

126
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,640
They haven't budged in days,

127
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,934
which is more suspicious.

128
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,561
Hello.

129
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,523
Hello to you too.

130
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,483
You're here.

131
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,401
Yes.

132
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,819
Where's Ms. Lee?

133
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,071
She's waiting inside.

134
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,617
BLUE HOPE FOUNDATION
SHARING LOVE FOR OUR NEIGHBORS

135
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,287
The Blue Hope Foundation
is an NGO founded 17 years ago.

136
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,497
It doesn't rely on government funds,

137
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,125
but it's funded by donations
and run by volunteers.

138
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,212
The donations and their usage
are transparently disclosed.

139
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,714
It has quite a good reputation.

140
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,220
The foundation probably
has records from 15 years ago, right?

141
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,098
Yeong-rim and Ha-yun came
to the village 15 years ago.

142
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,683
I'm not sure.

143
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,894
It does a lot of one-off events.

144
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,647
I don't know
if they keep records of volunteers.

145
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,399
I actually spoke
with an employee on my way here.

146
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,611
And they keep some on computers
and some in documents.

147
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,029
We'll have to go and see.

148
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,657
Then I'll go with you.
This is my specialty.

149
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,574
Okay.

150
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,159
Where are you going?

151
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,620
Do I need to tell you
all my comings and goings?

152
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,372
Respect your elders.

153
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,832
Where are you going?
Are you going to see Detective Shin?

154
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,377
You think I just go meet him all the time?

155
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,675
Where are they going?

156
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,263
Wook.

157
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,766
Hey, Detective Shin.

158
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,945
Surprisingly, Filipino cuisine
suits Koreans well.

159
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,532
They use lots of spices over there.

160
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,200
Here.

161
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,159
Thank you.

162
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,245
But…

163
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,624
there's nothing like this anywhere else.

164
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,627
Right.

165
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,463
This is it.

166
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,216
Let's drink.

167
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,309
Help yourself.

168
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,229
You need to eat well
more than ever at a time like this.

169
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,900
I took care of him
as soon as I found out he was a tail, but…

170
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,653
This was my fault.

171
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,989
That's what those cops
at the Drug Squad do.

172
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,493
They need to work at least that much
since they get paid from our taxes.

173
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,789
You put the rest of the stuff
in a safe place?

174
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,083
Yes.

175
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,334
But…

176
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,753
I think I need
to move it again to be sure.

177
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,671
Okay.

178
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,174
Now, let's stop talking shop and eat.

179
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,301
Yes, sir.

180
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,321
How long do you plan
to stay in Korea, sir?

181
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,408
It's been a while,
so I plan to go on tours

182
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,827
and find my stuff.

183
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,037
I kept it safe.

184
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,040
-The house in your name--
-Not that.

185
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,750
There's something bigger, remember?

186
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,585
What I lost three years ago.

187
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,424
You said his name was Oh Il-yong?

188
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,967
Have you heard anything about him?

189
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,011
I'm still looking for him.

190
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,473
That bastard took on
what he couldn't handle.

191
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,935
You…

192
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,898
You really didn't know about it?

193
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,818
If I had, you would have
found out already.

194
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,362
It's worth so much.

195
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,240
True.

196
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,452
Let's move the stuff first,
then set the stage.

197
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,037
No mistakes this time.

198
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:51,956
Don't worry, sir.

199
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,503
Do you eat eels?

200
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,420
Sorry?

201
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,798
I do.

202
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,260
Let's go for eels next time.

203
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,720
I know a great place.

204
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,556
Thank you, sir.

205
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,852
Hey, switch the license plate.

206
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,312
Yes, sir.

207
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,795
What is this?

208
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,425
Sir.

209
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,802
Hurry up. He's waiting.

210
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,928
This…

211
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,581
We searched every house,
but he wasn't in that neighborhood.

212
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,416
He switched cars and ran.

213
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,003
We must find Kim Pil-jung

214
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,839
to find Detective Goh and Il-yong.

215
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,676
And to find out if Lee Dong-min
is really the one behind Jang Do-ri.

216
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,223
Since you mentioned Jang Do-ri…

217
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,809
Detective Shin.

218
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:37,937
You trust me, right?

219
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,192
Why? What is it?

220
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,110
Well…

221
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,445
For you…

222
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,116
I've been keeping an eye
on those thugs we saw last time.

223
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,787
Did you put a tracker on them?

224
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,376
They were watching us
so we should do the same.

225
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,128
Good work.

226
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,298
I've been worried about that.
Let's take a look.

227
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,766
Wait, what's wrong with this?

228
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,018
What's going on?

229
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,188
It turned off!

230
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,481
They must have found it.

231
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,608
Then where was their last location?
I should go.

232
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,110
-I'm going with you.
-No.

233
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,445
From now on, I'll be going after
Jang Do-ri and Lee Dong-min alone.

234
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,239
It's too dangerous for you.

235
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,157
I'll call you if there's any progress.

236
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,410
Just send me the location. Thanks.

237
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,499
Did they really find it?

238
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,302
You know me, don't you?

239
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,557
No, who are you?

240
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,770
You look like someone I know.

241
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,106
I guess I was mistaken.

242
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,025
I'm sorry.

243
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,903
Could you step aside?

244
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,363
Of course.

245
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,240
I'm sorry.

246
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,084
What a strange man.
Why would he talk to me?

247
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,117
So many young people
are coming these days.

248
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,578
Who are you?

249
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,662
What is this place?

250
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,374
A place where people live.

251
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,794
You must have a lot of questions,
so follow me.

252
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,680
Come.

253
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,940
SUPERMARKET

254
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,192
Drink this scorched-rice tea first.

255
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,028
No need for these.

256
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,113
I'd like to use your phone.

257
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,867
I guess you'd want that
if you were doing something urgent.

258
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,829
Have some snacks before dinner.

259
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,958
It's hot, so don't forget to cool it.

260
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,003
I'll explain what this place is
while you eat.

261
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,758
So what did you do before you came here?

262
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,969
You're very stylish.

263
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,603
Oh, that's hot!

264
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,523
What the hell?

265
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,316
It's you, isn't it?

266
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,026
The one who killed Il-yong!

267
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,030
Il-yong?

268
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,824
You know him?

269
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,325
Who are you?

270
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,994
What does it matter who I am?

271
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,912
Il-yong told me.

272
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,291
He said someone
he thought was a friend stabbed him.

273
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,712
This is a friendship ring
I bought with Pil-jung.

274
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,964
I thought he was my friend.

275
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,592
I was an idiot.

276
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,512
He was no friend.

277
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,891
It's you!

278
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,855
I always wanted to see
what you looked like.

279
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,190
And you look like a piece of trash.

280
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,860
What the hell are you saying?

281
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,445
Let go of me!

282
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,572
There's no mail.

283
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,200
She doesn't seem
to be living with someone else.

284
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,952
She seems to speak Chinese.

285
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,495
Maybe she's here to work.

286
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,956
Since we found out where she lives,

287
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,083
we should look more into her.

288
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,753
Let me go, you punk!

289
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,921
What's going on?

290
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,801
What the hell are you doing?

291
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,303
What?

292
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,306
Kim Pil-jung.

293
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,349
Captain, are you okay?

294
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,517
-Yes.
-What is this?

295
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,521
Is that you, Il-yong?

296
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,483
Who else would I be, you crazy bastard?

297
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,319
Goliath?

298
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,405
-Did he die?
-He just arrived.

299
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,700
How did you know he was Kim Pil-jung?

300
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,202
The ring he's wearing.

301
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,829
Il-yong was also wearing it when he came.

302
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,875
Hey.

303
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,502
Where's my body?

304
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,921
What the hell are you talking about?

305
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,173
Then where's the stuff
I told you to keep safe?

306
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,592
You killed me.
What did you do with my body?

307
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,470
Are you crazy?

308
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,638
Have you gone mad?

309
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,224
What body? You're standing right here.

310
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,101
You still don't know what this place is?

311
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,437
What is this place?

312
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,439
It's the afterlife.

313
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,942
I'm here because of you.

314
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,236
What are you talking about?
I didn't kill you.

315
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,822
You stabbed me!

316
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,076
I did that because you took the stuff

317
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,286
and talked nonsense
about turning yourself in.

318
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,704
It wasn't enough to kill you.

319
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,212
Il-yong.

320
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,131
Mr. Noh's gone crazy, looking for you.

321
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,632
There's no time for this.

322
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,759
We have to get the stuff and…

323
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,681
Hey!

324
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,724
-What's going on?
-No.

325
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,601
Hey! Tell me where my body is!

326
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,061
Where's my body? Tell me!

327
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,522
Answer him, Kim Pil-jung!

328
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,024
You can't go like this!

329
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,119
He…

330
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,497
He just left…

331
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,124
like that?

332
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,545
What…

333
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,423
What do I do now?

334
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,472
What else is there to do?

335
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,144
I'm going to find you no matter what.

336
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,771
You stay strong.

337
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,372
-Thank you.
-Good work.

338
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,582
Take care.

339
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,833
Good job.

340
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,876
Good work. Bye.

341
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,421
-Have some snacks.
-Thank you.

342
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,839
Take care.

343
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,841
Excuse me.

344
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,803
We're here to see Director Choi Ji-yeon.

345
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,889
That's me.

346
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,891
Hello, ma'am.

347
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,934
Hello.

348
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,064
I'm very interested in child welfare.

349
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,524
I'd like to do volunteer work
and even teach kids.

350
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,610
And when there's a chance,

351
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,986
I'll also donate some items.

352
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,906
I've only been making regular donations,

353
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,575
but now I plan to do
some volunteer work too.

354
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,661
We'd be very grateful for your help.

355
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,621
By the way,

356
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,415
I'm looking for someone
among your long-time sponsors.

357
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,376
Someone I know

358
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,296
would like to contact that person
to thank her for her help.

359
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,048
Who would that be?

360
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,342
About 15 years ago,

361
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,595
she seemed to have done
volunteer work for this foundation.

362
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,139
What was her name again?

363
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,558
Maybe her name is on the record.

364
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,394
You may be right.

365
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,188
She'd be on the list
if she made regular donations.

366
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,524
But if she only came to volunteer…

367
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,699
We do require application forms.

368
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,616
Is that right?

369
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,660
Then please help so that I can thank her.

370
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,078
-This is great.
-Yes.

371
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:33,133
-Thank you.
-There's more besides these.

372
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,095
Finding a needle
in a haystack would be faster.

373
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,015
You seriously need my help with this.

374
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,391
Pardon?

375
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,144
I'll put all of these records in order.

376
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:45,854
All of them?

377
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,066
I'll begin with the records
from 15 years ago as you've said.

378
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,530
Until two years ago,
I actually worked at a community center.

379
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:59,034
Organizing, categorizing papers,
and updating databases

380
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,368
are all my specialties.

381
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,829
But there are so many files here.

382
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,039
Don't worry.

383
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,124
I'll get started tonight.

384
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,882
Hi there.

385
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,300
Ms. Lee.

386
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,179
Even you can't do all that by yourself.

387
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,973
I never said I was going to do it alone.

388
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,898
I'll be in the office.

389
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,941
I'm very quick

390
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,027
at situations like this.

391
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,113
What are you doing after work?

392
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,198
Are we having dinner?

393
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,616
I have nothing going on.

394
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,326
You're always hungry for food.

395
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,911
He's so clueless.

396
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,955
Do we need to work late today?

397
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,625
Yes. It's not for the café though.

398
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,469
SO GOOD COFFEE

399
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,806
-This is Shin Jun-ho.
-Hey, Detective Shin.

400
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,226
Goliath…

401
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,478
Kim Pil-jung is dead.

402
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,563
What?

403
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,024
I'm a bit confused myself,

404
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,068
but he's dead for sure.

405
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,154
Did he come to that village?
Did he say where Detective Goh's body is?

406
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,656
Let alone Detective Goh,

407
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,409
we didn't even hear about Il-yong.

408
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,869
He didn't even know he was dead.

409
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,287
And he was adamant

410
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,206
that he didn't kill Il-yong.

411
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,417
After that, he suddenly

412
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,085
disappeared.

413
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,962
All right.

414
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,426
Detective Oh, get me the info
on all anonymous male corpses

415
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,677
that were reported today.

416
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,971
He shouldn't have come in the first place.

417
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,766
Or at least, he could have told us
what we wanted to hear.

418
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,687
Il-yong has been after him for three years
and he left just like that.

419
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,522
Il-yong's feeling very down right now.

420
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,776
So, in the village
where the missing dead live,

421
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,280
the one that killed one of them came?

422
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,283
How can something like that happen?

423
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,494
Wait, so can you just leave
after a short time?

424
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,413
In Duon Village,

425
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,206
I once saw someone go the next day,

426
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,542
but I've never seen anyone go
within an hour.

427
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,627
It was a first for Captain Kang too.

428
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,213
It's like he was messing with him.

429
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,382
He should have told us something.

430
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,800
He did say something.

431
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,261
What?

432
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,975
He said something about this stuff.

433
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,603
He's been looking
for something Il-yong hid away.

434
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,813
We wanted to ask more, but he disappeared.

435
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,318
Kim Pil-jung is the one who killed you?

436
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,323
He's the one who had me killed, right?

437
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,450
Damn it!

438
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,578
I should have punched him
in the face before he left.

439
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,416
I'm too frustrated to stay inside today.

440
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,635
Goliath…

441
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,636
is dead?

442
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,262
Yes.

443
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,682
Now, there is no one to back you up.

444
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,478
The murders of Jeon Dae-gyeong,
Choi Jeong-ah, and Lee Gyeong-seon

445
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,688
will be all on you.

446
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,358
Why is that?

447
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,776
I told you before.

448
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,363
Your DNA was found on the needle
that was used on Choi Jeong-ah.

449
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,074
You're lying.

450
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,076
Don't you remember that abandoned factory?

451
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,120
Choi Jeong-ah was in the trunk,

452
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,122
and Goh Sang-cheol wouldn't do it,

453
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,792
so you stuck the needle in her yourself.

454
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,463
And Goh Sang-cheol…

455
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:45,677
You stabbed him while his hands were tied
and couldn't fight back.

456
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,470
Right there.

457
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,766
A detective, at that.

458
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,560
You piece of trash.

459
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,897
There was no one else there.

460
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,233
True.

461
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,527
There were only the two of you
in that container.

462
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,406
I know because
the dead Goh Sang-cheol told me.

463
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,958
Should I tell you more?

464
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,003
Sang-cheol seems
to have a lot to say to you.

465
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:23,798
It wasn't me.

466
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,675
Goliath ordered everything.

467
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,094
Listen, you idiot.

468
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,639
How are you going to prove that
when Goliath is dead?

469
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,059
You'll just rot here
for the rest of your life.

470
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,359
I won't be coming back.

471
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,612
Have a good life.

472
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,865
But I'm not sure if you'll last long.

473
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,703
Detective! It wasn't me!

474
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,496
Goliath ordered me to do all that!

475
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,458
What?

476
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,543
You have something to tell me?

477
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,424
Sir, I found out
where Detective Goh's body is.

478
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,427
"I'm not alone anymore."

479
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,678
"'Now.'"

480
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:15,099
"The cherry blossoms all went down,
riding the wind upon the signal,

481
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,143
and had fun with the kids."

482
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,856
"One of the blossoms
was torn between choices."

483
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,525
"It liked listening to happy stories,

484
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,278
but it wanted to make others happy."

485
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,865
What were you doing?

486
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,034
I was reading a book to Alice.

487
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,579
Alice, you must be so happy
that she's reading for you.

488
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,373
I'll read it for you too.

489
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,166
This is my favorite book.

490
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,085
Ha-yun only reads this book.

491
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,295
She's read it more than 100 times.

492
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,964
Not 100 times.

493
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,633
Come out and have some sausages.

494
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,093
Let's go.

495
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,594
Ha-yun, Yeong-rim.

496
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,888
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

497
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,431
Be careful when you carry that.

498
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,391
It looks delicious.

499
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,938
What did you call,
"staring into the fire" again?

500
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,731
Bulmeong.

501
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,942
It's a term for staring
into the fire for a long time.

502
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,403
You don't call it campfires anymore?

503
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,490
You do, but nowadays
people use the term bulmeong.

504
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,953
I'm just happy to see the kids having fun.

505
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,996
Me too.

506
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,333
Il-yong said he was going for a walk.
Where is he?

507
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,168
Wook went to get him.

508
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,894
I left because I didn't want
to ruin it for the others.

509
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,313
Don't worry.

510
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,483
They're having fun.

511
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:51,612
Il-yong.

512
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,616
I talked to the police outside.

513
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,205
Uncle Sang-cheol!

514
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,792
Try this.

515
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,044
It's delicious.

516
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,087
You eat it. I'm okay.

517
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,464
Open up.

518
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,007
Come on.

519
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,637
It's good, isn't it?

520
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,264
I'll bring back more.

521
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,228
Ha-yun

522
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,981
isn't afraid of me anymore.

523
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,776
I told you it wasn't because of you.

524
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,737
Come here!

525
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,906
Come watch the campfire.

526
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,491
Come and enjoy bulmeong.

527
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,492
Yes.

528
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,837
You need something sweet
when you're stressed.

529
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,506
Thanks.

530
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,726
I couldn't tell you earlier
because I was so out of it.

531
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,145
Yesterday…

532
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,690
I actually went to see your parents.

533
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,990
They were both doing well.

534
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,997
Your big brother and his kids
are visiting this weekend.

535
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,210
Your mother

536
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,796
wanted to see you

537
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,215
and said that they should call you.

538
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:39,095
But your father said
they shouldn't bother you

539
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,182
because you'd be busy.

540
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,533
Thanks.

541
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,371
It's nothing.

542
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,168
You ended up here
while trying to catch bad guys.

543
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,256
I'm different from you.

544
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,301
Of course you are.

545
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:19,886
You…

546
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,722
are needed

547
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,849
in this village.

548
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,861
Why are you crying
when his parents are well?

549
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,114
It's so moving.

550
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,867
I can't help but cry.

551
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,121
It's because you're old.

552
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,667
I'm a bit emotional these days.

553
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,462
Did I say something wrong?

554
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,422
Why did you have to say we're old?

555
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,090
We're all old.

556
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,804
NO TRESPASSING

557
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,565
This was done recently.

558
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,484
Detective Oh, hand me the hammer.

559
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,778
Here it is, sir.

560
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,592
To us!

561
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,802
-To us!
-To us!

562
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,644
-Goodness.
-That's good.

563
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,687
This is good.

564
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,774
I wondered why people go camping
when they could rest at home,

565
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,858
but this isn't so bad.

566
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,195
I tried it because someone recommended it.

567
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,697
This is my first time camping
since I came here.

568
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,615
It's wonderful.

569
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,786
Wasn't it Detective Goh
who said camping was fun?

570
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,537
Yes, well…

571
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,082
You went through so much
since you got here.

572
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,917
Just relax today.

573
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,294
I wish I could.

574
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,131
When I first came here…

575
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,592
things were so crazy.

576
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,763
Chasing criminals outside

577
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,723
was nothing compared to here.

578
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,226
At first, I was chased by Wook.

579
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,269
Then later on…

580
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,730
I chased him.

581
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,484
After one problem is solved,
another one popped up.

582
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:04,860
But…

583
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,405
every time…

584
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,908
you all helped.

585
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,786
This is…

586
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,915
a really strange place.

587
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,087
Are you sure you're not
the one who's strange?

588
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,338
He's right.

589
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,256
He's an odd duck.

590
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,216
You shot at me, remember?

591
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,260
And you cried so easily.

592
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,302
I must be drunk.

593
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,804
Why am I trembling?

594
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,411
Goodbye.

595
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,537
Crybaby detective.

596
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,627
Goodbye.

597
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,712
You went through a lot.

598
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,401
It's a good thing.

599
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,738
He had such a hard time.

600
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,783
I hope he's in a better place now.

601
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,512
Hey, stop.

602
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,429
Stop.

603
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,852
Sir, please.

604
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:55,966
Detective Oh.

605
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,093
Go bring Team Leader Lee here.

606
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,219
Yes, sir.

607
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,024
It's cocaine.

608
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,109
There are 10 of these 3kg bags.

609
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,153
These are worth at least ten billion won.

610
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,447
And this is just
the amount they kept hidden.

611
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,742
Which means there are more
out there in the market.

612
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,415
Sir.

613
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,875
Any news on Kim Pil-jung?

614
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,462
That reckless bastard
is doing business again.

615
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,172
Goliath…

616
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,174
Kim Pil-jung is dead.

617
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,760
Are you sure that's Kim Pil-jung?

618
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,345
It's the same method.

619
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,806
These cartels all operate differently.

620
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,392
Even if they copy the method,
it can't be 100% the same.

621
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,601
This guy…

622
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,063
is definitely Goliath.

623
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,489
Open for business.

624
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:05,744
Dealer name.

625
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,747
Goliath.

626
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,506
You saved the face of our Drug Squad.

627
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,050
You would have found him
even if it weren't for me.

628
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:21,969
Thank you

629
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,596
for finding Sang-cheol.

630
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,058
That's my job.

631
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,488
What did you just say?

632
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,450
Detective Goh Sang-cheol

633
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,494
died in the line of duty.

634
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,582
I'm so sorry.

635
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,176
I'm sorry, ma'am.

636
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,970
I'm sorry, sir.

637
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,723
I'm so sorry.

638
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,232
I'm sorry.

639
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,818
I'm so sorry, sir.

640
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,989
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

641
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,660
I'm sorry.

642
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,802
GOH SANG-CHEOL
WENT MISSING THIS AUGUST…

643
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,726
You did well.

644
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:05,614
SO GOOD COFFEE

645
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,620
Goodbye, Sang-cheol.

646
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,259
Can you see it too?

647
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,761
I can see it clearly.

648
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,603
We were a little late.

649
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,647
Yes, sir.

650
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:42,901
Let's go.

651
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,279
BLUE HOPE FOUNDATION

652
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,447
Let's speed it up a bit.

653
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,411
Here.

654
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,083
Let's go for pork back-bone stew
after we move all these.

655
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,544
Pork back-bone stew? Really?

656
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,338
You can even order
a large with extra meat. Okay?

657
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,381
Okay!

658
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,720
Forget moving all of these.

659
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,805
When are we going to put them in order?

660
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,056
We just need to move them.

661
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,935
Using the program that I created,

662
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,812
it'll be over if we stay up
all night tonight.

663
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:19,938
All night?

664
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,399
Yes.

665
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,949
A fire broke out
on the second floor of a 6-story building

666
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,577
in Namseomun-gu, Seoul
around 10:00 p.m. last night.

667
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,704
It was put out in an hour…

668
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,080
What is this?

669
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,333
What are you watching

670
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,959
so early in the morning?

671
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,128
You should watch some drama.

672
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,715
Kim Pil-jung is dead,

673
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,176
but why isn't it on the news?

674
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,388
He disappeared from the village.

675
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,268
Maybe…

676
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,355
they found his body and hid it somewhere.

677
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,607
Could it be

678
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,610
that someone rescued him,

679
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,863
and he's still alive?

680
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,119
I wish I could see what's going on
inside that head of yours.

681
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,002
I'm home.

682
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,879
Hey, Ms. Lee.

683
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,005
You're coming home now?

684
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,382
Yes.

685
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,218
You finished quite late.

686
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,012
The data have been organized.

687
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,099
Finding the culprit
is a matter of time now.

688
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,060
Want some coffee?

689
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,020
Up next.

690
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:47,484
An 80-year-old man living alone
in a slum was found dead.

691
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:51,488
He suffered from a chronic disease
according to his neighbors and the police.

692
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:55,325
And he also had bad knees,
so he couldn't move around with ease.

693
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:59,204
It was found that he and his family
stopped contact over ten years ago.

694
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,206
I doubted that she could,

695
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,917
but she really did put
all of them in order.

696
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,711
Don't be so surprised.

697
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,630
You'll be shocked when Ms. Lee
really shows you what she's got.

698
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,385
Here's the schedule you asked for.

699
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,679
Tell me in advance
when you can participate.

700
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,141
Sure, I'll talk to Ms. Lee

701
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,144
and get back to you.

702
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,228
Okay.

703
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,316
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

704
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,609
Would you like one?

705
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,657
Oh, no. I'm fine.

706
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:39,578
I don't do well with milk.

707
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,206
Do you always keep

708
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,333
banana milk around?

709
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,793
No.

710
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,172
A sponsor brings them sometimes
for the employees.

711
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,757
I see.

712
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,387
And how long has that sponsor
been doing good work here?

713
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,557
She first came about 15 or 16 years ago.

714
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,185
I see.

715
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,994
You're scaring me, Il-yong.

716
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,500
The dust was getting to me.

717
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,211
I'm going to clean up here today

718
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,797
and also mop the floor.

719
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,174
You should rest, Captain.

720
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,509
Hey…

721
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,182
Okay then.

722
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,918
-The dishes, please.
-Sure.

723
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,294
Leave that here.

724
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,295
My, that stinks.

725
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,305
Shall I warm up the food for you?

726
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,101
I don't have much of an appetite.

727
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,522
You need to eat something to get better.

728
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,567
If it's hard for you to chew…

729
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,488
How about this?

730
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:02,137
This is the playground from 15 years ago
where Ha-yun and Yeong-rim went missing.

731
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,932
Two blocks from here,
there used to be a senior welfare center.

732
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,475
On the day the kids disappeared,

733
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,770
the Blue Hope Foundation was there
to give baths and cut hair.

734
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,357
How do we find her
when it's been 15 years?

735
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,986
So how many volunteers
were there that day?

736
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,029
Thirty people.

737
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:20,488
Thirty?

738
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,908
The kids said

739
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,660
it was a woman
who gave them the banana milk.

740
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,955
I picked out women above 30
among the 30 volunteers,

741
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,624
and there are eight of them.

742
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,127
And these are the info
on those eight people.

743
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,799
What about the T-shirt?

744
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,927
Wouldn't that provide a clue?

745
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,264
I looked into the T-shirt.

746
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,224
They were all wearing one that day.

747
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,646
But there was a milk retail store owner.

748
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,857
Hey!

749
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,985
When I was at the foundation earlier,

750
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,905
someone left a bag
filled with banana milk.

751
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,323
I heard she leaves it every week.

752
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,450
And she's been a long-time sponsor.

753
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,912
It's been 15 years, so I bet
the milk retail store is gone now.

754
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,081
No, that person…

755
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:14,501
I heard she's a care worker,
not a milk retail store owner.

756
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,127
A care worker?

757
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,629
Yes.

758
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,589
Why would a care worker hand out milk?

759
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,632
How would I know?

760
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:24,052
Does she run
a milk retail store or something?

761
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:24,970
My goodness.

762
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:26,680
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

763
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,306
Please call Director Choi

764
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,643
and ask if the care worker's name
is Kim Geon-ju.

765
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,479
She was on site that day too.

766
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,439
You sure she's a care worker?

767
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,566
Why would you call her?

768
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,194
She was there
when they did volunteer work that day.

769
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:42,112
You never know.

770
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,822
She was the only care worker there.

771
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,908
What if it's a mistake?

772
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,868
Let's not make this worse.

773
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:49,786
Director Choi?

774
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,705
This is Pan-seok.

775
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,332
You know, when I was there earlier…

776
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,418
The banana milk.

777
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,587
Is the person who brings them
named Kim Geon-ju?

778
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,925
I think she may be
the person I'm looking for.

779
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,386
Yes, you're right.

780
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,096
Okay. Thank you.

781
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,431
She is.

782
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,349
I told you I was right.

783
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,892
I thought it was strange.

784
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,102
The care worker.

785
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,520
She's the one.

786
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,814
-It must be her.
-Really?

787
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,091
Why are you crying here alone?

788
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,804
Did you fight with your friends?

789
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,098
My friends

790
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,684
won't play with me anymore.

791
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,810
Oh, dear.

792
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,854
Where do you live?

793
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,690
Do you live here?

794
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,694
Where's your mom?

795
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,156
She went to heaven.

796
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:15,288
My mom is also up there.

797
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,458
She was very sick.

798
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,796
Fifteen years ago, Kim Geon-ju's job

799
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,631
wasn't a care worker.

800
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,968
My dream was to be a teacher.

801
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,847
But after high school,
I became a nurse's aide.

802
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,433
I wanted to take care of my mom.

803
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,020
I thought it would be better if I did it.

804
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,773
But she became sicker and sicker.

805
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,234
Then one day,

806
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,154
she held my hand and begged me.

807
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,699
"Please…

808
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,952
kill me."

809
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,998
Up until ten years ago,
she worked as a nurse's aide.

810
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:03,044
Then after three years,
she got the care worker's license.

811
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,630
Among the elderly people she visited,

812
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,757
thirteen died of natural causes.

813
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,342
Thirteen?

814
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,510
Yes.

815
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,680
They were all very elderly
and suffered from chronic illnesses

816
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,473
so they were all ruled as natural deaths.

817
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,727
They didn't die when they were in her care

818
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,855
but a few years later.

819
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,315
But I think…

820
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,153
this is more than just a coincidence.

821
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,364
Let's say you're right.

822
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,576
But what about Ha-yun and Yeong-rim?

823
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,785
They're not the elderly.

824
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,328
He's right.

825
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,124
They weren't kids
she knew personally either.

826
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,586
Among the children's hospital patients
where she used to work

827
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,379
some went missing.

828
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:50,175
They were all kids from families
receiving government welfare

829
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,135
or from childcare facilities.

830
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,721
Why would she kill those poor kids?

831
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,601
Maybe…

832
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,896
she killed them because she pitied them.

833
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,048
Rather than living in pain,

834
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,176
it's better to die in comfort now.

835
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,388
I wish…

836
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,393
I could have made my mom
comfortable sooner.

837
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,413
That's just crazy.

838
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,082
Kill them because she feels pity?

839
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,500
How dare she?

840
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,961
She's a crazy psychopath.

841
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,130
In other words, an insane serial killer.

842
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,716
The elderly were ruled as natural deaths,

843
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,677
but the kids are still missing.

844
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,887
If Kim Geon-ju really did this,

845
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,891
we must find the place
where she hid the bodies.

846
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,185
Where are you going?

847
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,563
To find the kids.

848
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,982
Come on, get up.

849
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:30,817
Let's go!

850
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,026
Wook, come on.

851
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,843
I'm not done yet.

852
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,261
I wiped the floor yesterday.

853
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,264
This is an empty room,
so no need to clean it every day.

854
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:04,934
If you have dishes to wash, I'll do them.

855
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:05,852
Just sit down.

856
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,899
I know you've been upset

857
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,569
after that jerk left.

858
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,905
And then, Detective Goh left too.

859
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,495
For three years,

860
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,874
I've only been thinking about that.

861
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,003
And now, I don't know what to do.

862
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:35,173
Yes, you do.
Continue with what you've been doing.

863
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,800
You weren't following him around
because you liked him.

864
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,762
You were trying to find out
where he hid your body.

865
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,057
But Pil-jung is dead now.

866
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,769
I wasn't going to say this, but…

867
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,230
I think it served him right.

868
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,984
That bastard is better off dead
than living a good life.

869
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,987
I even got the chance

870
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,864
to pour hot tea on him.

871
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,369
He would have continued
to do bad things if he were alive.

872
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,455
Even without him,

873
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,707
you can still find your body.

874
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,585
You can still go outside

875
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,879
and Wook will help you in any way he can.

876
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:19,050
Mr. Jang and Wook

877
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,761
won't let down the villagers.

878
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,554
I'm sure of that.

879
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,518
I know it too.

880
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,104
Even when Detective Goh left,

881
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,314
Wook told me beforehand.

882
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,775
So I got to tell him
everything I wanted to.

883
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,363
That's good.

884
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,283
Let's go.

885
01:01:55,837 --> 01:02:00,842
HYEON-JI!! I'LL MAKE SURE
TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS TOO…

886
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,111
Thank you.

887
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,613
It's magnolia berry tea.

888
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,407
I picked and dried them myself.

889
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,409
This is a precious one.

890
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,917
This is great.

891
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,546
There's something you wanted to ask me?

892
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,089
Yes.

893
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,050
Well…

894
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,012
I'm sorry.

895
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:53,686
Do you remember Ha-yun and Yeong-rim?

896
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,397
Who?

897
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,065
Before, you…

898
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,735
At the playground, you…

899
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,782
At the playground…

900
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,118
Banana milk…

901
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,340
The playground

902
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,801
and banana milk?

903
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,261
Mr. Jang also has a sad story.

904
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:32,475
His young daughter was found dead
after missing for 15 years.

905
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,770
His wife took her own life

906
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,564
not long after his daughter went missing.

907
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:42,902
He also tried to end it all a few times.

908
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,200
I remember them.

909
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,452
The kids I met at the playground.

910
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,956
I already sent them to a better place.

911
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,625
Mr. Jang.

912
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,587
Put down all your painful memories,

913
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,383
and rest in peace now.

914
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:36,664
They say you take
some secrets to your grave.

915
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:39,292
And we're not even in our graves yet.

916
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,003
When are you going to take us?

917
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,130
Mr. Jang. Mr. Jang!

918
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,299
Where are these kids?

919
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,634
Why are you asking me that?

920
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,511
Go find Yeong-rim and Ha-yun.

921
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,013
They've been here too long.

922
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,306
How can I forget?

923
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,850
It's all thanks to you and Kim Wook.

924
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,560
We have to be open to all possibilities.

925
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:58,895
They're not your average criminals.

926
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,229
Who are you?

927
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,315
Let's just say that I'm your dad's friend.

928
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:07,236
