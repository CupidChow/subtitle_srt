00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,599
- Dad.
- Yes?

4
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,719
- Can you sing for me?
- Sing?

5
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,233
Sure, why not?

6
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,520
<i>While the mother</i>

7
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:10,317

<i>The baby is left…</i>

10
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,098
<i>He's like the devil.</i>

11
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,299
Hey, where are you?
Why aren't you back yet?

12
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,047
<i>Why? You can't sleep without me?</i>

13
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,808
Don't be silly.

14
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,769
<i>Whatever. I'm on an unexpected stakeout.</i>

15
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,652
<i>Don't wait up for me.</i>

16
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,898
I see. Okay.

<i>Choiseung Construction

18
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,804
<i>who was said to have
no living family left,</i>

19
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,920
<i>recently found her grandson.</i>

20
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,217
{\an8}<i>The company officially announced
an extraordinary general meeting.</i>

21
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,892
<i>The news has seized the attention
of the financial sector…</i>

22
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,011
I was worried…

23
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,144
I'm glad she found him.

24
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,488
{\an8}Han Sang-gil.

25
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,244
{\an8}What did he do all night?

26
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,579
{\an8}Isn't he going to attend
the general meeting?

27
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,672
{\an8}Whatever.

28
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,708
{\an8}I don't care.

29

{\an8}HAN SANG-GIL

30
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,283

CHOISEUNG CONSTRUCTION
EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING

32
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,588
Thank you for taking the time
to attend the meeting.

33
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:19,051
I'm sure you were concerned
about my family being on the news.

34
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,427
There were a lot of rumors
about whether I have a grandchild or not.

35
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,176
As all of you are present here today,

36
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,887
I would like to formally introduce
my grandson to you.

37
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,070
Say hello.

38
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:48,285
Hello. I was finally able
to reunite with my grandmother.

39
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:54,134
I'm really grateful that she found me
after all these years.

40
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,460
My name is Kim Wook.

41
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,668
I'm sure you have a lot
of questions, but let's...

42
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,468
What?

43
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,059
What did you just say?

44
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,679
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- Ma'am, are you all right? What's wrong?

45
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,767
How did this happen?

46
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,693
Please wrap up the meeting.

47
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,949
- Did you notice anything strange?
- No, nothing.

48
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,452
Did you see anyone suspicious?

49
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,500
RECENT CALLS
DIRECTOR LEE DONG-MIN

50
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,791
Who did he last call before he died?

51
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:38,085
He talked to Lee Dong-min
at 10:45 p.m. last night.

52
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,255
The lobby security camera showed
Lee Dong-min going out at 10:30 p.m.

53
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,221
That means he was alive
when he stepped out to talk

54
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,717
to Lee Dong-min on the phone.

55
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,805
Han Sang-gil has a history of drug abuse.

56
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,348
This looks like a suicide to me.

57
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,226
Since he's got a history of drug abuse,

58
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,773
it would've been easy
to make it look like an overdose.

59
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,607
And the time of death is unclear.

60
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,360
Doesn't this crime scene

61
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,493
look staged?

62
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,416
Are you all right?

63
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,883
I shouldn't have done it.

64
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,973
I'm basically responsible
for Director Han's death.

65
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,433
- It's all...
- The culprit's fault.

66
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,885
It's not your fault.

67
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,018
I'm going to catch him.

68
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,165
Detective Baek.

69
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:05,718
I don't want to rush you,
but did you get anything?

70
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,140
<i>I'm already rushing them
by calling every two hours.</i>

71
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,720
You don't have to do that.

72
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,015
I'm sure they'll let you know
once they get the results.

73
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,890
<i>Still, I should keep trying.</i>

74
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,557
- Right.
<i>- Mr. Jang, where are you?</i>

75
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,645
Me?

76
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,523
I'm home.

77
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,858
You must be busy. Don't worry about me.
I'll let you get back to work.

78
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,533
- Hey, Detective Baek.
<i>- What is it?</i>

79
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,833
Thank you.

80
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,748
- Thank you so much.
<i>- Don't mention it.</i>

81
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,459
<i>Goodbye.</i>

82
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,848
I'm shocked to hear
that Director Han is dead.

83
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,308
I was wondering why
he didn't show up to the meeting.

84
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,809
What's the cause of death?

85
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,602
The NFS is conducting an autopsy.

86
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,189
Why did you meet Director Han last night?

87
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,817
Before getting off work, he called me
and asked me to join him for a drink.

88
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,660
I said no at first, but I decided to stop
by because I had something to tell him.

89
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,990
What did you tell him?

90
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:19,171
Director Han forged documents
on the kickbacks to kick Director Yoo out.

91
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,671
I considered telling the Chairwoman,
but I told him to turn himself in.

92
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,213
That's all I said.

93
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,589
Did you

94
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,506
threaten him with that?

95
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,593
What for?

96
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,638
Why would I?

97
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,854
The will.

98
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,654
If both Yoo Seong-ho
and Han Sang-gil disappear,

99
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,435
you will be able to get all the shares.

100
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,856
That's only if the grandchild isn't found.

101
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,824
Her grandson made an appearance
at the meeting today.

102
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:59,077
Oh, no. You must have been
deeply disappointed.

103
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,540
<i>That's why he's the killer.</i>

104
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,417
They both went into the hotel
and only one came out alive.

105
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,086
No matter how obvious it is,
we need evidence.

106
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,886
Did Han Sang-gil really kill himself?

107
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,348
It looks like he did,
but that's why it's more suspicious.

108
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,851
If Lee Dong-min killed
Han Sang-gil for the shares,

109
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,194
I'm sure he's furious
about her grandson showing up.

110
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,901
How did the meeting go?
How did the shareholders react?

111
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,322
It was insane.

112
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,700
Who could have expected to see
such a perfect prince like me?

113
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,948
When I entered and said hello,
they fell in love with me.

114
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,536
But that's when we found out
Han Sang-gil had died.

115
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,498
- And that's how the meeting ended.
- How did Lee Dong-min react?

116
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:46,041
Well, he looked very composed.
He wasn't nervous or antsy.

117
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,757
By the way, do you know
what he said as he passed by me?

118
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,259
Stop putting on a show.

119
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,972
- Did you get caught?
- No, not me. He got caught.

120
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,231
He recognized me. Think about it.
If it was his first time seeing me,

121
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:08,192
how would he know if
I'm putting on a show?

122
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,994
He must've known about me from
secretly communicating with Manager Wang.

123
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,909
By saying that, he practically admitted
that he's the one behind all this.

124
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,699
That's weird.

125
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,579
Why would he do that so soon?

126
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,870
He's probably waiting
to see what you'll do next

127
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,825
after feeling you out and scaring you.

128
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:29,295
Since he's confident that he's going
to get the shares.

129
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,921
Be careful. Don't let him fool you.

130
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,217
I wish I could get fooled
or make some mistakes.

131
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,438
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

132
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,729
Hyeon-ji is not a stranger!

133
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,145
I've never seen her,
but she's like a daughter to me!

134
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,453
Come on, I just got the call too.

135
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,871
The DNA results aren't out yet.

136
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,868
After spending all your life looking
for other people's bodies,

137
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,248
you're finally being blessed
with good fortune.

138
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,672
Yes.

139
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,630
I really hope they find Hyeon-ji.

140
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,959
Anyway, what a huge improvement.

141
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,631
Forensics?

142
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,514
Back in my day, we mainly used force to...

143
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,431
No!

144
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,350
Not that again!

145
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,852
A police officer using force
is nothing to brag about.

146
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,019
Yeo-na.

147
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,234
Can we have another bottle?

148
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:31,938
Sure.

149
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,911
Detective Park wants another bottle.

150
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,827
Tell him this is the last one.

151
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,917
Okay.

152
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,224
I didn't know these photos were here.

153
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,427
They're in a great mood today.

154
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:04,891
The police found some DNA
on Mr. Jang's daughter's backpack.

155
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,346
Hey, Mr. Jang.

156
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,976
How can you do this to me?
You know what Hyeon-ji means to me.

157
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:16,943
Even though I've never seen her,
she's like a daughter or a niece to me!

158
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,068
What is it?

159
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,204
What's so funny?

160
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,445
Detective Park also said
the same exact thing.

161
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,497
Did you two plan this?

162
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,996
We feel the same way.

163
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,418
Since you've been treating
the villagers like family,

164
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,428
you and Hyeon-ji are family to us too.

165
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,430
Good for Hyeon-ji.

166
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,483
She has so many uncles.

167
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,695
Three…

168
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,823
Three…

169
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,746
<i>Three, five, E. Zero, eight, two, nine.</i>

170
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,247
Three, five, E. Zero, eight, two, nine.

171
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,381
What if what Beom-su said

172
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,705
was a license plate number?

173
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,310
My goodness.

174
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,689
Look who's here.

175
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,608
You're the grandson
of that business mogul!

176
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,071
Hello!

177
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,901
I'm the grandson of Chairwoman Han
of Choiseung Construction,

178
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,237
Kim Wook.

179
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,657
How does that sound?

180
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,948
You brighten up the room.

181
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,867
Anyway, you're a handsome guy.

182
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,746
It's just that you have an awful temper.

183
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,086
Come on. You were complimenting me.
Why did you have to ruin it?

184
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,264
I liked what you were saying.

185
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,015
I heard the news about Hyeon-ji.

186
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,993
People can be so fickle.

187
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,741
I've been waiting for 15 years…

188
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,616
But after getting a call
from Detective Baek last night…

189
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,633
Now an hour feels like a year.

190
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,090
Time is passing by so slowly.

191
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,725
I went to the police station.

192
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,149
I got on the bus for no reason.

193
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,318
I even had a drink with Detective Park…

194
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,579
But the day

195
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,123
still isn't over.

196
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,707
You'll get a call shortly.

197
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,875
South Korea has
the best forensics team in the world.

198
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,804
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

199
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,388
Right.

200
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,392
I know that.

201
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,027
Do you think she's still alive?

202
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,203
I mean Hyeon-ji.

203
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,002
It's been 15 years since she disappeared.

204
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,422
If the DNA turns out to be the culprit's

205
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,594
and something bad happened to Hyeon-ji…

206
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,303
Mr. Jang will be heartbroken.

207
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,178
But isn't it better to know
if she's alive or not

208
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,262
than blindly waiting for her?

209
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,685
That's true,

210
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,516
but both scenarios are heartbreaking.

211
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,777
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.</i>

212
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:35,044
I should have comforted Director Han.
I guess I was too hard on him.

213
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,039
It's not your fault.

214
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,581
I'm the one who caused trouble.

215
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,172
The shareholders have divided opinions.

216
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,800
Some are questioning
whether your grandson is real or not.

217
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,224
What about you, Director Lee?

218
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,638
Honestly, I also have the same concern.

219
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,602
If you give me permission,

220
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,522
I'll verify that he's your grandson
and make an official announcement…

221
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,646
Here.

222
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,241
He is my grandson.

223
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,569
Did you think I'd call for a meeting
without confirming this basic step?

224
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,237
I just took care of it quietly
because I didn't want the attention.

225
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,957
But don't you think
it's risky to blindly trust

226
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,419
what this piece of paper says?

227
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,995
You have a point.

228
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,955
Although Director Yoo and Director Han
were my closest advisors,

229
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,377
I had no idea what was going
through their minds.

230
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,346
Come on in.

231
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,891
Have a seat here.

232
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,444
Did you get some sleep?

233
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,810
You look tired.

234
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,018
I'm fine.

235
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,112
Director Lee,
why don't you show Wook the ropes?

236
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,316
Everything from A to Z, one by one.

237
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,906
You can give him a scolding
if he doesn't do a good job.

238
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,452
I'll do my best, Director Lee.

239
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,829
Ma'am.

240
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,462
The employees will react
strongly against this.

241
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,672
They might see it as nepotism.
What if they become discouraged...

242
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,094
I've had an ordinary life until now,
so I'm not authoritative at all.

243
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,552
I'll try to learn
and work harder than anyone else.

244
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,848
I'll do as instructed.

245
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,062
And Director Lee.

246
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,436
I would like to revise my will.

247
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Pardon me?

248
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,612
Now that I have Wook, I want to specify
the details of the inheritance.

249
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,450
I'm relying on you, Director Lee.

250
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,743
I'll get going now.

251
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,539
Okay, ma'am. I'll get it ready.

252
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,592
I'm just curious.

253
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,221
How many shares does my grandma have?

254
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,563
To be precise,
how many shares will I inherit?

255
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,607
You're too smart.

256
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,778
Seriously.

257
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,534
I can't fool you.

258
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:22,659
So let me just be honest with you.
I want to get rich very quickly.

259
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:28,541
Does that mean
I won't get a penny until she dies?

260
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,468
Are you sure she's your grandma?

261
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,839
Come on, why would I lie about that?
She is my grandma.

262
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,427
Like I told you yesterday,
I know you're putting on a show.

263
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,394
Didn't you see the DNA test results?

264
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,104
I'm not brave enough
to pull off something like this.

265
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,186
It must be fake.

266
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,983
Is it money that you want?

267
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,896
Sure, money is great.

268
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:02,124
What about you? Do you want to take over

269
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,659
the whole company?

270
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,587
I could report you
to the police right now,

271
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,758
but I won't, since that will make
a fool of the chairwoman.

272
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,299
I suggest you get lost.

273
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,433
Then I'll give you a decent
amount of pocket money.

274
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,510
If I don't get lost,

275
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,888
will you kill me too?

276
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,940
Just like how you killed Choi Yeo-na,
Jang Myeong-gyu, and Kim Nam-guk?

277
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,725
You killed Manager Wang too, right?

278
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,741
What are you talking about?
How dare a scammer like you sit there...

279
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:45,332
Do you think I'm doing this just
for some pocket money?

280
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:50,123
Once my grandma amends her will,
I'll take all of my shares and disappear.

281
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,536
I'm relying on you too.

282
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,784
Kang Myeong-jin asked
to keep his belongings here.

283
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:22,198
Let's see. Number 64.
Number 65. Number 67. Number 68.

284
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,241
- Slow down.
- There's number 74.

285
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,615
- This is it, right?
- Right.

286
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,082
What a shameless jerk.
He will never get out of jail.

287
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,373
- Let's go inside.
- Yes, sir.

288
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,264
I'll start here. You start from the back.

289
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,345
Yes, sir.

290
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,439
He killed two people for no reason.

291
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,276
Plus, there's a 13-year gap
between the scrap paper lady case

292
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,452
and Kim Mi-ok's case.

293
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,384
There's no way he stayed
out of trouble for 13 years.

294
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,118
Sir. This looks suspicious.

295
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,122
- What is it?
- Take a look.

296
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:15,174
This looks like a woman's perfume.
There are high heels and a scarf too.

297
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,603
Kim…

298
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,307
YOON JIN-JU

299
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,849
- Maybe these belonged to his victims.
- Everything here?

300
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,081
- These are all women's stuff.
- Right.

301
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,395
But there's no consistency.

302
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,836
Which means they belonged
to different people.

303
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,180
I'll hand them over to Forensics.

304
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:04,257
If Lee Dong-min finds out you're fake,
he'll go to Chairwoman Han.

305
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,511
Go to Chairwoman Han?

306
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,012
He might come to kill me first.

307
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,676
Are you sure about this?
You almost died last time.

308
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,476
Hey, don't get me started.

309
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,849
It was because Detective Shin
showed up super late…

310
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,402
I should go.

311
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,400
Where are you going?
I need to talk to you.

312
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,152
Let's talk later. I'm going to see a guy
from the narcotics team.

313
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,895
I have to find out where
Lee Dong-min got the drugs from.

314
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,663
What bad timing.

315
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,579
You haven't told him
where Choi Yeo-na is yet?

316
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,582
It's not that I didn't tell him.
I couldn't find the right time.

317
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,876
Hello?

318
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,212
What?

319
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,215
Okay.

320
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,801
Jong-a, let's go.

321
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,062
Hey, Detective Baek.

322
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,018
- You're here.
- Yes.

323
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,064
Well,

324
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:08,322
the DNA found on Hyeon-ji's backpack…

325
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:14,035
We compared it to our criminal database
and got a match.

326
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,878
He was arrested recently
and is currently in jail.

327
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,793
His name is

328
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,628
Kang Myeong-jin.

329
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,674
What?

330
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,087
- Mr. Jang!
- Mr. Jang!

331
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,308
Jong-a, grab the chair.

332
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,178
Mr. Jang, are you all right?

333
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,154
What did you just say?
What's his name again?

334
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,490
Kang Myeong-jin.

335
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:53,123
He was arrested
for murdering a woman in her thirties.

336
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,344
But a few days ago,
we found evidence of another crime.

337
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,708
His DNA was on the belongings of a lady

338
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,418
who was killed 14 years ago.

339
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,591
Where is Hyeon-ji?

340
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,339
Where is Hyeon-ji?

341
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,470
Do you recognize this?

342
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,964
Hyeon-ji…

343
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,670
Hyeon-ji…

344
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,050
Hyeon-ji…

345
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,130
Is that…

346
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:54,175
Is that the headband you bought for her
at the amusement park?

347
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,055
Yes.

348
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:06,148
I sent it to Forensics,
so I'll call you once I have the results.

349
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,944
Calm down for now.

350
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,275
Where is that bastard?
Let me meet him. Please…

351
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:18,032
We just started investigating,
so give us some time.

352
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,368
I'll call you right away
once we find something.

353
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,535
It's her.

354
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,379
It's okay, little one.

355
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,509
There, there.

356
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,597
Where did he get this?

357
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,690
Choiseung Construction.

358
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,164
I should have noticed back then…

359
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,286
What do you mean? Notice who?

360
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,497
I mean Kang Myeong-jin.

361
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,050
When Mi-ok was abducted by him,

362
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,342
she told me he was scary

363
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,967
and that he was like the devil.

364
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,137
When I bumped into him that day,

365
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,403
I should have recognized him.

366
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,736
I'm such a bad father.

367
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,824
I didn't even know who he was.

368
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,297
Let me know
as soon as you get the test results.

369
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:49,436
<i>The serial killer, Kang Myeong-jin, who
killed a woman in her thirties a year ago,</i>

370
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,269
<i>and an elderly woman 14 years ago,</i>

371
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:55,654
is back here again to be questioned
about another murder charge.

372
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,196
- Were there other victims?
- Why did you kill these women?

373
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:08,204
- Is there a reason why you killed women?
- What was your motive?

374
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,668
- What was the motive for these murders?
- Excuse me.

375
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,049
Detective Baek.

376
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,683
You're not coming as well, are you?

377
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,759
I am.

378
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,929
That's against the rules.

379
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,813
Please. I'm not just a third party.

380
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,347
Anyway, I must be there too.

381
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,975
Mr. Jang is technically not allowed in
either, but I asked my boss.

382
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,151
He's allowed in only because I said
he might be able to recognize the culprit.

383
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,154
It's okay. I'll go on my own.

384
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,782
Then I'll be waiting here,
so call me if anything happens.

385
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,866
Okay, wait here.

386
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,380
- Wook will meet us there?
- Yes, he said he'll come on time.

387
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,960
Is that so?

388
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:02,011
I talked to him not long ago.
He won't answer since he's driving.

389
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,469
I see.

390
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,718
Yes, I'm on my way there.

391
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,307
All right. No one has arrived yet.

392
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,892
Is your voice recorder on?

393
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,651
Cameras these days have great quality,
but the audio is bad.

394
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:18,687
Where is Mr. Jang?

395
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,815
He went to the observation room
with the detective.

396
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,363
I should be there with him.

397
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,407
The chairwoman is revising her will today.
Of course you can't.

398
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,332
Wook, you must be careful.

399
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,917
Lee Dong-min is a serial killer in a suit.

400
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,128
Once I have evidence,
I'll hand it over to Detective Shin.

401
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,052
You take care of Mr. Jang.

402
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,854
JONG-A

403
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,603
Yes, Jong-a.

404
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,773
Wook, Chairwoman Han is on the move!

405
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,734
It's Lee Dong-min's doing!

406
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,527
Kang Myeong-jin.

407
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,817
Do you remember Jang Hyeon-ji?

408
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,326
From I-Land 15 years ago.

409
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,038
I don't know.

410
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,383
You worked there part-time
when you were in high school.

411
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,460
We already checked.

412
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,173
I can't remember.

413
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,586
Goddamn it.

414
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,259
A kid went missing that day
at the amusement park

415
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,267
and your DNA was found on her backpack.

416
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,274
How are you going to explain that?

417
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:42,822
I really can't remember anything.

418
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,912
Look carefully. This is Hyeon-ji.

419
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,618
She was seven when she went missing.
Do you recognize her?

420
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,452
No, I don't.

421
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,705
Then what about this?
The headband you had.

422
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,375
That belonged to Hyeon-ji.

423
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,815
Did you see that? He knows everything.

424
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,821
He remembered everything
when he saw the headband.

425
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,871
Where is my daughter Hyeon-ji?
Where is Hyeon-ji?

426
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,616
Hey, jerk! Tell me where Hyeon-ji is!

427
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,702
Sir.

428
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,615
- You jerk!
- Sir.

429
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,335
I must find Hyeon-ji!
He knows where she is!

430
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,671
Please!

431
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,506
Okay. I'll be quiet.

432
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,684
Sir, doing this won't help
the investigation at all.

433
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,064
We'll do everything we can do to find her.
So please step out and...

434
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,642
Let me ask him just one question!

435
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,267
- We will find...
- Just one question.

436
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:06,284
Just one. Please?
He might answer my question

437
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,069
because I'm Hyeon-ji's dad.

438
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:13,373
Please trust us, sir.

439
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,289
- We will find her.
- I'll be quiet.

440
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,169
Hello, this is Bok Min-ho.

441
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,339
Okay.

442
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,892
Where is Hyeon-ji?

443
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,523
Did you kill her?

444
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,480
I told you already.

445
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,767
I don't remember.

446
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,146
It's been too long.

447
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,903
So you remember that
it's been too long? You bastard.

448
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,992
Did you kill her?

449
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,412
Where is her body?

450
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,706
You jerk! Answer me now!

451
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,547
Where is Hyeon-ji?

452
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,967
Where is Hyeon-ji, you bastard?

453
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,098
Mr. Jang, are you all right?
What did that jerk say?

454
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,063
He's still under interrogation.

455
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,273
Mr. Jang got worked up
and interrupted the interrogation.

456
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,364
- Please take him home.
- Okay.

457
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,357
I can't leave now.

458
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,690
Not like this!

459
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,775
Mr. Jang…

460
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,872
There's no sign of murder.

461
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,933
It doesn't look like
he was forced to take the drugs either.

462
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,537
Then did he really take
all those drugs himself?

463
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,668
I said he wasn't force-fed,
not that he took them on his own.

464
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,839
What is that supposed to mean?
There were no other prints on the bottle.

465
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,678
Fentanyl, oxycodone, GHB,
and Adderall were found

466
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,225
on the wine bottle and glass.

467
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,480
Just in case,
we tested other wine bottles in that room.

468
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,073
- Did they also contain drugs?
- Yes.

469
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,820
That means Han Sang-gil
wouldn't have done it himself.

470
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:17,323
If he were going to kill himself,
he would've put them in only one bottle.

471
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,406
Exactly.

472
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:23,618
He'd have felt the effects
in five minutes.

473
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,624
If he drinks it, he dies.

474
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:30,086
Even if he doesn't, he wouldn't
know that the bottle is spiked.

475
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:36,471
The culprit took a gamble,
and Han Sang-gil fell for it.

476
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,931
Anyway, I think this man was murdered.

477
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,982
Yes, sir.

478
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,428
<i>We got the forensic results</i>

479
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,728
<i>and there's an interesting photo
on the cloud. I'll send it to you now.</i>

480
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,149
Okay, thanks.

481
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,317
I can't get a hold of Chairwoman Han.

482
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,502
She's heading to Cheongpyeong.

483
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:10,384
Her villa. She's got a villa there.
Send me the address.

484
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,459
Okay.

485
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,926
- Would you like a cup of tea, ma'am?
- No, I'm good.

486
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,723
I'll wait until Wook gets here.

487
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,518
I haven't been here in a while.

488
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,097
Director Han's daughter got married here

489
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,355
in a small ceremony
with just family attending.

490
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:37,526
It would've been nice
if he'd been as frugal as his daughter.

491
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,570
His greed is what got him killed.

492
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:45,077
He had his flaws,
but he also did a lot for the company.

493
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,118
You shouldn't speak ill of the dead.

494
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,287
You still have no idea
what kind of man he really was.

495
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,957
Yes, I got Yoo Seong-ho out of the way.

496
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,934
That jerk used to take bribes!

497
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,600
It wasn't that big of an amount.

498
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,889
Look at you,
acting like you're above it all.

499
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,683
Quit acting.

500
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,227
All you need is that old lady's money, no?

501
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,361
What good will that do?

502
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,992
Each person is worth something different.

503
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,948
Right.

504
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,541
I knew you were planning something.

505
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,503
Check your inbox. I've sent you a gift.

506
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,478
Who introduced you to a thug like that?

507
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:55,309
Well, it reminds me of the old days.

508
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,818
We hired thugs to kick out residents
for the redevelopment project.

509
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,913
We worked so hard back then.

510
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,621
Room service.

511
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,662
Room service?

512
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,293
I didn't call them.

513
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,569
You even ordered room service?

514
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,070
You're an ass,

515
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,156
but you're classy.

516
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:55,787
We should enjoy good wine with good food.

517
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,748
<i>I asked you to tell me
what kind of person he was.</i>

518
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,133
Director Han was a lowlife.

519
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,005
That's why he took his own life

520
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,682
by taking too much of the alcohol
and drugs that he loved.

521
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,142
By the way, what's taking Wook so long?

522
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,642
Are you sure he knows
we changed the meeting place?

523
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:19,438
You mean your fake grandson
who's not related to you at all?

524
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,861
He's probably in your office by now.

525
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,989
DNA TEST RESULTS

526
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:34,366
With this,
everyone will know that he's fake.

527
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,291
As for you, you were shocked
to find out that he wasn't your grandson,

528
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,167
so you came to the villa
to get some fresh air

529
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:46,474
and then had a heart attack.

530
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,179
What are you doing right now?

531
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,313
Everything will go according to your will.

532
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,893
You were going to give the shares

533
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,357
to me anyway.

534
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:08,988
<i>Yes, Detective Shin.</i>

535
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,833
Where is Kim Wook now?
He's not picking up.

536
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,038
<i>Wook is headed to the chairwoman's villa.</i>

537
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,159
<i>I think Lee Dong-min
kidnapped Chairwoman Han.</i>

538
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,971
DETECTIVE SHIN JUN-HO

539
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,337
You're the one

540
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,889
who killed Kim Su-yeon.

541
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,238
Chairwoman Han!

542
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,259
Who the hell are you?
Why do you keep getting in my way?

543
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,490
Stop!

544
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,377
Hey, Kim Wook! Wake up!

545
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,839
Kim Wook! Wake up! Kim Wook!

546
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,192
Wook, are you awake?

547
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,783
- Where am I?
- We're at a hospital.

548
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,695
Did I pass out?

549
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:01,793
You had a good sleep.
Lee Dong-min had propofol and diclofenac…

550
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,630
Anyway, he stuck a syringe in your neck,

551
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,749
but luckily, the drug didn't go
in completely.

552
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,630
What about Chairwoman Han?

553
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,343
She's in the VIP room.

554
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:16,343
She hit her head as she was falling,
but it wasn't life-threatening.

555
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,801
- Did you catch Lee Dong-min?
- Yes.

556
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,018
But he won't say a word.

557
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,846
Lee Dong-min killed Kim Su-yeon.

558
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,233
He's the man I saw when I was young.

559
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,858
Where is he now?

560
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,159
Follow me.

561
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,086
Did you take Chairwoman Han
to the villa to kill her?

562
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,177
Stalling for time is pointless.

563
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,685
Where is the woman…

564
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,654
You told Manager Wang to abduct?

565
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:34,166
Where is she, you bastard?

566
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,692
Please wait there.

567
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,751
<i>Mr. Jang Pan-seok.</i>

568
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,287
Your visitation has been denied
by inmate Kang Myeong-jin.

569
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,259
Mr. Jang Pan-seok.

570
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,344
Yes.

571
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,347
Your visitation has been denied.

572
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,694
Next, please.

573
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:50,655
Kim Wook, you saved my life.

574
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:53,627
I should have known that

575
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,254
Lee Dong-min would do
something unexpected.

576
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,211
It's my fault…

577
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,224
He would've tried to harm me
one way or another.

578
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,010
So that he would get the shares
as stated in my will.

579
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,694
I can't believe I kept someone like that
by my side for over 30 years.

580
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,244
You ran this DNA test here, right?

581
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,237
It was requested by Lee Dong-min, right?

582
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,784
Looks like I'm right.

583
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,747
Show me all the DNA tests
you ran for the last three months.

584
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,408
- That's confidential…
- Here is the warrant.

585
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,628
We're all busy here,
so I need your full cooperation.

586
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,128
- Go inside.
- Yes, sir.

587
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,669
Sir.

588
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,436
Please track where these two cars
have been during this time period.

589
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,717
Okay, I will.

590
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,301
I'm sure they met up
in person at one point.

591
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,557
Thank you.

592
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,639
No problem.

593
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,557
SEOUL SEOBUK POLICE STATION

594
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,520
Hey. Did you find it?

595
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,356
Send me the files now.

596
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:03,567
We found a drug dealer
who sold you fentanyl, oxycodone,

597
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,324
and Adderall the day
before Han Sang-gil died.

598
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,990
You paid him in cryptocurrency
and it was delivered via courier.

599
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,998
And two days later, you bought propofol
and diclofenac using the same method.

600
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,551
The drugs you were going
to use to kill Chairwoman Han

601
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,928
and make it look like a heart attack.

602
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,392
<i>Looks like you have enough evidence.</i>

603
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,104
What more do you need?

604
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,689
It's all circumstantial.

605
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:39,521
But he was caught red-handed
while injecting Wook with drugs!

606
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:43,316
That's not enough to prove
all the murders he committed.

607
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,743
I saw him with my own eyes!

608
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,655
I was there the day he killed
Kim Su-yeon 27 years ago,

609
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,164
and when he tried to kill
Chairwoman Han two days ago.

610
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,917
My mom, who was murdered by him…

611
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,918
She's right there.

612
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,590
Without knowing why she was killed

613
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,258
or where her body is.

614
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,009
She's been there for 27 years!

615
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,386
Do you know what he took from me?

616
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,141
Everything. Okay?

617
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,557
He took everything from me!

618
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,727
What more…

619
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,524
What more do you need?

620
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:24,358
What more do you need?

621
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:36,158
Mr. Jang visits Kang Myeong-jin every day,
but he keeps getting denied visitation.

622
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,996
Why won't he come out to meet Mr. Jang?
He should crawl out of there

623
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,173
and apologize to Mr. Jang
a million times over!

624
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,672
If he had the decency to do that,

625
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,755
he wouldn't have committed
all those murders.

626
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,720
Everyone died a wrongful death,

627
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,509
and the ones who should be dead are alive.

628
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:58,225
Wook said Mr. Jang won't eat or sleep.

629
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,940
I'm worried that something bad
might happen to Mr. Jang.

630
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,226
The living need to go on living.

631
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,938
We shouldn't just sit here.

632
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,990
Let's do what we can.

633
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,074
What?

634
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,832
Let's go.

635
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,870
Hey, Beom-su! I'm not going!

636
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,628
Uncle asked me to get you.

637
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:25,208
- Which uncle? Thomas?
- Yes.

638
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,045
Why does he want to see us?

639
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,880
Aunt Yeo-na and my mom asked us
to bring you guys over too.

640
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,547
Okay, fine.
I'll go, so let go of me first.

641
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,638
- Hey, buddy.
- Okay? Let's go.

642
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,393
Hey! I said I'm not going!

643
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,026
My goodness, you've lost so much
weight in the past few days.

644
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,578
You look more dead than we do.

645
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,332
I actually think he looks worse.
He looks like a zombie.

646
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,416
A zombie?

647
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,461
A walking corpse.
That's what I'm like these days.

648
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,934
Is it a special day today?

649
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,348
We prepared this for the two of you
since you seem exhausted these days.

650
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,601
I can't believe we're getting
comforted by the dead.

651
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,392
Let's eat before the food gets cold.
I made all this myself.

652
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,886
She cooked all the side dishes.

653
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,651
- Thank you for the food.
- Eat up, guys.

654
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,527
Have some scorched rice water.

655
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:41,406
When you don't have an appetite, it's good
to have something easy to swallow.

656
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,300
This is your favorite food.
This is Jun-su's favorite food.

657
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,178
I like everything here.

658
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,144
You only ate braised potatoes
when you were young,

659
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,386
and left out the carrots.

660
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,895
I still like them without the carrots.

661
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,413
What is it? Is there a problem?

662
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,790
No, it's nothing.

663
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,680
You can tell me. What's going on?

664
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:51,612
We caught Aunt Su-yeon's murderer.

665
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,492
He got arrested,

666
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,490
but he won't talk.

667
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,327
Aunt Su-yeon, you, Detective Park,

668
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,001
Nam-guk, and Yeo-na…

669
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,876
It was all his doing.

670
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,090
But there's nothing

671
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,589
I can do anymore.

672
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:23,721
Because I'm not a cop,
I can't even ask him anything.

673
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,772
Well, what's important
is that you caught the murderer.

674
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:35,189
That's more than enough for me.

675
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:39,317
What matters is that you're alive.
That's more than enough for me.

676
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,735
No, it's not enough.

677
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,749
Do you know how much I resented you?

678
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,053
You disappeared after writing me
a letter saying that you'll be back soon.

679
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,139
But you didn't come back, Mom.
So I resented you for years.

680
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,098
But…

681
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,602
But you were here.

682
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:16,034
I said so many bad things about you, Mom.

683
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,618
I'm sorry.

684
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,371
I'm so sorry.

685
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,498
What are you apologizing for?

686
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,839
The jerk who should be apologizing
is out there.

687
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,256
Wook.

688
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,715
What's wrong?

689
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,184
Wook just left.

690
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:53,146
Did he say something harsh to you again?
Did you guys fight?

691
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,191
Wook called me "Mom."

692
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,873
He called me "Mom" for the first time.

693
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,225
Get up.

694
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,443
- We have to go somewhere.
- Where? It's late.

695
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,818
You said you have a question for him.

696
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,233
Then go and ask.

697
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,412
He's in the holding cell, right?

698
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,254
You must have a lot on your mind
because of Hyeon-ji.

699
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,830
Why are you doing this for me?

700
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,745
Because I haven't had a chance.

701
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,341
I have so many questions for him
and things to say,

702
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,631
but I haven't been able
to hear a thing from him.

703
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,835
I haven't even had the chance
to sit before him.

704
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,934
This might be your last chance.

705
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,230
So go in there
and say what you want to say.

706
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,732
Thank you.

707
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,487
Detective Shin, it's me.

708
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,401
You again?

709
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:09,990
You look totally fine.

710
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,196
Are you pretending to be sick?

711
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,504
What an idiot.

712
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,996
Right, I'm an idiot.

713
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,468
Then what about you?
Did you kill people because you're smart?

714
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,305
Do you know Kim Su-yeon?

715
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,810
Of course I do.

716
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,941
You killed Kim Su-yeon.

717
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,185
I saw everything.

718
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,818
You were in a gray suit, weren't you?

719
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:57,575
Who are you? What were you doing there?

720
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,586
My mom was the chairwoman's housekeeper.

721
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,432
So I would often spend time there.

722
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,511
I was there
the day you killed Aunt Su-yeon too.

723
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:22,274
No wonder you grew up ignorant.
You grew up without a mother.

724
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:38,408
What did you just say?
How do you know I grew up without a mom?

725
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,457
Because I killed her.

726
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,804
I killed them.

727
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,378
Su-yeon. Your mom.

728
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,425
The three from the children's home
and Han Sang-gil.

729
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,393
I killed all of them.

730
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:04,022
If you hadn't made a sound that day,
I wouldn't have killed the housekeeper.

731
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,146
Your mom died because of you.

732
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:17,410
Do you understand?
Your mom died because of you.

733
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,672
Why?

734
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,586
Why did you kill my mom?

735
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,456
Why?

736
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,068
{\an8}<i>We've met before, haven't we?</i>

737
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,414
{\an8}<i>Just tell me where Hyeon-ji is.</i>

738
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,160
{\an8}<i>I have a feeling that Hyeon-ji
is around here.</i>

739
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,753
{\an8}<i>Yeo-na died because of me.</i>

740
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,458
{\an8}So I got rid of some obstacles.
Did I do something wrong?

741
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,080
{\an8}Because of some man's greed…

742
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,286
{\an8}<i>Many people lost their lives.</i>

743
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,587
{\an8}I've missed you a lot.

744
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,961
{\an8}I've missed you a lot.

745
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,337
{\an8}<i>I love you, Wook.</i>

746
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,593
{\an8}We're a team that finds people.

747
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,176
{\an8}<i>He'll find you no matter what.</i>

748
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,721
{\an8}<i>Someone must look after the village.
Thank you for everything.</i>

749
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:22,225
