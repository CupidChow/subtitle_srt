1
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,619
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,747
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,104
What day is today?

4
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,928
I lost count after the 500th day.

5
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,020
Your efforts were in vain.
It's meaningless to count the days here.

6
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,515
That may be the case for you, Thomas.

7
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,978
But I'm different.

8
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,815
Consider yourself lucky
that you're different from me.

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
What?

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,870
Are you going to stab me?

11
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,497
I already did it

12
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,957
several times in my head.

13
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,878
Turn on the light!

14
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,718
Turn on the light!

15
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,433
Turn on the light, Thomas!

16
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,024
You're violating my human rights!

17
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,701
Who are you?

18
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
Where's Thomas?

19
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,538
Thomas didn't come with you?

20
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,048
He locked me up in here. Undo this for me!

21
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,380
Why would Thomas…

22
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,005
I don't know!

23
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,352
He's a frightening man.
He's more than he seems!

24
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,429
Here…

25
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:05,442
He wouldn't lock someone up for no reason.

26
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,808
Let's go.

27
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,145
Wait!

28
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,515
You guys are dead, aren't you?

29
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,899
I'm not dead. I'm alive!

30
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,528
What did he just say?

31
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,834
Yeo-na, let's get out of here.

32
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,700
No. Wait! Hey!

33
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:36,633
That man just said that he's alive.
You heard it too, right?

34
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Yes.

35
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,430
Go and call Thomas.
Let's meet at Café Hawaii.

36
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,104
- Where are you going?
- To get Mr. Jang.

37
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,944
- Let's go.
- Okay.

38
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,605
Mr. Jang!

39
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,113
Mr. Jang!

40
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,859
What's all this fuss about?

41
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,525
We're not the only living people here!
There's someone else!

42
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,075
What are you talking about?

43
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,948
You didn't know either?

44
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,285
Who are they?

45
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,749
His name is Hwang Du-cheol.

46
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,618
There were others too.

47
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,379
There are five in total.
There used to be seven,

48
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,632
but two of them disappeared one day.

49
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,335
Why did you lock them up?

50
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,176
Because they're evil.

51
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,971
I get that, but even so, it's a little…

52
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,175
If Woo Il-seok hadn't disappeared,

53
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,523
I would've locked him up as well.

54
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:33,652
I can't let people who assault women,
take children hostage, and wield a knife

55
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,861
roam free.

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,780
Hwang Du-cheol?
He said he's different from us.

57
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,281
He said he's alive.

58
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,867
Right.

59
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,198
He's different from us.

60
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,378
In this world, he deceived us

61
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,418
and in the outside world,
he scammed our families.

62
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,009
And when he ran out of money,
he looked for new prey.

63
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,006
He swindled people
who miss their loved ones.

64
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,511
What he did was

65
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,143
kill those who were already dead.

66
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,519
Are you sure he's alive?

67
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,570
- Yes.
- You said the living can't see us.

68
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,439
You said they can't see me
no matter what I do.

69
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,607
But that man even talked to me.

70
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,866
Wook, you saw it too. Say something.

71
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,118
Right, I saw it too.

72
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:31,121
I don't know why he can see us.

73
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,496
All I can tell you is that he's different

74
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,415
and he used that difference
to do bad things.

75
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,884
That's enough.

76
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,264
It's getting late.
Let's talk again tomorrow.

77
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,885
Take her home.

78
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,523
Mr. Jang's right. It's getting late.

79
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,809
Let's go.

80
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,737
Do you believe what Thomas said?

81
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,495
What?

82
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,503
Do you believe that man is alive?

83
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,462
What about you? Do you believe him?

84
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,669
I don't know.

85
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,591
When I first met you on the hill,

86
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,429
Jun-ho was there.

87
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,728
I shouted out and called his name,

88
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,101
but he didn't see me and just drove on.

89
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,559
Right, I remember.

90
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,609
Jun-ho can't see me,

91
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,200
so how come that man can?

92
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,412
Good question.

93
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,119
I wonder why.

94
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,707
There are two possibilities.

95
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:59,344
Either Thomas is lying,
or that man is lying.

96
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,628
Or…

97
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,755
They're both right.

98
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,853
The things that happen in this village

99
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,809
don't make sense at all.

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,940
When it came to village affairs,

101
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,991
I let you take care of things
and observed from a distance,

102
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,991
but I was surprised this time.

103
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,204
Why?

104
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:36,793
- Because I locked up a living person?
- No, that's not why.

105
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,963
Why did you do it by yourself?
You could have tipped me off.

106
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,553
What would that have changed?

107
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:48,224
Instead of keeping him locked up here,
I could've reported him to the police.

108
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,511
Hwang Du-cheol is a sly snake.

109
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,262
He's nothing like you.

110
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,518
He never mourned the dead...

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,520
Why are you taking on that burden
on your own?

112
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,572
Because I'm on my own.

113
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,532
Many people have come and gone
from this place.

114
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,447
To me, you're also just someone
who will pass through this village.

115
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,039
You know what?

116
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,086
Even though
our circumstances are different,

117
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,757
I thought we were companions
walking the same path…

118
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,686
But I guess it was just me.

119
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,860
Am I just someone who will disappear
one day like the wind?

120
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,414
That's really upsetting.

121
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,016
<i>He's different from us.</i>

122
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,943
In this world, he deceived us

123
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,281
and in the outside world,
he scammed our families.

124
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,108
I'm not dead. I'm alive!

125
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,214
I can somewhat understand Thomas,
but not completely.

126
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,829
I feel bad for him.

127
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,377
Well, that too.

128
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,458
But there's someone else

129
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,168
who can see the dead other than us.

130
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,178
That's right.

131
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,097
The fact that Yeo-na knows
is bothering me.

132
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,430
What if you and I get caught?

133
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,557
That's why you must be extra careful.

134
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:19,701
<i>What's the use of skin and bones?
We can only trust our comrades.</i>

135
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,501
<i>I don't blame anyone.</i>

136
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,249
<i>I'm sure this too shall pass.</i>

137
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,564
{\an8}I had no idea there was a place like this.

138
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,651
{\an8}- How many are locked up in here, anyway?
- Five, according to Thomas.

139
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,605
{\an8}Let me go, you bastard!

140
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,325
{\an8}It's the jerk who wielded an axe at me!

141
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,040
{\an8}He disappeared one day,
so I thought he went to hell.

142
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,536
{\an8}But he was right here.

143
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,884
{\an8}- You know just by hearing his voice?
- How could I forget his voice?

144
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,800
{\an8}A lowlife like that should rot
behind bars for a hundred years.

145
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,683
Thomas!

146
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:23,851
Thomas, I'm sorry.
Please turn on the light!

147
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,443
Hey, it's been a while, Detective Park!

148
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,072
Do you guys know each other?

149
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,444
You bastard! Because of you, my mother…

150
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,358
Do you know how she died?

151
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,366
Come on, it's a misunderstanding!

152
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,699
Is he the guy who stole
your mother's money?

153
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,495
Yes.

154
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,828
You took her life's savings
and promised her that you'd find me.

155
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,915
Because of you, my mother

156
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,461
died of stress!

157
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,837
What? How did you know that?

158
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,844
Did another living person come here
other than me?

159
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,968
Why do you want to know that? Why?

160
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,305
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- No!

161
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,311
- That's not true! Detective Park!
- Let go of me!

162
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,225
- Come on!
- You can't just leave me here!

163
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,532
That bastard…

164
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,080
So that con artist was Hwang Du-cheol.

165
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,828
Right?

166
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,711
If you hadn't visited

167
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,326
my mother in my hometown,

168
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,672
I would've never known
about what he did to my family.

169
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,758
Thomas only locked up
the worst kind of criminals!

170
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,965
We shouldn't release these jerks!

171
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,065
Come in.

172
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,498
Have you been eating? You've lost weight.

173
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,584
I'm fine.

174
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,001
What brings you here?

175
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,261
How's the search for Yeo-na going?

176
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,222
Are you even worried about her?

177
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,060
Jun-ho. How can you say that?

178
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,481
I know you hate her.

179
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,232
You never approved of our marriage.

180
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,612
I don't want her as my daughter-in-law,

181
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,399
but I'm still worried about her.

182
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,533
There's news of her disappearance,

183
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,110
and she's yet to be found even though
you've been searching day and night.

184
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,737
It makes me think something bad
might have happened to her.

185
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,785
Of course I'm worried about her.

186
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,615
We haven't found her yet.

187
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,754
Does it have something to do
with the children's home?

188
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,174
I heard Myeong-gyu and Nam-guk died too.

189
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:05,337
Yes, I think so. It's an ongoing case,
so I can't go into detail.

190
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,601
Mom, I need to get going. Get home safe.

191
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,399
<i>I'm looking for my grandchild.</i>

192
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,029
My daughter's child.

193
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,699
I believe the child might've been sent to
a children's home about 30 years ago.

194
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,868
It's been many years,
but I'm looking for them now.

195
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,830
Why is this happening now?

196
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,306
Why did you ask to see me?

197
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,527
After hearing what you said,
I gave the matter a lot of thought.

198
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,863
If something horrible is happening
because of me,

199
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,986
I must stop it.
That's why I wanted to see you.

200
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,372
This is a copy of my will.

201
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,460
As you saw on the news,
I'm going to donate all of my wealth.

202
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:23,012
And I'm going to give my company shares
to these three people listed in my will.

203
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,548
WILL

204
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,722
But only if I fail to find my grandchild.

205
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,012
So these three will benefit
from these deaths.

206
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,353
Do they all know the contents of the will?

207
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:40,562
But the details of my will were announced
after the accidents took place.

208
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:47,737
Why are you looking
for your grandchild after all these years?

209
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,698
After making up my mind to write a will,
I started to look back on my life.

210
00:15:55,663 --> 00:16:00,673
Among my daughter's things that
I couldn't throw away for 27 years,

211
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,591
I found her diary.

212
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,675
All this time,
I thought she had a miscarriage,

213
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,298
but when I read her diary,
it sounded like she had a baby.

214
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,431
The moment I read that,
my heart began to race.

215
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,400
When my daughter was pregnant,
she got into a car accident.

216
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,944
After that, I wasn't able
to communicate with her.

217
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:31,121
Then one day, when she was home alone,
she got into another accident…

218
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,699
And unfortunately passed away.

219
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:45,302
Are you sure she was alone at home
when the accident occurred?

220
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,336
My housekeeper came back
from grocery shopping and reported it.

221
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,965
My daughter had been alone.

222
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,352
This is my daughter, Su-yeon.

223
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,349
If you find anything suspicious

224
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,396
about my daughter's death,
please get to the bottom of it.

225
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,150
I will fully cooperate.

226
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,494
Okay, thank you.

227
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,409
Oh. I'm not sure if this will help,

228
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,372
but not long ago,
the housekeeper's son came to see me.

229
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,002
- You mean Kim Wook?
- Do you know him?

230
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,079
What did he say?

231
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,165
That his mother also died
after Su-yeon died.

232
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,803
His mother died?

233
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,218
How many people did you lock up?

234
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,191
- Goodness, you're scary.
- What do you mean he's scary?

235
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,729
It's scarier to have criminals
roam around the village.

236
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,523
She's right. After getting stabbed,

237
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,148
I stayed home for days because
I was terrified of running into him.

238
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,066
Still, he should've taken a vote.
Am I wrong?

239
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,866
That's what I'm saying!

240
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,159
There might be innocent people
who got locked up.

241
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,253
I'm saying this as a former cop.

242
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,869
Those jerks would've been locked up
in jail even if they were alive.

243
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,707
If you let them go,
none of you will sleep in peace.

244
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,424
I didn't say we should let them go.

245
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,174
I just want order in the village.

246
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,795
This village doesn't always
get good people like you.

247
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,803
Some had committed evil acts
and some were cruel.

248
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,137
Because I know you must've all
experienced hardship when you were alive,

249
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:24,194
I wanted you all to be at peace here.

250
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,237
I'll stay out of it,

251
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,411
so take a vote or let him go.
Do whatever you want.

252
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,621
You want order? Please.

253
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,917
You'll be gone the second
your bodies are found.

254
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,171
Thomas took care of the dirty work
because he has a good heart.

255
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,375
Exactly.

256
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,514
Just think about this for a minute.

257
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,721
It's all thanks to Thomas
that we're able to live comfortably.

258
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,763
Whenever you need help,
you look for Thomas.

259
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,767
But did any of you look out for him?

260
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,269
According to your logic,
Thomas didn't have to do anything.

261
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:08,231
But every time something happened
in the village, he took care of it

262
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,193
and locked up the bad guys.

263
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,654
Of course we're grateful for what
he has done for us.

264
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,784
Instead of sitting back and giving orders,

265
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,612
go catch the bad guys
and punish them yourselves!

266
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,827
- Let's just leave them.
- We should know this.

267
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,286
We should be grateful.

268
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,836
- Exactly.
- I agree.

269
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,169
I'm starting to feel bad.

270
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,130
Jun-su's mom.

271
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,390
Why don't you go and console Thomas?

272
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,680
He did all the dirty work,
yet he got blamed.

273
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,805
I feel sorry for him.

274
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,404
Who am I to console him?
I'm just a wind that will be gone one day.

275
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,398
Never mind.

276
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,322
The police are looking for Jang-mi.

277
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,279
Really?

278
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,702
Her colleague filed a report.

279
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,372
You're close to Jang-mi.
Did she tell you anything?

280
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,713
When that law student was here,

281
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,828
she said she had evidence
of her killer's crimes hidden somewhere.

282
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,288
What did she hide? And where?

283
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,547
I have no idea.

284
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,841
Hyeon-mi, are you okay?

285
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,553
Jang-mi, come here!

286
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,047
After they heard what you said,
they became quiet and left.

287
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,602
I don't like them.

288
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,180
Jang-mi.

289
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,015
The guy you call a piece of trash.

290
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,981
You have proof of what he did to you
hidden somewhere, right?

291
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,233
Right. I saved it on a flash drive
and hid it somewhere safe.

292
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,025
Where did you hide it?

293
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,571
The place I used to work.

294
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,364
Why do you ask?

295
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,992
Jun-su's mom was telling me
about how smart you are.

296
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,208
Come on, if I was smart,
I wouldn't have gotten beaten up.

297
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,919
In order to report him to the cops,

298
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,419
I took videos of him hitting me
and of him doing drugs

299
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,462
and hid them in the ladies' room,

300
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:00,223
but I died without telling anyone.
It was completely useless!

301
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,760
No, it's a jackpot!

302
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,177
If the cops find that,
he'll be locked up for sure.

303
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,807
But

304
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,135
I don't want them to find it.

305
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,477
Why not?

306
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:15,771
Because if they do, he'll get arrested
and my body will be located.

307
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,607
Then I'll have to leave this place.

308
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,867
- I love it here.
- How naïve of you.

309
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,695
Hey, who knows?
You might go somewhere even better.

310
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,196
But you won't be there.

311
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,249
Or Thomas,

312
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,462
Beom-su,

313
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,626
Yeong-ho,

314
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,670
and Mr. Jang.

315
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,383
It's not that I like this place.

316
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,393
I like the people here.

317
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,468
I guess you guys grew on me.

318
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,812
Don't get too attached.
It'll only give you a hard time later.

319
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,441
After Ms. Choi left,
I kept seeing things for a while.

320
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Too bad.

321
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,114
I already like you.

322
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,861
- Go away.
- No!

323
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,444
Go away!

324
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,530
I'm jealous of your friendship.
I should get going.

325
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,197
Did we make him feel left out?

326
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:22,472
- I had so much fun on Memory Day.
- What? Why aren't there any photos?

327
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,549
Whose photos?

328
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,342
Never mind.

329
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,927
There aren't any photos
of that handsome guy or Mr. Jang.

330
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,597
Well, Mr. Jang was busy
taking photos of us.

331
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,935
Wook was busy too.

332
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,020
He installed all the lights here
and helped me with the projector.

333
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,107
Did he?

334
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,568
<i>I see.</i>

335
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,278
Let's go. I told the kids to play outside.

336
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,536
- Bye.
- See you.

337
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:38,999
You're a workaholic, aren't you?
I've never seen you take a break.

338
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,960
You're either working at the café
or working on something here.

339
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:49,176
Or you're going around the village
and fixing all the broken things.

340
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,261
Or

341
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,426
You're catching bad guys
and locking them up yourself.

342
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,269
There you go again.

343
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,818
Hey, be honest.

344
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,109
You've never closed the café
and taken a day off, right?

345
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,242
So you've never done it.

346
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,035
You've never taken a day off.

347
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,946
In the outside world,

348
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,497
you're not supposed to work
more than 52 hours a week.

349
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,212
Working too much is an illness.
You need to get it treated.

350
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,963
Living diligently is an illness?

351
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,799
- I've never heard of that before.
- I'm not joking.

352
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,511
You don't get any recognition
even if you work hard all by yourself.

353
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,136
What's your point?
I want to be alone, so please leave.

354
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,604
I just told you.

355
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,556
Don't try to do it all on your own.

356
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:46,149
You have me and Mr. Jang.
What are friends for?

357
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:51,994
We can share your burden,
catch the bad guys together,

358
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,411
and get blamed for it together too.

359
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,833
Damn, you look so serious.

360
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,261
I'm off.

361
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,790
Are you sad that there's no photo of you?

362
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,631
Speaking of which, Ms. Kim was wondering
why there weren't any photos of you.

363
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Photos of me?

364
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,804
Yes, only you and Mr. Jang
are missing in the photos.

365
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,303
It's because I look better in person.

366
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,603
The camera can't capture
my handsome looks.

367
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,356
So how did the hearing go?

368
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,776
Thomas seemed crestfallen. Poor guy.

369
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,325
You sound like a father
who's worried about his child.

370
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,870
What do you mean? I'm a bachelor.

371
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,035
Anyway, it wasn't really a hearing.

372
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,004
Jun-su's mom was…

373
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,165
I mean your mom was furious.

374
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,594
Who?

375
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,052
Your mom.

376
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,472
Mom…

377
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,466
This feels weird.

378
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:43,095
Maybe it's because I've been
without a mom for so long.

379
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,935
She did sound really angry.

380
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,902
What? Were you there?

381
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,442
I was just passing by.

382
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:56,026
Her voice was so loud that
I could hear everything from outside.

383
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,374
You have a temper just like her,

384
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,750
but your mom always says what's right,
while you always talk nonsense.

385
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,459
What do you mean?

386
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,496
My problem is that I'm too righteous.

387
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,877
Anyway, this must run in the family.

388
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,049
Yes. By the way, we need to go somewhere

389
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,259
later tonight.

390
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,934
- Where?
- To find Jang-mi's killer.

391
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,978
Jang-mi took videos of what he did
and hid them somewhere.

392
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,984
Give Ms. Lee a heads-up.

393
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:33,074
- Is Jong-a joining us?
- Yes. We need her.

394
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,159
Why don't you gain weight
when you eat so much?

395
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,035
I get bloated just from drinking water.

396
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,880
You shouldn't eat too much.
Idols need to stay fit.

397
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,764
Oh, right. Did a guy
with a ponytail come by today?

398
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,104
No.

399
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,889
That's weird. I ran into him in the hall
when I went out to get lunch.

400
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,644
He was looking at our shop,
so I thought he was a client.

401
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,357
I ran into him again
in front of the elevator just now.

402
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,438
Really?

403
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
One second.

404
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,487
Hey, Wook.

405
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,990
Tonight? I don't have plans.

406
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,201
Yes, okay. All right.

407
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,326
Hey, Dae-seong.
I have to leave early tonight.

408
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,826
I just made plans.

409
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,457
How can I eat all this by myself?

410
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,918
Were you going to finish it?
You have to keep in shape.

411
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,799
I'm going to eat it all!

412
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,011
Ms. Lee should be here by now.
Why is she so late?

413
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,112
What? You told me to dress up for a party.

414
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,189
Is this how you usually dress up?

415
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,239
You look like a different person.
I almost didn't recognize you.

416
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,716
Are you two trying to look like you're
going to a company dinner?

417
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,910
You look like the department head.

418
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,662
- And Wook, you're...
- A waiter.

419
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:10,421
Come on, that's tacky. I'm not a waiter!
How do I look like a waiter?

420
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,748
You totally look like one.

421
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,209
I booked a room under my name. Let's go.

422
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,636
Hey. What if you get drunk?
We're here for work.

423
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,057
I wanted a sip so this expensive liquor
wouldn't go to waste.

424
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,105
Anyway, what are we here to do?
Why don't we need a laptop or a plan?

425
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,531
I told you all we need is you.

426
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,664
What? You're making my heart flutter.

427
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,619
We just need you to go
to the ladies' room and get something,

428
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,240
since Wook and I can't go
in there ourselves.

429
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,498
He's right.
If we tried that, we'd get arrested.

430
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,461
We will stand guard, though.

431
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,341
If it's something in the ladies' room,
it must belong to a woman.

432
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,340
Is it a recording of an affair? Or a drug?

433
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,091
It's neither.

434
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,404
TOILET

435
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,399
<i>There's a key inside the storage room door
in front of the toilet.</i>

436
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,911
<i>The key opens the tissue dispenser
in the second stall.</i>

437
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,996
<i>Look inside the hole.</i>

438
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,093
What's in here?

439
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,849
<i>I didn't do anything!</i>

440
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,431
<i>- I said I didn't do anything!
- You want to die? Shut up.</i>

441
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,111
What a jerk!

442
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,912
What's taking so long?

443
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,369
What if someone else found it already?

444
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:09,992
Or maybe it's gone.

445
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,043
Jong-a!

446
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,749
Jong-a!

447
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,002
Gosh, my head hurts.

448
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,802
What are you looking at?

449
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,850
I haven't seen you before.
Are you new here?

450
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,149
Let's have a drink in my room.

451
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,320
- I'll be your regular customer.
- Why would I go to your room?

452
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,862
Are you high?

453
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,277
How dare a bar girl talk back
to a customer?

454
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,746
Listen, I'm also a paying customer
who came here to have a drink.

455
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,368
And did you call me a bar girl?

456
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,785
How dare you mock someone's job
in this day and age?

457
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,338
You also just touched me and hit on me.

458
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,499
I won't let it slide.

459
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,627
Do you have a death wish?

460
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,179
Who the hell are you?
Did you say death wish?

461
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,799
Are you talking about yourself?

462
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,596
Babe, are you all right?

463
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,481
He just groped me.

464
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,978
- Hey, I didn't grope you!
- You bastard!

465
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,935
You damned jerk. How dare you grope her?

466
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,937
I could break your wrist
as if they were twigs.

467
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,281
We're onto you.

468
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,617
That jerk is the guy in the video.

469
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,078
Are you sure?

470
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,537
Yes. Should we go to the police now?

471
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,298
- Why the police?
- To hand over the flash drive.

472
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,841
We must report him to the police
to teach him a lesson!

473
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,394
No.

474
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,890
Not yet.

475
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,350
Why not?
This video will get him arrested for sure.

476
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,271
There's more.

477
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,439
We're going to find more evidence
to send him packing.

478
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,979
Is that what the client wants?

479
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,442
- The lady in the video?
- Yes.

480
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,863
Who is she anyway?

481
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,650
What?

482
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,357
Someone I know.

483
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,565
What?

484
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,617
You look nice when you smile.

485
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,881
Keep on smiling while you can.

486
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,508
- Hello?
<i>- What should I do?</i>

487
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,429
Forget about the guys.

488
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,348
Just get the girl.

What do you mean
he'll be sentenced next week?

497
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,282
<i>You said you went to the trial.

<i>He confessed and the evidence was clear.</i>

Come on! Kang Myeong-jin is toying
with you! Can't you see that?

00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,248
Didn't Jun-ho say anything?

<i>He did. So we went through

Okay, fine. I'm hanging up. Bye!

Hey, Detective Lee.

505
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,846
- Print out the files on Kang Myeong-jin.
- Yes, sir.

506

What are you guys doing?

509
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:14,069
This old lady's case. Wasn't it
on the TV show, <i>Unresolved Questions?</i>

510
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,590
Her body was tied up with twine
and abandoned in a field of reeds.

511
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,244
She used to collect scrap paper.
Why are you looking at that case?

512
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,156
To catch Kang Myeong-jin.

513
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,325
There are two missing person cases too.

If anyone asks, we're investigating
missing person cases in this neighborhood.

515
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,457
- Okay.
- Call the local police.

516
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,205
And submit this old lady's evidence
for DNA testing.

517
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,127
Since it was from 2006,
we might get some new information.

00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,297

We already arrested Kang Myeong-jin.
What more is there to investigate?

520
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,224
Just let us run a DNA comparison test.

521
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,137
We're using existing evidence anyway.

522
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,766
Once we secure her DNA,
should I compare it to Kang Myeong-jin's?

523
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,855
Why are you asking him?

524
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,400
Seriously!

525
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,943
Do whatever you want.

526
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,486
If any issues arise,
make sure you take responsibility.

527
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,701
I'll get going then.

528
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,486
We have so many other cases.

529
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,197
Why are you looking into someone
we've already arrested?

530
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,168
Kang Myeong-jin

531
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,832
didn't just kill Kim Mi-ok.

532
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,125
Trust me.

533
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,301
If I'm wrong,

534
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,050
I'll be…

535
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,091
I'll be your son.

536
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,054
If you were my son, I would've...

537
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,425
- Stop it!
- Fine! Do whatever you want!

538
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,802
Thomas told me everything.
What you did was horrible.

539
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:07,016
Nothing in the world is for free.
Right, Miss?

540
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,769
To be honest,
I've been through a lot as well.

541
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,813
I don't care about your life story.

542
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,528
- Prove it.
- Prove what?

543
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,149
That you're alive.

544
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,992
That you're different from me.

545
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,163
Miss.

546
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,041
That thing in your pocket.
Is that a knife?

547
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,655
I'm just asking because

548
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,379
I want you to use that knife to stab me.

549
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,248
Don't try to play tricks on me.

550
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,495
You asked me to show you proof!

551
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:40,547
Play along and stab me.
I won't feel a thing.

552
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,106
Fascinating, isn't it?

553
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:02,364
I won't feel a thing
even if you stab me, beat me, or kick me.

554
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,157
No wonder Thomas is furious.

555
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:10,081
That's why he locked me up in here.
Because this is the only way to harass me.

556
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:14,462
How can you see me when you're alive?

557
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,302
At first, I didn't believe that
everyone in this village was dead.

558
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,880
So I wanted to confirm it myself.

559
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,215
I met up with their families
outside this village.

560
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,893
That's how I came to believe it.

561
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,678
I don't know what Thomas has told you,

562
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,016
but I'm not as bad as you think.

563
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:38,612
I tried so hard to help these people.
I swear, I worked really hard!

564
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:44,204
What exactly did you do to help them?

565
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,074
Hey!

566
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,660
Hey, babe.

567
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,286
- What is it this time?
- What did you say?

568
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,373
Come here.

569
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,788
Where were you yesterday?

570
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,264
<i>- I said I didn't do anything!
- You want to die? Shut up.</i>

571
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,718
That bastard!
I should go break his wrists!

572
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,766
How can he beat up a woman?

573
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,730
Come on! Why do you always
take out your anger on me?

574
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:19,071
Who else would I take it out on?
It's just you and me here.

575
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,527
You should do it on this guy!

576
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,069
Right.

577
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,777
Gosh… I don't know what to do.

578
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,082
- What do you mean?
- I want to go see him right now.

579
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,039
And grab him by his collar,
but Jang-mi said she likes it here.

580
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,121
What?

581
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,923
She didn't want anybody to find this.

582
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,212
That's why I hurried over there
before someone else could find it.

583
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,799
Jang-mi wants
to stay here for a long time.

584
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,095
I get it.

585
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,230
After getting beaten up like this,
she might prefer to live here.

586
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,022
Still, we need to catch the culprit.

587
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,555
Of course.

588
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:06,241
You decide what we should do.
Go talk to Jang-mi or something.

589
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,202
I'll be out for a while.

590
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,570
Where are you going?

591
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,027
I need to check a few things
with Detective Shin

592
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,368
and I have dinner plans.

593
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,752
Try to keep a low profile.
You'll be in big trouble

594
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,670
if you get caught by Manager Wang.

595
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:21,788
Okay, Dad. You take care of yourself too.

596
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,837
Goodness, I never had a son like you.

597
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,090
Be careful.

598
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,059
They still need to eat,

599
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,228
so I went to feed them,
but I had one leftover lunchbox.

600
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,525
I let him go.

601
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,782
The keys were missing earlier,
so I figured that was the case.

602
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,406
I said I'd stay out of it.

603
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,787
You made a choice
and you'll have to face the consequences.

604
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,876
But…

605
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,303
Don't get your hopes up.

606
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,385
He tricks people by giving them hope
and rubs salt in their wounds.

607
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,009
- If your fiancé falls for his trap...
- Do you think I wouldn't know that?

608
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,677
I learned to read people's faces
before I learned to talk.

609
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,561
I know whether someone likes me or not,

610
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,806
or if someone is being real or fake.

611
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,395
I just instinctively know.

612
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,130
It's a superpower I gained
from growing up in a children's home.

613
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,330
I instantly knew what kind of man
Hwang Du-cheol was.

614
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,831
As you said,

615
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,915
he would lure people in
like a snake and bite them.

616
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:51,009
I know what bait he'll use on Jun-ho
and that he'll ask for money.

617
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,091
But

618
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,262
it's the bait I threw Hwang Du-cheol.

619
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,725
Do you think your fiancé
will figure that out?

620
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,186
Of course!

621
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,728
I'm not worried
about what he might do to Jun-ho.

622
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,569
I'm worried that
he might not go see Jun-ho.

623
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:20,405
I told you to come to the police station.
Why did you ask to meet here?

624
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,746
This place is safer.

625
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,125
What if something happens to me?
There are many cameras

626
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:30,551
filming me all around.
He's got nowhere to hide.

627
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,891
- Did you go see Chairwoman Han?
- Yes, and so did you.

628
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,430
You went to see her
instead of Manager Wang.

629
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,061
I sent someone else
to Manager Wang's office,

630
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,903
but he found nothing useful.

631
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,646
Anyway, you told Chairwoman Han
that your mom passed away.

632
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,067
Right. Two days after her daughter died,

633
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,571
my mom disappeared into thin air.

634
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,912
If she moved out, got hospitalized,

635
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,702
or went abroad,
there would be some sort of record,

636
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,996
but I can't find anything.

637
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,254
So the logical conclusion
is that she's dead.

638
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,464
Two days after?
How do you know the exact date?

639
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:13,165
She wrote me a letter that day
and disappeared.

640
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,336
What letter? What did she say?

641
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:20,676
It's more of a memo.
"Stay strong. I'll come back to get you."

642
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,385
Well, she didn't in the end.

643
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,017
Did your mother know?

644
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,647
Know what?

645
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,355
I think Kim Su-yeon

646
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,697
was murdered.

647
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,054
This is Kim Su-yeon,
Chairwoman Han's daughter.

648
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,158
Do you recognize her?

649
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,264
I vaguely remember her.

650
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,599
Let me ask you a question.

651
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,314
I thought you were looking
for Choi Yeo-na.

652
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,234
Why are you so obsessed
with Chairwoman Han?

653
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,493
Kim Su-yeon had a baby.

654
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,821
Chairwoman Han thought
she had a miscarriage,

655
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,037
but she found evidence
that the baby might still be alive.

656
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:26,708
That's why she left some shares
for her grandchild in her will.

657
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,629
Then did they kill Nam-guk

658
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,288
because he was
Chairwoman Han's grandchild?

659
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,798
According to the DNA test results,
Jang Myeong-gyu, Kim Nam-guk, Choi Yeo-na…

660
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,341
None of them were biologically
related to Chairwoman Han.

661
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,965
I don't know who killed them,

662
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,715
but they didn't find her grandchild,
so the murders aren't over yet.

663
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,226
I must find the culprit
as soon as possible

664
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,846
in order to find Yeo-na.

665
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,450
Hello?

666
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,495
<i>Detective Shin Jun-ho?</i>

667
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:11,174
- Yes, that's me. Who are you?
<i>- You know Choi Yeo-na?</i>

668
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:17,383
Who are you? Where is Yeo-na now?

669
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:22,894
<i>I'm risking my life for this,
so I'll get straight to the point.</i>

670
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:28,096
<i>Have 50 million won ready in cash
and wait for me to call you back.</i>

671
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:30,475
How can I trust you?

672
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,861
Come on, why would you trust me?
You must trust your fiancée.

673
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,404
Let's see…

674
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:44,531
She said she was sorry
for canceling the pre-wedding photo shoot

675
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,616
and for changing her pass code too.

676
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:51,673
That's already a known fact.
Give me clear proof that Yeo-na is alive.

677
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:54,748
<i>No wonder you're a cop. You're very smart.</i>

678
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,962
Bernard Buffet.

679
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,966
<i>I don't know much about art,</i>

680
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,643
<i>but do you remember what you said
when you proposed to her?</i>

681
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,346
Detective Baek. Boss!
There's a witness who saw Yeo-na!

682
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,977
What did they say?
Where is she? Is she alive?

683
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,864
Give me the number. Look up the signal.

684
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,381
I have the information, so find him.

685
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,282
- Okay.
- Who called you?

686
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,007
- Are you sure he saw her?
- Did you record it?

687
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,531
Yes. He demanded cash.

688
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,327
<i>Bernard Buffet.</i>

689
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,580
- How dare he demand ransom from a cop?
- Be quiet. Let me listen.

690
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,214
<i>I don't know much about art,</i>

691
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:38,802
<i>but do you remember what you said
when you proposed to her?</i>

692
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:45,259
<i>Yeo-na was wearing the necklace
you gave her when you proposed to her.</i>

693
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,814
<i>Also the artwork from the exhibition.</i>

694
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,179
<i>She said you gave it to her as a gift.</i>

695
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,477
<i>She asked if it was still hanging
in the living room.</i>

696
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,402
Only Yeo-na and I know about this.

697
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,444
Who is he? Can you think of anyone?

698
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,238
He could be one
of the guys that kidnapped Yeo-na,

699
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,822
someone who's holding Yeo-na hostage
after she escaped,

700
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,408
or…

701
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,457
He said he would call again,
so let's get ready before then.

702
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,804
It wasn't forced open.

703
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,634
It was opened with a key.

704
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,481
Someone let Hwang Du-cheol go.

705
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,559
I'm aware of it.

706
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,732
Yeo-na did it.

707
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,399
Why did she do that?

708
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,730
Did she send him to her fiancé?

709
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,817
Yes.

710
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,985
It looks like everyone
has a plan these days.

711
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,575
I've been very foolish.

712
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,374
I used to think I was responsible
for everything in this village,

713
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:01,547
but now I realize that
things could turn out better

714
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:05,918
if I get help from my great comrades.

715
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,724
I'm glad you finally realized that.

716
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,480
What's going on between you two?

717
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,193
Why don't we have a drink together?

718
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:22,823
Sounds great.

719
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:26,489
- It's about time we had some rare liquor!
- You'd better brace yourself.

720
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,201
I have something to discuss
with Jun-su's mom. Get the drinks ready.

721
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,634
The days have gotten longer.

722
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:49,257
You're right. I found the flash drive
that Jang-mi told us about.

723
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,343
Really?

724
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,762
So she'll be gone soon?

725
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,556
Yes.

726
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,443
I haven't handed it over to the police.
That jerk needs to get arrested,

727
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,809
but I couldn't ignore
what Jang-mi told us.

728
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,067
Still, she should go.

729
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,068
She can't stay here forever.

730
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,320
By the way, I haven't seen
that young man around recently.

731
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Who?

732
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,202
Wook?

733
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,458
He's probably having fun somewhere.

734
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,424
How did he end up coming here?

735
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,711
I'm sure you know, Mr. Jang.

736
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,094
You need to find his body too.

737
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,596
I don't know everything.

738
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,929
And even if I did,
I can't find every single body.

739
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,136
Anyway, I don't know.
He won't answer my questions.

740
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,943
Okay. Well.

741
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:49,284
I'm having a drink with Thomas
and Detective Park at Café Hawaii.

742
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,988
You guys are drinking again?

743
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,162
That's it?

744
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,539
Detective Park asked me
to get scolded in his place.

745
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,497
Go easy on the alcohol.

746
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,292
Don't be too harsh on Detective Park!

747
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,799
Even though I'm his mom…

748
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:20,604
I don't even know how my son died.

749
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,311
Mom, are you crying?

750
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,193
No.

751
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,238
I'm not crying.

752
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:50,014
You said you wanted to know where Mr. Jang
goes carrying that backpack, right?

753
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,548
So I did some research.

754
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,643
Jang Hyeon-ji.

755
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,063
It's his daughter.
She went missing 15 years ago.

756
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:04,897
Missing?

757
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:08,268
She went missing at an amusement park
and still hasn't been found yet.

758
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:11,186
His wife committed suicide
not too long after that incident.

759
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,951
I think Mr. Jang still goes around
the whole country looking for Hyeon-ji.

760
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:21,122
He installs banners at highway rest areas
and hands out flyers.

761
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,907
That actually costs a lot of money.

762
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,917
Before Hyeon-ji went missing,
he owned a small company

763
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,920
and he had quite a lot of money,

764
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,212
but he spent it all looking for Hyeon-ji.
Now he's got nothing left.

765
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,926
That old man…

766
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,602
He didn't even tell me.

767
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,895
<i>There are a lot of con artists
who are after the reward.</i>

768
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:51,149
<i>He almost got conned again recently,
but I helped him catch the guy.</i>

769
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,990
They say you can't scratch your own back.

770
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:58,029
Yet he's always busy taking care
of other people's problems.

771
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,450
What was that?

772
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:50,883
You guys must be hungry. Eat up.

773
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,841
EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION
LEE JONG-A SENT AN EMERGENCY CALL

774
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,853
It's a device for emergencies.

775
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,849
Press SOS if anything happens.

776
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,942
Then the other two will receive
the person's location.

777
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,371
Does it work no matter where you go?

778
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,765
Yes, even to the ends of the Earth.

779
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,703
RESTRICTED NUMBER

780
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,452
Who are you?

781
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,995
<i>Obviously, I'm the guy
who's eagerly waiting for you</i>

782
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,499
<i>with your girlfriend.</i>

783
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:33,921
Don't you dare lay a finger on Jong-a!
You hear me?

784
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,632
<i>Look at you, trying to threaten me.</i>

785
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,546
Come here by yourself.

786
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:41,803
If I hear sirens or see a police car,
I'll kill her.

787
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,812
You should've kept a low profile.
Why did you meddle in my affairs?

788
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,389
I'll be right there, so let her go.
She knows nothing!

789
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,901
Her fate depends on you.

790
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,227
Hey!

791
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,397
Hey! Goddamn it.

792
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,125
It's not him. Let me answer this.

793
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,177
- I'm busy right now. Let's talk later.
- Manager Wang kidnapped Jong-a.

794
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,759
What?

795
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,062
They're somewhere near the coast
of Incheon. I'm on my way there.

796
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,718
They'll kill Jong-a right away
if they see the police.

797
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:30,978
So please come alone.

798
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,439
I'm really sorry, but I can't right now.

799
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,981
I'm supposed to meet a guy who saw Yeo-na,
so I'm waiting for him to call.

800
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,686
I understand how you must be feeling,

801
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:41,777
but we must

802
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,279
save the living first!

803
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,156
The living?

804
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,288
What is that supposed to mean?

805
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,830
I don't know who he is,

806
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:55,543
but if he said he saw Yeo-na,
he's a scammer. Don't trust him.

807
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,835
I'm asking you again.

808
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,799
What the hell are you talking about?!

809
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,387
Choi Yeo-na…

810
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,140
Is dead.

811
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,411
<i>I'm a man of my word.</i>

812
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:34,214
Of course, I do it my way.
But I know better than anyone

813
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,499
how it feels to lose someone you love.

814
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,922
I promise I'll call Detective Shin.

815
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:51,805
Please hurry.
Our wedding is in three days.

816
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:11,034
If you're going to talk bullshit,
just hang up, you bastard.

817
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,643
Hyeon-ji.

818
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,770
Hyeon-ji.

819
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,435
Daddy had a drink

820
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:47,695
with Thomas and Detective Park.

821
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,791
MISSING: JANG HYEON-JI

822
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,869
My baby.

823
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,710
Gosh, why do I get so silly
every time I'm drunk?

824
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,302
Good night.

825
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,104
Goodness, where's Wook?

826
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:23,108
Why isn't he back yet? It's late.

827
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:38,044
I'm sorry.

828
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,498
I'm sorry.

829
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,131
I love...

830
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,972
What's this?

831
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,467
No way…

832
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,687
What's wrong? Who was it?

833
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,769
Nothing.

834
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:12,025
- It's him.
- We'll trace the number, so answer it.

835
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,033
Hello?

836
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,331
<i>Detective Shin, did you prepare the money?</i>

837
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,292
Yes, I did. Where should I go?

838
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:25,212
<i>Come to Hongdae.
I'll call you in 30 minutes.</i>

839
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,633
Are you sure she's alive?

840
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:30,011
<i>Come on, I told you
I met her this morning.</i>

841
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,799
<i>Your wedding is in three days, right?
Wait, let me see.</i>

842
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,255
<i>It's past midnight now,
so I guess it's in two days.</i>

843
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,306
I'll come right now. See you in Hongdae.

844
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,639
Move in teams of two.
Detective Shin and Detective Baek.

845
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:44,062
- Take the money and go now.
- You two wait near Hongdae.

846
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,305
Let's go!

847
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,149
Are you up?

848
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,864
Why won't you stay still?
Do we have to hit you to keep you quiet?

849
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,582
What's that? Go and check. Hurry!

850
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,295
Are you all right?

851
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:02,971
Are you okay?

852
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:05,809
Jong-a.

853
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,313
If you exit through the back door
and turn left, you'll see my car.

854
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,067
- Take it and get out of here.
- Come with me.

855
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,820
I'll be right behind you.

856
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,361
Where do you think you're going?

857
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,869
Come on.

858
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,370
Get them!

859
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,293
Get them now!

860
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,744
<i>The person you are calling
is not available at the moment…</i>

<i>The person you are calling

MS. LEE JONG-A

864
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,590
<i>The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message after...</i>

865
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,011
Can you drive faster?

866
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,046
{\an8}I was there.

867
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,237
{\an8}<i>There's something about this place.</i>

868
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,087
{\an8}Wait, do you actually believe it?

869
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,724
{\an8}My son is alive!

870
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,091
{\an8}Please tell me where Yeo-na is first.

871
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:29,098
{\an8}Will we be able to find
Hyeon-ji with this?

872
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,010
{\an8}I won't give up.

873
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,307
{\an8}I remembered something important.

874
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,811
{\an8}Why are you involved with
everything and everyone?

875
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,289
{\an8}<i>If you had told me from the beginning…</i>

876
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,073
{\an8}Why didn't you tell me?

877
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,938
{\an8}Being left behind is also painful.

878
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,145
{\an8}They have figured out
that you killed them.
