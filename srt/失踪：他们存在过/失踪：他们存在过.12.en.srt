1
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,123
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,956
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,176
I'll try to buy some time,
but it'll only be a few minutes.

4
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,929
How unfair.

5
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,431
He took 27 years from me,

6
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,851
and all I get is a few minutes?

7
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,602
You've waited 27 years for this moment.

8
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,816
Hello. I'm Detective Shin Jun-ho.

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,230
- Did you have dinner?
- No.

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,858
They didn't even let you eat?
Go and have some dinner.

11
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,775
WOOK
RECORD CALL

12
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:13,954
Hurry.

13
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,513
<i>Do you know Kim Su-yeon?</i>

14
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,103
Of course I do.

15
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,559
You killed Kim Su-yeon.

16
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,893
I saw everything.

17
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,902
You were in a gray suit, weren't you?

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,070
What were you doing there?

19
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,947
My mom was the chairwoman's housekeeper.

20
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,658
<i>So I would often spend time there.</i>

21
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,912
<i>I was there
the day you killed Aunt Su-yeon too.</i>

22
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,959
No wonder you grew up ignorant.
You grew up without a mother.

23
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,716
What did you just say?
How do you know I grew up without a mom?

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,800
Because I killed her.

25
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,968
Su-yeon.

26
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,555
Your mom.

27
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,481
<i>The three from the children's home
and Han Sang-gil.</i>

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,640
<i>I killed all of them.</i>

29
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,690
If you hadn't made a sound that day,

30
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,146
I wouldn't have killed the housekeeper.

31
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,861
Do you understand?
Your mom died because of you.

32
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,026
I should rip his mouth open.

33
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,155
<i>Why did you kill my mom?</i>

34
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,661
Why?

35
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,592
Let go! Let go of him!

36
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,545
Goodness!

37
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,643
Gosh, Wook! You can't do this!

38
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,681
- No!
- Hurry!

39
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,142
Get him out of here now!

40
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,651
What did you do to Choi Yeo-na?

41
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,436
What did you do to her, you bastard?

42
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,534
Tell me!

43
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,464
- You can't do this, sir.
- Let go!

44
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,732
Were you here all night long?

45
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,411
I'm sorry that I shouted at you
and stormed out yesterday.

46
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,325
I yelled at you many more times
than you did.

47
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,330
It's okay.

48
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,414
I'm sorry

49
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,792
for resenting you

50
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,752
and hating you

51
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,004
all these years.

52
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,627
I would've done the same.

53
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,336
If my mom had disappeared

54
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,925
without a word when I was seven,
I would've been scared.

55
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,229
And if she never came back for me
no matter how long I waited,

56
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,113
I would've hated her too.

57
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,778
- Still, it's all my fault…
- Wook.

58
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,399
Do you remember Tan?

59
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,071
The black dog that lived on our block.

60
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,039
You called him Tan
because he was as black as a briquette.

61
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,372
Because you felt sorry for the stray dog,
you even saved the snacks

62
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,087
you got from preschool to give to Tan.

63
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,472
That's when I realized that you, Wook,

64
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,597
would brighten the world,
just like your name.

65
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,522
You wouldn't ignore people
in need of help.

66
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,188
You're someone that the world needs.

67
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,738
I'm so relieved
that I'm here instead of you.

68
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,906
I shouldn't have taken you to that house.

69
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,003
I left you alone when you were just seven…

70
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,626
In the end,

71
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,047
even though I said I'd come back for you,
I couldn't keep my promise.

72
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,562
I'm sorry

73
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,642
that I couldn't keep my word.

74
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,852
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,583
{\an8}<i>Kang Myeong-jin, who was arrested
for killing a woman in her 30s last June,</i>

76
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,293
{\an8}<i>is said to have committed more crimes.</i>

77
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,495
{\an8}<i>- During their recent investigation…</i>
- Sir. Please have a look.

78
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:23,467
{\an8}<i>The police found several lost items
that are assumed to belong to the victims.</i>

79
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,259
{\an8}<i>- After requesting a forensic analysis…</i>
- Goodness.

80
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,974
{\an8}Hey, bring that jerk here.

81
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,724
{\an8}Due to security issues,
we need to interrogate him in prison.

82
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,138
{\an8}- Is that so?
<i>- They plan to reinvestigate the case.</i>

83
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,897
{\an8}Let's go. We're running out of time.

84
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,058
{\an8}- We'll be back.
- We'll be back, sir.

85
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,608
Next, please.

86
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,323
Here.

87
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,908
You're here again.

88
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,203
He'll probably turn you down.

89
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,036
Please still make the request.

90
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,164
Okay.

91
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,257
You have a visitor, 4821.

92
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,688
Where is my daughter Hyeon-ji?

93
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,065
It was you.

94
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,448
Yes, I'm Hyeon-ji's father.
So give me my daughter back.

95
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,705
There's a rabbit!

96
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,251
- Hello!
- Hello!

97
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,344
Dad, I want some ice cream.

98
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
Sure.

99
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,715
- Wait here.
- Okay.

100
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,405
Please call this number
if you see this girl.

101
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,201
You're working so hard.

102
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,419
MISSING: JANG HYEON-JI

103
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,344
We've met before, haven't we?

104
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,393
Yes. I followed you
and found Mi-ok in the freezer.

105
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,179
So stop changing the subject.
Just tell me where Hyeon-ji is.

106
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,141
Please!

107
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,563
You haven't changed a bit.

108
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,780
DO NOT ENTER

109
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,868
KANG MYEONG-JIN

110
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:14,428
Why aren't you saying anything?
Tell me what you did to Hyeon-ji!

111
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,102
Your time is up, 4821.

112
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,475
We're not done talking.
I haven't heard his answer!

113
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,114
Hey, where is my daughter?
Just tell me where she is!

114
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,820
You haven't changed at all.

115
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,784
Answer me! You can't just leave like this!

116
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,577
You bastard! What did you do to Hyeon-ji?

117
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,411
Give me my daughter back!

118
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,142
Why did you ask to see me here?

119
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,014
Yeo-na…

120
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,522
I found out where she is.

121
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,023
Where is she?

122
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,226
I don't know

123
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,475
the exact location yet.

124
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,107
I wanted to tell you
after finding out the exact location.

125
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,196
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
I couldn't find the right time.

126
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,081
Find her no matter what.

127
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,542
I'll talk to Yeo-na in the village.

128
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,214
Hey, Mr. Kim! You should've called first.

129
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,008
No boats are allowed to leave the port
because of the typhoon.

130
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,599
Who is this man?

131
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,679
The man who knows where Yeo-na is.

132
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,595
Manager Wang's henchmen
kidnapped Yeo-na and put her on his boat.

133
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,438
And he drove the boat.

134
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,065
What the hell are you talking about?

135
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,161
Is it true?

136
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,949
No! Hey, Mr. Kim!

137
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,583
You wanted to rent a boat to have a party.
What are you doing?

138
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,293
I'm asking you if it's true.

139
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,133
This guy is a detective.

140
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,384
And the woman you threw overboard that day

141
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,299
was his fiancée.

142
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,053
That's all I know.

143
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,178
Where did you leave her?

144
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,688
Where did you leave her?

145
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,565
Answer me!

146
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,486
Did you order Manager Wang

147
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,410
to kill Jang Myeong-gyu,

148
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,327
Kim Nam-guk, and Choi Yeo-na?

149
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,012
We know you gave the order.

150
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,135
This photo of you and Manager Wang

151
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,771
was captured on the CCTV camera
near Seongmi Park.

152
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,981
The hair you used to run the DNA test.
It's the leftover hair.

153
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,362
DNA TEST RESULTS

154
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,900
And here are the DNA test results.

155
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,280
I get that you tried to not make it
look like a serial murder,

156
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,163
but the police aren't stupid.

157
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,791
And this is the recording file
of your confession to Kim Wook.

158
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,956
There's no way out of this.

159
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,922
Why the hell did you kill
all of these people?

160
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,771
Lee Dong-min, that jerk…

161
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,066
Come to think of it,

162
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,580
he came to the house a few times
with Chairwoman Han.

163
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,499
Why on earth did he do this?

164
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,948
He even killed me and Hyeon-mi.

165
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,542
Why would he do something like this?

166
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,466
<i>That detective was
secretly investigating me</i>

167
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,299
and that housekeeper
witnessed me killing Su-yeon.

168
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,969
No.

169
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,522
At least I thought she did.

170
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,309
Want to know what
the best thing you ever did was?

171
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,061
You survived.

172
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,991
You deserve praise for that alone,

173
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,161
but then you came to us.

174
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,533
So thank you.

175
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,536
He's right.

176
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,246
I also agree.

177
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,374
Same here.

178
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,921
- But still…
- It's that bastard's fault.

179
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,133
He deserves worse than death.

180
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,925
Locking him up won't be enough.

181
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,552
He must be executed.

182
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,796
What a meaningless life.

183
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,389
I can't believe I died

184
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,732
because of some man's greed.

185
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,899
Why did you kill Choi Yeo-na,
Jang Myeong-gyu, and Kim Nam-guk?

186
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,494
You could've just run the test!

187
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,528
You didn't have to kill them!

188
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,323
They enjoyed extra time
that they weren't supposed to have

189
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,698
because they were lucky enough
to survive the fire.

190
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,745
Were you the one who set the fire?

191
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,796
Was that your doing too?

192
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,010
To be precise,

193
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,676
I just paid someone to do it.

194
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,517
Don't let him get to you.

195
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,350
He's not worth it.

196
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,944
You're a complete psychopath.

197
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,375
Giving shares to her grandson
because he's family

198
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,127
and to her employees
because they worked hard…

199
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,741
A company isn't something
like a pizza you share with others.

200
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,658
Thirty years. I've been working
on this for 30 years.

201
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,452
I was about to see
my lifelong dream come true.

202
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,536
I couldn't let anything get in the way.

203
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,712
So I got rid of some obstacles.

204
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,003
Did I do something wrong?

205
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,172
Are people

206
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,298
obstacles to you?

207
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,310
Yes, they were merely obstacles to me.

208
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,517
What? You think I'm insane?

209
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,977
No.

210
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,855
I just have

211
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,241
stronger basic needs than others.

212
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,742
Three people were murdered by Lee Dong-min

213
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,160
in this village alone.

214
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,832
So after killing that many people,

215
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,921
was he able to find the grandchild?

216
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,759
No, not yet.

217
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,839
I'm not even sure if there really is one.

218
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,803
<i>So this woman</i>

219
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,926
was your fiancée?

220
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,859
- You should leave.
- Let go!

221
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,823
- You should leave!
- Let me go!

222
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,113
Right now!

223
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,819
Hey!

224
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,465
Detective Shin caught the culprit
and is interrogating him now.

225
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,351
But as for you…

226
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,150
I'm sure he hasn't found me yet,

227
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,728
seeing as I'm still here.

228
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,647
Detective Shin will find you
no matter what.

229
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,041
The reason why you are able to see us

230
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,368
must be because your mother
is here, right?

231
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,576
I don't know.

232
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:24,844
Mr. Jang can see the villagers too,
even though Hyeon-ji is not here.

233
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,835
Jun-ho came here on our wedding day.

234
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,354
I was sitting right next to him,

235
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,679
but he couldn't see me.

236
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,476
Wook, I have a favor to ask.

237
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,647
Can you help me meet Jun-ho one last time?

238
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,963
Did you meet him?

239
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,502
What did he say? Where is Hyeon-ji?

240
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,759
He must've felt guilty after meeting you.

241
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,301
His attitude changed a bit.

242
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,266
We've confirmed five victims so far.
We'll have to keep pressing him.

243
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,270
He told me that I haven't changed a bit.

244
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,060
What does that mean?

245
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,146
I thought carefully about what he said.

246
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:32,572
I think he saw me after he kidnapped
Hyeon-ji at the amusement park

247
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,113
because I went there every single day.

248
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,617
He said that to you?

249
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,908
I'm going to ask him again tomorrow.

250
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,622
He finally met with me today
and started talking,

251
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,924
so maybe he'll tell me where Hyeon-ji is.

252
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,538
Okay.

253
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,514
Let's have some cocktails.

254
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,184
I only know

255
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,600
how to make one or two simple ones.

256
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,429
Have a seat.
I'll make you a delicious cocktail.

257
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,898
Gosh, look at the color.

258
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,776
What's this drink called?

259
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,739
You're the owner of Café Hawaii,
but you don't know Blue Hawaii?

260
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Blue Hawaii?

261
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,121
Yes, it originated in Hawaii.

262
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,118
Cheers.

263
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,332
How does it taste?

264
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,842
How should I put this?
It tastes like Hawaii.

265
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,304
You don't even know Blue Hawaii
when you're the owner of Café Hawaii.

266
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,779
You have blond hair, but you speak like
someone from a period drama.

267
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,313
You've been here for more than 100 years.
Who exactly are you?

268
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,409
What's the use of telling you?

269
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,273
Hey, I thought we were close. Come on.

270
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,193
Besides, do you think
you'll live here forever?

271
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,481
If you insist,

272
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,151
fine.

273
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,363
Here.

274
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,624
What is this?
Why do you guys look so serious?

275
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,917
My real name is Cha Gwon-muk.

276
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,341
I'm the 34th generation
of the Guryeong Cha family.

277
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,880
I was from a rich family,
so I planned to study abroad,

278
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,472
but I gave up.

279
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,549
Why?

280
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,099
People who studied abroad at that time
were considered intellectuals.

281
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,969
There was no point in studying abroad
and applying what I learned

282
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,477
when I didn't have a country.

283
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,142
Then…

284
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,738
Did you fight
for our country's independence?

285
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,685
Are you someone in a textbook?

286
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,605
I'm probably recorded as
the black sheep of the family.

287
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,315
I was surrounded by enemies,
so I had to keep secrets from my family.

288
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,366
I pretended that
I fell into drinking and gambling

289
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,386
so I could get money
to support the liberation army.

290
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,210
And later on,
I even sold our family's land.

291
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,251
Anyway, with the money I collected,

292
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,963
I was able to cross the Amnok River
about five times.

293
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,484
It wasn't much, but I contributed to

294
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,705
the establishment
of the Korean Provisional Government.

295
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,891
It was the best thing
I ever did in my life.

296
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,103
Then how did you end up here?

297
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,453
After we established
the provisional government,

298
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,187
Imperial Japan's oppression worsened.

299
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,271
While crossing the Amnok River
the following year,

300
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,726
I ran into a Japanese soldier.

301
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,897
When I woke up,

302
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,613
I found myself there.

303
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,087
At first, I thought I was caught
by a Japanese soldier.

304
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,843
And then I realized

305
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,137
this place wasn't for the living.

306
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,385
That's how I started a café here
and learned how to live as a dead person.

307
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,307
Why did it have to be the Amnok River?

308
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,899
- There's no way for me to go there.
- How ironic.

309
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,363
We were once so desperate
to protect our country,

310
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,744
but now we're split in half.

311
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,912
I have a lot to say
when I meet my comrades.

312
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,260
When you were attacked by
the Imperial Japanese army,

313
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,294
were there other
independence activists with you?

314
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,789
They got shot too.

315
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,372
Then why aren't they here?

316
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,037
If their bodies weren't found…

317
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,665
I'm the only one who came here.

318
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,586
But…

319
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,836
I don't think this is
the only place for the dead.

320
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,484
You mean there's
another village like this one?

321
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,138
I can't be sure.

322
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,844
But…

323
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,759
I just think there might be.

324
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,636
I've pondered many questions
for the past 100 years.

325
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,555
I thought you were just
an immature guy in your twenties.

326
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,694
Your blond hair totally fooled me.

327
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
My hair?

328
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,485
About seven to eight years ago,

329
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,069
a hairdresser from Apgujeong came
and dyed my hair.

330
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,703
It looked good on me,
so I've kept it this way.

331
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,782
What do you think?

332
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,044
Don't I look like one
of those surfers in Hawaii?

333
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,673
Then what about Hawaii?
You have nothing to do with Hawaii?

334
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,750
No.

335
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,166
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

336
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,692
My stuff…

337
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,488
Give them back to me.

338
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,319
You crazy punk. How are they yours?
They belong to the victims.

339
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,406
They're mine.

340
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,994
They're my treasure!

341
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,496
Give them back to me, please!

342
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,463
I can't live without these.

343
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,002
I don't care if I have to rot in jail.
So please just…

344
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,632
Please give me back my treasure!

345
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,509
I'm begging you.

346
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,525
Everything was taken…

347
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,355
It's all over.

348
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,656
I've got nothing left.

349
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,636
<i>What? Who died?</i>

350
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,895
Sir…

351
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,654
You can't visit Kang Myeong-jin.

352
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,858
Why not?

353
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,487
He died this morning.

354
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,534
What? Then…

355
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,660
Wait…

356
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,584
What about my daughter, Hyeon-ji?

357
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,575
Sir!

358
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,630
Sir, are you all right? Sir.

359
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:09,672
Sir, are you okay? Sir, wake up!
Call an ambulance!

360
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,111
The coast guard will call us
once they can search the waters.

361
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,635
When? The storm is already gone.

362
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,823
If they don't start searching,
I'll just get on a boat myself.

363
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,241
Are you going to dive into the water too?

364
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,635
Get yourself together, Jun-ho!

365
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,690
What are you doing here?

366
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,565
Yeo-na asked me to bring you

367
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,240
to her.

368
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,337
Did Yeo-na really ask you
to bring me here?

369
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,339
Yes. How many times do I have to tell you?

370
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,091
Where is she? Where is Yeo-na?

371
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,882
Over there.

372
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,309
I brought him.

373
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,729
Thank you, Wook.

374
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,395
What are you doing?

375
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,614
Is Yeo-na really here?

376
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,736
Yeo-na is right here standing next to you

377
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,044
in a white dress with her hair tied back.

378
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,291
The white dress…

379
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,713
I bought it for her.

380
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,750
He bought it for me when he proposed.

381
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,418
Did you buy it for her when you proposed?

382
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,386
You look worse today

383
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,597
than when I saw you on our wedding day.

384
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,984
She says you look worse today than

385
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,941
on your wedding day.

386
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,983
She was with me then as well?

387
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,068
She was sitting beside you that day.

388
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,964
Tell him that

389
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,383
I've been doing well since that day.

390
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,797
She says she's been doing well

391
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,299
since she last saw you.

392
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,850
If Yeo-na really is here,

393
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,441
and if she really is doing fine
like you said,

394
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:31,357
what do I have to do
to keep talking to her like this?

395
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,651
Will she always be here

396
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,694
if I don't find her body?

397
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,111
That's not possible.

398
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,503
You have to do your job.

399
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,866
That's what Yeo-na wants.

400
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,036
Then what about me?

401
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,589
What I want is

402
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,336
to be with Yeo-na.

403
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,545
I hate waking up every morning.

404
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,263
I can't even dream of a future.
What do I do now?

405
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,885
Yeo-na.

406
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,681
Are you listening?

407
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,397
Why can't I see you when he can?

408
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,482
I miss you.

409
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,357
Jun-ho…

410
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,198
Please help me…
What do I have to do to be with Yeo-na?

411
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,245
You must keep your promise.

412
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,463
You promised that you would
find me no matter what.

413
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:37,051
She wants you to keep your promise.
She wants you to find her no matter what.

414
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,734
My whole life,

415
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,106
I never had anyone to call my own.

416
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,073
You were the only one who cared for me.

417
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,782
Even when I threw a fit,

418
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,623
even when your mother
didn't approve of me,

419
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,463
you never got swayed.

420
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,915
I want you to know that I was happy.

421
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,264
I also

422
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,680
don't want you to forget me too soon.

423
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,220
So find me,

424
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,773
mourn for me,

425
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,396
and then

426
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,400
forget it all…

427
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,690
Mr. Jang.

428
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,072
What happened?

429
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,446
Let's talk outside.

430
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,249
Kang Myeong-jin committed suicide?

431
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,209
He refused to tell Mr. Jang
where Hyeon-ji was until the end.

432
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,553
Gosh…

433
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,047
My heart breaks for Mr. Jang.

434
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,401
PERSONAL PROFILE
KANG MYEONG-JIN

435
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,574
Hey.

436
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,902
Where did Kang Myeong-jin
live before he enlisted?

437
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,572
Jihyeon-dong, Janghyeon-go.

438
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,511
Look into his parents, grandparents,
cousins, and everyone related to him.

439
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,535
Yes, sir.

440
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,788
We got the location, but we won't know
for sure until we go in the water.

441
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,334
It might've been swept away
by the tides. Let's go.

442
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,208
I'll go in with you.

443
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,302
I know the bag Captain Kang mentioned.
I'll be careful not to get in the way.

444
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,471
Stay here.
You'll be helping them this way.

445
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,812
- Please do your best.
- Okay.

446
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,392
- You ready?
- Yes.

447
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,773
- Let's go.
- I'm relying on you.

448
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,750
YEO-NA! I'M ALWAYS GRATEFUL FOR YOU.
I LOVE YOU. I'll DO BETTER.

449
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,083
You're early today.

450
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:41,003
I had a good night's sleep for once,
so I woke early.

451
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,822
It tastes so good.

452
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,664
It tastes out of this world.

453
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,738
Of course.

454
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,155
You can only taste it when you're dead.

455
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,133
Your fiancé must have found you.

456
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,849
Jun-ho

457
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,272
made me a promise.

458
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,359
Goodbye.

459
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:30,037
CHOI YEO-NA, AGE 29
DIED JUNE 8TH, 2020

460
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,849
How suffocating it must have been

461
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,104
under the deep, dark sea.

462
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,620
Goodbye.

463
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,497
Goodbye,

464
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,416
Yeo-na.

465
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,182
How much longer, Jong-a?

466
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,312
It's almost done.

467
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,307
I'm so busy now that
the business is doing well.

468
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,981
Kang Dae-seong stopped coming here
once he began recording his album.

469
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,401
Right. Mr. Jang.

470
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,375
The car with
the license plate number 35E 0829.

471
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,609
Did you find it?

472
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,402
Yes. It's a car that was released
in 2015 and the owner hasn't changed.

473
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:39,908
Here.

474
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,949
The owner's name, address,
and phone number.

475
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,743
This hit-and-run killer.

476
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,577
- How do we catch him?
- I'm going to report it.

477
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,422
KIM GEON-HEE
321-2 SEONCHINDAN-DONG, 35E 0829

478
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,957
Done. Let's go.

479
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,264
You came.

480
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:18,435
Since you kept your promise,
I'm sure Yeo-na left with a light heart.

481
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,654
Thomas said…

482
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,406
Thomas…

483
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:30,921
A man who was with Yeo-na told me
that she smiled as she said goodbye.

484
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,336
Thank you.

485
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,545
Thanks to you, I was able to find Yeo-na.

486
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,847
I didn't do anything.
You did all the work.

487
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,645
You came.

488
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:02,904
I'm…

489
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,949
Sorry.

490
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,584
I was horrible toward Yeo-na.

491
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,834
Poor Yeo-na.

492
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,300
My goodness…

493
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,269
My eyes are bloodshot
because I couldn't get any sleep.

494
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,863
Wait.

495
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,859
Hey, Mr. Jang.

496
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,698
What brings you here?

497
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,699
You probably don't know Choi Yeo-na.
Are you friends with Detective Shin?

498
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,494
- Well?
- It's…

499
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:54,001
I asked him to come with me.
Mr. Jang hasn't been eating well lately,

500
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,461
so I asked him out for a bowl
of spicy beef soup.

501
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,842
That's why I brought him.

502
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,090
You came all the way to a funeral
for a bowl of spicy beef soup?

503
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,675
Right. I'm glad you came.

504
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,392
You can get some fresh air and all.

505
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,056
That reminds me,

506
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,925
I looked into every relative
Kang Myeong-jin has.

507
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,938
Apparently, his maternal family's
grave site is near Duon-ri.

508
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,573
We're going to start
searching the area soon.

509
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,486
<i>Then is Hyeon-ji…</i>

510
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:35,955
I'm sorry.

511
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,335
Due to my greed,

512
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,964
many people lost their lives.

513
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,969
It's not your fault, ma'am.

514
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,300
Lee Dong-min is to blame.

515
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,360
How beautiful.

516
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,366
What do you think, Mom?
Does it look good on me?

517
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,201
KIM GEON-HEE
321-2 SEONCHINDAN-DONG, 35E 0829

518
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,845
- What is this? Who is he?
- I think he's a hit-and-run killer.

519
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,770
You know I attend
all the meetings for missing children.

520
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,398
Maybe you've heard of him.
His name is Beom-su.

521
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,605
He's a boy with a developmental disability

522
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,657
who disappeared three years ago.

523
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,793
Anyway, after I met
and talked to Beom-su's parents,

524
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,120
I did some research.

525
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,615
It sounded like

526
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,667
he was the victim
of a hit-and-run accident.

527
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,382
You should go and meet Beom-su's parents.

528
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,837
It definitely smells fishy.

529
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,046
What do you mean?

530
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,102
I mean, you.

531
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,889
Last month, we found a skeleton
at the construction site

532
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,015
of Muchang Highway.
Do you know who that was?

533
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,232
The person you mentioned ten years ago.

534
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,482
You said his wife could've killed him
because of monetary compensation.

535
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,687
Don't you remember?

536
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:31,196
I said that? I don't remember.

537
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,240
You know Park Byeong-eun.

538
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,195
Recently, we arrested his wife.

539
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,418
She plotted the murder with her lover,
killed her husband, and buried him.

540
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,833
They found the skeleton

541
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,839
as the highway was being built.

542
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:51,128
And with the flash drive you gave me,

543
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,217
we caught Jang-mi's killer.

544
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,802
Some guy asked me to give it to you.

545
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,808
- That's right. Some guy.
- Yes.

546
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:03,441
But I was never able
to find the guy you mentioned

547
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,311
after going through

548
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,108
all of the CCTV footage.

549
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,782
CCTV footage is not reliable.

550
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,161
There are so many blind spots.

551
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,334
I'll go and meet the parents.

552
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,458
I can already tell

553
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,126
that he's a hit-and-run killer.

554
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,255
Right? A hit-and-run killer.

555
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,846
Gosh, I was so scared!

556
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:44,102
Detective Baek is like a fox!
He's so smart!

557
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,896
Of course he is.

558
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,860
He's been a cop for so long.

559
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,280
He's always had a good hunch
ever since he was a rookie.

560
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,201
Well, you turned me into a crazy guy
and ignored me, Mr. Jang.

561
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,540
Come to think of it,
you're like a sly fox.

562
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,748
I'm nothing compared
to you and your nosiness.

563
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,583
Thanks to you both, Yeo-na finally left

564
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,165
and Beom-su will be able
to get justice too.

565
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,341
The same goes for Detective Park
and Jun-su's mom,

566
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,800
since their killer was caught.

567
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,129
The expired statute
of limitations is one thing,

568
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,295
but I'm not sure if they can find
abandoned bodies from 27 years ago.

569
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,224
My wife and I don't really expect much.

570
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,305
We'll just live happily ever after
with you, Thomas.

571
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,897
I'm going to get going.

572
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,451
Live happily ever after?

573
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,410
Do you think Wook will leave
his mom here forever?

574
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,283
Gosh, how can you be so dense?

575
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,987
You shouldn't have said that.

576
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,746
Are you sure you're a cop?

577
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,799
Be careful!

578
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,593
- Hey.
- Yes.

579
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,674
Did you eat?

580
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,006
Yes, I ate.

581
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,973
Thanks to Mr. Jang,
I had a rustic, organic meal.

582
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,015
I'm glad to hear that.

583
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,388
You used to be a picky eater
when you were young.

584
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,766
You didn't eat carrots, beans,
or vegetables, but you liked meat.

585
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,615
Mr. Jang has been feeding me
only vegetables.

586
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,154
Right.

587
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,695
Any news about Hyeon-ji?
Are the police still looking for her?

588
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,287
The culprit's maternal family's
grave site is nearby.

589
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,749
I think they'll find her soon.

590
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,213
I really hope they do.

591
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,040
A few days ago, Yeo-na said

592
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,461
the reason why I see the dead

593
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,422
is because you're here.

594
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,927
But Hyeon-ji isn't here.

595
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:44,098
I have a feeling that Hyeon-ji
is around here.

596
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,729
Big bro!

597
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,771
You're in a great mood.
Did something good happen?

598
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:58,897
Yes! I'm going to go meet my mom,
dad, and grandma!

599
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,528
What do you mean?

600
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,866
It means…

601
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,827
It means…

602
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,418
Goodbye.

603
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,801
My dear Beom-su.

604
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,050
Goodbye.

605
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,135
Bye.

606
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,401
Good for him.

607
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,651
I'm glad he left.

608
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:44,492
You'll also leave one day, Mom.

609
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,366
I want to stay here
with you for as long as I can.

610
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,457
No.

611
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,958
I don't want you to get tied down here.

612
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,220
I just want you to live
a normal life like others.

613
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,175
Jun-su must be bored since Beom-su left.

614
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,765
I'll find Jun-su.

615
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,609
I'm really good at finding people.

616
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,447
Remember how I found Ha-neul?

617
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,358
I'm doing this because
of my sense of justice.

618
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,659
That's because you take after me.

619
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,615
I really can't stand injustice.

620
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,206
Didn't Mr. Jang and Thomas
tell you about it?

621
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,751
Well, Thomas did.

622
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:41,134
He said you have a fiery temperament
and that you jump to action.

623
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,215
What?

624
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,260
Gosh.

625
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:48,101
Now I finally understand
where I get my temper from.

626
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,314
My goodness.

627
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,225
Come over for dinner
with Mr. Jang tonight.

628
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,232
Detective Park always
does all the cooking.

629
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,780
It doesn't matter. What matters is that
we all enjoy the food.

630
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,698
Have a seat.

631
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,670
Thank you for coming to the funeral.

632
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,131
We have handed over
Lee Dong-min to the prosecutors.

633
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,171
We have enough evidence of his crimes,

634
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:29,095
so he'll probably spend
the rest of his life in prison.

635
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,759
After killing all of those people,

636
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,479
I can't believe that's
all the punishment he'll get…

637
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,400
Lee Dong-min is a sociopath.

638
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,820
Being in a situation
where he has no control…

639
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,994
Might be more excruciating than death.

640
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,318
He must pay for what he did.

641
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,534
Anyway,

642
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,828
I asked you to come to ask you a question.

643
00:47:55,914 --> 00:48:00,844
About the necklace that
your fiancée was wearing…

644
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:04,629
I gave it to her when I proposed.

645
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,092
My mom gave it to me when I was young.

646
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,814
I kept it to give it to someone I love.

647
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:21,265
Do you mind if I take a look at it?

648
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,279
If there's an "S"…

649
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,584
How do you know about that?

650
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:40,458
This is the birthstone necklace
I bought for Su-yeon

651
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,671
on her 20th birthday.

652
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:09,243
Are you saying I'm your grandson?

653
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,491
But I have a mother…

654
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,159
There's no need to rush.

655
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,407
You can take your time.

656
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,463
I'm sorry.

657
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,758
I'm sorry.

658
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,912
Su-yeon…

659
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,504
Your birth mother gave it to me.

660
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,551
I went to the church

661
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,627
after getting a call saying
they had an orphan there.

662
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,968
As soon as I held the baby,

663
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,675
the baby held onto my finger
and wouldn't let go.

664
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:25,515
He wasn't even 100 days old,
but there was a twinkle in his eyes.

665
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:31,321
Your dad also said we should adopt you
the moment he laid eyes on you.

666
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,583
I told the director
of the children's home the next day,

667
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,409
dropped by the district office,
and brought you home.

668
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,002
You never told me I was adopted.

669
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:50,132
My birth was registered
on my family register.

670
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:54,803
I was afraid that you might be bullied
at school or hurt if I told you the truth.

671
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,886
I meant to tell you someday.

672
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,806
After the children's home burned down,

673
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:08,018
and your dad passed away,
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

674
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,897
Still,

675
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,151
you should have told me

676
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,366
when Yeo-na disappeared.

677
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,409
How could I, when all the kids
from that children's home died?

678
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,584
If those guys were really after you,

679
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:25,712
I'd be putting you in danger.
How could I possibly tell you?

680
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,343
Every time I heard the door,
I'd wonder if you were home.

681
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,209
If you weren't home the next day,
I'd wonder if you were okay.

682
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,974
I've been so anxious all this time.

683
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:41,099
Before I read the diary in your room,

684
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,602
I didn't realize your birth mother was
Chairwoman Han's daughter.

685
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,944
In the end,

686
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,904
Yeo-na died

687
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,112
because of me.

688
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:01,486
Jang Myeong-gyu,

689
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,327
Kim Nam-guk,

690
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,120
and the kids who died in the fire…

691
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,626
They all died because of me.

692
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,592
Because of me…

693
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,933
So many lives were lost.

694
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,271
Jun-ho.

695
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,838
You didn't do anything wrong.
It's not your fault.

696
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:02,965
You were all children.
The adults are at fault.

697
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,684
I didn't want my kid to get hurt,

698
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:10,694
so I kept silent when other kids
got hurt instead. It's all my fault…

699
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,188
Yeo-na…

700
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,438
Suffocated to death

701
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,865
in the cold waters of the ocean

702
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,409
because of me.

703
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,999
I don't even deserve to breathe.

704
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,247
Mom, I don't deserve to breathe…

705
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,465
I'm sorry. You did nothing wrong, Jun-ho.

706
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:48,142
It's all my fault.

707
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,577
Dig a little deeper. Over There.

708
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,457
Okay, sir.

709
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,503
<i>Mr. Jang!</i>

710
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,375
What is it this time?

711
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:23,175
Why can't you stay still
for even a second?

712
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,469
You must come with me now.

713
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,598
The police are here to search the area!

714
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,771
Why?

715
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,348
Come on, hurry!

716
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,109
What are they looking for?

717
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,279
Over here!

718
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,987
- Where?
- Let's go, sir.

719
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,077
Hey, where is it?

720
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,161
Over here, sir!

721
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,422
Hey, Detective Baek.
Can you let me in for a second?

722
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,633
You can't go inside now.

723
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,176
Come on. It won't take long.

724
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:18,059
Damn it. There's more than one.
Hey, when will Forensics get here?

725
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,148
Detective Baek!

726
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,190
Yes, it's me!

727
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,486
Keep digging.

728
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,704
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

729
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,584
See? I told you. You can let me in.

730
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,790
When will you be able
to identify the bodies?

731
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,155
We're going to send them
to the National Forensic Service.

732
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,592
There are at least three to four victims.

733
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,228
I'll call you as soon
as I get the results.

734
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,051
Okay.

735
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
They found

736
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,452
my Hyeon-ji.

737
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,579
What do you mean?

738
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,455
I don't see the village.

739
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,219
I can't see anything.

740
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:58,208
I heard they found Hyeon-ji!
Where was she?

741
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,417
In the woods.

742
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:10,888
I really hoped that
she would be alive somewhere.

743
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,759
What about Mr. Jang? Where is he?

744
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,846
He can't see the village anymore.

745
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,653
Why not?

746
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,161
If I had known sooner,

747
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:36,121
I would have said goodbye.

748
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,464
He found Hyeon-ji.

749
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,535
That's why he can't see
this place anymore.

750
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,722
Good for him.

751
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,340
He lived with the dead
for more than ten years.

752
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,388
Now that he has found Hyeon-ji,
he needs to live his own life.

753
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,321
I feel so sorry for Mr. Jang.

754
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:39,334
Then if you find your mom's body,
will you stop seeing the village too?

755
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:41,831
I think so.

756
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,037
We should hurry then.

757
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,091
We must find all of them.

758
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,505
Yes, we must.

759
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:54,878
You're right.

760
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:59,263
I promised to find Jun-su too.

761
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,306
We must find them.

762
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,231
Honey.

763
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,530
I promised to come with Hyeon-ji.

764
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,866
I'm sorry that
I brought her in this state.

765
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,830
OH YUN-GYEONG, JANG HYEON-JI

766
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:26,000
At least now,
all three of us are together.

767
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Hyeon-ji.

768
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,961
You're not scared now that
you're with Mom, right?

769
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:41,264
Honey. Be kind to Hyeon-ji
and take good care of her.

770
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,994
Don't hate your mother too much.

771
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,659
She's a wonderful person who spent
her whole life caring for you.

772
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,330
I know.

773
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,379
That's what makes me even more upset.

774
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,506
My Su-yeon

775
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:20,724
and your mother…

776
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,559
They both tried to protect their child.

777
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,774
We still have the time

778
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,191
to resent them and forgive them.

779
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:43,782
Su-yeon was able
to protect her little child

780
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,786
when she was in so much pain.

781
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,463
But…

782
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,785
I couldn't protect my child.

783
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,257
I failed at being a good mother,

784
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:02,971
but I want to give you everything

785
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,260
since Su-yeon risked
her life protecting you.

786
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,561
You've already given me everything.

787
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,845
I've found my grandmother,

788
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,436
so I don't need anything else.

789
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,188
But I'll try to visit you more often

790
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,816
with my mom.

791
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,740
Sure.

792
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:26,950
Thank you.

793
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,463
Hey.

794
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,087
What brings you here?

795
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,428
Yeo-na is gone now.

796
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,142
It's the same for me

797
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,557
back then and now.

798
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,020
I still don't see anything.

799
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:02,493
Kim Hyeon-mi and Park Yeong-ho.
I can't seem to track them down.

800
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:07,242
I know. I'm still looking for them too.

801
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:11,575
Choiseung Construction built
an apartment 27 years ago.

802
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:14,711
Lee Dong-min bribed
the person in charge of

803
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,133
overseeing the foundation work.

804
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,670
That's probably where
he buried the bodies.

805
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,724
The building will be torn down next week
for redevelopment,

806
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,339
so I'm going to go check it out.

807
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,185
Is today the day?

808
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:41,731
Yes, so I'd like to ask you for a favor.

809
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,704
Sure. I'll do anything for you.

810
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:50,033
Once my mom and Detective Park disappear,

811
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,120
promise me you'll
take good care of Jun-su.

812
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,501
I'm going to find Jun-su's body,

813
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,501
so just until then.

814
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,549
Okay, I'll do that.

815
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,800
And you…

816
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,177
Don't mind me.

817
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,933
Someone must look after the village.

818
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,766
Thank you for everything.

819
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,353
I mean it.

820
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,646
I should be the one to thank you.

821
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:27,406
Thanks to you,
I'm able to live here in Korea.

822
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,368
Here you are.

823
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,828
A cup of iced America no
with an extra shot.

824
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,667
Gosh, I love this coffee.

825
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,090
Thank you.

826
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:04,776
- He lost again.
- Goodness. Why do I keep losing?

827
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,322
Jun-su, want to play one more round?

828
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,283
You always lose, Dad.

829
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:12,615
Let's do it one more time.

830
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,701
I think your top is better.

831
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,342
You wrote in your letter
that you'd come back.

832
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,210
Thank you for keeping your word.

833
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,507
Thank you for coming into my life again.

834
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,429
Wook.

835
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:37,682
I've…

836
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,562
Missed you a lot over the years.

837
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,148
Me too.

838
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,323
I've missed you a lot.

839
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:59,292
Thank you for growing up
to be such a fine young man.

840
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:08,803
Mom…

841
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,563
I love you, Wook.

842
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,438
Me too.

843
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,407
Goodbye.

844
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,656
At least you got to say goodbye to Thomas.

845
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,579
I couldn't even say goodbye
because it all happened so quickly.

846
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,038
Mr. Jang, do you remember?

847
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,669
The detectives treated me like a lunatic

848
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,881
when I said I saw Ha-neul over there.

849
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,380
Of course I do. I joined in on them too.

850
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,795
But now,

851
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:37,342
I understand how the detectives

852
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,599
must have felt.

853
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,220
I insisted there was a village
in those woods.

854
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:44,694
I know.

855
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,277
What are you doing?

856
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:58,701
Even if I can't see them, they can see me.
I'm saying goodbye to Thomas.

857
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:04,118
You should wave in that direction.
Café Hawaii is over there.

858
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,920
I lived here for over a decade.
I know this place better than you.

859
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:10,838
It's over there!

860
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:15,299
It's that way! I put a mark there!

861
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,885
- What?
- Look over there.

862
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:20,529
- I'm right.
- You're not Sunshine Wook.

863
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,176
You're Stubborn Wook, you brat.

864
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:28,225
- It's over there!
- I'm not just trying to prove a point.

865
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,812
- That's where it is!
- Ten years...

866
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,647
I put a mark there
every time I went by that place.

867
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:34,943
Again, I lived here for over ten years.

868
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:38,237
I traced the IP address and it's the house

869
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:40,242
of the bus driver you mentioned last time.

870
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,787
Then Kim Geon-u killed Jun-su.

871
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:45,870
No.

872
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:49,252
It was someone else from that house.

873
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,923
I knew it.

874
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,131
Great work, Jong-a.

875
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,211
You've gotten much better.

876
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,474
It seems like just yesterday
you got scammed.

877
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,563
You got scammed?

878
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,808
No. I don't know
what you're talking about.

879
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,977
Yes, you were.

880
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,902
Mom, did you send the money?

881
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:14,653
Okay. I'll handle it.

882
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,868
Yoo Yeong-min.

883
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:24,490
You shouldn't do that.

884
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,501
Who are you?

885
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,496
You're getting involved again.

886
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,924
Forget who I am. Let me see that first.

887
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,165
The name on the paper
is different from the name

888
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:39,257
on the memo, right?

889
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,971
Where? Let me see.

890
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:45,428
You're right. The names are different.

891
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:50,024
The realtor said he got
a power of attorney.

892
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,857
Exactly. He got a power of attorney,
not the deed.

893
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,190
If you signed a lease,
you should send the money to the landlord.

894
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,397
Why are you sending it to someone else?

895
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,618
You look smart, but you're not.

896
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,866
Consider yourself lucky today.

897
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:09,411
I have this weird sense of justice,
so I can't ignore someone in need.

898
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:16,134
Right. That happened.

899
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,212
I got scammed.

900
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:19,126
I have something for you.

901
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:21,128
What is it?

902
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,063
Ta-da!

903
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,218
Now you're one of the four musketeers.

904
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:30,016
Four musketeers?

905
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,229
The three of us plus Nam-guk.

906
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:33,975
Hence, the four musketeers.

907
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,403
No, I'm out. This is too much work for me.

908
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,072
You can't bail on us now.

909
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:42,281
Once you become part of our group,
you're stuck with us for life.

910
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,453
Give me your hand.

911
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,988
- Gosh.
- Come on.

912
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,537
I had this custom-made.

913
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,409
You've got nothing to do
at home by yourself.

914
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,417
You can take care of things here
and help us when we get work.

915
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,090
We'll eat together
and have fun together too.

916
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,920
You can't force me to do that.

917
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,589
Like this.

918
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:05,089
- Welcome to the four musketeers.
- It doesn't come off easily.

919
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,357
Hello, I'm Shin Jun-ho.
Today, I was officially transferred

920
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,240
to the Missing Persons Team.
I look forward to working with you.

921
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:30,043
We've been working together already.
Why are you making an announcement?

922
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,709
This is your seat.
Just act as you usually do.

923
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:40,342
But our team barely gets results.
Are you sure about this?

924
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,467
You don't seem to get it.

925
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,933
The police are always a step behind when
investigating a robbery or a homicide

926
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:51,102
because they're chasing the criminal
after the crime has taken place.

927
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,181
But…

928
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:55,391
Missing persons cases are always ongoing.

929
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,770
We're a team that finds people.

930
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,091
Must we go this far?

931
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,764
The guy who killed Jun-su
is going to move out today!

932
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,933
The evidence is saved on his computer.

933
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,062
- We must get it.
- Okay.

934
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,598
Wait. Be quiet.

935
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,141
{\an8}<i>We received some good news
from the site where the exhumation</i>

936
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:37,135
{\an8}<i>of fallen Korean War soldiers
is taking place.</i>

937
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:40,357
{\an8}<i>According to North and South Korea's
KIA Recovery and Identification Agency,</i>

938
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:43,939
<i>they found the remains of seven people
who are presumed to be</i>

939
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,646
<i>independence activists
near the Amnok River</i>

940
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:49,567
<i>along with their clothes and belongings.</i>

941
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:52,656
<i>The skeletons of these
presumed independence activists</i>

942
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,833
<i>were found downstream of the Amnok River.</i>

943
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:59,502
{\an8}<i>- The Ministry of National Defense…</i>
- Gosh, look. It's Thomas.

944
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,923
One moment.

945
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,381
Do you think they'll find Thomas
under all that dirt?

946
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:07,222
Anyway, one of them is Thomas, right?

947
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,720
I really hope they find him.

948
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,392
I hope so too.

949
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:15,931
<i>The remains will soon be sent to the
KIA Recovery and Identification Agency</i>

950
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:18,346
<i>for a detailed examination
and DNA analysis…</i>

951
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:01,436
I'm so glad Jun-su left,
especially since Thomas is gone now.

952
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,020
You're right.
Who's going to look after the village now?

953
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,645
I'm sure someone new will come along.

954
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,162
Who was that?

955
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,623
Who threw this ball?
Where did it come from?

956
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,787
Please give it back. It's mine.

957
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,579
There are a lot of cars passing by here.
It's dangerous.

958
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:22,955
You need to be careful.

959
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:25,131
- Be careful, okay?
- Thank you.

960
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,887
Girls these days are good at soccer.

961
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,259
Jong-a is good too.

962
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:36,805
- Really?
- She's good at everything.

963
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,941
That girl looks so familiar.
Where have I seen her?

964
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,268
Let's go. We're late. Come on.

965
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:51,454
Guys!

966
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,278
I just saw Hyeon-ji's dad.

967
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,031
Really? Hyeon-ji's dad?

968
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:56,946
- Yes.
- Where?

969
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,164
Over there.

970
01:14:58,243 --> 01:14:59,663
- Let's go.
- Okay.

971
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,741
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
<i>MISSING: THE OTHER SIDE</i>
