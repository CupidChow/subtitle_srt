00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,012
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,972
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,313
Send an ambulance here, quick.

4
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,773
To 4 Guja-ro 10-gil.

5
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,941
A man in his twenties.

6
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,192
He's in a critical state!

7
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,279
Il-yong,

8
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,449
hang in there.

9
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,359
You bastards.

10
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,123
You can't just leave like this.

11
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,255
Il-yong!

12
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,009
Il-yong.

13
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,218
Il-yong!

14
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,761
Wake up.

15
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,930
Oh Il-yong!

16
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,057
You know each other?

17
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,197
You're the guy
who went to see Bo-ra, aren't you?

18
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,366
Who are you?

19
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,869
What did you do to Il-yong?

20
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,167
I have a lot of questions for you too.

21
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,669
But first, save him.

22
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,714
We'll meet again soon.

23
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,466
Where do you think you're going?

24
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,180
Or shall I kill you here now?

25
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,475
I told you. We'll meet again soon.

26
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,103
Damn it!

27
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,000
How do they know each other?

28
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,211
Let's go.

29
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,128
Yes, sir.

30
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,773
Here.

31
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,316
Drink this.

32
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,196
Goodness.

33
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,079
You heard it too, right?

34
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:54,711
That Il-yong was with Wook
before returning here.

35
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,587
Of course I heard.

36
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,508
Then…

37
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,887
Wook must have found Il-yong.

38
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,019
That's good.

39
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,188
It's a good thing, isn't it?

40
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,943
So don't worry about him,

41
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,488
and just focus on composing yourself.

42
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,490
Okay.

43
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,746
-Thanks, Mr. Jang.
-Not at all.

44
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,331
I didn't do anything.

45
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,124
Pull yourself together.

46
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,667
Don't cry.

47
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,671
Don't cry. Please don't.

48
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,638
SUPERMARKET

49
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,273
Captain.

50
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,442
I think I know where my body is.

51
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,528
What do you mean?

52
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,740
I went to this house with Wook.

53
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,409
It was the only house I couldn't get in.

54
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,995
I could go in anywhere else,

55
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,623
but I couldn't go in there.

56
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,292
I don't know why.

57
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,628
But I just…

58
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,338
I just have a feeling

59
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,673
that my dead body is there.

60
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,259
Then what are you doing here right now?

61
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,761
You should go find your body.

62
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,929
Not yet.

63
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,806
I still have lots of work to do.

64
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,892
I have to help find Alice,

65
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,353
and I have to visit
a few more villagers' homes.

66
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,439
And when all that is done,

67
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,359
that's when I'll tell Wook.

68
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,445
So until then, please keep this

69
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,239
a secret, Captain.

70
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,661
I thought

71
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,331
we would have more time.

72
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,671
I didn't know
you'd leave so suddenly, Il-yong.

73
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,274
Wook.

74
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,359
How is Il-yong?

75
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,695
What did the doctors say?

76
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,612
Right now,

77
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,240
he's in the ICU.

78
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,452
He had a cardiac arrest,

79
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,287
but an ambulance arrived right after,

80
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,830
and they did CPR and everything.

81
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,789
Is he conscious?

82
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,792
No.

83
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,295
He's unconscious, but he's alive.

84
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,255
What?

85
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,468
Oh Il-yong had been alive?

86
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,929
Then who was the Il-yong
that you've been seeing, Wook?

87
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,848
I don't know either.

88
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,641
I don't know what's going on right now.

89
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,227
Was Il-yong alone in that house?

90
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,189
The man who went
to see Bo-ra was also there.

91
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,567
There was someone
who called 911 before you did.

92
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,110
Then that's…

93
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,696
So was he

94
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,365
trying to save Oh Il-yong?

95
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,578
I think he was there
because of Il-yong rather than you.

96
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,954
I think so too.

97
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,665
But he recognized me.

98
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,043
He asked me
if I was acquainted with Il-yong

99
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,670
and said we'd meet again soon.

100
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,195
What happened?

101
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,530
Il-yong is alive?

102
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,864
He's still…

103
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,450
unconscious.

104
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,245
He must have been in a coma all along.

105
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,996
He's been like that for three years.

106
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,123
Can he wake up?

107
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,668
There are lots of such cases
around the world.

108
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,835
Here.

109
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,296
A woman in the US woke up
after being in a coma for two years.

110
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,633
And there's a man in China
who woke up after three years.

111
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,429
There's also a woman
who woke up after 27 years.

112
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,099
That's truly a miracle.

113
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,059
Exactly.

114
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,645
Oh Il-yong is indeed a sheer miracle.

115
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,356
He went to the village
even though he was in a coma.

116
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,984
The other dead people couldn't
even leave the village.

117
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,027
But only Il-yong could, right?

118
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,071
Right.

119
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,323
It makes sense in a way.

120
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,617
Right?

121
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,496
Il-yong wanted
to find his body no matter what.

122
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,082
That's why he sought you out.

123
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,545
I blindly searched for you for a year.

124
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,464
I was very desperate.

125
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,843
After going through so much
to find your body…

126
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,806
Il-yong…

127
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,811
He will wake up, right?

128
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,231
-I believe that he will.
-He should.

129
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,527
Earlier, he appeared in the village
before he suddenly disappeared.

130
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,279
Captain Kang was heartbroken.

131
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,115
When she hears that Il-yong is alive,

132
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,618
I'm sure she'll be overjoyed.

133
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,881
I'm sure I've seen him before.

134
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,884
But where?

135
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,265
This is Shin Jun-ho.

136
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,560
Is that right?

137
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,562
Okay, I'll be there right away. Thank you.

138
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,317
Why not?

139
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,027
It's against the rules.

140
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,987
-I didn't do anything wrong.
-You can't.

141
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,364
I'm sorry. Please.

142
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,699
-I have to go in.
-You can't.

143
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,617
Ms. Jin Hee-jeong.

144
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,833
I have a few things I'd like to ask you.

145
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,921
You know Mr. Oh Il-yong, right?

146
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,882
The man you had been taking care of.

147
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,097
I don't know his name.

148
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,431
I was just nursing him.

149
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,482
You don't know the patient's name,
and you've never seen his guardian.

150
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,275
Did you really just nurse him?

151
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,402
For three years?

152
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,154
Why would I lie about that?

153
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,242
How did you get there in the first place?

154
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,329
I got a call
that someone was looking to hire a nurse.

155
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,581
So I went there following the address.

156
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,417
We only spoke through text messages.

157
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,468
The drugs I needed were delivered

158
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,180
together with my monthly wage.

159
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,810
I saw that there was
a security camera in the room.

160
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,311
Do you know how to use it?

161
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:10,896
No, I don't.

162
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,231
I didn't touch anything.

163
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,567
Then why did you try to run,

164
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,527
leaving behind your patient?

165
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,698
I was scared.

166
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,117
My calls weren't being picked up.

167
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,578
No one delivered the drugs or my wage.

168
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,622
And a strange man
kept coming to the house.

169
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,879
Was it…

170
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,673
this man?

171
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,425
Do you know who he is?

172
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,180
No.

173
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,931
I don't know him.

174
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:53,063
Shin Jun-ho is the grandson
of the chairman of Choiseung Construction.

175
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,692
Kim Wook is the son of the housekeeper,
who worked for the chairman.

176
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,613
They worked together
to send Dong-min to prison.

177
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,448
Yes.

178
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,911
Then what's the relationship
between Kim Wook and Oh Il-yong?

179
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,288
I didn't realize
that they knew each other.

180
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,289
I didn't either.

181
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,292
But now we do.

182
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,379
Wait a minute.

183
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,719
Then would Kim Wook know
where Oh Il-yong hid my stuff?

184
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,931
Should I go catch them both?
You should ask them directly.

185
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,682
No.

186
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,392
We just need Oh Il-yong.

187
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,437
Then Kim Wook will come to us on his own.

188
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,856
But what if he doesn't?

189
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,150
That's not how you do the math.

190
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,488
There's 99% certainty that he'll come.

191
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,489
Right?

192
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,288
What an interesting turn of events.

193
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,089
So Il-yong has been showing up
in your dreams?

194
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,840
Yes.

195
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,679
The same woman kept showing up.

196
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,264
So at first,

197
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,809
I wondered what she had to do with me.

198
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,686
But the truth was…

199
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:15,980
in that room,

200
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,316
Il-yong was the one lying on that bed.

201
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,112
I was the one dreaming,

202
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,866
but in the dream,
I was Il-yong, not myself.

203
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,870
Isn't it strange?

204
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,080
Of course it is.

205
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,001
How desperate he must have been
to show up in your dreams.

206
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,169
I should have realized sooner.

207
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,381
Who could have known?

208
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,467
It was only possible
because you always have your suspicions.

209
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,468
You did well.

210
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,512
You saved Il-yong.

211
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,267
It feels strange

212
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,521
to think that I won't see Il-yong
in the village anymore.

213
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,819
You can meet him outside.

214
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,073
Do you think he'll recognize us
when he wakes up?

215
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,702
We know him. That's what matters.

216
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,498
You're right.

217
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,877
Does he owe you money or something?

218
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,715
He didn't pay up?

219
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,894
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

220
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,479
LETTERS TO A YOUNG POET

221
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,105
I never knew you read books like this one.

222
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,067
Why would you say that?

223
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,612
There's no law that says
which books I should or shouldn't read.

224
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,905
Of course not.

225
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,783
I was just saying

226
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,993
because it mentioned a poet and stuff.

227
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,370
Captain.

228
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,872
Have a seat. I have something to tell you.

229
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,918
What surprising news
are you going to tell me now?

230
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,003
This may shock you.

231
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,089
Do you have something
to calm you down here?

232
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,548
You should take it first, if you do.

233
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,926
Forget all that.

234
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,595
I'm here because I'm dead.

235
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,431
It wouldn't surprise me
if someone came back from the dead.

236
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,687
You hit it spot on.

237
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,690
What?

238
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,358
Did someone…

239
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,444
really come back from the dead?

240
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,906
Il-yong.

241
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,585
Oh, dear.

242
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,297
-Have a seat and hear us out.
-Goodness.

243
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,883
What about Il-yong?

244
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,344
What?

245
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,138
What happened to him?

246
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,349
He's alive.

247
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,690
He's really alive?

248
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,483
He's not conscious yet,

249
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,403
but we should hope that he wakes up.

250
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,991
Thank you so much.

251
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,245
Wook.

252
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,706
You saved Il-yong.

253
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,916
It wasn't me.

254
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,586
Il-yong saved himself.

255
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,673
Thank you, dear Lord.

256
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,761
Well done, Il-yong.

257
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,846
From the first day

258
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,973
he arrived,

259
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,393
he wouldn't stay still.

260
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,273
3 YEARS AGO

261
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,234
Il-yong.

262
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,195
Where have you been?

263
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,654
You were gone the whole day.

264
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,865
I've been outside.

265
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,577
-Outside where?
-The neighborhood I used to live in.

266
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,039
I went to see the guy who killed me,

267
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,209
but it seemed like they couldn't see me.

268
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,170
Met who?

269
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,380
You went where?

270
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,424
The neighborhood I used to live in.

271
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,262
I knew then that he was different from us,

272
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,475
but I really had no idea
that he would be alive.

273
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,603
Neither did I.

274
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,189
This isn't something to be sad over.

275
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,191
Calm down.

276
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,694
I don't know if I can calm down.

277
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,197
Tell me more.

278
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,991
How? How was he alive?

279
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,828
He was stabbed with a knife.

280
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,413
And since then, he's been in a coma.

281
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:47,876
Pil-jung hid Il-yong
and hired a caregiver.

282
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,629
When Il-yong and Wook went to that house,

283
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,589
Il-yong couldn't go inside.

284
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,134
So they thought it was strange.

285
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,887
It was probably
because his body was in there.

286
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,015
I see.

287
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,601
I just have a feeling

288
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,812
that my dead body is there.

289
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,358
He wasn't dead.

290
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,699
This morning, as soon as I woke up,

291
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,286
I stood near the village entrance
for a long time.

292
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,998
I felt like Il-yong would show up

293
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,584
and say he'll be back later.

294
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,211
But now…

295
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,589
It's all good.

296
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,217
It's better that I can't see him.

297
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,096
The living must get on with their lives.

298
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,682
Yes.

299
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,642
We'll visit often.

300
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,855
We'll be here so often
that you'd grow sick of us.

301
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,109
Keep that instant coffee in stock.

302
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,113
Sure, I'll make coffee for you

303
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,990
for the rest of your life
until you grow sick of it.

304
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,329
Let's have a cup before we go.

305
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,458
Hey, can you help me with this?

306
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,375
Sure.

307
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,088
CUSTOMIZED CUP SLEEVES

308
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,382
We have a lot of cup sleeves left though.

309
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,384
Open it.

310
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,439
SEARCHING FOR A MISSING CHILD
KIM SANG-YEON

311
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,024
You plan to investigate these too?

312
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,109
NAME: JANG HYEON-JEONG…
NAME: SONG SEUNG-HUI…

313
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,569
NAME: KIM SANG-YEON

314
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,072
I thought you'd personally go looking.

315
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,365
You're awesome, Ms. Lee.

316
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,283
I'm going to find them myself later.

317
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,952
But first, I'm going to start with this.

318
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,041
How about making a bulletin board here?

319
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,542
A bulletin board?

320
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,046
Where our customers can see well.

321
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,465
About this big?

322
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,717
Do we have some wood in our storage room?

323
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,928
What? You're going to make it yourself?

324
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,640
I even built enclosures
for my chickens and rabbits back home.

325
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,769
All you have to do is buy us meals often.

326
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,480
Okay. Then I'll leave it to you.

327
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,233
Good luck with your work,
and you can go home when it's time.

328
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,401
I have to go.

329
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,111
Bye.

330
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,404
See you…

331
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,364
Hey.

332
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,574
Don't you think she trusts us too much?

333
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,159
I know, right?

334
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,077
Right?

335
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:38,880
Il-yong.

336
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,343
You came and took me to the village.

337
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,388
You showed up in my dreams

338
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,764
and made me find you.

339
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,267
If you bothered me that much,

340
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,353
shouldn't you wake up
and make it up to me?

341
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,279
I'm going to make you pay interest too.

342
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,286
Wake up.

343
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,832
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

344
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:14,750
Here you go.

345
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,753
This is Team Leader Lee Man-sik
from the Drug Squad.

346
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,546
-Hello.
-Hello.

347
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,256
I remember you now.

348
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,425
It's been about two years, right?

349
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,926
You grew your hair long.

350
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,972
He has questions about Oh Il-yong.

351
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,684
I heard Oh Il-yong
and Kim Pil-jung were friends.

352
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:37,314
Apparently, Oh Il-yong hid something
that belonged to Kim Pil-jung.

353
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,817
I think it would help our investigation
if we can find out what that is.

354
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,694
Mr. Kim Wook.

355
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,489
I'm telling you this
since I heard that you know most of it.

356
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,241
Right after Goliath, Kim Pil-jung, died,

357
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,327
a new Goliath has been active.

358
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,079
More so than before, in fact.

359
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,415
It means someone
is definitely behind Goliath.

360
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,752
If Oh Il-yong hid
something belonging to Kim Pil-jung,

361
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,464
then he'll never be safe.

362
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,634
So…

363
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,469
please tell me everything you know.

364
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,724
Then…

365
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,936
will the police
guarantee Il-yong's safety?

366
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,647
Even now, he's lying
in the hospital by himself.

367
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:21,817
Yes.

368
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,944
We'll protect him around the clock.

369
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,705
I don't know
exactly what it is that Il-yong hid.

370
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,457
Il-yong.

371
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,918
Mr. Noh's gone crazy, looking for you.

372
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,336
There's no time for this.

373
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,797
But I heard

374
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,258
that Mr. Noh is looking for Il-yong.

375
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,217
Mr. Noh?

376
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,261
Do you know who that is?

377
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,846
No, I don't.

378
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:52,848
But…

379
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,559
there is someone

380
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,435
who seemed suspicious.

381
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,397
I have a lot of questions for you too.

382
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,023
But first, save him.

383
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,568
We'll meet again soon.

384
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,988
The man who was there that day

385
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,740
said to me that we'll meet again soon.

386
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,830
This is the guy.

387
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,293
I've never seen him before.

388
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,711
Is he a gang member?

389
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,713
No. He didn't seem to be one.

390
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,590
He seemed different.

391
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,801
He was rather frightening.

392
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,642
Does he have a particular trait?

393
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,478
He feels strangely familiar to me too.

394
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,480
The way he talks was…

395
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,817
smarmy, should I say?

396
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,402
He spoke

397
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,988
in an overly polite manner.

398
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,825
People don't usually speak
like him, you know.

399
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm sorry.

400
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,042
Please go ahead.

401
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,419
Thank you.

402
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,632
I remember now.

403
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,260
When I went to see Lee Dong-min,

404
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,512
I met him in the corridor.

405
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,349
Then who was he visiting?

406
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,642
Let's find out.

407
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,062
-Let's go.
-What are you talking about? Go where?

408
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,318
I'll look into
the prison visitors' record,

409
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,487
so thank you, but as a civilian,
you should stay out of this.

410
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,072
You, punk. Stay in the office.

411
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,157
You're not even fully recovered.

412
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,451
Should I tell on you to Il-du?

413
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,246
Mr. Kim Wook.

414
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,165
I'd like your close cooperation
regarding this Oh Il-yong case.

415
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,500
Thank you.

416
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,088
Yes, sir. Just give me a call.

417
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,047
Stay in the office.

418
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:53,969
Where is it?

419
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,098
Sir.

420
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,308
Do you happen to know Mr. Lim Jong-yun?

421
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,310
I think he lives around here.

422
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,645
-Lim Jong-yun?
-Yes.

423
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,230
Oh, Mr. Lim.

424
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,525
Over there.
He lives in that house with a blue roof.

425
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,484
-I see.
-Yes.

426
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,819
Thank you.

427
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,781
LIM JONG-YUN

428
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,949
Lim Jong-yun.

429
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,033
Ms. Lee.

430
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,996
What's all this?

431
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,293
Is anyone home?

432
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,795
Is someone here?

433
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,842
-Hello.
-Hello.

434
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,801
Who are you?

435
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:38,346
Are you Ms. Lee Sun-hee?

436
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,057
Yes, I'm Lee Sun-hee.

437
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,060
This is for you.

438
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,150
And you are?

439
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,279
I'm Ms. Kang Eun-sil's distant nephew.

440
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,158
Eun-sil's…

441
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,243
nephew?

442
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,786
Yes.

443
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,539
And I'm his niece.

444
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,125
I heard that you and Mr. Lim

445
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,795
have been taking great care
of my aunt's grave for all these years,

446
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,213
so we came to thank you.

447
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,800
Is someone here?

448
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,763
Hello.

449
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,723
Yes?

450
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,770
You should stay for a meal
since you came all the way here.

451
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,521
We're just here

452
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,732
to thank you, that's all.

453
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,360
You need to eat well to be on your way.

454
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,278
It's all right, sir.

455
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,238
It's cold out here. Please go in.

456
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,573
Yes, we should be on our way now.

457
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,991
-Let's go.
-Sure.

458
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,201
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, sir.

459
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,286
Don't come out.

460
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,789
Take care.

461
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,254
I heard the same
when we went to your home in Duon Village.

462
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,340
"You should stay for a meal
since you came all the way here."

463
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,761
People are very generous
in the countryside.

464
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:03,973
Excuse me.

465
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,184
Yes, sir?

466
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:09,979
I just…

467
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,982
wanted to tell you to drive safely.

468
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,867
Sir!

469
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,077
Wait…

470
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,790
Oh, dear. He just had to give us a gift.

471
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,221
Mr. Jang.

472
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,973
-Yes?
-These are checks.

473
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,476
Why give us such a big amount of money?

474
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,231
Wait.

475
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,691
Let me go and give this back.

476
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,608
Okay.

477
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,781
What's going on?

478
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,205
Why are you throwing salt?

479
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,707
That's enough.

480
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,584
They brought the ghost in here!

481
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,002
Not this again.

482
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,837
Come on. Stop it.

483
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,339
I'm sick of this.

484
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,509
Goodness.

485
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,604
Sun-hee.

486
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,863
Sun-hee, what's for dinner?

487
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,907
Sun-hee.

488
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,700
Sun-hee.

489
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,375
How long are you going
to keep picking me up from school?

490
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,170
They still haven't caught
that strange man?

491
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,507
Cops can't arrest everyone
just because they're strange.

492
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,967
I know that.

493
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,595
I'm just worried about you, Dad.

494
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,765
Can't you now stop
doing all these brave citizen acts?

495
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,187
You're a big girl now, is that it?

496
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,731
Let me know if you're hungry.

497
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,024
I'll get snacks for you.

498
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,902
I had spicy rice cakes
before coming home earlier.

499
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,656
Yell if you see someone strange outside.

500
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,783
My room is on the second floor, you know?

501
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,376
Hey, Detective Shin.

502
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,253
His name is Noh Yoon-gu.

503
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,379
Noh Yoon-gu?

504
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,340
He must be the Mr. Noh
that Kim Pil-jung mentioned.

505
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,717
He used to be the CEO
of a construction company.

506
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,637
Do you know for whom
the company mostly worked?

507
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,515
Don't tell me. Choiseung Construction?

508
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,100
Correct.

509
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,271
Then he must know Lee Dong-min well.

510
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,439
I think they were closer than that.

511
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,194
Now the puzzle is almost complete.

512
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,818
The money has been perfectly laundered.

513
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,614
Your friends do good work.
They're also fast at collecting fees.

514
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,240
Oh Il-yong

515
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,284
hasn't woken up yet.

516
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,794
What if there's no hope for that bastard?

517
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,845
Go eat something nice with your friends.

518
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,974
Make sure they're well-fed
and well-dressed.

519
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,392
Don't let them do drugs.

520
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,769
That way, we'll be successful.

521
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,021
Yes, sir. Thank you.

522
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,147
I'm off.

523
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,902
This and…

524
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,364
this.

525
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,573
Ten…

526
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,575
-Thirty million won?
-Yes.

527
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,870
The old lady threw salt around her place
as soon as we left.

528
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,540
And the old man gave us
this talisman and money.

529
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,668
What's going on?

530
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,544
Something fishy.

531
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,630
Did they owe money to Captain Kang?

532
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,632
If they did, they would have said so.

533
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,009
They could've just said
that they owe her money

534
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,512
and that they're paying it back
to the nephew.

535
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,638
Anyway…

536
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,349
let's give this money back.

537
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,394
And you should go ask
Captain Kang about this.

538
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,896
Ask her why Mr. Lim
would give us this money.

539
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,815
-I'll also look into the matter.
-Okay.

540
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,987
Jong-yun said that?

541
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,655
That I lent them money?

542
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,949
No, he didn't say that.

543
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:16,619
I told him I was your nephew,
and he gave me an envelope full of money.

544
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,705
There were checks
worth 30 million won in there.

545
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,041
Gosh, 30 million won

546
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,794
was enough to buy a house back then.

547
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,630
I saw that he hurt
a finger on his left hand.

548
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,048
When did that happen?

549
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,217
When he was working with my husband,

550
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,761
his finger got stuck
while doing maintenance work on the boat.

551
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,557
He couldn't work
for a few months because of that.

552
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,768
Sun-hee cried a lot
and went through a hard time.

553
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,187
Is she doing well?

554
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,148
Yes. She's hale and hearty.

555
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,108
Hale and hearty?

556
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,279
Did they sell Captain Kang's home
for 30 million won?

557
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,572
Or…

558
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,157
for the boat?

559
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,117
Is there anything you remember?

560
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,952
Well…

561
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,539
Hold on a second.

562
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,173
Insurance money?

563
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,717
After what happened
to Ju-won and my husband,

564
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,219
I didn't get any compensation.

565
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,097
These days,
insurance on the boat is a must,

566
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,932
but it wasn't back then.

567
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,936
So when I started taking the boat out,
I took out insurance.

568
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,648
If something happens,
those left behind must go on living.

569
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,735
I took out insurance on my sailors
as well as for myself.

570
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,613
The beneficiaries were
Jong-yun and Sun-hee.

571
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,906
That couple

572
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,450
was the closest one I had to a family.

573
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,244
That's right.

574
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,371
LIFE INSURANCE BENEFICIARIES:
LIM JONG-YUN, LEE SUN-HEE

575
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,833
I left that for them,
but now they're giving it back?

576
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,877
They're such good people.

577
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,629
I see.

578
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,215
I'm going to return it to them anyway,
so don't worry.

579
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,556
Mr. Jang.

580
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,392
I must be a materialist.

581
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,229
That's right, you are. That's nothing new.

582
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,818
While I was listening to Captain Kang
talk about her insurance money,

583
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,903
something struck me.

584
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,574
I stayed quiet because I didn't want
to hurt her feelings,

585
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,035
but something doesn't
feel right to me too.

586
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,037
Right? You find it strange too, right?

587
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:23,955
Yes.

588
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,291
I should look into it
when I go back to return the checks.

589
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,754
I'm going to the hospital.
I'll come home with Bo-ra later.

590
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,047
Okay.

591
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,090
Hey, you materialist!

592
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,091
Drive safe!

593
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,888
Meonggun, Janggun.

594
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,223
How have you been?

595
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,391
You guys.

596
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,612
It's been a week already.

597
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,322
How long are you going to sleep?

598
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,582
I kept my promise that I'd find you.

599
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,835
It's your turn now.

600
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,298
Wake up.

601
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,033
Is Oh Il-yong still the same?

602
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,534
Yes.

603
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,204
His organs are okay,

604
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:51,792
and so are his muscles
for someone who's in a coma.

605
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,925
I thought they were guarding him 24/7.

606
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,343
Where are the guards?

607
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,470
I sent them out to get something to eat.

608
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,388
By the way…

609
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,017
About Noh Yoon-gu.

610
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,811
For everything that happened so far,

611
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,105
if we put Noh Yoon-gu
in Lee Dong-min's place,

612
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,024
then it all makes sense.

613
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,327
Hey, it's me.

614
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,830
The Drug Squad is tightening the noose.

615
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,209
There seems to be a Drug Squad cop
among the delivery boys,

616
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,421
so we need to replace them
even if it costs us some.

617
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,174
Tell Goliath to take care
of the rest of the stuff

618
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,926
and stay off the grid for a while.

619
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,553
I'll take care of everything else myself
when I get there.

620
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,681
When are you going to come to Korea?

621
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,016
Soon.

622
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,018
Yes, sir.

623
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:51,936
Good luck.

624
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,063
Noh Yoon-gu knew
that the Drug Squad was investigating him.

625
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,233
Through Jang Do-ri,
he told Kim Pil-jung to hide the cocaine

626
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,484
and stay under the radar.

627
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,657
Is it done?

628
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,574
Yes.

629
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,244
He'll look like a druggie for sure.

630
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,455
The cops are not that naive.

631
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,084
It'll be fine as long as we leave
no evidence behind.

632
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,545
Hey.

633
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,505
How about a cup of tea here?

634
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,632
It says they have a great view.

635
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,550
Yes, sir.

636
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,598
They killed Kim Pil-jung

637
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,059
and put on a brake on
the Drug Squad's investigation.

638
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,104
What about Lee Dong-min?

639
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,025
You were stabbed
after you visited Lee Dong-min.

640
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,611
Lee Dong-min definitely
had a grudge against us.

641
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,780
It showed in the letters he sent you,

642
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,491
and I could tell when I went to see him.

643
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,161
He said he was in prison because of us.

644
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:57,084
What's the use in sending him to prison
when he doesn't even repent?

645
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,378
So he hired Noh Yoon-gu?

646
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,756
To stab you and threaten Bo-ra?

647
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,008
It's very likely.

648
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,801
But why did Noh Yoon-gu do that?

649
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,887
Was he paid by Lee Dong-min?

650
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,847
Or does he have something on him?

651
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,767
I don't know the exact reason,

652
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,021
but I think Noh Yoon-gu also
took advantage of Lee Dong-min.

653
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:18,939
How so?

654
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,400
So that we would suspect
Lee Dong-min instead of him.

655
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,867
Why did you take care
of the prison matter like that?

656
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,913
Why do you think?

657
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,541
I'm grateful for what he did
for me in the past,

658
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,379
but I'm no longer the man I was back then.

659
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,258
I'm not desperate enough

660
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,137
to set an orphanage on fire
over a paltry amount of money now.

661
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:53,849
Right?

662
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,904
It's me.

663
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,073
I want you to visit the police station.

664
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,868
No. Don't send him alone. Send a backup.

665
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,078
I told you.

666
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,579
Don't underestimate the cops.

667
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,125
I hear your parents moved to a nice place.

668
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,752
The houses are quite expensive
in that neighborhood.

669
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,880
Your parents will be fine, so don't worry.

670
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,174
Stay healthy until you're released.

671
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,217
All right?

672
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:29,969
Yes, sir.

673
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,434
Remember.

674
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,940
So Lee Dong-min was also

675
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,692
killed by Noh Yoon-gu?

676
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,902
To tie up loose ends?

677
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,780
That's what I think,

678
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,116
but it happened inside the prison,

679
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,909
so it's difficult to find evidence.

680
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,956
Hurry.

681
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,835
Stay here.

682
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,591
Oh Il-yong woke up.

683
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,345
Okay!

684
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,807
Now that he's alive, things will work out.

685
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,310
-Should I bring him?
-No.

686
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,022
I should go visit him.

687
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,779
Il-yong.

688
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,989
It's me, Wook.

689
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,241
Do you recognize me?

690
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,370
Hey, Il-yong.

691
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,914
Il-yong!

692
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,082
What's wrong with him, Doctor?

693
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,878
For a few days,
he'll be asleep more than awake.

694
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,881
He's awake for sure though?

695
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,132
Yes.

696
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,926
His senses will return gradually.

697
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,428
Thank you.

698
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,766
Goodness.

699
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,025
Is he awake?

700
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,667
Hello, sir.

701
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,627
Oh Il-yong has woken up.

702
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,965
The seven sailors returned alive,

703
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,177
but only the captain fell
into the sea and went missing?

704
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,185
Hi, Wook.

705
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,937
Mr. Jang?

706
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,105
He's outside.

707
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,399
Really?

708
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,316
Can he talk?

709
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,402
Okay.

710
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,573
How did she come up
with such a great idea?

711
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,742
She said she learned it all from you.

712
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:03,205
-From me?
-Yes, she said you're a man of action.

713
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,834
That I am.

714
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,336
SEARCHING FOR MISSING CHILDREN

715
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,839
-Mr. Jang!
-Yes?

716
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,301
Oh Il-yong is awake.

717
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,303
Really?

718
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,557
Thank goodness!

719
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,190
The answer is here somewhere.

720
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,443
Captain Kang!

721
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,777
Captain Kang!

722
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,446
Captain Kang!

723
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,824
Why do people always call me
when I want to do some reading?

724
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,453
Captain Kang.

725
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,204
Stop and catch your breath.

726
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,790
Il-yong…

727
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:47,708
Yes?

728
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,754
He's awake.

729
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,339
What?

730
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,632
He woke up.

731
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,384
He's really alive now.

732
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,053
Oh, my.

733
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,846
Thank goodness.

734
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,266
What did he say?

735
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,602
Does he remember what happened here?

736
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,813
He opened his eyes
but fell asleep right away.

737
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,900
He'll get better as time goes on.

738
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,658
Are you crying again?

739
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,619
I'm not crying.

740
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,330
Il-yong, that boy.

741
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,791
He keeps making you cry.

742
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,878
I'm so glad that he's alive.

743
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,800
SO GOOD COFFEE

744
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,469
She was so happy as if she was the one

745
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,262
who came back from the dead.

746
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,392
But…

747
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,061
what happened to Captain Kang

748
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,771
still remains a mystery.

749
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,565
So I looked into it.

750
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:58,404
There were eight people
on board the Juwon that day.

751
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:02,116
When the storm came,
six sailors took refuge below the deck

752
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,160
while Captain Kang and Mr. Lim
remained on the deck.

753
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,371
-Outside?
-Yes.

754
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,624
Captain Kang was in the cabin,
trying the radio.

755
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,584
That's what she told me.

756
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,255
The weather report was fine that day.

757
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,424
But the rainstorm was strong.

758
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,677
This is Juwon. Requesting a rescue.

759
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,847
We're evacuating to Seonggu Port
from our current location.

760
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,516
Juwon is on its way to take refuge.

761
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,684
Juwon?

762
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,686
-Then when the lightning struck,
-Can you repeat what you said?

763
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,312
I saw that Jong-yun was out on the deck.

764
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,731
Jong-yun, that idiot.

765
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,235
Jong-yun!

766
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,945
Go inside the cabin, right now!

767
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,989
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

768
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,537
She was in the cabin until the end?

769
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,455
Yes.

770
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,290
That's strange.

771
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,961
According to the final communication log
of Juwon,

772
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,089
it says the captain went missing
out on the deck.

773
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,800
Then it says
that the captain fell into the sea.

774
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,595
But Captain Kang said
she fell in the cabin

775
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,680
while talking on the radio.

776
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:12,019
Then what she remembers
is different from what you found out.

777
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,938
Jong-a, do you have
the records of her communication?

778
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,190
Yes.

779
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,358
Ten minutes before the last communication,

780
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,528
it was cut off while saying
they were taking refuge.

781
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,489
So Captain Kang was right.

782
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,910
How can someone
who fell in the cabin fall into the sea?

783
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,786
Exactly.

784
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,330
It is strange.

785
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,297
After that incident,
Mr. Lim didn't sail for a while.

786
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,840
He also suffered ill effects
from the incident.

787
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:46,094
He recently suffered from shingles.

788
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,013
I heard it hurts a lot.

789
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:51,308
He must have gone through a lot
since he was young.

790
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,020
I hope he stays healthy.

791
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,480
I know.

792
00:46:58,982 --> 00:46:59,816
Is this the house?

793
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,112
Hello, ma'am.

794
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,697
You remember us, right?

795
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,157
Why are you back?

796
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,493
We came to return something
to your husband.

797
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,452
Is he inside?

798
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,662
He's not home!

799
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,834
Well, I…

800
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,588
What's with her?

801
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,185
She seemed so sad at that time.

802
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,522
She seems like a different person now.

803
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,402
Sir.

804
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,611
Yes?

805
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,989
Do you happen to know Mr. Lim Jong-yun?

806
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,115
Oh, Mr. Lim.

807
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,450
You see that warehouse?

808
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,743
BAEMAN PORT SEAFOOD WAREHOUSE

809
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,911
He should be there.

810
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,329
Thank you.

811
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,166
There we go.

812
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,838
These five will be going out,
so leave them here.

813
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,298
These three go to the freezer.

814
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:05,757
No, it's fine.

815
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,428
I'll put them inside,
so go home and come back tomorrow.

816
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,888
It's heavier than you would think.

817
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,725
I'll put them in,
so just open the freezer for me.

818
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,061
I'll do it, okay?
Do you think I'm weak because I'm old?

819
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,356
-Go. Leave.
-Fine.

820
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,316
Bye.

821
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,984
-I'm leaving.
-Okay.

822
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,950
FREEZER

823
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,494
Here you are.

824
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,372
Hello.

825
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,915
Let me get that for you.

826
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,876
Here.

827
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,672
What brings you here?

828
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,759
We came to return this to you.

829
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,011
There's no need to do that.

830
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,929
-I gave it to you, remember?
-Come on.

831
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,389
Please take it back.

832
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,808
-We don't know--
-It's okay!

833
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,518
I gave it to you, remember?

834
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,645
Take it back.

835
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,272
Take it.

836
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,149
-I said it's okay.
-Oh, dear.

837
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,485
Why are you so angry?

838
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,904
I'm not angry.

839
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,238
Yes, you are.

840
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,747
Having a cold storage warehouse like this

841
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,832
would actually be pretty great.

842
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,043
Sir.

843
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,962
How long did he own that warehouse?

844
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,006
Mr. Lim's cold storage warehouse?

845
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,383
He had it for a long time.

846
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,385
He had that since he went fishing.

847
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,846
-So maybe about 30 years?
-It's more than that.

848
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,932
The original owner drowned at sea,

849
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,601
and it's been around 30 years
since the owner changed.

850
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,853
Is that so?

851
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,441
Why are you digging into our past?

852
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,860
Sorry? Oh…

853
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,072
You are mistaken.
That wasn't what I was doing.

854
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,074
I don't want to hear it. Just leave!

855
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,245
She's at it again.

856
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,831
She does that sometimes.

857
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,958
She gets startled easily
if someone approaches her.

858
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,836
She even brought exorcists
to chase away evil spirits.

859
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,964
I heard she takes psychiatric medication,
but it seems to make no difference.

860
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,093
-Thank you.
-No problem.

861
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,013
INSURANCE POLICY

862
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,649
Oh, dear.

863
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,569
Holding a memorial is hard work.

864
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,490
And they've been doing it for three
for over thirty years.

865
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,496
It must have been hard on Sun-hee.

866
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,959
How do I repay her?

867
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,761
I need to prepare Alice's meal.

868
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,889
Why do you keep coming here
when we have nothing?

869
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,142
Ma'am, we're not here to demand anything.

870
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,393
My husband and I

871
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,730
did everything we could for Eun-sil!

872
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,398
What is the matter with you?

873
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,816
Excuse me.

874
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,735
Please calm down.

875
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:15,614
I've been harassed by her ghost
for the past 30 years!

876
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,741
So please stop!

877
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,368
Just stop it! Stop it now!

878
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,662
Sun-hee.

879
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,956
Sun-hee.

880
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,210
It's me, Eun-sil.

881
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,878
-Sun-hee.
-Stop.

882
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,172
Sun-hee.

883
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,883
Stop!

884
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:41,556
I did everything I could
to send you on your way.

885
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,020
Please.

886
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,940
Get a hold of yourself!

887
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,775
What are you talking about?

888
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,446
Send her on her way?

889
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,880
I should cook dried radish greens soup
for Alice tonight.

890
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,427
How odd. She's so young,
but she likes dried radish greens so much.

891
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,114
That wasn't what we came to ask you about,

892
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,533
but it does seem
like something happened here.

893
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,201
I'd like to know what.

894
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,579
Where are you going?

895
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,497
-What are you so curious about?
-Why are you pushing me?

896
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,332
Stop pushing me. Please.

897
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:55,130
So you two sent Captain Kang on her way?

898
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,091
Sent whom where?

899
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,595
Who do you think saved those sailors
in that storm?

900
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,390
If it weren't for him,
more people would have died!

901
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,934
All eight of them could have died,

902
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,146
but he brought them home!

903
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,151
Where did you send her?

904
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,326
Where is her body?

905
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,460
Where are you, sweetie?

906
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,506
Alice?

907
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,676
Where are you, sweetie?

908
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,608
Look all you want.

909
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,651
There's nothing here.

910
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,403
Go and look if you want.

911
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:04,199
There's only her ghost here!

912
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,118
The house, the boat,
and the cold storage warehouse.

913
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:11,581
She haunts them all!

914
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,584
She's been haunting me
for the past 30 years!

915
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,711
What is wrong with you?

916
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,879
-Let go of me!
-Come on.

917
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,130
Move!

918
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,884
Come on out!

919
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,555
-Come on out!
-Hey!

920
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,979
Is this the police?

921
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,939
This is the Baeman Port Seafood Storage.

922
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,399
An elderly lady…

923
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,484
You need to help us. Please hurry.

924
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,069
My sweetie.

925
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,029
Were you playing here?

926
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,826
Captain.

927
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,341
Come on out.

928
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:42,065
FORENSIC SERVICES

929
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,047
The villagers must be feeling so empty

930
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,175
without Captain Kang around.

931
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,345
I feel empty too.

932
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,182
Who'd have thought her body

933
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,101
would show up like that?

934
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,064
If we had could tell beforehand,

935
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,150
we could have told her goodbye.

936
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,404
Then who

937
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,865
is going to look after Alice now?

938
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,997
Hye-ju will take care of her.

939
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,259
Who would be at the supermarket?

940
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:55,972
I don't know.

941
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,549
There's no one here?

942
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,475
We didn't get to see her go.

943
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,610
Welcome.

944
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:41,703
There's no reason to keep you alive
if you don't know anything.

945
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,620
Let's go. Come on!

946
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,497
You may not remember,

947
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,000
but you helped a lot of people.

948
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,626
I'm going to help you this time.

949
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,546
Then why am I still here?

950
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,674
Why must I be punished?

951
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,344
No matter what happens,
we'll never leave you alone.

952
00:59:59,012 --> 00:59:59,971
We were a family.

953
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,141
I thought a miracle would really happen.

954
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,892
It's not over yet.

955
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,145
I'm going to keep
the promise I made to you.

956
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,355
We'll never give up.

957
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:15,111
