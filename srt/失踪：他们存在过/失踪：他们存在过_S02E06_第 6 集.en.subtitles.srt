00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,887
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,389
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,184
He's a very scary person.

4
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,977
He doesn't deserve to be called a human.

5
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,687
I'm okay.

6
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,066
But my child…

7
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,859
My heart breaks for her.

8
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,069
My Alice.

9
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,821
You must find her.

10
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,448
You must.

11
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,533
Please.

12
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,328
Please find my Alice.

13
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,580
Please.

14
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,998
Please find her.

15
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:40,975
Alice!

16
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,271
Alice!

17
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,400
Oh, no.

18
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,318
Ali…

19
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,945
She's not here.

20
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,948
It's going to get dark soon.

21
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,574
Where did she go?

22
00:01:59,035 --> 00:01:59,869
Ali…

23
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,412
Alice.

24
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,081
Oh, dear.

25
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,119
-Ju-won.
-You hungry?

26
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,495
-Honey.
-Mom.

27
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,372
You worked so hard.

28
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,832
Goodness.

29
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,046
-What's all this?
-I brought the freshest ones for us.

30
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,632
Wow, you caught a lot of fish today.

31
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,550
I'll cook these. Go inside.

32
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,636
My wife is the best.

33
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,222
Hey! You're so silly.

34
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,598
Go inside.

35
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,183
Mom, I'm hungry. I want to eat soon.

36
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,560
Ju-won, look how sweaty you are.
You need a shower.

37
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,561
I can do that later.

38
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,813
-I'll heat up some water.
-Oh, goodness.

39
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,814
Hold on a second.

40
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,868
Here's the rice wine
that you like so much.

41
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,538
It's nice how the wife that always
nagged you to quit drinking

42
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,707
is now pouring you a drink, right?

43
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,919
My swole son.

44
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,588
I brought you the bananas you like.

45
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,299
Wait a minute.

46
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,261
Do you even know
what the word "swole" means?

47
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,265
Your mom is quite trendy now.

48
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,685
I learned a lot living here.

49
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:34,941
Stop laughing.

50
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,735
Are you two happy there without me?

51
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,616
I met a lot of good people here,
so I'm not lonely.

52
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,661
Did I tell you about Alice?

53
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,163
She's the youngest here.

54
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,625
When she first arrived,
she wouldn't eat a bite.

55
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,837
I was worried she wasn't eating
because she didn't like my food.

56
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,215
But she eats when given her rice
and side dishes separately.

57
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,843
She is such a pretty girl.

58
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,603
-Hold on.
-What?

59
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,855
Wait. Be quiet.

60
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,776
Don't you hear someone crying?

61
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,903
What crying?

62
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,449
Hey, Wook!

63
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:25,867
Wook!

64
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,835
Alice?

65
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,795
Alice?

66
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,715
Alice, Uncle Wook is here.

67
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:43,968
Alice!

68
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,471
-Alice! Oh, dear.
-Here.

69
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,638
Alice, come here.

70
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,599
This way.

71
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,100
Upsy-daisy. Let's get you down.

72
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,518
My goodness.

73
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,146
Goodness, Alice.

74
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,357
-It's all right. You're okay now.
-Goodness.

75
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,152
Alice, are you hurt anywhere?

76
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,571
Let's take a look at you.

77
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,655
She's all right.

78
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,574
Why is there a boat here?

79
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,035
I know, right?

80
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,245
What's this?

81
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,375
Hey, Wook.

82
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,376
Wook.

83
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,087
Wook.

84
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,338
Look here.

85
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,226
Oh, dear.

86
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,270
Captain! Goodness.

87
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,564
-Goodness.
-Oh, dear.

88
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,317
What's the matter? Are you hurt, sweetie?

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,862
I don't think she's hurt anywhere,
but look after her.

90
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,863
I have to go.

91
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,990
Why? What's going on?

92
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,201
When Alice disappeared this afternoon,

93
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,703
we searched around the lake
and found a boat.

94
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,705
She was inside the boat.

95
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,874
A boat?

96
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,209
By herself?

97
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,627
Yes.

98
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,338
I'm supposed to meet
with Mr. Jang and the principal there.

99
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,464
-I have to go.
-Okay.

100
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,674
Be careful.

101
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,806
My sweetie.

102
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,184
Who did you play with on the boat?

103
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,814
I played with the fish.

104
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,483
Fish?

105
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,364
There's no way.

106
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,950
How could they have appeared there?

107
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,829
-We have to go this way.
-Okay.

108
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,205
No. It's this way.

109
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,498
-That's what I mean.
-Here.

110
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,416
Look.

111
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,252
-Oh, dear.
-Here.

112
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,378
Over here.

113
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,631
Alice was crying on top of this boat.

114
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,091
Alice was…

115
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,968
here?

116
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:49,886
Yes.

117
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,722
How did a small girl like her
get up there?

118
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,226
And why is this boat here?

119
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,603
Oh, this.

120
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,897
It used to be out by the lake,

121
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,274
but after I came here, no one used it.

122
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,985
The footprint! Here.

123
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:06,944
Take a look.

124
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,197
See this footprint here?

125
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,114
Look at this.

126
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,366
It's way bigger than mine.

127
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,077
This is definitely a man's footprint.

128
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,078
Then…

129
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,998
did someone know the boat was here

130
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,501
and try to take it to the lake?

131
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,379
Mr. Jung, is there anyone
that comes to mind?

132
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,424
In this village,

133
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:33,221
there are only weak kids, women,
and old people like me.

134
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,601
Who can this be?

135
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,646
Anyway,

136
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,234
we should just keep the kids
away from the lake for a while.

137
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,151
Yes.

138
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,822
You're eating so well.

139
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,076
All done!

140
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,661
Was it good?

141
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,079
Yes.

142
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,124
Alice, are you sleepy?

143
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,793
Want a piggyback ride?

144
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,754
Here.

145
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:21,018
-Twinkle, twinkle, little star
-Twinkle, twinkle, little star

146
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,897
-How I wonder what you are
-How I wonder what you are

147
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:30,236
I know you love
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

148
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,865
My mom sings it better.

149
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,411
Where's my mom?

150
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,296
There, there.

151
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,550
Let's get you to bed.

152
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,178
It's strange how Il-yong

153
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,557
can perfectly guess what Alice wants.

154
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,731
How did it go?

155
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,649
Was anyone there?

156
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,319
No. There were only traces
that someone had been there.

157
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,738
The footprint was larger than my own.

158
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,532
The principal is forbidding the kids
from going to the lake,

159
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,908
so keep that in mind, Captain Kang.

160
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,410
All right.

161
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,620
Where's Alice?

162
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,079
She's with Il-yong.

163
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,498
After he fed her, he put her to bed.

164
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,794
I didn't see a peep of him
when we were searching for her.

165
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,757
Why do you always get irritated
whenever we talk about Il-yong?

166
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,885
There's good enough reason for that.

167
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,887
As for Alice,

168
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,182
I'll keep her with me from now on,
so don't worry.

169
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,143
Go inside and take a seat.
I'll bring out something to eat.

170
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,771
-Shall we?
-Okay.

171
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,105
-All right.
-Go in.

172
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,441
Okay. Let's eat.

173
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,991
Today's the anniversary
of my husband and son's death.

174
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,536
How did they die on the same day?

175
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,871
My son was on vacation.

176
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,666
He went fishing with my husband.

177
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,796
And that day, huge tidal waves
came without a warning.

178
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,716
On the first day, only the boat came back.

179
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,802
On the second day…

180
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,264
only my son washed ashore.

181
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,225
My husband came on the last day.

182
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,645
Other fishermen brought him home.

183
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:33,192
When I saw his face
bloated from being in the water,

184
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,737
I was so grateful.

185
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,451
He stayed with Ju-won
so he wouldn't be scared

186
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,789
and sent him home a day earlier.

187
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,333
He also brought himself home.

188
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,296
So I was very grateful for that.

189
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,595
Oh, don't look so serious.

190
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,932
It's been more than 40 years after all.

191
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:05,850
Drink up.

192
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,197
Then Captain Kang…

193
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,951
How did you end up here?

194
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,245
Me?

195
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,041
I hated even the sight of that boat.

196
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,169
I wanted to set it on fire.

197
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,754
So I took a can of oil
and went to the dock.

198
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,052
The minute I saw
the name of the boat, Juwon,

199
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,263
my resolve wavered.

200
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,764
Ju-won…

201
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,975
JUWON

202
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,936
We bought that boat
in the year our son was born.

203
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,898
So we named it after him.

204
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,529
If I got rid of the boat…

205
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,036
it felt like the memories of our family
would also completely disappear.

206
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,837
Since then,
I started taking that boat out.

207
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,801
That's how you became a captain.

208
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,222
Yes. Oh, gosh.

209
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,809
I took that boat out thinking,
"I don't care if I die today or tomorrow."

210
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,688
And goodness, I lasted for five years.

211
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,816
I caught a lot of fish
and made a lot of money.

212
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,361
I also hired several sailors.

213
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,738
Then one day,

214
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,576
I was suddenly swept away
by the waves and came here.

215
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:57,127
Unfortunately, there was no one
to hold a funeral for me.

216
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,505
So I think the Dragon King
took me away forever.

217
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,135
My story is no fun, is it?

218
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,015
How could a story of someone dying be fun?

219
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,934
There's no need to be so serious.

220
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,020
It's normal to talk about life
both laughing and crying.

221
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,984
I'm a weepy mess.

222
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,820
Drink.

223
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,280
We need to toast, though.

224
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,908
-Yes.
-Mr. Jang keeps taking sips by himself.

225
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,161
Good work.

226
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,123
You're here.

227
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,294
This is the leader of the Drug Squad.

228
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,628
-Hello.
-Hello.

229
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,921
How are you feeling?

230
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,214
I slept all day.

231
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,592
They said I'd be fine
with a few good days of rest.

232
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,010
That's good.

233
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,971
I'll be outside so you two can talk.

234
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,973
You can stay. I just have a few questions.

235
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,142
I don't do drugs. I've never done them.

236
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,226
I'm telling the truth.

237
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,062
I know.

238
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,981
Sang-cheol…

239
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,818
Did you hear anything
from the man who took you?

240
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,154
Nothing much.

241
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,073
He said he'd save me if I stayed quiet.

242
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,994
At first, I was stuck
in a shipping container in the mountains.

243
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,872
A few days later
when he brought me some food,

244
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,540
I managed to escape.

245
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,878
I was so worried about my daughter
and missed her so much.

246
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,464
I just wanted to hear her voice.

247
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,175
When you called from the pay phone?

248
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,635
Yes.

249
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,845
I was caught right away.

250
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,681
He yelled that he was going
to get killed because of me,

251
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,724
and I was so scared.

252
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,975
Wait.

253
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,936
He was going to get killed? By whom?

254
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,271
I'm not sure.

255
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,024
Whenever I asked him anything,
he said it was better for me not to know.

256
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,779
Do you have any idea
why they might have kidnapped you?

257
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,405
You should ask him yourself.

258
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,158
He's the one who grabbed me
outside the bar.

259
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,536
I would also like to know
what I did wrong to be kidnapped.

260
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,379
Who do you think put Alice on the boat?

261
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,131
I find that strange too.

262
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,845
Don't you think there's also
a secret to this village?

263
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,515
A secret?

264
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,641
In Duon Village,

265
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,686
Thomas used to lock up bad people
without the villagers knowing.

266
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,690
I don't know about that,
but I think that boat is suspicious.

267
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,526
It's also strange that it's on land.

268
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,444
The way it was covered by the trees…

269
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,322
It looked as though
someone had hidden it there on purpose.

270
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,951
Exactly. Did you see
Captain Kang's face earlier?

271
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,412
Captain Kang?

272
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,330
When you mentioned the footprint…

273
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,250
The footprint was larger than my own.

274
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,796
She looked like she knew something
but was hesitating to say it.

275
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,342
If she has something to say,
she'll say it when she's ready.

276
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,554
There's no one I trust
more than Captain Kang.

277
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,766
You think she's suspicious too?

278
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,809
No.

279
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,730
I may be suspicious,
but I'm a good judge of character.

280
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,469
Go back to sleep.

281
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,428
No, it's okay.

282
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,637
Goodness.

283
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,265
I didn't mean to wake you up.

284
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,350
It's okay. I must have fallen asleep.

285
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,065
Hey.

286
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,901
Doesn't Alice look cute
even when she's asleep?

287
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,570
She's like an angel.

288
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,113
I know, right?

289
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,201
She kept calling for her mom in her sleep.

290
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,495
She's that age.

291
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,581
She should be with her mom.

292
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,291
Why is she here?

293
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,752
Goodness.

294
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,714
What kind of bastard
hurt an angel like her?

295
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,926
A piece of dung that deserves to be hung.

296
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,055
Hey.

297
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:22,392
Alice seems unusually attached
to you and Wook.

298
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,272
I want to know
what happened to that little girl,

299
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,942
so if there's a way to find out,

300
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,111
talk to Wook about it.

301
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,658
What?

302
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,036
He said he found me
suspicious and unlikable.

303
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,580
Is this because of me?

304
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,959
Because of what I told you
when you first came here?

305
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,046
Why is that because of you?
It's all because of me.

306
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,716
And to be honest,
I understand why he's suspicious of me.

307
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,635
I'd find myself unlikable if I were him.

308
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,429
Il-yong.

309
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,309
There's no need to tell me
everything that you saw outside,

310
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,522
but if there's something
that upsets you or makes you angry,

311
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,107
you can tell me.

312
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,776
It doesn't have to be me either.

313
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,573
If there's someone you want to confide in,
talk to that person. Okay?

314
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,663
I will.

315
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,796
SEOUN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

316
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,008
-Mom!
-Bo-ra!

317
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,303
-Bo-ra…
-Mom…

318
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,950
Are you hurt?

319
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,619
What's wrong with your face?

320
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,454
It's just because I have no makeup on.

321
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,372
I'm fine.

322
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,043
You must have been so worried.

323
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,169
Of course.

324
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,255
You're my mom, but you always worry me.

325
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,132
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,843
I'm really sorry.

327
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,600
Let's go home, Mom.

328
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,770
Let's go.

329
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,856
Is it okay for me to go home with my mom?

330
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,317
About that…

331
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,736
The doctor said I can go home.

332
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,113
There are still some things
we need to investigate…

333
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,031
Hold on.

334
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,541
Why aren't you coming in?

335
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,711
I didn't think it was my place.

336
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,755
Goodness.

337
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,298
How is Se-yeong?

338
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,592
Bo-ra seems thrilled
to be going home with her mom.

339
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,052
But they're still in danger.

340
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,347
We haven't discovered
who was behind her kidnapping.

341
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,516
And we haven't found Detective Goh yet.

342
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,769
Ms. Mun will be taken
to a safe house for now.

343
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,687
Bo-ra…

344
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,313
She can stay with us.

345
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,024
She's gotten really close to Jong-a.
They're besties.

346
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,443
They're pretty similar.

347
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,784
Dad, Mom wants you to come in.

348
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,246
Dad?

349
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,163
Who?

350
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:35,711
I'm dependable like a dad, you know.

351
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,048
Go in. Bo-ra,
want to get something to drink?

352
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,133
Okay.

353
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,362
It's been a long time.

354
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,531
Yes.

355
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,868
I look awful, don't I?

356
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,579
You haven't changed a bit.

357
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,997
Oh, please.

358
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,957
I'm a lot more handsome now.

359
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,918
You really haven't changed.

360
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,128
You too.

361
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,924
I'm glad that you're okay.

362
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,387
Thank you for looking after Bo-ra.

363
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,222
Don't mention it.

364
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,023
And Bo-ra's dad?

365
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,401
She's 14 years old.

366
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,490
Never could I have imagined
that she'd go find you.

367
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,789
I'm glad that you're still
excessively virtuous.

368
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,212
It's because of you.

369
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,132
You're the one

370
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,427
who made me like that.

371
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,850
So I'm someone

372
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,478
important to you?

373
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,652
Alice?

374
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,446
Her name is Alice?

375
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,242
We asked her what her name was,
and she said she's Alice.

376
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,035
She never says much.

377
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,537
She's so cute.

378
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,374
She's too young,
so she can't talk precisely,

379
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,501
but I think she's
from a multiracial family.

380
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,545
Okay.

381
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,757
NAME: LEE ALICE

382
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,801
YEAR OF DISAPPEARANCE: 2022

383
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,849
She's not in
the missing children's database.

384
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,976
Maybe it's not her real name.

385
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,020
Or maybe she hasn't been reported.

386
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,441
Ro-ha wasn't reported missing either.

387
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:07,154
He came to the village eight years ago,
and no one has ever looked for him.

388
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,740
Il-yong went to his home,
and other people were living there.

389
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,536
And Yeong-rim's family all moved overseas.

390
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,580
-Overseas?
-Yes.

391
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,458
No wonder I couldn't find
an address for him.

392
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,378
But how did you find out all of this?

393
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:24,921
Il-yong told me.

394
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,632
Il-yong?

395
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,219
That Il-yong guy…

396
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,470
What did he major in?

397
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,930
Something to do with IT?

398
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,515
How did he find their addresses?

399
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,892
Did he hear it from them?

400
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,269
I don't know.

401
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,979
-According to him--
-Wait!

402
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,148
No. I don't want to hear this.
Don't tell me.

403
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,400
I'll do this my way.

404
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,404
I'll call you when I find
all the people on this list.

405
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,159
-I'll find them as fast as I can.
-Okay.

406
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,164
Goodness.

407
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,541
Why so sassy with me?

408
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,002
Gosh.

409
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,050
Why is she becoming like Wook?

410
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,089
Are you busy?

411
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,632
Come with me if you have time.

412
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,549
No.

413
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,302
You said you wanted to know
what I spend my time doing.

414
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,432
I want you to see for yourself.

415
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,188
What are you up to?

416
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,274
Punk.

417
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,364
Are you going on another picnic?

418
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,825
Alice, you too?

419
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,536
Hi, Mr. Jang.

420
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,621
Well, hello.

421
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,248
You should say "Hello."

422
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,876
I made some porridge
for the crybaby detective

423
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,878
since he's been crying
in his room all day.

424
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,130
Here, I'll carry it.

425
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,965
It's not heavy at all.

426
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,258
Captain Kang.

427
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,261
You think I'd carry it if it were heavy?

428
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:37,846
Give me that.

429
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,809
Let's go.

430
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,159
Why are you still acting like this?

431
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,495
I heard you didn't
eat anything yesterday either.

432
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,958
I brought you some porridge.

433
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,753
Get up and eat some.

434
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,134
Go outside and get some sun too.

435
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,847
I know it feels like your whole world
has come crashing down,

436
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,184
but it will get better in a few days.

437
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,158
Mr. Lee Gwang-taek?

438
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:45,914
Who are you?

439
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,332
Hello.

440
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,043
I'm Detective Shin Jun-ho
of the Missing Persons Team.

441
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,712
So what?

442
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,422
Do you know Goh Sang-cheol?

443
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,383
He's been reported missing.

444
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,551
-Never heard of him.
-You really don't?

445
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,887
I heard that you know him well.

446
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,808
What idiot said that to you?

447
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,643
Now, don't be like that.

448
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,269
Take a good look.

449
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,604
He may be someone you know.

450
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,779
Never seen him before. Don't know him.

451
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,696
Wait…

452
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,210
Lee Gwang-taek, Goliath…

453
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,423
Names I heard
while searching for Detective Goh.

454
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:41,261
I went to see Lee Gwang-taek today.
The jerk completely denied knowing him.

455
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,015
Gwang-taek?

456
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,475
Gwang-taek?

457
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,688
He asked me if Gwang-taek sent me.

458
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,232
Goliath?

459
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,902
I can't find Detective Goh
without your cooperation, sir.

460
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,071
You know that better than anyone.

461
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,919
Go see your son Ro-ha.

462
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,046
And don't come back.

463
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,562
Are you going to Seoul?

464
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,735
I happily drive all this way
for the extra cash,

465
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:42,071
but the problem is
going all the way back to Seoul.

466
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:42,989
I get sleepy too.

467
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,241
Goodness.

468
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,287
You were released?

469
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,289
What?

470
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,374
Oh, this?

471
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,212
Yes. I got out today.

472
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,047
It must have been tough.

473
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,131
Congratulations.

474
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,302
But no welcome committee?

475
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,056
I wrote a letter
saying I'd get home on my own.

476
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,559
I was too ashamed.
I wasn't much of a father or husband.

477
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,521
How long has it been?

478
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,606
It's been nine years.

479
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,486
I can't apologize enough
to my wife and kid.

480
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,862
Wow. Nine years…

481
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,615
Your kid must have grown so big.

482
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,328
The last time I saw him, he was eight.

483
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,497
He must be in high school now.

484
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,750
I'm worried
that I might not recognize him.

485
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,879
You've never seen him since then?

486
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,716
After the trial,
I told my wife not to come visit me.

487
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,846
I said I'd send her the money
I make working inside,

488
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,931
so she should just pretend that I'm gone

489
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,600
and live like others
so our son wouldn't be discouraged.

490
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:58,273
I told her I'd pay for my crimes
and proudly walk out to see her.

491
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,867
I only have a picture
from when my kid was young.

492
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,286
I imagined countless times
what he would look like.

493
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,913
I wonder how he's grown up.

494
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,890
You didn't have to give me a ride
all the way here. Thank you.

495
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,266
It's been fun.

496
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,775
Whose home is it?

497
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,110
It's Ro-ha's home.

498
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,070
Ro-ha's name is Lee Ro-ha.

499
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,239
It says Byeon Seok-ha here.

500
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,950
This is the house Ro-ha used to live in.

501
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,411
Someone else seems to live here now.

502
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,331
But here's a letter addressed to Ro-ha.

503
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,291
Take a look.

504
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,337
He's been sending letters here
not knowing that they moved?

505
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,137
SENDER: LEE JIN-SEONG
RECIPIENT: LEE RO-HA

506
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,181
Someone's coming.

507
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,601
Sender, Lee Jin-seong…

508
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,353
Seoul…

509
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,903
"Ro-ha."

510
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:31,574
"Your foolish father
can now finally go home."

511
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,328
He still doesn't know
that Ro-ha disappeared?

512
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,455
He must be in prison.

513
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,752
You were just a little boy
when I last saw you.

514
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,671
You must be so big now.

515
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,802
I'm going to work hard to become
a dad you can be proud of.

516
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,719
And…

517
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,556
I'll try my best to make up
for all of the past years.

518
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,350
Let's go on trips, the three of us,

519
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,645
and be happy together.

520
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,897
BYEON SEOK-HA

521
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,370
Who are you?

522
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,207
I'm sorry, but when did you move in?

523
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,750
It's been a while.

524
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,420
Do you know where
the previous residents went?

525
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,963
No, I don't.

526
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:27,922
Let's go, Ha-il.

527
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,259
Hurry up.

528
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,719
Why are you in such a hurry?

529
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,017
Ro-ha.

530
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,728
Let's have fun today
with Mom and Dad, okay?

531
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,062
Let's go.

532
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,605
Let's go!

533
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,233
OUR HAPPY FAMILY
LEE JIN-SEONG, GOH EUN-JEONG, LEE RO-HA

534
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,403
BYEON SEOK-HA

535
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,240
This is so sad.

536
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,243
You didn't tell him about Ro-ha, did you?

537
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,536
I couldn't.

538
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,748
I dropped him off at his house and left.

539
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,542
What happened to Ro-ha's mom?

540
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,296
Was she in the same accident as Ro-ha?

541
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,382
Then she'd be here with Ro-ha.

542
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,218
Ro-ha's dad will go look for her now.

543
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,262
He's been waiting to see them
for nine years.

544
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,972
I don't think he'll give up easily.

545
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,515
He shouldn't.

546
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,351
Ms. Lee!

547
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,979
You're going to overwork yourself.
Take it easy!

548
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,814
-That goes to the kitchen.
-Okay.

549
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,025
You've been working here by yourself?

550
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,569
-You should've told me.
-I was wrapping up the kitchen.

551
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:36,365
After we finish setting the tables,
we can open in a few days.

552
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,493
Take it easy! No one's rushing you.

553
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,494
No!

554
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,913
We need to get the equipment in here fast
and find the kids.

555
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,290
This is now a matter of pride.

556
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,169
The key is to find information
quickly and precisely.

557
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,339
Oh Il-yong isn't listening in, is he?

558
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,842
Ma'am, could you come take a look?

559
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,010
I'm coming!

560
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,095
Bye.

561
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,307
Il-yong listening?
And what key was she talking about?

562
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,185
She just wants to find those kids
as fast as she can.

563
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,645
You know what Ms. Lee is like.

564
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,188
I should go take care of my business too.

565
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:08,981
Where are you going?

566
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,233
To the school.

567
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,156
That kid wearing a white shirt.

568
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,741
His name is Lee Ro-ha.

569
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,785
He's been here for eight years.

570
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,830
There are other kids
who have been here longer though.

571
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,081
So what?

572
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,210
Ro-ha is not even listed as missing.

573
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,295
Either no one is looking for him,

574
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,381
or no one knows that he's missing.

575
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,298
That…

576
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,717
That's not comforting at all.

577
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,010
It wasn't meant to be.

578
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,850
I was just talking about Ro-ha.

579
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,227
That's the situation he's in.

580
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,898
This place is full of people who died
but whose bodies haven't been found.

581
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,441
We're all in the same situation.

582
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,120
You look like death.

583
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,707
What's wrong with a dead man
looking like death?

584
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,250
Don't get all mad.

585
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,376
You're so weird.

586
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,419
Very weird.

587
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,633
Detective Goh, come here! Let's talk.

588
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,843
I have nothing to say.

589
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,511
Goodness.

590
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,888
Isn't Ro-ha's dad getting out today?

591
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,139
I thought you were going to get him.

592
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,141
I gave him a ride home.

593
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,310
He'll know by now that Ro-ha is gone.

594
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,770
But he won't know that he's dead.

595
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,689
He'll find out someday.

596
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,274
Detective Goh!

597
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,692
Wait.

598
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,450
There used to be, but not anymore.

599
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,453
It's a bad boat,
so the grown-ups got rid of it.

600
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,123
Why did she call it a bad boat?

601
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,128
Hey. Ms. Ahn.

602
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,341
Mr. Jang's going to help
with the flags for our field day.

603
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,592
Welcome.

604
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,886
I'll go get the flags from the classroom.

605
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:02,970
Sure.

606
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,391
Whose drawing is this?

607
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,893
It's Alice's.

608
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,938
I told her to draw what she did that day.

609
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,690
There are two people in the boat.

610
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,525
Who is this other person?

611
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,071
If it was a stranger,
she would have been scared.

612
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,572
-You're right.
-Yes.

613
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,075
She wasn't.

614
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,328
She drew the boat big
and colored it yellow.

615
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,915
This signifies that she felt safe
and had fun in the boat.

616
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,417
You can tell that from the drawing?

617
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,630
She used to be an art therapist.

618
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,261
-See the fish in the boat?
-Yes.

619
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,305
Something that should be
in the water is outside.

620
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,600
It's a fantasy-changing method
that five-year-olds often show.

621
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,561
They don't use that if they feel uneasy.

622
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,731
So she had a fun time in the boat?

623
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,527
Do you know who among the villagers
has played with Alice?

624
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,862
I'm not sure.

625
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,490
But I still don't understand.

626
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,744
Ha-yun said something strange
to Yeong-rim.

627
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,622
She said it was a bad boat,
so the grown-ups got rid of it.

628
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,748
A "bad boat"?

629
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,210
Was there an accident involving the boat?

630
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,378
Do you know anything about it?

631
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:21,507
Well, when I came here,
the boat was already on land.

632
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,719
We should ask Captain Kang.

633
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,596
She's been here the longest.

634
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,018
Why do you want to know that?

635
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,894
The woman you kidnapped.

636
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,647
Se-yeong and I…

637
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,648
Are you two lovers?

638
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:40,901
Well…

639
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,695
We know each other well.

640
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,740
Doesn't that usually mean
that they're lovers?

641
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,950
Not now.

642
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,785
So former lovers?

643
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,581
I don't know what this is about,
but I want to hear it too.

644
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,590
My first assignment in the Drug Squad
was an undercover job.

645
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,343
It was a drug cartel
that operated on social media sites.

646
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,845
The drug lord's ID is Goliath.

647
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:12,475
He advertises in a secret chat room,
and buyers order using cryptocurrency.

648
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,726
I'D LIKE TO PURCHASE

649
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,063
When payment is confirmed,
they drop off the drugs.

650
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:21,901
They used to operate in small groups
but got bigger in the past two years.

651
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,361
They sell both wholesale and retail.

652
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,573
Even if we catch the underlings,
the drug cartel won't be revealed.

653
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,241
NAME: GOH SANG-CHEOL
(UNDERCOVER)

654
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,452
So we sent in Sang-cheol undercover.

655
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,412
You said he was a newbie.

656
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,122
His face wasn't known.

657
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,834
It was a classified investigation
even only a few in our team knew about.

658
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,337
Why is a drug cartel
kidnapping and killing people?

659
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,714
They're afraid of nothing.

660
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,134
If any of their clients fail
to pay back their due credit,

661
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,429
-they cut out their organs and sell them.
-Goodness.

662
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,764
Sell what?

663
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,140
Crazy bastards.

664
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,058
What?

665
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,477
They're harvesting organs domestically
and selling them?

666
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,271
Those bastards.

667
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,523
It's hard to do it here,

668
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,275
so they kidnap people
and send them to China for the operation.

669
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,821
Most are anesthetized, put in a box,
and loaded onto a smuggler's boat.

670
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,115
Choi Jeong-ah died in the box.

671
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,200
They told me to
secretly get rid of her body,

672
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:15,037
but I left her on the beach
so that the police would find her.

673
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,540
But why did you kidnap Se-yeong?

674
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,125
She told me she never did drugs.

675
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,628
I received a text message while working.

676
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,634
I don't know the reason.

677
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,428
I just do it when the order is given.

678
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,930
Who gives you the orders?

679
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,182
Goliath.

680
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,934
That was D-day.

681
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,604
Lots of drugs were coming in,
and Goliath was supposed to show up.

682
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:45,025
Sang-cheol sent me the changed location,
but I lost contact with him after that.

683
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,573
So you need Detective Goh
to catch Goliath?

684
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,827
If anything happens to Sang-cheol…

685
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,079
Will she be okay?

686
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,290
She's probably alive, right?

687
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,499
She will be okay.

688
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:03,961
Thank you

689
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,546
for saving Se-yeong.

690
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,300
That's why I became a police officer.

691
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,886
To protect the safety

692
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,263
and the lives of the people.

693
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,853
But now, that's all over.

694
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,646
Oh, dear…

695
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,773
I'm so proud of you.

696
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,941
Our crybaby detective.

697
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,819
Here. Eat this as you talk.

698
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,040
How did you end up here, Detective Goh?

699
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,542
What do you remember last?

700
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,086
Gwang-taek.

701
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,380
I was held captive in a container.

702
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,549
Then Gwang-taek stabbed me.

703
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,219
Which country's flag is this?

704
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,930
Is this the top? Or is this the top?

705
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,641
Can't you tell?

706
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,268
It's a flag of an imaginary country.

707
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,020
Just put it up anyhow you want.

708
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,481
No one would know
even if you hang it upside down.

709
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,733
Not even the kid who drew it.

710
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,364
Ro-ha drew this.

711
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,323
Isn't it good?

712
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,244
Ro-ha is a talented artist.

713
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:22,081
He has a good eye and is very expressive.
His dream is to be an artist.

714
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,626
He said his dream was
to come in first in a race.

715
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:29,129
The first place prize is
an easel and a paint set.

716
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,924
I think he wants to win the race
because of the prize.

717
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,051
Maybe there's also another reason.

718
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,471
Ms. Ahn, you know a lot about the kids.

719
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,848
Is it because you talk to them often?

720
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,226
Some kids tell me their stories,

721
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,645
and others, I guess
from looking at their drawings.

722
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,314
Can you show me the drawings?

723
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,149
I'd like your interpretations as well.

724
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,068
Sure. I can do that.

725
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,152
Please!

726
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,363
-Okay.
-Thanks.

727
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,283
Take care of it and send it up.

728
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,326
What brings you here?

729
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,663
I was directed here
by the local substation.

730
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,963
LEE JIN-SEONG
WIFE: GOH EUN-JEONG, CHILD: LEE RO-HA

731
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,134
NOVEMBER 6, 2014
JEONGSEONG MAEUM HOSPITAL

732
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,343
Okay.

733
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,889
For the past eight years, there's been
no sign that Goh Eun-jeong is alive.

734
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,891
We've looked for her
among unclaimed bodies

735
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,769
and unidentified bodies
that died of unnatural causes.

736
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,687
Unnatural causes?

737
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,108
Yes. We looked just in case
but couldn't find her.

738
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,738
So we searched the medical records
at the National Health Insurance Service.

739
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,325
Then…

740
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,119
was my wife hurt?

741
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,872
It's not that.

742
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,582
She's in a mental hospital.

743
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,878
Then what about Ro-ha?

744
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,590
Is he there with her?

745
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,342
No.

746
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,801
Only your wife is there.

747
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,181
Why don't you go see your wife
and ask her where your son is?

748
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,478
JEONGSEONG MAEUM HOSPITAL

749
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,065
She was an alcoholic and severely
delusional at the time of hospitalization.

750
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,150
Her state hasn't improved,

751
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,943
so she's been a long-term inpatient.

752
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,571
An alcoholic?
She can't drink even a drop of alcohol.

753
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,616
Who signed the consent form?

754
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,119
She did it herself.

755
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,374
This is her room.

756
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,563
Honey.

757
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,201
Eun-jeong.

758
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:06,995
It's me.

759
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,628
What are you doing here?

760
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,717
Where is our Ro-ha?

761
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,097
Our son, Ro-ha.

762
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,229
Get a hold of yourself, Eun-jeong!

763
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,150
Ro-ha. Where's our Ro-ha?

764
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,985
Where's Ro-ha?

765
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,528
You must not aggravate the patient.

766
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,447
Our son, Ro-ha!

767
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,614
You need to leave now.

768
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,534
Honey!

769
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,036
Hey, Detective Oh.

770
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,621
You must not aggravate the patient!

771
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:53,459
Let's take a look at the records
of the patients in this hospital.

772
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,335
Yes, sir.

773
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,380
It's nice here.

774
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:02,176
It's where kids draw and get counseling.

775
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,512
So you wanted to see their drawings.

776
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,640
Yes. You can read their thoughts
from their drawings.

777
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,517
It's so fascinating.

778
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,937
Show me Ro-ha's drawings.
He's really good at drawing.

779
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,147
Okay.

780
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,863
He used a lot of green in his drawings.

781
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,908
Eun-hee did a good job
of keeping all the drawings.

782
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,077
Ro-ha has been here for eight years,

783
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:32,039
so these drawings have been here
even before I got here.

784
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:33,874
You know…

785
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,627
The drawings all seem the same.

786
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,380
Ro-ha drew this when he just arrived here.

787
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,466
He drew the forest and trees.

788
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,842
The forest is dark,

789
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,720
and the trees are dark as well,
as if light can't get through.

790
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,931
I can feel fear from the drawing.

791
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,101
The tree trunk narrows as it goes up.

792
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,562
It's seen from a child's viewpoint.

793
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,482
The surrounding area is
also very detailed.

794
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,693
I think it's a place
somewhere in his memories.

795
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,821
A place he's actually seen or has been to?

796
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,989
Yes.

797
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,622
What's this?

798
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,167
Ms. Ahn, are you here?

799
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,127
-Yes.
-Okay.

800
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,421
Oh, you're also here, Mr. Jang.

801
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,714
Let's go.

802
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:23,674
Where are we going?

803
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,175
You'll know when you get there.

804
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,554
-There they are.
-Hurry up. Come on!

805
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,513
What are you doing?

806
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,600
Being late is like a sickness for you.

807
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,478
Mr. Jang, you're sick? Are you okay?

808
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,646
Who, me?

809
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,482
I'm fine. Why?

810
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,317
You've got a case of narcissism.

811
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,153
I mean, look at him.

812
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,030
He arrives last
to grab everyone's attention.

813
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,075
But when I was in a bind,
he didn't even show up to help.

814
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,119
He showed up after I took care of--

815
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:56,498
Gosh. What did you feed him
that he's so talkative?

816
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,918
Why are all these people here?

817
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,337
There's going to be a field day
in a few days,

818
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,755
so we gathered here.

819
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,048
Your hand's salty!

820
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:05,966
Salty.

821
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,217
Goodness.

822
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,470
Why is everyone here over a field day?

823
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,639
It's the biggest event of the year.

824
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,019
We need to have a meeting to prepare.

825
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,770
It's a huge event.

826
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:22,232
Everyone seems to be here.
Go ahead, Mr. Jung.

827
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:31,658
You can divide people
into two groups just like that.

828
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,871
Next is the mission race.

829
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,832
For the first leg of the race,

830
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,669
should it be running
with candy in the mouth?

831
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,965
Or running after eating sticky rice cakes
without using your hands?

832
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,925
-Mr. Jung?
-Yes?

833
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,219
Even when eating them normally,
sticky rice cakes

834
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,347
-can get stuck in your throat.
-Right.

835
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,476
Wouldn't it block your throat
if you eat them and run?

836
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,646
I think just eating it using your hands

837
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,649
or running while holding it
in your mouth would be better.

838
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,026
Captain Kang has a point.

839
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,152
Okay.

840
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,195
Then…

841
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,113
Let's make it

842
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,575
running with a sticky rice cake
held between the teeth.

843
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,915
Is this something that warrants
such serious attention?

844
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,500
I told you.

845
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,627
They're dead serious about this.

846
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,463
It reminds me of the old days. I like it.

847
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,756
-Yes.
-Wait!

848
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,758
Anyone volunteering as staff?

849
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,387
We can do it!

850
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,889
-Let go. Do it by yourself.
-Let's do it together.

851
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,975
The event staff will be
Il-yong and Detective Goh.

852
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,354
Do whatever you want.

853
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,565
Why aren't you doing anything?

854
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,609
Excuse me.

855
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,860
He's going to do it too.

856
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,362
What are you doing?

857
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,446
Dragging me into this?

858
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,615
What's so wrong with
dragging you a little?

859
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,536
He has a point.

860
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,579
Whose side are you on?

861
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,872
Well, I'm on--

862
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,916
There are no sides here.

863
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,752
What are we going to do here?

864
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,505
We're going to practice running today.

865
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,423
Yes!

866
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,301
I practiced running this morning too.

867
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,678
Really?

868
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,555
Man or woman, young or old…

869
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,391
Everyone is really serious
about this field day.

870
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,893
Kindergarten, lower grades,
and upper grades.

871
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,980
We'll divide them into those three
and each of us can take a team.

872
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,607
Hey, Detective Goh.

873
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,192
Where's this passion coming from?

874
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,902
You rarely sound enthusiastic.

875
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,656
I do my best at the job I'm assigned,
even if I don't like it.

876
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,492
This is why I like you so much.

877
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,035
I also do my best at my job.

878
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,495
I don't trust you yet.

879
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,831
I'll take the upper grades.

880
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,374
Then I'll…

881
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,839
A kindergartener called dibs on me.

882
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,469
Let's go.

883
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,598
I have to study for exams.
Where are you taking me?

884
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,100
You'll do well on exams
only if you study every day.

885
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,810
Cramming doesn't work.

886
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,562
You should be studying regularly.

887
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,564
I do, and today is just another day.

888
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,940
No, it's not.

889
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,235
Janggun and Meonggun, you're coming too!

890
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,071
Bo-ra, get Jjamppong.

891
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,616
What's special about today?

892
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,700
Today?

893
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,285
It's the opening day of the café.

894
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,204
You said you'd help out when it opened.

895
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,291
There's going to be a lot of people
since it's the first day.

896
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,460
A new café opening and all, you know?

897
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,420
Janggun, Meonggun, let's go!

898
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,136
Is this the right place?

899
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,474
My goodness. I'm sorry.

900
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,145
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

901
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,231
Yes.

902
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,367
-Mister!
-Mister!

903
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,701
Mister!

904
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,744
-Hello.
-Hello.

905
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,538
Hi. Welcome.

906
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,580
Get in.

907
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,541
-I'm riding in the front!
-No, me!

908
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,209
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

909
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,129
-I'll go in the front.
-Look.

910
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,298
SO GOOD COFFEE

911
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,550
Ta-da!

912
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,467
What do you think?

913
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:18,927
Let's go.

914
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,475
This is your new house.

915
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,649
Stay here.

916
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,111
Can I take Jjamppong inside?

917
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,279
No.

918
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,947
Jjamppong can't go inside yet.

919
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,992
But I want to take him inside.

920
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,035
You can't.

921
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,037
Jjamppong, you stay here for a bit.

922
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,915
Let's stay here, Jjamppong.

923
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,252
But…

924
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,671
There are no passersby here.

925
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,423
No one's going to come all this way.

926
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,275
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

927
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,236
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

928
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,198
-Happy birthday, dear Bo-ra
-Happy birthday, dear Bo-ra

929
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,659
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

930
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,704
Wait.

931
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,789
You have to make a wish first.

932
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,597
Happy birthday!

933
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,724
-Happy birthday, Bo-ra.
-Happy birthday.

934
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,436
Hey, wait.

935
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,604
Wait a minute.

936
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,231
There we go.

937
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,776
Bo-ra, open these later.

938
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,110
Okay. Thank you.

939
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,820
Happy birthday!

940
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,951
What's going on?
You said it was your café opening.

941
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,243
It is the café opening,

942
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,663
as well as your birthday party.

943
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,081
Have fun with your friends.

944
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,802
Girls, I prepared lots of food.

945
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,637
-Okay.
-Eat up before it gets cold.

946
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,846
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

947
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,431
The surprise was a total success.

948
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,726
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

949
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,317
Thank you.

950
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,944
For everything.

951
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,782
Let's eat.

952
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,164
Look at this.

953
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,834
We have to get it on her face.

954
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,795
Mr. Jang, Wook. Come here for a second.

955
00:54:58,878 --> 00:54:59,879
Okay.

956
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,273
Ta-da!

957
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,733
This is our new hideout.

958
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,235
Wow!

959
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,570
This is…

960
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,742
This is far better

961
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,494
than the office at the pawnshop.

962
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,625
The pawnshop was quite secure
and nice too.

963
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,295
This place is much safer and more secure.

964
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,922
I have special security cameras
all over the place.

965
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:47,343
Emergency alarms, security cameras,
wiretapping detection, fire detection,

966
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:51,014
magnet detection, and even motion sensors,
all operating simultaneously.

967
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,225
If we have an invader, the system will
send out warning texts first,

968
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,811
then send a real-time video
to our cell phones.

969
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,314
So it's automatically
reported to the police?

970
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,440
No.

971
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,193
The victim must report it directly
according to the law.

972
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,570
So I've set up the system
to send the data to all of us.

973
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,572
When you first mentioned opening a café,

974
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,241
I was wondering why you'd do that
all of a sudden.

975
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,118
So this was the real reason.

976
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,457
I'm so glad that Jong-a is on our side.

977
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,546
Was that faster than before?

978
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,256
Not at all. It's the same.

979
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,760
You've done enough for today.
Let's continue tomorrow.

980
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,220
All your friends went home.

981
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,347
See? It's going to turn dark soon.

982
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,557
Let me do this just one more time.

983
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,017
Blow the whistle for me.

984
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:39,521
Get ready.

985
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,774
This is really the last time.

986
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:43,691
Okay.

987
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,119
Thanks to Detective Goh,

988
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,703
Mun Se-yeong was saved.

989
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,914
He saved me too.

990
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,791
He couldn't save himself, though.

991
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:05,004
He was stabbed by Lee Gwang-taek
in a container at Wondo Port.

992
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,343
We'd searched all the containers.

993
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,852
Please find our poor
crybaby detective quickly.

994
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,437
I will.

995
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,658
Your help was crucial this time.

996
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,952
Obviously. I've always been a big help.

997
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,871
Remember all the information I provided?

998
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,582
You've just forgotten, that's all.

999
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,087
What is it? What's wrong?

1000
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,550
I only have my suspicions right now,
so I can't tell you.

1001
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,511
Detective Shin,
answer right away whenever I call.

1002
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,639
If anything happens to me,
it's all your fault.

1003
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:57,557
Got it?

1004
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,658
Call the police
if I don't come back in ten minutes.

1005
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,243
Sorry? Oh, okay.

1006
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,918
I'd heard that a drunk customer
was passed out in the room.

1007
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,880
Since it happens often,
I went inside without thinking much of it.

1008
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:32,091
But when I saw her, she didn't seem drunk.

1009
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,134
Drugs?

1010
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:36,179
Yes. It looked like she was on drugs.

1011
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,015
Detective Shin, show her the picture.

1012
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:39,933
Okay.

1013
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,684
Was it

1014
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,395
this person?

1015
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,117
Yes.

1016
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,244
It was her.

1017
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,205
Was there someone else
in the room with her?

1018
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,748
Someone else?

1019
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,210
There was a man.

1020
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,003
The one who kidnapped you?

1021
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,714
No. It wasn't him.

1022
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,037
What?

1023
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,331
Come drink with me. Come in.

1024
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,416
Come in.

1025
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,169
You've got the wrong room.

1026
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,006
This is it!

1027
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,841
Hey, Jong-a!

1028
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,551
I'm coming in!

1029
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,803
Oh, gosh.

1030
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,221
I told you it's not.

1031
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,975
Stay right there!

1032
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,893
I'll be right back after I pee!

1033
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,157
Who is inside

1034
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,826
that there are even bodyguards?

1035
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:24,871
What man?

1036
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,541
The woman was passed out,
but the man was fine,

1037
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,168
so I asked him if he was with her.

1038
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,754
Are you with her?

1039
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:33,671
No.

1040
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:35,715
I thought it was my room.

1041
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,051
He said no.

1042
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,261
He said he came in
thinking it was his room.

1043
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:43,056
He slammed into me
as he was rushing to leave.

1044
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,437
He dropped something on the ground.

1045
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:52,106
What was it?

1046
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,816
It was a mask.

1047
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,445
Wait.

1048
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,446
By any chance…

1049
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,116
did it look like this?

1050
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,787
Yes. That's it.

1051
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,672
I'm sorry.

1052
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,762
Nice mask.

1053
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,892
Who's the owner of this mask?

1054
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,314
Goliath.

1055
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,776
The person we're trying to catch

1056
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:38,945
is this guy.

1057
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:50,873
Hey.

1058
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,251
What are you doing here?

1059
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,419
What about you?

1060
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:06,931
That's him.

1061
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,102
He's the one who killed me.

1062
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,665
And…

1063
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,712
I was with them.

1064
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,632
I am…

1065
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,343
also a murderer.

1066
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,168
You were with them?

1067
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,378
Murder?
Did you sell drugs and kill people?

1068
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,757
I'll tell you everything,
so let's go somewhere else.

1069
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,342
Pil-jung will be back.

1070
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,970
I hid the evidence in the back seat.

1071
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,431
Lee Gwang-taek did it.
