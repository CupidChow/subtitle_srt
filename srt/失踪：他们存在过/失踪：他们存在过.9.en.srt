(and events are unrelated to real life.)

00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:21,199
Wook.

5
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:24,929
Mom...

6
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:28,569
It's okay, Wook. It's okay.

7
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:31,140
You're okay.

8
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:35,539
Mom's here, Wook.
You're okay now. It's okay.

9
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:37,809
Mom.

(Episode 9)

12
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:01,140
Detective Shin Jun Ho?

13
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:03,405
Come to Hongdae first.

14
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:05,669
I'll call you in 30 minutes.

15
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:29,534
- Hello?
- Detective Shin Jun Ho.

16
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:32,004
I'm where you told me to be
ÃŸand I have the cash.

17
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:33,075
Where are you?

18
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:35,570
I told you to come alone.

19
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:38,115
This really won't work.

20
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:40,645
Choi Yeo Na said it's urgent.

21
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,080
Where is Yeo Na?

22
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:44,684
No. We can't do this here.

23
00:02:44,684 --> 00:02:46,450
I'll call you again.

24
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:48,679
Don't hang up. Where is Yeo Na?

25
00:02:58,235 --> 00:02:59,564
What happened?

26
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:00,689
He's gone.

27
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:03,399
- He noticed you.
- Darn it.

28
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:04,975
Will he call back?

29
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:07,374
Give this to the captain. I have to go.

30
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:08,770
Hey. Where are you going?

31
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,540
Detective Shin.

32
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:19,679
- What happened?
- Over there.

33
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:21,455
I was able to get away,

34
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,384
but Manager Wang is holding Wook there.

35
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:24,955
I checked the nearby security cameras.

36
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,589
She was the only one
who got out from there.

37
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:29,260
Then they still must be inside.

38
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:32,294
We put out an APB on Manager Wang.
And our backup will arrive soon.

39
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,099
It's dangerous here.
You should go home and wait.

40
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:37,200
- Can you escort her home safely?
- Yes, sir.

41
00:03:39,404 --> 00:03:40,629
Put him down.

42
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:42,070
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,210
Get him up.

44
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:04,559
Do you know the trouble
you made me go through?

45
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,929
Did you see me kidnapping that girl?

46
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:12,899
I'll let you join her.

47
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:15,369
You'll be fed to the fish just like her.

48
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,870
Call Captain Kang.

49
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:21,539
Tell him to throw him in the ocean.

50
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:25,779
Stupid.

51
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:28,349
You're so stupid.

52
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:30,950
What a fool.

53
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:34,460
How much are you getting paid for this?

54
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:36,393
You were ordered
to kill the grandchild...

55
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:38,229
of Choiseung Construction's chairwoman.

56
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:41,200
What are you yapping about?

57
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,330
You were ordered to kill those people...

58
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:49,570
because they could have been
the grandchild of the chairwoman.

59
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:52,239
But of course,

60
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:55,739
you got the wrong people.

61
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:58,750
Why should I care?

62
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,789
Of course, you should.

63
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:09,960
The real grandchild of the chairwoman...

64
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,659
hasn't been found yet.

65
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,029
Besides,

66
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:18,370
the police...

67
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:23,640
know that you were
the one who killed them.

68
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:28,210
There's no place to hide now.

69
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:29,739
You crazy jerk.

70
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:35,219
Nam Guk... You can ask the guy yourself.

71
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:37,580
The one who ordered you...

72
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:40,120
to kill Nam Guk.

73
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:42,560
If he gets caught,

74
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:44,830
I bet...

75
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,399
he's going to frame you for everything.

76
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:50,659
You're so stupid.

77
00:05:57,405 --> 00:05:59,070
Cut the nonsense.

78
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,520
I just heard something very interesting.

79
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:22,229
I think this is the place.

80
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:25,799
Gosh, what happened to Ms. Lee?

81
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:28,975
The person you have
reached is not available.

82
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:31,909
My gosh, come on.
Wook isn't answering his phone.

83
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:34,270
Be quiet.

84
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,140
Freeze!

85
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:10,979
Don't come near me.

86
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:14,279
Hey, Wook. Wake up.

87
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:18,250
You came.

88
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:28,560
Put that knife down.

89
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:32,229
If you do something stupid,
it will only make it worse for you.

90
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:34,399
You got it all wrong.

91
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:36,700
I'll be better off
once this guy is dead.

92
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,539
- Please.
- Be quiet.

93
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:43,184
I wasn't talking to you.

94
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:45,149
I told you to shut it.

95
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:53,820
Hey, are you all right?

96
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:57,419
Are you okay, Wook? Are you?

97
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:00,060
- Mr. Jang.
- Yes.

98
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:04,500
Goodness, look at you.
You're covered in blood. Oh, no.

99
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:07,229
Goodness. Oh, no.

100
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you okay?

101
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:14,409
He's not okay. Call 911.

102
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,409
Call 911 now!

103
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:28,890
Wook.

104
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,089
My gosh.

105
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:37,259
Are you awake now?

106
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:39,170
Are you okay?

107
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:40,869
Yes.

108
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:44,040
This wouldn't have happened...

109
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,274
if they never got me in the first place.

110
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:49,509
It's not your fault.

111
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:52,609
You were in danger...

112
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:55,619
because of me.

113
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:57,894
Stop talking. And go back to sleep.

114
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:59,554
Luckily, your bones are okay.

115
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,460
But your bruises will hurt for a while.

116
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:04,830
But it looks like you're handling
your injuries better than I thought.

117
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:07,830
This isn't why I worked out.

118
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:12,499
Okay. I'll go back to sleep.

119
00:09:12,904 --> 00:09:15,969
Ms. Lee, you should go
and get some sleep too.

120
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:18,910
- Okay.
- Okay.

121
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:29,650
I didn't see him yesterday either.

122
00:09:32,394 --> 00:09:33,690
Did he leave now?

123
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:35,920
Yes. He left.

124
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:38,359
What?

125
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:40,830
Did he leave?

126
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:42,629
What do you mean?

127
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:48,239
It's all right. He left,
but he will be back.

128
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:51,170
Play with Joon Soo here.

129
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:53,410
- I'll be gone for a while.
- Okay.

130
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:04,749
Hey.

131
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,690
Have you seen Mr. Jang?

132
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:12,160
The last time I saw him was
when we drank with Detective Park.

133
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,160
Does he have a bad hangover?

134
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:17,504
I haven't seen that young man
named Wook either.

135
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:18,930
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

136
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:21,869
Did something really happen to him?

137
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:25,940
- What?
- It's nothing.

138
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:28,440
What's that bicycle for?

139
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:31,280
Jang Mi said she wanted to ride one.

140
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:34,249
You have a lot on your plate,
looking after the people here.

141
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:35,580
That's nothing.

142
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:38,389
I'm doing it because I want to.

143
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:40,489
By the way,

144
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:46,160
do you know anything about Wook?

145
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:48,660
Like how he ended up here?

146
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:50,629
Or what he did before coming here?

147
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,030
Things like that.

148
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:00,774
You were caught red-handed...

149
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:02,609
for abduction, assault,
and instigation to murder.

150
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,379
You can't weasel
your way out of this one.

151
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:09,684
Where's Choi Yeo Na?
Someone witnessed you abducting her.

152
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:10,879
I did?

153
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:14,389
That can't be.

154
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:18,259
Someone big must be backing you up.

155
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:20,930
Is it a conglomerate?

156
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,330
For example, could it be
Choiseung Construction?

157
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:32,109
Hey, I know everything.

158
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:36,680
Someone ordered you to kill
Jang Myung Gyu and Kim Nam Guk.

159
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:42,219
- Right?
- Think carefully before you answer.

160
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,619
It looks like you'll
go down for this alone.

161
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:50,359
You can ask the guy yourself.
The one who ordered you...

162
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:52,930
to kill Nam Guk.

163
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:56,859
I bet he's going to
frame you for everything.

164
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:03,969
- Can I make a call?
- Sure.

165
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:28,764
The person you have
reached is not available.

166
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:31,900
Please leave a message after the tone.

167
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:35,139
- After the tone, you will be...
- What is it? He's not answering?

168
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:40,070
I want to call my lawyer.

169
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:42,540
A lawyer?

170
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:04,830
All right. Let's begin.

171
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,769
Let me go over the
sales of this quarter first.

172
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:13,774
Why did Manager Wang kidnap you?

173
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,414
Wook told me...

174
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:18,650
that Manager Wang used me
as bait so he could catch Wook.

175
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:23,185
How is Mr. Kim doing?

176
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,719
He's badly injured.

177
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:27,589
The doctor says he needs to rest.

178
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:33,134
Did you check the number
that Manager Wang called?

179
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:34,530
Yes, it's a burner phone.

180
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:36,205
- Where was the call traced to?
- Near Choiseung Construction.

181
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:38,060
I'm sure the company has
something to do with this.

182
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:42,339
What's wrong?
Are you waiting for a call?

183
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:44,105
No, it's nothing.

184
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:47,040
By any chance,
did Mr. Kim tell you anything...

185
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:50,639
about Choi Yeo Na recently?

186
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:53,349
No.

187
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:56,050
Yeo Na...

188
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:58,050
is dead.

189
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:10,160
You really should stay here
for a few more days.

190
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:13,874
The doctor told me I'll get better
if I eat and rest well.

191
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:15,839
I can do that at home.

192
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:18,869
If you go home,
I'll have to take care of you.

193
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:23,410
You're getting discharged already?

194
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:27,014
I'm willing to stay for a bit longer...

195
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,420
if the cops pay for my hospital bill.

196
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:32,719
I should take off the bandage
and let my wound get some air...

197
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,365
so that it'll heal quickly.

198
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:37,160
What did you mean when you told me...

199
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:41,629
that Yeo Na was dead?

200
00:14:49,674 --> 00:14:50,969
I literally meant what I said.

201
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:54,609
Yeo Na is dead.

202
00:14:57,784 --> 00:14:59,479
How do you know that?

203
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:05,650
Because I saw her.

204
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:14,060
Where?

205
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,400
The place where I saw Ha Neul.

206
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:22,839
That's where I saw...

207
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:25,609
Yeo Na.

208
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,180
Are you kidding me?

209
00:15:39,595 --> 00:15:40,794
Yes, this is Shin Jun Ho.

210
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:43,024
Detective Shin, do you remember me?

211
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,160
Where are you right now?

212
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,264
You told him Yeo Na was dead?

213
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:49,664
How will you deal with the consequences?

214
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:50,900
Yeo Na...

215
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,129
is in the ocean.

216
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:54,900
How did you find out?

217
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,300
Manager Wang told me...

218
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:59,070
that I'll get to join her...

219
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:02,879
and told his men to
throw me into the sea.

220
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:22,605
Hello?

221
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:25,300
Did you come by yourself this time?

222
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:27,475
I made a mistake yesterday. I'm sorry.

223
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:30,070
I have the money ready,
and I came alone.

224
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:31,345
Where are you?

225
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:34,174
Do you see the wooden column
next to you? Number 35.

226
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:36,244
Put the money down there.

227
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:37,339
(Sijang Park, 4-35)

228
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:43,379
I'll do everything you say.

229
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,794
So please tell me where Yeo Na is.

230
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:48,989
Gosh, you're so impatient.

231
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,820
Look in front of you...

232
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:53,465
and go to the third column.

233
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:55,664
It's column number 41.

234
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:58,530
You'll be able to find what
you want to know there.

235
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:05,809
(Sijang Park, 4-41)

236
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:17,180
(19-1, Duon-ri Mountain,
Yijeong-si, Gyeonggi Province)

237
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:41,979
Sir, look. The GPS tracker
isn't moving. How is he...

238
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:45,015
It's okay. We don't need to rush.

239
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:46,809
But we need to catch him.

240
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:48,950
Calm down.

241
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:53,390
You're working so hard.

242
00:17:56,194 --> 00:17:59,190
Can I have a pack of cigarettes?

243
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,190
- Which one?
- Well...

244
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,660
I'll take the red one.

245
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:13,414
Goodness. You're rich.

246
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:15,184
That's a lot of cash.

247
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:16,340
What...

248
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:19,884
What... What do you want?

249
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:23,120
Do you know how much people suffer
when a family member disappears?

250
00:18:23,224 --> 00:18:26,095
But you use that to
make money? You little...

251
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:28,450
- No, I didn't...
- Do you regret what you did?

252
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,519
How did you know?

253
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:32,729
Come here.

254
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:35,299
What... What are you doing?

255
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,170
This is how we found out.

256
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:43,444
You're under arrest for fraud
and obstruction of justice.

257
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:44,704
You have the right to an attorney.

258
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:46,174
You have the right to remain silent.

259
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:47,974
You don't need to say anything
that could be used against you.

260
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:49,710
You shameless punk.

261
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,755
No, wait. What are you doing?

262
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,454
I did nothing wrong.

263
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:55,755
Okay, whatever.
First, let's go to the police station.

264
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:58,819
Once we get there,
I'll tell you what you did wrong.

265
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:05,590
What is this?

266
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,434
What do you think?

267
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,964
That's where you can find Choi Yeo Na.

268
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,860
You crazy jerk.

269
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:13,704
This is a restricted area.

270
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:14,904
No one lives here.

271
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,799
I even searched this place before.

272
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:19,845
Are you going to keep lying to me?

273
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:21,539
It's not a lie.

274
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,779
You told me you saw Yeo Na.

275
00:19:23,884 --> 00:19:26,979
Who told you about my proposal...

276
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:29,249
and the wedding?

277
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:31,279
Tell me.

278
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:34,495
Where is Yeo Na, you jerk?

279
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:38,390
I swear that's where she is.
She's in Duon Village.

280
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:40,394
I was locked up there.

281
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:42,505
And as she set me free,

282
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:45,005
she asked me to find you...

283
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:48,469
and tell you that she's there.

284
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:54,610
I'm not crazy, okay?

285
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:57,880
I just see what you can't.

286
00:19:58,144 --> 00:19:59,380
I don't see anything here.

287
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:18,700
Ms. Choi.

288
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:20,034
Have you seen...

289
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:21,670
another living person here
other than myself?

290
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:25,545
Did you ever talk to
someone who's still alive?

291
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:27,440
If I had done that,

292
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:30,180
I wouldn't have let you go.

293
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,355
I hope you keep your promise.

294
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:36,150
Gosh, of course. Don't worry.

295
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:41,620
My goodness.

296
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:45,019
I wonder...

297
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,759
if he met Jun Ho by now.

298
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:53,670
Yeo Na.

299
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:55,340
Hey.

300
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:59,469
You weren't home,
so I thought you might be here.

301
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:01,569
What happened to your hand?

302
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,180
Did you get hurt?

303
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:06,809
What are you doing here?

304
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:10,950
I'm waiting for Jun Ho.

305
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,620
I set Hwang Du Cheol free.

306
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:19,934
I told him to tell Jun Ho that I'm here.

307
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:21,529
Thomas told us...

308
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:24,634
that Hwang Du Cheol is a con artist.

309
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:28,469
That's why I'm sure he'll call Jun Ho.

310
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,539
Jun Ho will notice that.

311
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:32,269
Then he'll come here.

312
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,440
He's already been here twice.

313
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:40,579
And then what?
What will you do once he comes?

314
00:21:41,654 --> 00:21:43,850
I know I won't be able to do anything.

315
00:21:44,924 --> 00:21:46,049
But I just...

316
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:48,390
miss him.

317
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:20,719
What happened to your hand?

318
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:24,719
It's nothing.

319
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:27,860
It'll get better soon.

320
00:22:30,335 --> 00:22:31,559
What happened?

321
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:34,100
What happened?

322
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:37,400
How did you end up here?

323
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:39,870
I fell.

324
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,789
Jang Mi's house was
owned by Jo Won Wook.

325
00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:58,224
And according to the manager,

326
00:22:58,224 --> 00:23:00,335
he even bought her the car she drove.

327
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:04,365
Gosh, he must be rich.

328
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,805
Did you meet him?

329
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:08,535
Yes. He told me they broke up
after Jang Mi cheated on him.

330
00:23:08,535 --> 00:23:10,144
That's when he sold the house...

331
00:23:10,144 --> 00:23:11,345
and the car.

332
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:13,115
He was arrested for a DUI,

333
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:14,474
and his license was revoked once.

334
00:23:14,474 --> 00:23:15,809
He doesn't have a record.

335
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:19,714
Il Du! They found DNA in the
scrap paper lady's belongings.

336
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:22,654
Really? Did they compare it
with Kang Myung Jin's? Is it his?

337
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,785
- That'll take a couple of days.
- Okay.

338
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:27,019
- Hound them until they tell us.
- Okay.

339
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:30,224
I have a good feeling about this.

340
00:23:30,224 --> 00:23:32,190
The hair on my neck is standing.

341
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:34,090
I haven't felt like this in a while.

342
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:40,670
(Jang Hyun Ji's Disappearance)

343
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:45,640
(Jang Hyun Ji, aged 6, 326-12,
Mijin-dong, Gongro-gu)

344
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:48,469
Her backpack.

345
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,840
- I'm going out.
- Okay.

346
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:00,549
- My gosh.
- Mr. Jang.

347
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:05,865
What about her backpack?

348
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:07,259
It's 15 years old.

349
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:09,059
Will you find something on it?

350
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:15,969
Yes. In the belongings
of a victim from 2006,

351
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,144
we found DNA this morning
that we couldn't find then.

352
00:24:19,144 --> 00:24:21,115
- Did you catch the killer?
- Yes.

353
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:22,840
We're comparing the DNA right now.

354
00:24:22,914 --> 00:24:25,654
Hyun Ji disappeared in 2005.

355
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:29,779
We might be able to find something
we couldn't back then, right?

356
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:36,360
(Please help us find Jang Hyun Ji!)

357
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:46,630
(Jang Hyun Ji)

358
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:57,085
Can I find my Hyun Ji with this?

359
00:24:57,085 --> 00:24:58,640
I really hope so,

360
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:01,779
but even if we can't,

361
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:04,819
I won't give up looking.

362
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,749
Thank you,

363
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:08,690
Detective Baek.

364
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:15,829
Who is this?

365
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:18,900
It's the phoenix who never dies.

366
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,229
It's good to see you too.

367
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:24,799
See? We're on great terms.

368
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:26,969
You have five minutes and no longer.

369
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:30,079
Okay.

370
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:34,549
I'm supposed to live for a long time.

371
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:37,924
So I survived the fall over the cliff...

372
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:39,519
and the dreadful beating.

373
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,719
All that pain for nothing.

374
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:46,289
So you fearlessly came to see me?

375
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:47,664
To die?

376
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:49,130
Of course not.

377
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:52,930
I came to give a statement of
what you did among other things.

378
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:56,600
And to see your face.

379
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:02,340
And to thank you.

380
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:04,239
Thanks to you,

381
00:26:06,184 --> 00:26:08,610
I remembered something incredible.

382
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:13,719
What happened when I was a child.

383
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,960
What are you talking about?

384
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:22,329
You killed three innocent people.

385
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:24,960
You'd better tell me...

386
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:29,299
who told you to kill Nam Guk.

387
00:26:31,245 --> 00:26:33,840
Even if you don't tell me,
I'll find the person anyway.

388
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:45,719
Hello?

389
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:47,219
This is Han Yeo Hee.

390
00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:54,789
Who gave you the name "Wook"?

391
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,200
My mother did.

392
00:26:58,204 --> 00:27:00,729
She named me that so I would...

393
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:02,469
brighten the world.

394
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:04,769
Did she?

395
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:12,210
Why did you wish to see me?

396
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:15,210
When your daughter...

397
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:17,979
passed away,

398
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:22,350
I was there.

399
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:24,319
What are you saying?

400
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:26,890
You were in our house?

401
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:32,400
I'd sometimes follow my mom to work...

402
00:27:33,775 --> 00:27:36,840
and stay and play in your attic.

403
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:41,874
I remember that Auntie Soo Yeon...

404
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:43,940
sometimes played with me.

405
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,950
I had no idea that...

406
00:27:51,825 --> 00:27:53,450
a child was in the house.

407
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:56,819
My mother must've kept it
from you because...

408
00:27:57,825 --> 00:27:59,559
she felt bad about bringing me.

409
00:28:01,295 --> 00:28:02,529
That day,

410
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:05,729
I was napping...

411
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:09,340
when I heard a loud thump
and came downstairs.

412
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:12,569
Auntie Soo Yeon was lying down.

413
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:17,610
There was blood all around her.

414
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:21,610
A man was standing there.

415
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,380
I only saw him from behind.

416
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,350
I was so scared,

417
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:30,489
I went back up to the attic and hid.

418
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:34,590
Who was the man?

419
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:38,630
Why are you saying this now?

420
00:28:40,174 --> 00:28:42,870
I remembered it only recently.

421
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:47,640
Do you suspect anyone?

422
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:53,410
Who on earth would...

423
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:56,950
I think the person who
killed Auntie Soo Yeon...

424
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,590
killed my mother too.

425
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:02,719
Do you remember...

426
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:06,789
who had free access to your mansion...

427
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:09,200
at the time?

428
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:12,900
My driver.

429
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,999
The gardener who came once a month.

430
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:17,870
And my housekeeper.

431
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,769
It's just those three.

432
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:23,410
My driver was with me that day.

433
00:29:24,384 --> 00:29:26,779
It wasn't the day for
the gardener to visit.

434
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:31,154
I also confirmed him...

435
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:33,920
working elsewhere that day.

436
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:36,759
The man I saw...

437
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:41,660
was wearing a suit.

438
00:29:57,914 --> 00:30:00,479
Don't try to pull any tricks.

439
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:03,549
What's wrong? Are you choking?

440
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,049
Hey!

441
00:30:09,095 --> 00:30:10,289
Wake up!

442
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:11,890
Wake up!

443
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:14,229
Call for an ambulance now!

444
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:16,860
Wake up! Hey!

445
00:30:17,434 --> 00:30:20,130
Call for help! We need an ambulance!

446
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,029
Darn it.

447
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:24,340
See you.

448
00:30:24,345 --> 00:30:27,309
I'll walk you to your car.

449
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:29,640
Why bother when it's so hot today?

450
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:33,180
I know you want to walk
Hyun Ji's bag and not me.

451
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:36,579
I'll drop it off for testing myself.

452
00:30:36,954 --> 00:30:39,289
Don't worry and stay at home.

453
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:41,489
Okay then.

454
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:47,960
Thanks, Detective Baek.

455
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:52,360
Doggie.

456
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:07,380
Stay away! Don't come closer!

457
00:31:07,484 --> 00:31:08,710
Don't come near me.

458
00:31:09,085 --> 00:31:11,479
- Stay away from me.
- Mr. Jang.

459
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:12,920
Do something.

460
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,724
Is it someone new?

461
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:15,924
Who are you?

462
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:18,390
Relax and hear us out.

463
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:19,690
What for?

464
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:21,134
Calm down.

465
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:23,464
We're not weird people. We live here.

466
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,860
You live here?

467
00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:26,805
This village is weird!

468
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:28,729
That makes you all weird!

469
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,769
Why on earth am I here?

470
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:37,680
What did you all do to me?
What did you do?

471
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:41,840
Why on earth am I here?

472
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:45,015
What did you all do to me?

473
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:47,009
What did you do?

474
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:49,214
I should get Thomas.

475
00:31:49,214 --> 00:31:50,450
He's in storage.

476
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,420
Darn it.

477
00:31:55,555 --> 00:31:56,789
Come on out.

478
00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:58,065
Is something wrong?

479
00:31:58,065 --> 00:32:00,190
We got a new one
and he's out of control.

480
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:03,999
Thomas? Who is Thomas?

481
00:32:04,134 --> 00:32:07,200
Is he a mercenary?
Is this a mafia hideout?

482
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:11,140
I said I'd pay them back
once I sold the restaurant.

483
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:13,640
You're so mean, Mr. Kim.

484
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:15,315
It seems you're very shocked.

485
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:16,710
Of course, I am shocked!

486
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:37,529
Are you...

487
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:39,499
Thomas?

488
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:42,434
Yes. I'm Thomas.

489
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:43,870
I bet you have a lot of questions.

490
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:46,710
Let's talk over some tea
in a quiet room.

491
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:48,210
I see.

492
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:50,644
I like oolong tea.

493
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:51,779
This way please.

494
00:32:54,214 --> 00:32:55,579
That way?

495
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,240
What is your name, sir?

496
00:33:21,774 --> 00:33:22,880
Gosh, don't call me that.

497
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:26,110
You can just call me Mr. Hong.

498
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:31,849
By the way, the way you talk is so hot.

499
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:34,619
You sound so classy and sophisticated.

500
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:36,960
Is that so?

501
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:39,789
Someone told me I sound old and lame.

502
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:41,729
What are you talking about?

503
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:45,729
Gosh. Being unique
is the trend nowadays.

504
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:50,944
By the way, why did
they lock you up here?

505
00:33:50,944 --> 00:33:53,539
Did you take out a private loan like me?

506
00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:56,539
Well, no.

507
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,909
No one can forcefully bring you here.

508
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:01,880
What are you talking about?
I was forced here without knowing...

509
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:04,320
No, they kidnapped here.

510
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:06,320
It's all right.

511
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,159
This is not okay.

512
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:24,269
My gosh, what an odd man.

513
00:34:24,745 --> 00:34:27,039
No, I think Thomas is more interesting.

514
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:29,145
That man threw a fit when he saw us.

515
00:34:29,145 --> 00:34:31,185
But as soon as he saw Thomas,
he became a docile sheep.

516
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:33,550
You know, Thomas is
very polite and calm.

517
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:35,409
So he could let
his guard down with Thomas.

518
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:39,079
I can't imagine this village
without Thomas.

519
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:40,550
Right.

520
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:09,309
Don't be nervous.

521
00:35:09,415 --> 00:35:11,479
- You can do it.
- After putting you up,

522
00:35:11,785 --> 00:35:13,389
I'll get to go home.

523
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:18,519
Where should I put this?

524
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:21,130
All the pieces arrived...

525
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:26,429
What are you doing here?
You didn't even call first.

526
00:35:27,604 --> 00:35:31,999
I don't care where or how you grew up.

527
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:35,240
Your past won't stop me.

528
00:35:35,915 --> 00:35:37,380
I don't need anything.

529
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:41,479
I just need you to come to me.

530
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:20,990
(Kim Wook)

531
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:30,900
Hello.

532
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:32,860
Let's meet.

533
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:38,470
("Jang Hyun Ji Gone for Five Days,
Her Whereabouts Still Unknown")

534
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:53,455
Kang Dae Sung, are you stalking me?

535
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:54,725
That's such a harsh word.

536
00:36:54,725 --> 00:36:56,325
I decided to work here
as your part-timer...

537
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:58,125
and your bodyguard for the time being.

538
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,464
Did you give up on making
a debut as an idol singer?

539
00:37:00,464 --> 00:37:01,865
That's not important right now.

540
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:04,134
You were kidnapped and
only survived miraculously.

541
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:07,670
At this rate, you might miraculously
get fired as their trainee.

542
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:09,740
Jong Ah, you can be a bit harsh.

543
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,400
- That's Ms. Lee to you.
- Yes, Mr. Lee.

544
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:20,055
Hello. This way.

545
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:21,214
("Jang Hyun Ji Gone for Five Days,
Her Whereabouts Still Unknown")

546
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:22,479
(Missing person search)

547
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:24,479
Why are there so many missing people?

548
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,889
(Jang Mi, female)

549
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,090
What?

550
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,519
She looks familiar.

551
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:34,760
I didn't do anything!

552
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:37,199
I said I didn't do anything!

553
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:39,599
It's that woman in the video.

554
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:44,604
She wasn't his client.
She's a missing person.

555
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:46,440
Who is she anyway?

556
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:48,539
It's someone I know.

557
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:52,639
How can a missing person be his client?

558
00:37:55,615 --> 00:37:57,479
Ha Neul went missing too.

559
00:37:57,754 --> 00:37:59,619
So is Choi Yeo Na,

560
00:38:00,955 --> 00:38:02,949
and Wook's mother as well.

561
00:38:05,924 --> 00:38:07,159
What is this?

562
00:38:11,404 --> 00:38:13,834
Jong Ah. Ms. Lee, where are you going?

563
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,035
Go home at the end of your shift.

564
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:17,269
Gosh. I need to escort her home.

565
00:38:26,714 --> 00:38:28,479
Did you catch Hwang Du Cheol?

566
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,479
Do you know him?

567
00:38:33,955 --> 00:38:37,389
Fine. How do you know Hwang Du Cheol?

568
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,690
I don't know much about him.

569
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:41,360
I just know...

570
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:44,604
that he's a con artist.

571
00:38:44,604 --> 00:38:45,760
Exactly, my point.

572
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:49,300
How do you know that he's a con artist?

573
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:53,845
How are you connected to
every case and everyone?

574
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:55,115
You told me you saw Ha Neul here.

575
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:57,044
And this time, Hwang Du Cheol
told me he saw Yeo Na here.

576
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,510
That doesn't make any sense!

577
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:01,010
Right.

578
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,079
It doesn't make sense.

579
00:39:04,055 --> 00:39:06,849
When I saw Ha Neul here,

580
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:09,519
it was after Ha Neul had died.

581
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:11,424
The fact that I saw Yeo Na here...

582
00:39:11,424 --> 00:39:12,990
You're driving me crazy!

583
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:15,464
Hey, she's not dead.

584
00:39:15,464 --> 00:39:16,564
Why do you keep saying that?

585
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,130
Who are you to tell me
that Yeo Na is dead?

586
00:39:22,035 --> 00:39:23,570
Yeo Na is dead.

587
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:26,769
I saw her.

588
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:36,349
Who's fighting with whom?

589
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:39,320
Wook...

590
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:42,720
Oh, right. Wook and Jun Ho are fighting.

591
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:44,760
Jun Ho?

592
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:46,694
I see. The cop?

593
00:39:46,694 --> 00:39:49,159
- Yes. The cop.
- Where?

594
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:53,059
- Wait. That's Ms. Secret.
- What?

595
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:54,369
Mr. Jang.

596
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,440
Hey, you're here.

597
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,699
You didn't even call ahead.

598
00:40:00,174 --> 00:40:02,245
Who were you talking to just now?

599
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:05,409
Me? Gosh, no.
I wasn't talking to anyone.

600
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:06,809
Okay.

601
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,309
Stop.

602
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,880
Something is up with this place.

603
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:13,119
Something was up with Wook last time.

604
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,924
And with you too.

605
00:40:14,924 --> 00:40:16,354
What on earth are you talking about?

606
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:19,519
You can only find grass,
trees, and wild animals here.

607
00:40:20,564 --> 00:40:21,595
- No.
- Go.

608
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:23,464
You were just saying
something about Jun Ho...

609
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:24,900
and him being a cop.

610
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:28,334
- Who were you talking to?
- What?

611
00:40:28,334 --> 00:40:30,805
Someone else must be here
other than us, right?

612
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:31,900
Gosh.

613
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:33,970
Who is it? What's going on?

614
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:35,115
Is it a boar?

615
00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:37,409
Yes. I do see boars here
from time to time.

616
00:40:42,814 --> 00:40:43,949
Who is it?

617
00:40:49,524 --> 00:40:51,559
The dead live here.

618
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:55,729
And I can see the dead.

619
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:58,159
So you can see spirits?

620
00:40:59,365 --> 00:41:01,699
You might think I'm crazy.

621
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:04,840
But they aren't just spirits.

622
00:41:06,104 --> 00:41:07,710
Then what are they?

623
00:41:09,145 --> 00:41:10,479
They are dead,

624
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:13,179
but their bodies haven't been found.

625
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:19,650
I can see them.

626
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,490
And Yeo Na is one of them.

627
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:25,460
You are indeed crazy.

628
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:28,090
Do you know who else I saw here?

629
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:32,729
My mom.

630
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,499
27 years ago,

631
00:41:37,674 --> 00:41:39,944
she abandoned me and ran away.

632
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:42,039
Or so I thought. But she's here.

633
00:41:42,575 --> 00:41:43,710
I can...

634
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:46,240
see those people.

635
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:48,809
So...

636
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:52,079
do you expect me to believe...

637
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:54,590
your absurd claim?

638
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:05,999
Jun Ho.

639
00:42:11,604 --> 00:42:13,070
You really came.

640
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:15,940
Jun Ho, I'm right here.

641
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:20,010
Are you seriously telling me...

642
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:26,579
to believe that Yeo Na is dead?

643
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:31,220
Wook.

644
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:36,229
What about me? Jun Ho, can't you see me?

645
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,179
He can't see you.

646
00:42:51,384 --> 00:42:53,179
He just talked to you.

647
00:42:53,455 --> 00:42:56,449
Jun Ho just held onto you.
I saw everything.

648
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:58,024
But why can't he see me?

649
00:42:58,024 --> 00:42:59,249
Jun Ho.

650
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:01,349
Jun Ho.

651
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:07,090
He can't see you.

652
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:08,789
You crazy jerk.

653
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:11,300
You really are crazy.

654
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:18,539
Don't ever mention Yeo Na's name again.

655
00:43:23,174 --> 00:43:25,679
Jun Ho. Jun Ho!

656
00:43:27,015 --> 00:43:29,849
Let me go. Jun Ho!

657
00:43:30,084 --> 00:43:32,084
- Come back.
- Jun Ho!

658
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:33,720
Just come back. It's useless.

659
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:34,990
Let me go!

660
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:37,559
Detective Shin.

661
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:43,865
What's with him?

662
00:43:43,865 --> 00:43:45,860
Why would he just ignore us like that?

663
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,740
Wook!

664
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:55,510
What's going on?

665
00:43:56,274 --> 00:43:57,639
What is he doing there all by himself?

666
00:43:57,915 --> 00:43:59,179
Do you see that, Mr. Jang?

667
00:44:00,185 --> 00:44:01,510
Wook!

668
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,915
- Wook!
- He won't take long.

669
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:04,353
Let's wait for him at my house.

670
00:44:04,354 --> 00:44:05,579
Wook!

671
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,713
I told you to play in the garden.

672
00:44:15,148 --> 00:44:16,418
We were playing
hide and seek, and I was it.

673
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:19,182
But I couldn't find Beom Soo,
so I went looking for him.

674
00:44:21,657 --> 00:44:23,013
Beom Soo is here.

675
00:44:23,058 --> 00:44:25,022
Beom Soo, where were you?

676
00:44:25,087 --> 00:44:26,682
I looked everywhere for you.

677
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,952
The secret lady is here,
so I can't tell you.

678
00:44:28,998 --> 00:44:30,363
This time, you can hide.

679
00:44:30,797 --> 00:44:32,593
Hey, Wook is back.

680
00:44:34,868 --> 00:44:36,633
Don't go anywhere else. Just stay here.

681
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:40,633
Tell me.

682
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:43,033
Why can't Jun Ho see me
when he can see you?

683
00:44:46,877 --> 00:44:48,472
Well, I'm...

684
00:44:48,717 --> 00:44:52,343
Are you also alive?

685
00:44:55,817 --> 00:44:57,022
Yes.

686
00:45:04,797 --> 00:45:06,693
Then how can you see me?

687
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,133
Jun Ho can't see me.

688
00:45:09,768 --> 00:45:12,002
But how is it that you can?

689
00:45:16,777 --> 00:45:18,202
I don't know...

690
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:20,843
how I'm able to see the people here.

691
00:45:21,578 --> 00:45:22,812
How...

692
00:45:23,717 --> 00:45:26,142
How could you not tell me anything?

693
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:30,013
You know how hard
I tried to leave this place.

694
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:31,653
Why didn't you tell me?

695
00:45:32,257 --> 00:45:34,058
If you had told me,

696
00:45:34,058 --> 00:45:36,823
I wouldn't have asked
Hwang Du Cheol for a favor.

697
00:45:37,027 --> 00:45:39,122
Why didn't you tell me anything?

698
00:45:45,337 --> 00:45:46,763
He's alive.

699
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:51,573
I must've misjudged you.

700
00:45:54,317 --> 00:45:55,513
Yeo Na.

701
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:06,483
Yeo Na.

702
00:46:09,697 --> 00:46:11,022
He's alive.

703
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:16,033
Wook...

704
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:20,832
is still alive.

705
00:46:21,837 --> 00:46:23,472
He's alive.

706
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:26,972
He's still alive.

707
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:30,073
Thank you.

708
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:33,412
Thank you.

709
00:46:34,388 --> 00:46:35,713
Thank you.

710
00:46:39,388 --> 00:46:40,993
Thank you.

711
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,562
Thank you.

712
00:46:48,797 --> 00:46:50,133
Can we please talk?

713
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,772
Please give me a chance to explain.
Yeo Na, please.

714
00:47:12,558 --> 00:47:14,653
This place is where...

715
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:18,662
dead souls come if their
bodies were never found...

716
00:47:18,697 --> 00:47:20,122
by anyone.

717
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:23,263
Then who were you talking to earlier?

718
00:47:23,297 --> 00:47:24,463
Beom Soo.

719
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,403
He's really big,
but he's still a child at heart.

720
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,177
He's such a good kid.

721
00:47:30,177 --> 00:47:33,447
Then was Wook also with someone earlier?

722
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:36,443
Choi Yeo Na. He was with her.

723
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:38,343
Unbelievable.

724
00:47:40,618 --> 00:47:44,082
You actually believe
everything I just told you?

725
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:46,323
Aren't you scared?

726
00:47:46,757 --> 00:47:48,653
You can't even see anything.

727
00:47:49,197 --> 00:47:52,392
Yes, of course I believe you.
This world is full of mysteries.

728
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:54,967
For example, Stephen Hawking's
believed a multiverse theory.

729
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:56,836
I truly believe that
another version of myself...

730
00:47:56,837 --> 00:47:58,332
actually exists somewhere
out in the universe.

731
00:47:59,038 --> 00:48:01,702
Gosh, if Stephen Hawking didn't die,

732
00:48:01,907 --> 00:48:04,407
we would've been able to go
time traveling on a time machine.

733
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:05,507
Who?

734
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,613
Anyway, I thought there
was a parallel universe at first.

735
00:48:08,848 --> 00:48:11,812
Choi Yeo Na, Wook's mother,

736
00:48:11,987 --> 00:48:15,383
and Jang Mi. It was weird that
all three clients were missing.

737
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,923
But I finally get it now.

738
00:48:19,257 --> 00:48:22,153
You're looking for the bodies of
dead people who went missing?

739
00:48:23,598 --> 00:48:25,863
It's so thrilling.

740
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,538
Mr. Jang, how many people
are there in the village?

741
00:48:30,538 --> 00:48:31,903
I don't know.

742
00:48:32,808 --> 00:48:35,007
It's always different.

743
00:48:35,007 --> 00:48:36,737
But there are usually several dozen.

744
00:48:36,737 --> 00:48:38,578
Give me a list of all their names.

745
00:48:38,578 --> 00:48:40,872
- What for?
- So we can find their bodies.

746
00:48:40,978 --> 00:48:42,348
I'll help you find them all.

747
00:48:42,348 --> 00:48:44,042
Gosh, I know Wook and I aren't normal.

748
00:48:45,018 --> 00:48:47,713
But you're pretty unusual yourself.

749
00:48:51,357 --> 00:48:52,553
Wook.

750
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:05,062
- Honey!
- Yes?

751
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:06,633
My goodness.

752
00:49:06,638 --> 00:49:08,033
Honey!

753
00:49:10,877 --> 00:49:13,173
My son is alive.

754
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:16,312
Of course he's alive.

755
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:17,843
I bet he's doing well.

756
00:49:18,618 --> 00:49:22,153
- Did you think of your son again?
- No, that's not it.

757
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,682
He's alive.

758
00:49:26,257 --> 00:49:27,493
I'm talking about Wook.

759
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:30,863
My son, Wook,

760
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:33,193
is still alive.

761
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,733
You mean the guy who
hangs around with Mr. Jang?

762
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:38,702
He's...

763
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:41,372
your son?

764
00:49:43,107 --> 00:49:47,542
My goodness, I'm his mother,

765
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:49,713
but I couldn't even recognize him.

766
00:49:51,918 --> 00:49:54,082
While I was busy being
caught up in the past,

767
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:56,312
he grew up to be a decent man.

768
00:49:57,757 --> 00:49:59,582
And he has such a kind heart.

769
00:50:01,027 --> 00:50:03,993
So he never told me anything
even though he knew...

770
00:50:04,598 --> 00:50:06,062
I was his mom.

771
00:50:09,668 --> 00:50:10,903
Thank goodness.

772
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:16,432
Thank goodness.

773
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:18,903
I'm so relieved.

774
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:22,472
So that means...

775
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:26,082
your mother is here.

776
00:50:28,018 --> 00:50:29,983
Then what about Mr. Jang's daughter?

777
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,082
Is Hyun Ji not here?

778
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:34,423
No.

779
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:36,022
She's not here.

780
00:50:36,197 --> 00:50:37,923
Does that mean she's still alive?

781
00:50:39,297 --> 00:50:42,332
- I don't know.
- This is all so cruel.

782
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:47,702
I'm sure there's a reason why
Mr. Jang is able to see the dead.

783
00:50:48,377 --> 00:50:50,843
He spent 10 years looking
for other people's bodies,

784
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:54,513
but he still wasn't able
to find his own daughter.

785
00:50:56,848 --> 00:50:58,912
You should be nicer to him.

786
00:50:59,217 --> 00:51:00,613
Stop complaining all the time.

787
00:51:02,418 --> 00:51:03,613
Okay, fine.

788
00:51:05,657 --> 00:51:07,153
You should be nicer to me too.

789
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,593
Gosh.

790
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,598
Let's go.

791
00:51:11,598 --> 00:51:12,823
Okay.

792
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,602
Mr. Jang.

793
00:51:19,607 --> 00:51:20,702
I'm disappointed.

794
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,038
If you'd just tipped me off...

795
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,202
Then what?

796
00:51:25,578 --> 00:51:27,343
It's not for us to interfere.

797
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,513
It's for them to sort out.

798
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:32,142
That's true.

799
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:35,213
They'll be shocked and distraught,
but then it'll go away.

800
00:51:36,058 --> 00:51:37,452
It's for them to deal with.

801
00:51:38,688 --> 00:51:40,222
You might as well be enlightened.

802
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:43,952
I don't agree with this.

803
00:51:44,297 --> 00:51:45,392
We're friends.

804
00:51:45,927 --> 00:51:48,162
We must share information
and sort things out together.

805
00:51:48,998 --> 00:51:50,803
That's what neighbors and
family are supposed to do.

806
00:51:51,138 --> 00:51:53,863
Since we're talking about neighbors...

807
00:51:54,138 --> 00:51:55,303
Jang Mi.

808
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:57,673
I have the evidence,

809
00:51:58,078 --> 00:51:59,972
but I couldn't give it to the police.

810
00:52:01,148 --> 00:52:02,312
Why not?

811
00:52:02,377 --> 00:52:05,213
Jang Mi said she likes it here.

812
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:08,288
She doesn't want to
part with the people here.

813
00:52:08,288 --> 00:52:09,983
She might say so now,

814
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:12,423
but eventually,
everyone else will pass on.

815
00:52:13,357 --> 00:52:15,297
Having to remain hurts too.

816
00:52:15,297 --> 00:52:17,927
He's right. We must
also catch the bad guy.

817
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:21,193
If we let him live a good life
after he killed her, that's wrong.

818
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:24,403
Jerks like that will do the same again.

819
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:29,002
You have a point.

820
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,248
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

821
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:35,047
Nothing makes sense.

822
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:37,713
Should I smack you around the head?

823
00:52:38,418 --> 00:52:39,613
Hello.

824
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:42,153
Mr. Jang. Hello there.

825
00:52:42,188 --> 00:52:43,458
I got you some cold drinks.

826
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,888
You didn't have to get us anything.

827
00:52:45,888 --> 00:52:47,558
- Detective Lee.
- Yes?

828
00:52:47,558 --> 00:52:48,598
Take this.

829
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,993
- It's from Hyun Ji's dad.
- Thank you.

830
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,363
- Why are you here?
- I was just passing by.

831
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:56,668
I also wanted to ask if
you checked the backpack.

832
00:52:56,668 --> 00:52:58,268
The people at NFS...

833
00:52:58,268 --> 00:53:00,533
are saying they can't stand seeing me.

834
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:01,837
I dropped off the bag...

835
00:53:01,837 --> 00:53:04,243
and have been calling morning and night.

836
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:07,142
By the way, take this.

837
00:53:07,848 --> 00:53:08,848
What is it?

838
00:53:08,848 --> 00:53:10,987
Some guy passed it to me as I came in.

839
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,618
He said it's for your squad.

840
00:53:12,618 --> 00:53:13,812
Some guy?

841
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:15,058
What did he look like?

842
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,458
He looked like a courier on
a motorcycle wearing a helmet.

843
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,958
Does it have a name? It doesn't.

844
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,493
It doesn't have a name. Let's see.

845
00:53:22,697 --> 00:53:24,923
- Stick this in your PC.
- Okay.

846
00:53:28,668 --> 00:53:30,392
I didn't do anything!

847
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:32,467
I didn't do anything!

848
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:35,372
Il Du, Captain. Come and see this.

849
00:53:36,478 --> 00:53:37,602
What is it?

850
00:53:40,177 --> 00:53:43,872
Hey. Isn't this that scumbag?

851
00:53:43,918 --> 00:53:45,783
We got you now.

852
00:53:45,947 --> 00:53:49,118
Mr. Jang, did you notice anything
about the man who gave you this?

853
00:53:49,118 --> 00:53:51,188
Did you get his license plate
or a facial feature?

854
00:53:51,188 --> 00:53:52,857
He wore a helmet
so I didn't see his face,

855
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:54,328
and I didn't check his license plate.

856
00:53:54,328 --> 00:53:56,752
What is it? Is something wrong?

857
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:59,668
Did I do something silly?

858
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:01,498
Did Jang Mi's acquaintance send this?

859
00:54:01,498 --> 00:54:04,168
You did nothing wrong,
so don't worry and go home.

860
00:54:04,168 --> 00:54:05,708
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

861
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:08,332
- I'll let you guys work.
- Bye.

862
00:54:20,888 --> 00:54:24,788
(Please help us find Jang Mi.)

863
00:54:24,788 --> 00:54:27,722
(Please help us find Jang Hyun Ji!)

864
00:54:43,407 --> 00:54:44,702
Captain Kang.

865
00:54:46,447 --> 00:54:49,173
Here you are. I was looking for you.

866
00:54:50,018 --> 00:54:51,047
Who are you?

867
00:54:51,047 --> 00:54:53,013
Manager Wang spoke a lot about you.

868
00:54:53,547 --> 00:54:54,783
Manager Wang?

869
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:56,412
Who's that?

870
00:54:57,757 --> 00:54:59,852
I'll let you join her.

871
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:01,593
Call Captain Kang.

872
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,122
Tell him to throw him in the ocean.

873
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:06,498
Come on now.

874
00:55:06,498 --> 00:55:09,938
Everyone here knows
Ilgong Freezing's Manager Wang.

875
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:12,107
I'm here because he sent me.

876
00:55:12,107 --> 00:55:13,837
It hurts to hear you deny knowing him.

877
00:55:13,837 --> 00:55:16,372
I don't know anyone by that name.

878
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,642
Okay, fine.

879
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:23,073
I know fewer people than him,
but I am more generous.

880
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:24,783
I'll pay you an extra bill.

881
00:55:25,888 --> 00:55:27,042
What?

882
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:33,383
You might as well
control the whole seafront.

883
00:55:33,627 --> 00:55:36,622
You can find any coordinates
with your eyes closed.

884
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,392
That's an exaggeration.

885
00:55:40,427 --> 00:55:43,233
Let me borrow
your skill for just one day.

888
00:56:01,388 --> 00:56:04,788
A new life is growing inside me.

889
00:56:04,788 --> 00:56:06,653
It's amazing and fascinating.

890
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:08,722
Sunshine.

891
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:13,963
Thank you for coming to us
like the warm sunshine.

(June 25, 1990)

895
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:24,233
I went to the hospital with my senior.

896
00:56:25,607 --> 00:56:27,547
I saw Sunshine through the ultrasound,

897
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:29,872
and it's the prettiest baby
in the world.

898
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:34,952
I hope Sunshine looks like my senior.

899
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:44,392

900

Mommy can't protect you.

904
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:13,082
I'm sorry.

00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:52,567
They're closest to Chairwoman Han.

909
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:55,038
Was Director Yoo's resignation
your work, Director Han?

910
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,138
If I give up,

911
00:57:56,138 --> 00:57:58,268
no one else will find you.

912
00:57:58,268 --> 00:57:59,808
I'm right here.

913
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:01,538
A long tail is bound to get noticed.

914
00:58:01,538 --> 00:58:03,578
It's a long tail that lasted 27 years.

915
00:58:03,578 --> 00:58:05,047
What are you doing there?

916
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:07,277
So it's one or the other?

917
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:08,848
Why look into something so dangerous?

918
00:58:08,848 --> 00:58:11,348
I thought it'd be buried forever,
but the time has come.

919
00:58:11,348 --> 00:58:14,087
I will find you, whatever the case.

920
00:58:14,087 --> 00:58:17,053
The key to this plan is me.
I'm the bait.
