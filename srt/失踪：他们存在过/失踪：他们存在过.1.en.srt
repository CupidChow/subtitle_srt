ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,747
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,938
LOOKING FOR MY DEAR DAUGHTER,
KIM SO-HEE

4
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,302
<i>It's been ten days
since Kim So-hee went missing.</i>

5
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,262
<i>The police and the fire department
are under a full investigation,</i>

6
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,724
<i>but there are no clues
to her disappearance as of yet.</i>

7
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,556
<i>According to the police,
the number of missing cases</i>

8
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,562
<i>has been steadily increasing
over the past five years.</i>

9
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,515
<i>The total number of missing persons</i>

10
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,646
<i>who are yet to be reunited
with their families</i>

11
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,573
<i>is approximately 7,000…</i>

12
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,380
KIM MI-OK, AGE 33

13
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,278
What?

14
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,053
{\an8}As for Dragon Chemicals,

15
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,305
{\an8}after having their worst year last year
due to the US-China trade war,

16
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,308
{\an8}they've returned since the second quarter,

17
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,600
{\an8}and are expected to enter
a recovery phase in the third quarter.

18
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,145
{\an8}So we're expecting an increase

19
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,859
{\an8}of 4.5% for the first quarter,
4.2% for the second quarter,

20
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,030
{\an8}5.4% for the third, and as much
as 8.2% for the fourth quarter.

21
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,031
{\an8}Do you understand me now?

22
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,124
{\an8}In other words,
your assets will increase overall.

23
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,497
I understood that much, yes.

24
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,711
Bring it in.

25
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,554
Yes, that's exactly 100 million won.

26
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,224
But why exactly 100 million won?

27
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,972
I'm loaded.

28
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,439
Sir, let's assume one billion won
just dropped from the sky.

29
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,150
Do you have a clear plan about
what you'll do with that money?

30
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,776
Now, that is the difference
between the rich and the poor.

31
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:44,451
What's important here is not the amount,
but how you invest it and protect it.

32
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,624
That's the true secret to getting rich.

33
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,171
So in other words,
invest little, long term?

34
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,800
Looks like you got the gist of it.

35
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,762
Please, you flatter me.

36
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,301
This is for your reference.

37
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,514
I will make monthly visits
to update you on the global stock markets

38
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,925
and their outlooks.

39
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,635
Yes, I'll be in your care,
Mr. Kim Seok-hun.

40
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,319
Hold on.

41
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,149
Is this West Securities?

42
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,074
I'm calling for a Mr. Kim Seok-hun.

43
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,275
What are you doing?

44
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,455
Just consider this
your credit rating assessment.

45
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,880
<i>Mr. Kim Seok-hun?</i>

46
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,591
Yes, he's our team leader.

47
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,049
There is a Mr. Kim Seok-hun.

48
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,795
All right!

49
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,604
Now we can finally seal our partnership.

50
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,639
Things were still awkward between us.

51
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,773
Goodbye, you pretty little thing!
You understand, right?

52
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:57,823
- Sir, I was almost offended.
- Oh no, we can't have that.

53
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,541
<i>Mr. Park.</i>

54
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,251
He's a real scumbag
who swindles local businesses.

55
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,671
The amount he conned from the store owners
at Sang won Market last month

56
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,751
is 100 million won.

57
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,415
The vegetable store lady
blew her entire savings.

58
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,665
She had to pawn the gold ring

59
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,426
she got from her mother-in-law
just to pay this month's rent.

60
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,179
That lady is too gullible.

61
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,100
I knew this would happen one day.

62
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,805
What about my watch?

63
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,019
Don't you know perfect scams
come from perfect attire?

64
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,523
I mean, you guys insisted that
we go for the full 100 million won.

65
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,856
We might as well give back
the full amount while we're at it.

66
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,033
Are you the con artist?

67
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,201
You just watch the show
and bag the commission.

68
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,619
Hurry up and give him his watch.

69
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:52,038
Anyway, isn't it funny how Mr. Park
is investing his money when he's a thug?

70
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,040
- He says it's a trend.
- What about us?

71
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,672
You're a civil servant,
and I'm a freelancer. Here.

72
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,291
We're scamming con artists too.

73
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,798
Hey, there's a big difference.

74
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,709
I'm pretty much volunteering here.

75
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,878
Exactly! We are the defenders of justice…

76
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,927
- You mean con artists.
- Jeez.

77
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,596
<i>Hello, this is Kim Seok-hun.</i>

78
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,265
I'm returning your call.

79
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,653
How can I help you?

80
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,936
What?

81
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,283
Then that bastard just now…

82
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,490
Damn it!

83
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,319
Get that bastard!

84
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,576
Let's split up!

85
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,134
- He's not here.
- We'll go this way.

86
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,184
- You go that way.
- Yes, sir!

87
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,597
<i>You said Kim Seok-hun
was away on business!</i>

88
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,101
<i>I said I'm sorry, okay?</i>

89
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,483
It's not my fault his flight was canceled.

90
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,350
If I could hack the weather,
I'd be a god, not a human!

91
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,148
Stop complaining.
You're alive and that's all that matters.

92
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,572
Try being in my shoes, you evil bastard!

93
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,902
Hey, I'm at work.

94
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,447
I was in the middle of updating addresses.

95
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,991
I'm also expecting a client.
Go to the market, give their money back,

96
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,786
and collect our commission.

97
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,004
And don't pocket anything.

98
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,830
Hey!

99
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,955
They just hung up on me.

100
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,510
I'll deal with you guys later.

101
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,549
SANGWON MARKET

102
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,425
Here, 20 million minus the commission
is 19 million won.

103
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,346
No need to count. It's all there.

104
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,432
Here.

105
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,807
Share it with that young man
at the pawn shop.

106
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,064
It's okay! He didn't even do anything.

107
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,356
I did all the work.

108
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,939
And here.

109
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,400
Take this to the fishmonger lady

110
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,355
and the lady that owns
the <i>tteokbokki</i> place.

111
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,496
{\an8}DO NOT ENTER

112
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,252
They found a body.

113
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,503
I'm scared.

114
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,844
- It's my first time seeing a corpse.
- You okay?

115
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,689
- Has the body been identified?
- Yes. Kim Mi-ok.

116
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,593
She was reported missing a year ago.

117
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,264
We identified her right away
because her body was frozen.

118
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,812
That's a sign of strangulation.

119
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,522
What the hell?

120
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,442
Excuse me, mister!

121
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,021
What are you doing here?

122
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,226
"Mister"?

123
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,692
Me?

124
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,587
BAEK IL-DU
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

125
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,631
I'm Detective Baek Il-du,
in charge of missing cases.

126
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,275
Exactly, so what are you doing
at our crime scene?

127
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,247
- Do you even know who this is?
- Are you acquainted with the victim?

128
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,539
Kim Mi-ok. She would've been 33 this year.

129
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,933
She was single, worked in publishing,

130
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,768
and was last seen going home
after a company dinner.

131
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,042
No one heard from her after that. So what?

132
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,091
She ended up dead.

133
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,012
Send the body to
the National Forensic Service

134
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,301
and ask for an autopsy.

135
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,594
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,061
She may just be
another dead person to you,

137
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,520
but she's dear to her family,
who's been looking for her this past year.

138
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,482
Yes, it's terrible.

139
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,362
After a year of investigation,
the body showed up.

140
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,780
- What did you say?
- As you said, it's a just body to me.

141
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,320
Instead of getting sentimental,
we should catch the culprit.

142
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,281
I'm off.

143
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,661
That rude jerk!

144
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,907
He is a rude character,
but it's been worse these days.

145
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,078
His wedding is coming up,
and he fought with his fiancée.

146
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,085
Hello. Do you have a reservation?

147
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,473
Yes, for a fitting.

148
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,298
May I ask what your name is?

149
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,144
It's Shin Jun-ho.
And my fiancée is Choi Yeo-na.

150
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,600
Ms. Choi called just now
to cancel the reservation.

151
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,359
- I see, thank you.
- Sure.

152
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,364
<i>Did you have to go that far?</i>

153
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,622
<i>Fine, have it your way.</i>

154
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,661
I'm sick and tired of this too.

155
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,790
Please help!

156
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,125
Help me!

157
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,056
Hello? I'm at…

158
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,483
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

159
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,185
I got everything on my phone!

160
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,659
What? Wait a minute.

161
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,201
What do you want?

162
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,788
You…

163
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,705
So we meet here again.

164
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,464
We meet here again!

165
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,667
- Sir!
- You little rat!

166
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,757
How dare you scam our boss?

167
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,893
Sir, I think there's been
a misunderstanding…

168
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,221
Hey, let go of this first.

169
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,765
Is this your gang?

170
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,729
What's with the suits?

171
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,349
- What?
- What do you think?

172
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,146
- Hey, you. Come here.
- Why?

173
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,520
You little…

174
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,922
Get him!

175
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,053
A missing person was discovered dead.

176
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,427
We should go on the offensive
and find the culprit.

177
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,064
Who cares if we address her
as a dead body or Kim Mi-ok?

178
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,942
<i>Why are you on edge?</i>

179
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,769
<i>Did you fight with your fiancée again?</i>

180
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,734
Look at me.

181
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,744
I let my wife wear the pants
and married life has been good ever since.

182
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,162
Tell me once the results
from the NFS are out.

183
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,162
Out of the way! Move!

184
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,833
Move!

185
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,997
Ma'am, hurry!

186
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,585
Please be careful.

187
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,902
That bastard!

188
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,641
Sir, can you hear me? Hello?

189
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,517
Is this 911?

190
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,734
A man just ran into my car,
and he's unconscious.

191
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,357
- How is the patient?
- It was a car accident.

192
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,657
His vitals are normal,
but he's unconscious.

193
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,081
- Let's first get an X-ray.
- Yes, Doctor.

194
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,828
Please stay here.

195
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,233
Code blue. Cardiac arrest!

196
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,448
Give me the defibrillator.
Charge at 200 joules.

197
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,529
200 joules, charged.

198
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,815
Everyone stand back!

199
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,578
One, two, three!

200
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,789
Charge at 250 joules.

201
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,751
250 joules, charged.

202
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,416
Everyone stand back. One, two, three!

203
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,200
- Keep an eye on his vitals.
- Yes, Doctor.

204
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,091
Can you hear me?

205
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,256
Where am I?

206
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,465
The doctor said you should be fine now.

207
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,270
Do I look like I'm fine?

208
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,646
- You hit me, didn't you?
- Hit you?

209
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,321
You ran into the street.

210
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,700
You were the driver, so you should've
watched where you were going.

211
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,992
You were distracted, weren't you?

212
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,412
Were you on your phone?

213
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,870
The dash cam should have everything.

214
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:39,211
Stop rambling. I'll be right here,
so finish your IV drip.

215
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,790
Where are you going? Hey, don't go!

216
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,585
Wait right here! Hey, don't run away!

217
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,505
My head…

218
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,797
MISSING PERSONS TEAM

219
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,731
Il-du. What happened?

220
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,598
There were signs of strangulation,

221
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,371
but we'll have to wait
for the exact cause of death.

222
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,248
Hand it over to the Crimes Division
and close the case.

223
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,112
Yes, I should do that.

224
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,320
Are we after missing people
or dead bodies?

225
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,742
Where's everyone else?

226
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,950
Out working their butts off.
That's our job.

227
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,451
We waste our time asking around
but to no avail,

228
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,655
only to be hounded about our work
by a young brat.

229
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,165
Careful, ma'am.

230
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,246
My Ha-neul!

231
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,295
Ha-neul's gone missing.

232
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,379
Please find my Ha-neul!

233
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,052
Ma'am.

234
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,014
- Here, have a seat.
- Have a seat.

235
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:40,772
Please calm down
and tell us the details, slowly.

236
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,902
Who is Ha-neul? Is Ha-neul your child?

237
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,229
Ha-neul was playing at home
when he suddenly stepped outside…

238
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,106
I quickly followed him,
but I couldn't find him anywhere!

239
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,148
What do I do? My baby…

240
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,696
I can't find him anywhere.

241
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,333
No one's seen him!

242
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,449
Honey.

243
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,405
Honey.

244
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,708
Are you the father?

245
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,922
Yes, I've been searching
the entire neighborhood.

246
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,585
- But no one's seen him.
- Please find our son.

247
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,183
You have a picture of Ha-neul, right?

248
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,261

249
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,817

250
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,203
MISSING CHILD
NAME: SEO HA-NEUL

251
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,078
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

252
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,788
Have you ever seen a boy
who looks like this

253
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,039
at this playground or around here?

254
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,723
Where is this?

255
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Around the back.

256
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,684
- That's too high. Lower it.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,443
I haven't even eaten anything all day.
Why won't they let me?

258
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,016
I told you to see the doctor,
not get a full medical checkup!

259
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,438
A colonoscopy?

260
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,068
Since I'm here, I might as well add it on.

261
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,784
Besides, they didn't let me do it.

262
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,164
Stop being so stingy.

263
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,291
Mr. Kim Seok-hun?

264
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,463
Mr. Kim Seok-hun. They're calling for you.

265
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,618
- Me?
- Yes.

266
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,837
I got this from your pocket.

267
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,148
WEST SECURITIES
TEAM LEADER KIM SEOK-HUN

268
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,972
You were unconscious,
so I did the paperwork.

269
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,644
Mr. Kim, this is your first time
at our hospital, correct?

270
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,935
- Kim Wook.
- Pardon?

271
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,149
My name. It's Kim Wook.

272
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,982
<i>Wook</i> as in "sunshine."

273
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,855
In other words,
someone who lights up this world.

274
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,073
Wook.

275
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,106
Did they find anything?

276
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,328
No, I'm at a hospital.

277
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,331
I'll fill you in back at the station.
All right.

278
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,418
I'm going to claim insurance.

279
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,080
<i>He busted the lock open,
placed the body inside,</i>

280
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,866
<i>and turned on the power?</i>

281
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,253
<i>Who are you?</i>

282
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,345
DELIVERER: KANG MYEONG-JIN

283
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,862
Yes, what?

284
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,652
- Where are you?
- On my way to the police to make a report.

285
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:23,116
- A report?
- Due to my sense of justice!

286
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,158
I just can't overlook injustice.

287
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,242
I really can't.

288
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,002
My life is so tiring.

289
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,624
Why did you call me?

290
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,285
How about a drink to celebrate
at our hideout?

291
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,584
Celebrate what?

292
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,798
My miraculous revival
from that traffic accident?

293
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,009
You were in an accident?

294
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,049
<i>Are you hurt badly? Are you all right?</i>

295
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,140
Hello?

296
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,225
Wook?

297
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:15,581
It's all thanks to that nutjob
we're doing this.

298
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,127
Shut up and get moving.

299
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,809
You need to dig deep,

300
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,568
or else his head will show.

301
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,779
Boss, look.

302
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,145
What is he doing?

303
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,407
That nutjob.

304
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,160
That's why I told you to move it.

305
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,945
- Hey!
- Damn it!

306
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,207
Grab him!

307
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,711
Hey, you bastard!

308
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,774
Find him quickly!

309
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,609
Where did that bastard go?

310
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,527
He couldn't have gone anywhere else.

311
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,986
If he fell from there,
he's probably dead, right?

312
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,867
Let's come back when the sun's up
to look for his body.

313
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,285
Let's retreat for now.

314
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,983
Where am I?

315
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,235
Who are you? And where is this place?

316
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,358
You…

317
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,316
Who are you?

318
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,865
Don't come near me!

319
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,662
You kidnapped me, didn't you?

320
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,826
Kidnap you?

321
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,714
Don't come near me!

322
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,020
Who are you?

323
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,112
What's the date today?

324
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,578
It's stopped.

325
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,671
How long has it been since then?

326
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,879
My clothes…

327
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,723
What about my clothes? Where are they?

328
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,974
Outside.

329
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,788
Jong-a, is this the place?

330
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,834
This is where we got his last signal.

331
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,630
<i>On my way to the police to make a report.</i>

332
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,514
Where on earth did he go?

333
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,008
Jong-a.

334
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,977
<i>This is custom-made.</i>

335
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,977
Ta-da!

336
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,944
It says something on it. What does it say?

337
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,990
It's from <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>

338
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,872
Oh, right.

339
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,577
This is for you.

340
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,661
For you, in khaki.

341
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,093
Come on, cuties. Time to eat.

342
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:04,095
- Excuse me, may I borrow your phone?
- I don't have one. There's no signal.

343
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,312
I don't mean your cell phone.
Your land line.

344
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,645
I said I don't have one.

345
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,444
There's no place in Korea
where you can't get a signal.

346
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,030
Did you see my wallet
by any chance? It's black.

347
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,655
No, I didn't see it.

348
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,292
Did some dog run off with it?

349
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,290
You little bastard!

350
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,554
<i>There's this huge tree midway up the hill,</i>

351
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,298
<i>which you'll instantly recognize.</i>

352
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,550
<i>That's where I found you,
so try that place.</i>

353
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,802
Please…

354
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,299
They all look the same to me.
Which one is he talking about?

355
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,397
You must be the one.

356
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,148
So you're my savior, are you?

357
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,872
Thank you.

358
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,951
My wallet.

359
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,133
Found it.

360
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,881
Where did he go?

361
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,177
Hey, do you see him?

362
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,810
- Hurry up and look for him.
- Where on earth did he go?

363
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,889
Seriously.

364
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,811
This is driving me crazy!

365
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,276
We searched everywhere else,
and we're positive this is the place.

366
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,530
He fell from pretty high up,
so he might be dead.

367
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,576
If he's dead, there should be a body.

368
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,999
Maybe a wild animal ran off with it.

369
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,868
Be quiet.

370
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,245
Are you sure you looked everywhere?
Keep searching.

371
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,753
Like the rocks over there.

372
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,503
I'm sure this is where he fell.

373
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,385
Big bro?

374
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,179
Go away!

375
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,941
Go!

376
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,299
They went that way, big bro.

377
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,522
Search his phone to see
where he might've gone.

378
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,728
If he's dead, bring me his body.

379
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,809
Yes, sir.

380
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,024
Find him.

381
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,493
So…

382
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,780
Who are you?

383
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,004
Where are you going, big bro?

384
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,252
I'm not your big bro!

385
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,251
Big bro!

386
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:42,112
DO NOT ENTER

387
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,967
What the hell?

388
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,180
He said there was no signal here.

Everyone's talking about it.

394
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,762
I heard.

395
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,466
How long will you keep him here?

396
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,599
Only for a short while.

397
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,774
Why don't I take him to my place?

398
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,105
He keeps looking for his mother.

399
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,529
- It'll be better if he stays with me.
- There are other children there.

400
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,438
He'll quickly make friends.

401
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,027
It'll hush things down here

00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,077
Go upstairs.

00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,634
- I'll bring food for Ha-neul.
- Sure.

Can I borrow your phone?

413
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,905
- It doesn't work.
- No one's used it for a while.

414
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,917
That's very funny.

415
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,221
I guess most people
don't have land line phones, but…

416
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,050
You run a business.

417
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,892
Can I borrow your cell, then?

418
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,602
It doesn't work here.

00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,061
What kind of town is this?

420
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,767
Where's the nearest police station?

421
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,356
There isn't one around here.

422
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,859
Then I'll have one iced America no.

With an extra shot.
I want it nice and cold.

424
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,950
We don't have any espresso machines…

425
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,433
- Do I have to pay first?
- No.

426
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,348
Then why are you…

427
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,387
looking at me like that?

428
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,886
I haven't seen you around here.

429
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,058
You run a café.

430
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,897
Of course you'll have strangers
coming in from time to time.

431
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,147
Or is this for members only?

432
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,947
Is it because of how I look?

433
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,320
Of course not.

434
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,327

What are you doing here?
Did you find your wallet?

438
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,859
I was trying to borrow a phone.

439
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,242
I said there's no signal here.
Who were you trying to borrow it from?

440
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:42,121
I just saw a woman with a cell phone.
She went that way.

441
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,160
She was tall and had long hair.

442
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,788
I'm sure I saw her.

443
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,351

00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,204
- I'm off.
- So you're leaving?

447
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,743
You told me to go.

00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,156

I mean, where can I catch a taxi?

Walk down for about 30 minutes
and you'll see a bus stop.

452
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,299
Take the bus to town.
You'll find taxis and buses there,

453
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,009
so take whatever you want.

454
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,549

They all drive cars around.

Hey. What happened here?
Did you hurt yourself?

532
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,988
Ha-neul.

533
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,695
How old are you?

534
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,744
Seven.

535
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,746
<i>Seo Ha-neul,</i>

536
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,829
<i>seven years old.</i>

537
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,384
It is you.

538
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,679
- Ha-neul!
- Goodness!

539
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,014
You startled me.

540
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,095
Come on.

541
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,353
You shouldn't sneak up on people.

542
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,062
I was in my room when I heard him crying.

543
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,853
I swear I didn't make him cry.
I was only comforting him.

544
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,268
Right, Ha-neul?

545
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,149
Ha-neul, why are you out here?

546
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,485
Did you wake up from your sleep again?

547
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,488
Let's go back in.

548
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:10,793
You should get some rest too.
I'll put the child to bed.

549
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,358
Why is a missing child locked up in here?

550
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,780
Was he kidnapped?

551
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,121
Damn it.

552
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,176
I should've left him to die
in the mountains.

553
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,266
I just created trouble for myself.

554
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,363
<i>That woman was an accomplice,</i>

555
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,742
<i>and they cut the telephone cords
on purpose too.</i>

556
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,239
<i>It all makes sense now.</i>

557
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,832
There are too many of them
for me to take on by myself.

558
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,406
No.

559
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,115
Why should I?

560
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,707
I can just call the police.

561
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,924
This is not good. I should chase him out.

562
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,258
Just one night should be fine.

563
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,301
Thankfully, I don't think
he knows anything.

564
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,811
Kick him out as soon as
he wakes up tomorrow.

565
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,771
I'll do that. I should get back inside.

566
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,601
The child is having trouble sleeping.

567
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,556
All right, go on in.

568
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,725
Why? What's going on?

569
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,113
What do you mean?

570
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,355
I heard you guys talking just now.

571
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,407
You said you caused trouble for yourself,

572
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,411
and that he should kick him out tomorrow.

573
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,913
Don't you have something better to do?

574
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,535
No, there's nothing to do around here.

575
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,623
You know that.

576
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,544
So tell me. Who is it?

577
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,094
How will you chase him out?

578
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,221
Is it that kid who's staying with Thomas?

579
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,798
Or that new young man
in the room next door?

580
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,597
I'm just curious as to how
you'll chase him out, that's all.

581
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,439
This isn't a town
where you can leave freely.

582
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,190
Just go get some sleep.

583
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,272
Mr. Jang.

584
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,482
Let go of me.

585
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,897
I'm bored.

586
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,066
Besides, who knows?

587
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,452
I could help chase him out.

588
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:48,911
Shut your mouth!

589
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,491
My blood boils whenever I think about
how you tricked me

590
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,679
into accusing an innocent person.

591
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,833
She's not innocent!

592
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,123
That woman really stabbed me in the back!

593
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,417
That woman is your wife!

594
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,091
A wife who shed tears
waiting for a husband like you!

595
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,380
She was just putting on a show.

596
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,434
Why do you only believe her words?

597
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,718
I told you.

598
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,850
After hearing about plans
to lay a highway across my land,

599
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:11,948
she wanted the insurance...

600
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,022
That highway project?

601
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,098
It's been ten years.
Work still hasn't begun.

602
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,983
When I told the police what you said,

603
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,520
they thought I was a lunatic!

604
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,064
All the while, your wife…

605
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,067
She was camping out at the station,
pleading to them to find you.

606
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,279
She's a good woman.

607
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,451
So please!

608
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,485
Stop tormenting her.

609
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,452
Mr. Jang.

610
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,706
Did you take money from my wife?

611
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,497
Why you!

612
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,629
Forget it.

613
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,376
I shouldn't waste my time.

614
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,955
First, I'll get out of here
and call the police.

615
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,167
Search his phone to see
where he might've gone.

616
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,132
If he's dead, bring me his body.

617
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,467
Jong-a and Nam-guk…

618
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,258
I hope they're all right.

619
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,975
Gosh, you're up early.

620
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,525
Here. This is on the house.

621
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,906
Coffee on an empty stomach
gives me a stomachache.

622
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:53,906
Then…

623
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,698
I suggest you hurry up.

624
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,294
You don't want to miss the bus again.

625
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,954
Right.

626
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,962
I wouldn't want to do that.

627
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,631
By the way, I don't see Ha-neul anywhere.

628
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,092
He wasn't in his room either.

629
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,511
He went to visit a friend.

630
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,632
Really?

631
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,969
Then I should go before I miss my bus.

632
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,621
Kids, have some snacks!

633
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,203
Hey, snacks!

634
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,408
What is it, Auntie?

635
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,707
Have a seat. I have cookies and milk.

636
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,041
Cookies and milk.

637
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:48,423
Good boys.

638
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,919
- Here you go, Ha-neul.
- I want one too.

639
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,758
Let's wipe that off and have some milk.

640
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,045
Is it good?

641
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,268
<i>Why is she being so nice to him?</i>

642
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,888
<i>Who is that woman?</i>

643
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,862
Jeez, ma'am. What are you doing?

644
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,359
Quiet.

645
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,451
If she sees you, she'll secretly kill you.

646
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,283
What?

647
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,744
She's got a real temper, that one.

648
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,575
Goodness, you got some on your face.

649
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:25,251
Another person died last night.

650
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,000
What?

651
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,464
- Follow me.
- Okay.

652
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,965
Come to think of it…

653
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,256
It's you.

654
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,477
You've grown so much.

655
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,892
Do you know me, ma'am?

656
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:46,977
Quack, quack.

657
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,269
Of course.

658
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,976
I heard all about you from your mother.

659
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,448
My mother?

660
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,817
Yes.

661
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,080
No way.

662
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,332
My mother left when I was seven

663
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,499
and never came back.

664
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,751
She probably even forgot about my face.

665
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,375
Yes.

666
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,797
Anyway, what did you mean
by what you said back there?

667
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:23,136
You said another person died last night.

668
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,983
Well, you see…

669
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,194
What are you doing here?

670
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,993
Answer me. What are you doing here?

671
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,834
Are you all right, Ms. Choi?

672
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:52,955
I'm hungry. Why won't you give me my meal?

673
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,384
You've been talking nonsense again,
haven't you?

674
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,258
I'm going to get going, ma'am.

675
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,773
When will you give me my meal?

676
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,892
Have a seat.

677
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,476
I'll count to ten now.

678
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,614
One,

679
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,232
two,

680
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,109
three,

681
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,861
four,

682
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,856
five.

683
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,121
- Six, seven…
- Hey, Ha-neul!

684
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,160
- Let's go see your mom.
- Really?

685
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,124
- Really? We're going to see Mommy?
- Nine.

686
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,874
- Of course. I promised, remember?
- Ten! Here I come.

687
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,705
Then let's go!

688
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,674
Let's go.

689
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:43,678
We were playing hide-and-seek.
I was it and Ha-neul went to hide.

690
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,892
- But that big bro came and...
- "Big bro"? Who are you talking about?

691
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,353
You mean that handsome man with big eyes?

692
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,397
That bastard!

693
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,226
- Ha-neul!
- Ha-neul!

694
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,855
Excuse me! Stop right there!

695
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,028
Open that bag.

696
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:10,998
- Why do you want to see my bag?
- Just do it while we're asking nicely.

697
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,421
There's no time for that.

698
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,629
Why are you touching my stuff?

699
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,709
Open it right now!

700
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,462
Thomas, open it up!

701
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,006
Hey, let go of me!

702
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,472
Let go!

703
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,889
You think I stole something? Well…

704
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,147
Ms. Choi Mi-ja packed this for me.

705
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,939
If you don't believe me, go ask her.

706
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:39,652
I don't like corn, all right?
Or dried radish!

707
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:40,904
Where's Ha-neul?

708
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,241
How would I know where he is?

709
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,321
If he's not outside,
he probably went home.

710
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,777
He didn't come home.

711
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,334
Where did Ha-neul go?

712
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,451
Ha-neul!

713
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,249
Honey, I'll try looking over there.

714
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,421
All right.

715
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,629
Beom-su!

716
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,339
If you manage to leave this village,

717
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,130
don't ever come back.

718
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,306
He's saying that because
he's hiding something.

719
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,363
Ha-neul!

720
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,399
Ha-neul, you can come out now.

721
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,744
There you go.

722
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,630
Just hang on for a bit. Are you all right?

723
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,711
Yes.

724
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:45,133
What is it?
What do you want me to do this time?

725
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:49,006
Can you be beside me when I go see Mommy?

726
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,845
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

727
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,390
Isn't taking you back to your mom enough?

728
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,944
Are you scared she'll tell you off?

729
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,897
You didn't do anything wrong.

730
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,446
Those people are bad
for bringing you here.

731
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,239
Still…

732
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,408
Fine, all right.

733
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,746
I'll brag about bringing you back
to your mom.

734
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,166
Here.

735
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,416
You promised!

736
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,916
Okay.

737
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,427
Now, let's go.

738
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,926
You're lighter than I thought.

739
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,846
No one's following us.

740
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,226
Ha-neul, you can come out now.

741
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,899
Ha-neul!

742
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,395
What happened?

743
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,657
Ha-neul!

744
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,962
Sir!

745
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,090
Your phone.

746
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,799
Can I borrow your phone?

747
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,418
Here.

748
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,835
Hurry!

749
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,427
Hello? Is this the police?

750
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,642
I want to report a missing child.

751
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,888
Ha-neul. Seo Ha-neul.

752
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,515
Sir, what's the name
of that village again?

753
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,562
- Duon-ri…
- Duon Village.

754
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,241
Detective Baek.

755
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,321
What?

756
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,664
Did you find anything?

757
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,330
Someone called saying they saw Ha-neul.

758
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,079
We get tons of calls like that.

759
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,701
See if any of them is useful.

760
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,367
The caller said
he was with Ha-neul last night.

761
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,745
Was it really Ha-neul? Is he alive?

762
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,169
Let's check it out.

763
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,510
Go, Ha-neul, go!

764
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,927
Ha-neul!

765
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,768
Ha-neul, why are you here?

766
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,686
You left without me.

767
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,614
That's not true,
I've been looking for you everywhere.

768
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,704
You didn't.

769
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:15,994
Ha-neul got lost, so I brought him back.

770
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,695
You brought him back?

771
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,155
Yes. Good on me, right?

772
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,745
Good on you? No!

773
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,620
Come on, let's go.

774
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,632
Where are you going?

775
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:31,263
Are you going out to play?
I want to come too.

776
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,931
Don't follow me!

777
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,549
If you bring Ha-neul back here again,
I won't forgive you.

778
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,612
- Hey! Why you…
- Let's run!

779
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,400
Hey, put him down!

780
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,994
Ha-neul!

781
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,572
Ha-neul!

782
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,867
Come over this way!

783
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,200
Ha-neul!

784
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,806
Ms. Choi, we're coming in.

785
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,956
CHOI MI-JA

786
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,921
<i>A police dog discovered
the body of a woman with dementia</i>

787
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,756
<i>at a beach this afternoon.</i>

788
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,681
<i>Choi had gone missing three months ago
while on a walk at her nursing home.</i>

789
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,561
<i>The police are trying to determine
the cause of her death.</i>

790
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:04,269
- Dogs are better than people.
<i>- They suspect she fell.</i>

791
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,560
<i>Next up.</i>

792
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:08,443
<i>The Muchang Highway project
that will connect Mujin City</i>

793
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,021
<i>to Muchang City is now underway.</i>

794
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,856
<i>Choiseung Construction…</i>

795
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,857
You saw it too, didn't you?

796
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,783
That lady beckoned to us.

797
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:19,662
So we followed her, but she disappeared
and so did all her things.

798
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,947
Mister.

799
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,785
- Mister, my legs hurt.
- Your legs hurt?

800
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,920
All right. One, two, three!

801
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,301
Ha-neul.

802
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,509
So…

803
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,669
I'm carrying you

804
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,378
and taking you to your mom.

805
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,682
What will you do for me in return?

806
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:47,144
I'll give you my favorite
transforming robot toy.

807
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,596
A transforming robot? Really?

808
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,817
Don't go back on your word!

809
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,149
When can I see Mommy?

810
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,534
Soon.

811
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,030
I made a report to the police.

812
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,552
Let's go.

813
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,513
Stay right here. Don't go anywhere.

814
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:23,925
- Okay.
- All right.

815
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,936
They began work on the highway?

816
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,018
Yes.

817
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,572
You said you got
the wrong person last time.

818
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,530
Do you finally believe me now?

819
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,530
Hey, I only said the project broke ground.

820
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,282
I never said your wife killed you.

821
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,083
I'm telling you, that woman killed me!

822
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,002
Who killed who?

823
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,916
Hey!

824
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,092
My wife killed me.

825
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,216
Why? You're not dead?

826
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,259
Why are you here?

827
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,763
- Get out.
- I came here to ask something.

828
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,006
That's all.

829
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,967
But what was that just now? Who's dead?

830
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:11,057
- Let's go. Let's take this outside.
- Let go of me!

831
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,904
Come on, Mr. Jang.

832
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,570
He said to let go of him.

833
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,688
Just leave him alone.

834
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,656
- Let's talk outside.
- It's just…

835
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,369
A lady with dementia beckoned to me,
so I followed her.

836
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,410
But she was gone and so was her furniture.

837
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,793
And now someone's dead?

838
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,410
That lady left.

839
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,656
Where did she go?

840
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,918
To a good place, I bet.

841
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:37,837
Are you really not dead?

842
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,420
Why do you keep asking if I'm dead?

843
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,474
Everyone in this village is dead.

844
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,394
But you're…

845
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,270
So I was right.

846
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,401
This is what's been troubling you,
Mr. Jang.

847
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:57,439
- So this guy is...
- Say another word and I'll make you pay.

848
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,862
How?

849
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,445
How will you make me…

850
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,286
What's happening?

851
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,219
I'm off.

852
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,135
All right.

853
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,350
Go.

854
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,166
- I'll explain, so...
- Get…

855
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,835
Get away from me.

856
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,053
- You see…
- Stay back!

857
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,959
Mister, when are we going to see Mommy?

858
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,505
Mister.

859
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,925
Ha-neul.

860
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,057
Are…

861
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,352
Are you…

862
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,435
Dead?

863
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,267
{\an8}Have you ever seen a ghost?

864
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,814
{\an8}Wook, do you see ghosts?

865
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,791
{\an8}There's not a dead soul here
without a story to tell.

866
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:45,975
{\an8}You're all crazy!

867
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,647
{\an8}You saw his scar over there?

868
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,275
{\an8}That's where Ha-neul is, so yes!

869
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,612
{\an8}<i>He's not in his right mind.</i>

870
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,507
{\an8}<i>Won't catching the culprit
lead us to the victim?</i>

871
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,411
{\an8}<i>Stepping forward won't help.</i>

872
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:55,742
{\an8}<i>What is this place?</i>

873
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,388
{\an8}<i>Do you think they'll believe you
when you can't believe it yourself?</i>

874
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,912
{\an8}<i>What did Ha-neul bring?</i>

875
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,197
{\an8}<i>Did he really leave this time?</i>

876
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:04,038
{\an8}Do you think it'll be easy for him
to leave Ha-neul behind?

877
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,836
{\an8}They can't see them, so how come I can?

878
