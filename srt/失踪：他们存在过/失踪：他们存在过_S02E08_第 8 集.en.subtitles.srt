1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,887
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,972
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,605
Do you think those are Ro-ha's remains?

4
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:04,939
Yes.

5
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,483
I'm sure.

6
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,443
That's definitely Ro-ha.

7
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,861
Still…

8
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,529
Let's wait for the test results.

9
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,075
How are you so sure? It's not like you.

10
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,743
Well…

11
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,703
This morning…

12
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,664
three mountain gods showed up

13
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,834
and told me about this.

14
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,128
Sir!

15
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,548
We found this under the remains.

16
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,136
It looks like a boy's shoe.

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,054
Sir!

18
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:37,931
We brought him.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,767
Did you find Ro-ha?

20
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,102
Yes.

21
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,814
Do you perhaps

22
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,108
recognize this?

23
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,494
I got this for his eighth birthday.

24
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,835
He was growing so fast…

25
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,548
that I got him a pair
that was a size bigger.

26
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,345
He said his toes were swimming inside.

27
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,602
Where was he?

28
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,814
This is…

29
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:33,361
the trail Ro-ha often walked with his mom.

30
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,821
I think

31
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,699
he came here looking for his mom.

32
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,498
Ro-ha.

33
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,838
Ro-ha…

34
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,303
Ro-ha…

35
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,433
Ro-ha!

36
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm…

37
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,534
sorry, Ro-ha…

38
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,308
CLOSED TODAY

39
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,288
You cried again?

40
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,498
Who cried?

41
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,252
There's a detective I know
that's a crybaby.

42
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,753
Do you feel nothing?

43
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,589
What do you mean?

44
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,843
Ro-ha disappeared
right in front of our eyes.

45
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,928
So did Ms. Yang

46
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,763
and Seung-jae.

47
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,182
They were people who were here
before you came.

48
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,770
This place is like that.

49
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,857
If your body is found

50
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,526
you disappear from here.

51
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,904
I still find it hard to believe
that I'm dead.

52
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,407
And now I could even disappear.

53
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,410
What happens next?

54
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,163
What else is there?

55
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,623
No idea. That's all I know.

56
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,419
What did you do for Ro-ha?

57
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,254
It was you, wasn't it?

58
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,256
Someone

59
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,425
must have found his body.

60
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,427
That's why he disappeared.

61
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,720
I meant about his race.

62
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,931
Oh, that?

63
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,228
Sang-yun had a mosquito bite on his leg

64
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,900
and Ji-woo hurt her toe when she fell.

65
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:03,029
Ha-yun and Yeong-rim couldn't run
as fast as usual because their legs hurt.

66
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:04,906
What?

67
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,660
Ro-ha and his friends

68
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,204
all did their best.

69
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,501
So the kids helped him out.

70
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,920
Isn't it beautiful?

71
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,217
Among all the races I've seen,

72
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,384
this one was the best.

73
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,430
By now…

74
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,392
Ro-ha probably met his mom, right?

75
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:38,022
He believed that if he won the race,
he could run to his mom.

76
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,024
I hope it came true.

77
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,319
This is a very strange place.

78
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,487
You realized that now?

79
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,489
At first,

80
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,991
I wanted to run away because I was afraid.

81
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,993
But now…

82
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,330
I find this place interesting.

83
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,338
Thank you.

84
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,298
Like you said,

85
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,176
it was a great race.

86
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,806
I could have taken the bus.

87
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,600
Goliath is still at large,
so it's too dangerous.

88
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,894
And that house isn't safe.

89
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,230
I was going to move anyway.

90
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,150
The ladies in our neighborhood
have big mouths,

91
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,693
so Bo-ra is very stressed out.

92
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,988
We plan to stay at a friend's place
until we find a new home.

93
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,158
Don't you think staying with Wook
would be safer for now?

94
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,368
He seems to think the same.

95
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,875
I suppose so.

96
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,381
I heard that you paid our rent.

97
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,927
I wanted to repay you,
so I carried this around with me.

98
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,012
Thank you.

99
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,139
You didn't have to pay me back so fast.

100
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,349
Yes, I did. I'll put it in here.

101
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,898
You know how to use
that smartwatch, right?

102
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,858
Of course.

103
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,986
I'm going to report
just about anything suspicious.

104
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,115
Go see Bo-ra.
I'll wait in front of the school.

105
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,371
What are you eating?

106
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,415
-Did you see it?
-Did you?

107
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:20,917
Bo-ra.

108
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,086
Mom!

109
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,546
You guys go ahead.

110
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,797
-Bye.
-See you.

111
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,427
-How have you been?
-Good.

112
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,179
Is it okay for you to be out?

113
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,680
Can we go home now?

114
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,890
No.

115
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:36,974
We're going to move.

116
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,103
I'm going to stay at Aunt Ji-yeong's
until we find a new place.

117
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,273
But I think you'll be better off
where you are for now.

118
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,567
Okay. I'd prefer that too.

119
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,445
Are they good to you?

120
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,363
Yes!

121
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,698
Dad acts tough but he's actually soft.

122
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,283
Jong-a is so cool.

123
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,744
And Mr. Jang has my back no matter what.

124
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,833
Enjoy your food.

125
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,918
Thank you.

126
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,714
Let me see your stamp.

127
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,132
Stay still.

128
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,842
BANANA MILK

129
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,219
-Thank you.
-I have two stamps.

130
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,429
-Enjoy.
-This stamp is fake!

131
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,348
-Come on!
-What do you mean?

132
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,766
One more.

133
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,560
-Thank you.
-All right, Captain Kang.

134
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,477
Two baskets!

135
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,812
-Applause!
-Give me that.

136
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,150
Where did you get all this?

137
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,113
From a fountain that never runs dry.

138
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,531
This is a miracle.

139
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,700
This village is a miracle in itself.

140
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,327
It all makes sense when you believe that.

141
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,329
-All right.
-Give me one more.

142
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,664
Oh, come on.

143
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,291
Detective Goh, take one.

144
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,585
Yes, at least take
the participation prize.

145
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,920
It's weirder if you don't take it.

146
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,924
Show me the stamp.

147
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,427
I don't have one.

148
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,595
You don't?

149
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,347
If you don't, here!

150
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,433
Get the stamp.

151
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,394
Give me this hand too.

152
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,650
This is Ro-ha's.

153
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,570
It's a plaque of appreciation.

154
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,991
Thanks to you,
Ro-ha came in first in the race.

155
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,659
I didn't do anything.

156
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,620
Thank you.

157
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,704
See?

158
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,914
Isn't it nice to get a prize?

159
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,709
Yes.

160
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,044
See you later.

161
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,629
Next!

162
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,632
Hey! Lee Yeong-rim!

163
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,428
I told you not to drink those!

164
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,640
But it's good.

165
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,099
You idiot.

166
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,101
You shouldn't drink banana milk!

167
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,686
That's bad.

168
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,815
Yeong-rim, Ha-yun.

169
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,235
Come on, we had so much fun back there.

170
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,195
What's going on?

171
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,864
Look.

172
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,452
This idiot was drinking banana milk.

173
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,414
Why can't he drink it?

174
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,832
Is he allergic?

175
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,251
Because of that, we can't go home

176
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,253
or see our parents.

177
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,050
I'm sorry. I won't drink it.

178
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,093
Ha-yun.

179
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,135
My goodness.

180
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,261
What's with them?

181
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,311
Did he drink this?

182
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,356
Yes. I gave it to him.

183
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,276
Yeong-rim drank that
and Ha-yun told him not to.

184
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,238
She said he's here because of this.

185
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,449
I should have told you about this,
but I forgot to.

186
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,369
You shouldn't give them banana milk.

187
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,162
Why not?

188
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,208
Let me put Alice to bed first.

189
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,626
Then I'll tell you the story.

190
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,805
She must've been so tired. She's out cold.

191
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,893
Where was I?

192
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,978
That's right.

193
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,565
This wicked woman

194
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,567
gave banana milk

195
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,360
to the kids in the playground.

196
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,779
And they fell asleep after drinking that.

197
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,323
When Ha-yun woke up,

198
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,243
she found Yeong-rim sleeping next to her

199
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,704
and that woman watching TV.

200
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,541
She berated Ha-yun for waking up
and gave her that milk again.

201
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,086
She cried and refused to drink it.

202
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,881
When she came to her senses,
she found herself here.

203
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,967
It's all so vivid

204
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,052
as if it happened yesterday.

205
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,725
Where are we?

206
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,809
I don't know.

207
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,739
There's no need to be afraid.

208
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,950
Are you two siblings?

209
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,119
No.

210
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,913
He's an idiot.

211
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,539
He can't even read yet.

212
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,833
So don't hurt my friend.

213
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,837
Are you protecting him?

214
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,050
He's my friend.

215
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,761
I want to go home.

216
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,889
We live in Yeonggi-dong.

217
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,974
But where are we?

218
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,310
Could you…

219
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,189
please take me to my mom?

220
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,316
Please?

221
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,281
How could she do that
to those nice little kids?

222
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,242
And they don't know who she is?

223
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,743
No.

224
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,328
They'd never seen her before.

225
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,413
It's already been 15 years.

226
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,000
If Yeong-rim and Ha-yun were alive,

227
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,462
they'd be cool college students by now.

228
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,801
Does Mr. Jang know about this?

229
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,261
Yes.

230
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,138
So that's what happened

231
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,724
to Ha-yun and Yeong-rim.

232
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,436
So how are we going to find the one
who gave them banana milk?

233
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,440
He asks me
about the villagers all the time.

234
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,402
Like when did they get here
and what happened when they were alive.

235
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,405
And he writes down everything I tell him.

236
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,532
That's what he does best.

237
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,868
That's how he found Ro-ha.

238
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,411
Oh, please.

239
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,289
I know that he did his best

240
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,708
and that you did your best

241
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,918
to look for Ro-ha.

242
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,753
I heard it from Il-yong.

243
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,297
So I know.

244
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,842
I'm so grateful for all that you did,

245
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,511
that I didn't know how to say thank you.

246
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,348
You're doing so much for us
but there's nothing we do for you.

247
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,934
Please, don't say that.

248
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,312
You've fed us so many times.

249
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,064
I'm thankful that you think that way.

250
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,484
Speaking of food,

251
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,155
why do you always cook for us?

252
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,036
A long time ago,

253
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,664
someone who had been here
for a while told me

254
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,793
that people don't become useless
when they're dead.

255
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,755
But that they die
when they become useless.

256
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,216
So the reason why you cook for us so much

257
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,344
is because…

258
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,931
What are you guys talking about
that you don't even notice me?

259
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,891
You're here.

260
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,685
We were talking
about Yeong-rim and Ha-yun.

261
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,062
I see.

262
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm so tired from cleaning up.

263
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,360
Il-yong and Detective Goh are still at it.

264
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,319
Hey, Wook.

265
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,905
Go get me a glass of water.

266
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,740
-Okay.
-I'll get it.

267
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,534
I know my kitchen the best.

268
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,624
I think Captain Kang

269
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,835
cooks for the villagers

270
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:08,008
because she wants to remain
useful even after dying.

271
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,803
Did she tell you that?

272
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,681
Not in those words exactly.

273
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,309
But I think I'm right.

274
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,186
What are you talking about?

275
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,530
Jong-a, and this?

276
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,323
That's Mr. Jang's.

277
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,744
Do you do all the laundry?

278
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,580
No, we each take care
of our own underwear,

279
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,499
and I only do the laundry
in the laundry room.

280
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,917
I do the laundry,

281
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,794
Mr. Jang does the cooking,

282
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,254
and Wook does the cleaning.

283
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,215
We take turns walking the dogs.

284
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,010
And now we have you.

285
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,389
Mr. Jang's been so happy since you came.

286
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,350
Well, I'm a good cook.

287
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,268
Goodness.

288
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,437
I'll take these upstairs.

289
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,981
Okay, then I'll take the first floor.

290
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,774
Thank you!

291
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,829
What is this?

292
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:39,892
FROM: PO BOX 90 7107, SEONGJU POST OFFICE
SEONGJU-SI, GYEONGGI-DO

293
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,809
What are these?

294
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,103
Are they all from the same person?

295
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,951
We're home.

296
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,831
I'm so hungry.

297
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,250
You too?

298
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,295
Even if I eat something in the village,

299
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,631
I feel famished when I get home.

300
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,840
It's strange.

301
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,425
-I know.
-The food must disappear.

302
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,594
We'll just have to eat again here.

303
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,763
You're home.

304
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,016
Hey, Jong-a. They found Ro-ha.

305
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,519
Really? That's great.

306
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,020
It's all thanks to you.

307
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,524
You told Detective Baek the exact spot.

308
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,653
How could you be so bold?
I couldn't have done it if it were me.

309
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,322
I guess you have to be bold to succeed.

310
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,740
Welcome home.

311
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,950
Hey, Bo-ra.

312
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,330
What's with your outfits?

313
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,999
Did you really go around
dressed like that?

314
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,501
We had a field day.

315
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,547
What's wrong with our clothes?

316
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,924
This is nice, isn't it?

317
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,760
Don't I look cool?

318
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,512
I'm white and he's blue.

319
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,598
We look cool.

320
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,313
Where did I put the key?

321
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,401
My goodness…

322
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,779
I've been so forgetful lately.

323
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,083
Day 10,896.

324
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,837
Today is field day.

325
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,965
THE 1ST…

326
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,343
Ten years ago,
when Professor Jung came to the village,

327
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,806
he wanted to open a school
and have field days.

328
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,145
"Exercise for the dead?"

329
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,482
"He's such an overeager
and boisterous guy."

330
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,067
That's what I thought.

331
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,487
-Come on.
-It needs to be wider.

332
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,323
THE 3RD COMPLEX 3 FIELD DAY

333
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,033
You're so bad at this.

334
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,119
Go, Hyeon-ji!

335
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,080
-Go, Hyeon-ji!
-Let's go!

336
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,458
Hyeon-ji!

337
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,841
THE 5TH MUJIGAE FIELD DAY

338
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,384
THE 6TH MUJIGAE FIELD DAY

339
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,470
-Did you tie it up?
-Yes. And you?

340
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,138
All done.

341
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,140
Slowly.

342
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,685
THE 8TH MUJIGAE BRANCH SCHOOL
EXCITING FIELD DAY

343
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,437
Be careful.

344
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,939
Where are you going?

345
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,523
-We went too far.
-Okay.

346
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,192
-Hey, don't push.
-All right.

347
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,693
-Come on!
-Just a bit.

348
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,195
It's the tenth event already.

349
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,238
TEAM BLUE, TEAM WHITE

350
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,989
It is now the biggest festival

351
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,283
of the year in the village.

352
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,577
Had they been alive,

353
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,996
they would have attended high school

354
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,249
and gone to college by now.

355
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,793
Watching them

356
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,170
makes me happy and sad.

357
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,838
It makes me smile,

358
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,007
but it's also heartbreaking.

359
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,927
Those beautiful flowers…

360
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,722
They were cut down
before they could even bloom.

361
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,102
People say heaven
can't exist without kids.

362
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,897
But these kids shouldn't have been here

363
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,234
even if that may make this place hell.

364
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,154
They should have never come here.

365
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,827
And…

366
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,830
our Ro-ha…

367
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,917
The lonely boy
who came here eight years ago,

368
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,255
left today as everyone clapped for him.

369
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,968
He used to eat two bowls of rice

370
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,220
saying he wants to grow strong.

371
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,265
And he ended up winning first place.

372
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,686
I'm so happy that he left like that.

373
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,690
And I'm also grateful to the people

374
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,526
who found him.

375
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,902
I'm just so grateful.

376
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,280
Ro-ha.

377
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,574
Next time,

378
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,828
be born in a world where there are

379
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,955
only good adults.

380
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,226
Would this send Ro-ha to a better place?

381
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:38,982
Want to do it?

382
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,862
LEE RO-HA, 9 YEARS OLD
BORN ON OCTOBER 3, 2006…

383
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,864
No.

384
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,324
Just light it up.

385
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,966
You must've been so lonely and scared.

386
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,718
You rascal.

387
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,950
Goodbye, Ro-ha.

388
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,078
Goodbye, Ro-ha.

389
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,044
Burn all the bad memories.

390
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,799
Let's pray that he forgets them all
and is set free.

391
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,027
I'm heading in.

392
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:18,999
FROM: PO BOX 90 7107, SEONGJU POST OFFICE
SEONGJU-SI, GYEONGGI-DO

393
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,960
Did you upset him again?

394
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,545
I didn't.

395
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,589
It's clear that you did.

396
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,470
Yes?

397
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,440
Why aren't you asleep yet?

398
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,944
What are you doing tomorrow?
It's Saturday.

399
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,155
Tomorrow? Why?

400
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,700
Now that Mom is out…

401
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,370
Can we go see Mom tomorrow?

402
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,290
We could eat something delicious.

403
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,670
Never mind if you're busy.

404
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,839
I'll just ask Detective Shin
to give me a ride.

405
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,134
You always go for him.

406
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,844
I can go.

407
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,721
Let's go eat something good then.

408
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,639
I'm going.

409
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,100
Look at the time.

410
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,644
Go to bed now.

411
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,985
Yes!

412
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,765
The doll!

413
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,687
Choi Young-bae.

414
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,190
When Alice disappeared this afternoon,

415
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,151
we searched around the lake
and found a boat.

416
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,528
She was inside the boat.

417
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,613
Who did you play with on the boat?

418
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,408
I played with the fish.

419
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,868
Then, that time…

420
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,038
How did he get out?

421
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,417
He said he could never come out.

422
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,761
Hurry up, Dad!

423
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,263
Bo-ra.

424
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,180
Here.

425
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,311
A dash of color looks good.

426
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,104
It's so pretty.

427
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,152
Let's go.

428
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,528
Hey, wait!

429
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,571
Well…

430
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,075
Who's this?

431
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,369
Who are you?

432
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,704
It's me, Bo-ra.

433
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,415
-Are you two going on a date?
-No.

434
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,458
My mom's also coming.

435
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,628
A date?

436
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,464
Aren't you just going out to eat?

437
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,258
Wait.

438
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,385
Why are you so dressed up?

439
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,304
Aren't those the clothes I got for you?

440
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,307
We're just going out to eat.

441
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,516
It's the same thing.

442
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,268
Whatever it is.

443
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,644
Have fun. Go now.

444
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,229
-Let's go.
-We'll see you later.

445
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,856
-Okay.
-Bye.

446
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,316
Come home early!

447
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,028
Go on.

448
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,828
You don't like it?

449
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,705
Wook eating with another woman?

450
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,166
Don't be so temperamental.

451
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,835
Not only that…

452
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,922
Lee Dong-min…

453
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,008
He sent letters to Wook from prison.

454
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,969
He sent one every month
for ten months now.

455
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,471
What did he say?

456
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,515
All kinds of nonsense.

457
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,226
There was nothing special,
but I have a bad feeling.

458
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,020
Why did he send those letters?

459
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,689
And why didn't Wook tell us about them?

460
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,775
Probably because
he didn't want us to worry.

461
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,611
You know he never talks about himself.

462
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,783
What if he's planning something
inside the prison?

463
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,244
That's what I'm worried about too.

464
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,122
Don't be.

465
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,957
You're a lot prettier.

466
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,084
What?

467
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,711
You're prettier.

468
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,057
Are you two each other's first love?

469
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,019
Why do you want to know that?

470
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,062
She was for me.

471
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,106
I wasn't for you?

472
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,859
I just…

473
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,114
You were too.

474
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,159
It's my first time
seeing you look embarrassed.

475
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,536
Oh, right.

476
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,997
Did you know
that your nickname is Mr. Perfect?

477
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,165
Bo-ra.

478
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,126
Why am I Mr. Perfect?

479
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,587
Because you're so handsome.

480
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,422
Mr. Perfect.

481
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,591
So I made it clear to my friends.

482
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,762
That I'm pretty because I take after you.

483
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,181
What are you talking about?
You take after me.

484
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,432
You're my daughter.

485
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,558
I don't.

486
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,644
Look. Our double eyelids,
high nose, and small face.

487
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,315
What's with you two?

488
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,443
Bo-ra said that to me when we first met.

489
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,653
I don't know where she got it from.

490
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,322
I told you, I got it from you.

491
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,532
Mom, when Dad and I first met,

492
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,701
he kept denying that he was my dad.

493
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,829
He's the one in the picture
but said he wasn't my dad.

494
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,792
He's not.

495
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:59,047
-What?
-Don't speak with your mouth full.

496
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,216
Let's eat, then go for dessert.

497
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,467
Okay.

498
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:13,937
Where's Bo-ra?

499
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,355
The restroom.

500
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,273
She's so excited right now.

501
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,983
She ate more than she usually does.

502
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,905
Why did you do that earlier?

503
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,616
The first love thing?

504
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,536
It wasn't a lie.

505
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,913
But you dumped me though.

506
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,081
Not that.

507
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,126
Letting Bo-ra call you Dad.
And her saying that she takes after you.

508
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,758
Now that I think about it,
she does take after me.

509
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,885
Stop joking your way out.

510
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,221
You haven't changed a bit.

511
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,934
I told her that I wasn't her dad.

512
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,477
She just doesn't believe me.

513
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,648
There must be a reason
why she believes that.

514
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,026
She just misunderstood.

515
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,862
I'll talk to her.

516
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,700
I didn't have the chance to tell her
at the hospital with the cops and all.

517
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,118
Do it later.

518
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,120
She's going through
a tough time right now.

519
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,586
I'll find a house
and take her as soon as I can.

520
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,089
Thank you for taking
such good care of her.

521
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,675
I know you're doing this for Bo-ra,

522
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,346
but if this goes on any longer,
it could hurt her more.

523
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,140
And me too.

524
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,776
Bo-ra, are you okay?

525
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,987
I thought you were eating too much.

526
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,822
I'm not sick.

527
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,949
Let's go have dessert now.

528
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:50,867
Wait.

529
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,799
Captain!

530
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,930
Captain.

531
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,557
Captain!

532
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,188
Scanning.

533
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,024
Scanning.

534
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,275
Scanning.

535
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,321
Were you looking for me, Captain Kang?

536
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,948
Hey, Hye-ju.

537
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,158
Could you stay here
with Alice for a while?

538
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,284
I'll be right back.

539
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,827
Sure.

540
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,510
Detective Goh, are you home?

541
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,096
Detective Goh!

542
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,351
Yes?

543
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,436
So you were home. Let's talk inside.

544
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,695
What's wrong?

545
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,363
Well…

546
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,990
When we had the field day,

547
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,700
someone broke into my home.

548
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,326
Broke in?

549
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,495
Was anything taken?

550
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,289
A doll that was in my room.

551
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,458
A doll?

552
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:23,960
Then do you think…

553
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:25,878
a kid did it?

554
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,255
It's not a kid.

555
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,757
I know who stole it.

556
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,010
Please catch him for me.

557
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,555
You're a police officer,
so you can handle this, right?

558
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,141
I saw that you had a gun too.

559
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,477
So who did it?

560
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,731
Before I tell you…

561
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,150
I'd like you to

562
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,110
keep quiet about this.

563
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,030
I don't want the villagers to know

564
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,740
and worry about it.

565
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,825
The kids will be scared too.

566
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,828
I'll be careful.

567
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,830
So who did it?

568
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,790
Choi Young-bae.

569
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,835
He's a bad man
who does nasty things to kids.

570
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,383
He's a lot taller than you

571
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,509
and has a thin face.

572
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,845
His eyes are bleary

573
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,138
like those of rotten fish.

574
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,682
He never looks people in the eyes.

575
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,894
If you see anyone that you don't know

576
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,813
who wasn't at the field day,
just catch them.

577
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,650
If he's a child molester,

578
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,488
then he could be hiding near the school
or other places that kids go often.

579
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,907
Which is why you need
to catch him quickly.

580
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,367
Okay.

581
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,582
Il-yong!

582
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,007
Where is he going?

583
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,243
FALLING DEBRIS
DO NOT ENTER

584
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,249
Are you sure this is the right place?

585
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,583
The movie theater is that way.

586
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,836
I'll go with Hye-yeong after her academy.

587
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,130
All right.

588
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,756
Then have fun at the movies.

589
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,049
Don't come home too late.

590
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,470
Why are you smiling?

591
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,472
Because I'm happy.

592
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,558
I had a meal with my mom and dad.

593
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,268
Our first family outing together.

594
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,481
Then enjoy your movie
and I'll see you at home.

595
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,233
Okay.

596
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,068
-See you.
-Have fun.

597
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,545
Excuse me.

598
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,128
There's no way Pil-jung
would come to this place.

599
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,245
What are you doing here?

600
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,287
You startled me.

601
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,748
What are you doing here, Mr. Jung?

602
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,542
I was weeding.

603
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,502
And you?

604
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,796
I was patrolling the area.

605
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,798
To make sure that the school zone is safe.

606
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,341
By the way…

607
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,678
Have you seen anyone
suspicious around here?

608
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,805
Anyone suspicious?

609
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,475
Right now,

610
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,645
you're the most suspicious one here.

611
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,563
Me?

612
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,400
Did Captain Kang put you up to this?

613
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,528
Or is it because you
became fond of the kids?

614
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,862
Like Ro-ha?

615
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,198
Something like that.

616
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,409
Or not exactly.

617
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,578
Continue with your patrolling.

618
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:14,125
While you're at it,
make sure the kids get home safe.

619
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,169
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

620
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,841
-Sorry?
-I also patrol the area around this time.

621
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,261
You never know what can happen to kids.

622
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,889
This is my weapon.

623
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,851
Good luck.

624
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:32,893
I'll see you later.

625
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,275
You want to ask Ha-yun about it?

626
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,192
Yes.

627
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,155
I think she remembers
what happened quite clearly.

628
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:48,576
She may not know who the woman is
but if we ask her what she saw,

629
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,078
we might find a clue.

630
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:55,041
I considered that too,
but I didn't want to scare her.

631
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,918
Why don't we create
a comfortable environment first,

632
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,712
then ask her in a roundabout way?

633
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,590
You're close to Ha-yun.

634
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,469
Okay.

635
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,179
Well…

636
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,347
anything else?

637
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,432
Like what?

638
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,517
How did the date with Bo-ra's mom go?

639
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,227
Did anyone try to bother you?

640
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,980
It wasn't a date.
We just had a meal together.

641
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,024
Dressed up like this?

642
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,318
What do you mean?
I'm always dressed like this.

643
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,527
Sure.

644
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,862
Goodness.

645
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,698
My goodness.

646
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,658
You're napping too long.

647
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,243
You won't get much sleep tonight.

648
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,244
It's me, Wook!

649
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,121
What were you doing in there?

650
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,251
I was thirsty and just wanted a drink.

651
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,337
And there was no one here.

652
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,131
I thought it was a burglar.

653
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,508
Why were you so surprised?

654
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,343
I thought you were a burglar.

655
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,095
Are you here alone?

656
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,180
Where's Mr. Jang?

657
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,933
We came together
but he went to see Mr. Jung.

658
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,811
To get Ha-yun and Yeong-rim's
school records.

659
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,149
Well…

660
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,233
were you on a date?

661
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,318
Come on! Why does everyone
say it was a date?

662
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,528
It was just a meal.

663
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,656
So it was a date.

664
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,075
I'll get you a drink.

665
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,995
Barley tea, please.

666
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,207
Ha-yun and Yeong-rim.

667
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,377
Here are their school records
for ten years.

668
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,713
Eun-hee did a good job of keeping records.

669
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,714
Thank you.

670
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,883
Sorry for making you stay late.

671
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,345
No one's home waiting for me anyway.

672
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,555
-Let's go.
-Okay.

673
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,226
Don't you want to see your family?

674
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,062
You never talk about them.

675
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,107
I think I heard more about Hyeon-ji
than I did about you.

676
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:29,236
Hyeon-ji was a star around here.

677
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,282
You remind me of her whenever I see you.

678
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,159
I miss her a lot.

679
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,287
She must be so happy to know
that everyone loves her.

680
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,414
Isn't it surprising?

681
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:45,211
That even the dead can make memories
and miss each other.

682
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,379
Yes.

683
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,091
Aren't you tired of this place?
You've been here for so long.

684
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,221
Want to know something funny?

685
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,764
Here…

686
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,349
The death rate

687
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,892
is zero.

688
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,645
Because you can't die again.

689
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,231
Right.

690
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,025
I'm going this way.

691
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,152
You missed your street.

692
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,279
Goodbye.

693
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,115
Get home safe.

694
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,262
Look at this.

695
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,972
It's way bigger than mine.

696
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,432
This is definitely a man's footprint.

697
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,456
Who's there?
I know you're there. Come out.

698
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,299
My goodness!

699
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,428
What are you doing here?

700
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,930
I was just…

701
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,725
Never mind.

702
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,560
Anyway…

703
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,022
There's nothing over there.

704
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,190
Why are you coming from there?

705
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,403
I was just

706
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,614
taking a walk,

707
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,532
organizing my thoughts and stuff…

708
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,577
Wait.

709
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:43,996
Are those handcuffs?

710
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,001
Did something happen in the village?

711
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,796
What's taking him so long?

712
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,882
Is he writing out the records himself?

713
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:56,967
Ms. Ahn.

714
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,137
Ha-yun disappeared.

715
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,180
What?

716
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,474
She went to Yeong-rim's place a while ago

717
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,976
and when I went to get her after sundown,
she wasn't there.

718
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,436
When did she leave?

719
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,021
Are Ha-yun's belongings still there?

720
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,439
Yes, they're all there.

721
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,525
She left before sunset, so around 5 p.m.

722
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,279
What's this about? Who disappeared?

723
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,530
Ha-yun.

724
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,949
We have to search quickly.

725
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,326
It's Choi Young-bae's doing!

726
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,203
Who?

727
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,412
Choi Young-bae!

728
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,252
Ha-yun.

729
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,380
You must have been so scared.

730
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,967
I went to get water
because you said you were thirsty.

731
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,137
But I couldn't get it.

732
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,434
But I brought a doll for you.

733
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,241
I'm sure he went this way.

734
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,201
Where did he go?

735
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,372
Il-yong and I'll go to the lake.

736
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,542
Detective Goh, you gather the villagers
and check every corner.

737
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,336
-Okay.
-I'll go let Mr. Jung know.

738
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,337
Okay. Let's go.

739
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,965
No, you should stay with Alice.

740
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,216
No, take me with you.

741
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,969
Hye-ju, take Alice and stay with Mr. Jung.

742
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,470
There's no time for this.

743
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,471
Let's go.

744
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:34,982
Ha-yun.

745
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,193
You bastard!

746
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,283
You punk!

747
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,081
After Alice disappeared before,

748
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,459
I was too focused on her

749
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,377
that I didn't pay attention to Ha-yun.

750
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,547
I should have kept her with me.

751
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,090
It wasn't your fault.

752
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,967
You bastard!

753
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,677
Did you hear that?

754
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,564
What's your deal?

755
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,358
You bastard!

756
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,235
You punk!

757
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,236
You piece of trash!

758
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,422
Don't get in my way!

759
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,468
Are you okay?

760
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,097
Who the hell are you?

761
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,265
Ha-yun!

762
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,518
My goodness, sweetie!

763
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,394
What's all this?

764
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,522
You're safe now.

765
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,940
Are you hurt?

766
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,484
Sweetie, were you scared?

767
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,903
Sang-cheol, hurry!

768
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,826
How did you know to come here?

769
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,079
I followed that footprint we saw.

770
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,372
The footprint?

771
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,669
Why did you come here alone?
You could have been in danger.

772
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,295
My goodness…

773
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,922
Are you hurt anywhere?

774
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,715
I'm fine. I'm just worried about her.

775
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,929
You bastard! You deserve to die!

776
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,472
That piece of trash.

777
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,351
Sweetie…

778
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,144
You should take her away.

779
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,145
Okay.

780
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,355
Can you stand up?

781
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,606
There we go.

782
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,990
What should we do with him?

783
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,616
We have to get rid of him!

784
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,036
I'll take care of this.

785
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,164
Okay, you do that then.
You have your gun, right?

786
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,006
Weigh him down with rocks
and throw him in the lake.

787
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,258
Or dig a hole and bury him.

788
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,427
So that he can never get back out.

789
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,804
I should have done that 15 years ago.

790
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,309
You're not really going to do that,
are you?

791
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,060
There's no reason why I shouldn't!

792
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,064
Even death is too good
for the likes of you!

793
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,858
You're right.

794
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,490
Did you hear that?

795
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,076
No.

796
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,335
Come on. Hurry up.

797
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,171
Hold him tight.

798
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,548
Let go of me.

799
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,966
Stay still.

800
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,177
-Tie him up.
-Let go.

801
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,346
Let me go!

802
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,805
I said, let go!

803
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:54,848
Shut up!

804
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,642
In here

805
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,061
there's no need for Miranda rights.

806
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,438
There's no need to even consider
human rights for scum like you.

807
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,606
Why not?

808
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,900
I came here
because I was wrongfully killed too.

809
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,318
What did you say?

810
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,153
You damn…

811
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,618
A piece of trash like you
and people here are different.

812
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,371
What's so different?

813
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,289
You really have to ask?

814
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,543
I don't want to talk long
with scum like you,

815
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,420
so just answer my questions.

816
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,883
Who killed you?

817
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,345
What?

818
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,264
He came here 15 years ago?

819
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,141
Yes.

820
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,352
Where has he been all these years?

821
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,187
I never saw him once.

822
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,649
He kept doing nasty things
to Ha-yun back then.

823
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:49,152
So Comrade Jeong and I
took him to the island and left him there.

824
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,157
Don't even think about coming back.

825
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,327
You brought this on yourself
so don't blame anybody else.

826
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,745
If you're lucky,

827
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,665
you might get to disappear someday.

828
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,590
You can't leave me in a place like this!

829
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,219
How dare you say that, you piece of trash!

830
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,804
How could you do that?

831
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,432
No need to answer him.

832
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,433
Let's go.

833
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,817
He can't possibly
swim out of there, can he?

834
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,278
He doesn't know how to swim, remember?

835
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,029
And over this long distance?

836
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,072
You're right.

837
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,825
The water is also deep.

838
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,411
He won't get out of there alive,
so don't worry.

839
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,663
What if he does, dead?

840
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,583
You can't die here as you wish.

841
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,461
I doubt it will happen,

842
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,671
but if he does return to the village,

843
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,757
I'll find another way to exile him.

844
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,175
So just trust me.

845
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:54,760
Okay.

846
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:56,887
Comrade Jeong.

847
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,765
You have to row the other way.

848
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,933
We have to go in that direction.

849
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:08,273
So that's why the boat was on land.

850
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,816
Still, look what happened.

851
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,361
He came back and did more bad things.

852
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,782
I'm so sick of this place.

853
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,951
No matter how hard we try,
it all ends up being useless.

854
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,329
You can't run away.

855
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,497
And you can't even die.

856
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,375
How can he be put here with innocent kids?

857
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,461
Aren't we all just…

858
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,714
some mice in a trap?

859
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,137
Captain Kang.

860
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,934
It must have been hard
handling this on your own.

861
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,271
It wasn't me.

862
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,982
Ha-yun went through a lot.

863
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,696
I should go and find Choi Young-bae first.

864
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,406
That way the kids will be safe.

865
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,450
But he died 15 years ago.

866
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,327
Finding him won't be easy.

867
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,622
We found Eun-hee
and she was missing for 20 years.

868
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,457
Hey.

869
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,835
Wook found out something.

870
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,549
About that bastard,

871
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,676
his wife killed him.

872
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,471
He kept trying to escape from the island

873
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,224
and sank deep into the lake
a few days ago.

874
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,226
When he woke up, he was there.

875
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:27,894
You mean…

876
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,897
Did he go all the way to the end
and come back?

877
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,859
Anyway, let's send him away
for good this time.

878
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,194
If you find the address,
I'll follow her around.

879
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,904
I'll see if there's useful information.

880
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,197
That's a good idea.

881
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,282
Then what do I do?

882
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,075
You have a lot to do.

883
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,369
You're already looking after
the store and Alice.

884
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,454
You also have to make snacks for the kids.

885
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,290
We'll take care of him.

886
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:49,875
You just relax.

887
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,044
He's right. Detective Goh will watch him

888
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,422
and Mr. Jung will guard the kids.

889
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,424
You also have Il-yong and me.

890
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,760
Comrade Jeong is not the only one
who can help you.

891
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:04,556
We're all a big family here, remember?

892
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,724
He's right.

893
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,601
I'll take on more responsibility,

894
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,811
so please get some rest this time.

895
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,565
I didn't do anything that needed rest.

896
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:17,652
You tried to throw that flower pot earlier
because of him, right?

897
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,655
I knew it.

898
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,867
I could tell you were angry,
the way you were holding it.

899
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,371
Sorry about that.

900
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,706
My goodness…

901
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,416
Thank you so much, everyone.

902
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,376
There's no need.

903
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,003
Let's hurry, Wook.

904
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,504
Okay.

905
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,048
-See you later.
-Bye.

906
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,885
Choi Young-bae.

907
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,845
Born in 1963.

908
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,556
He was 45 years old, 15 years ago.

909
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,976
He was never reported missing
and he has no criminal record.

910
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,853
He has a wife named Cho Yu-seon,

911
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,397
and a daughter named Choi Eun-su
who turned 20 this year.

912
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,484
They've been living in the same
apartment for the past 18 years.

913
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,153
It's under Choi Young-bae's name.

914
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,781
So they'd been living there
before he died.

915
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,616
And they haven't moved.

916
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,493
I think so.

917
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,038
What could he have done
for his wife to kill him?

918
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,750
From what he did in the village,
he's a clear pervert.

919
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,043
Maybe that's why.

920
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,505
What does the wife do?

921
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,799
She's just ordinary.
She was never even fined.

922
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,803
Up until three months ago,
she was under employee health insurance.

923
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,429
But I think she quit her job now.

924
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,317
What's that?

925
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,652
What are you drinking?

926
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,947
I heard it's good for joints.
The pain comes with the job.

927
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,410
My knees have been acting up too.

928
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,494
Hey!

929
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,710
Fine, I'll make an exception for you.

930
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,129
Stay healthy and strong.

931
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,089
Yes, ma'am.

932
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,303
Where are you going?

933
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,140
To check out Choi Young-bae's home.

934
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,883
He can't go out that way.

935
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,364
Choi Young-bae was an infamous pervert.

936
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,534
Hey, Detective Goh.

937
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,369
Has Il-yong been here?

938
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,830
No.

939
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,458
Detective Goh, about Choi Young-bae…

940
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,212
How rude! I was still talking to him.

941
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,756
Why is he looking for Il-yong?

942
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:25,673
I don't know.

943
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,537
Ms. Cho Yu-seon?

944
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,081
Who are you?

945
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,376
I need to ask you some questions
about Choi Young-bae.

946
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,838
He…

947
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,714
left 15 years ago.

948
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:07,966
I know.

949
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,677
I also know what kind of a man he was

950
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,888
and where he went.

951
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,414
Who keeps blocking here?

952
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,757
Do you think she'll tell us
where Choi Young-bae's body is?

953
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,428
She said she'll think about it.

954
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,679
So we'll have to wait.

955
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,267
Thank you.

956
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:00,852
For what?

957
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,272
For taking care of the things
I couldn't do anything about

958
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:05,982
but just watch.

959
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,984
You're doing it too.

960
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,696
You're doing things
that other villagers can't.

961
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,115
So let's just leave it at that.

962
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,286
Give me that. I'll get more.

963
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,537
It's all right.

964
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,208
Goodness…

965
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,964
Captain Kang, there's big trouble.

966
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,674
What now? What happened?

967
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,551
Detective Goh came

968
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,012
and told me
that he saw Il-yong leave the village.

969
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,806
-So what happened?
-What do you think?

970
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,144
Oh, my…

971
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,855
Mr. Jang was here.

972
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,566
Yes, I was getting tea.

973
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,235
It's all right.

974
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,028
He knows everything.

975
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,823
He does?

976
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,618
Yes. I found out by chance.

977
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,203
So where is Detective Goh?

978
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,413
He went after Il-yong.

979
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,124
You should have pretended not to know!

980
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,926
You're back.

981
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,394
Detective Goh.

982
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:32,569
He came to the school and asked me,
so I denied it.

983
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,736
But he wouldn't believe me.

984
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,491
He said he'll catch him in the act,
so I came right away to get you.

985
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,786
If the others find out
that Il-yong can come and go,

986
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,371
we'll have trouble on our hands.

987
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:46,082
Wouldn't it be better now
to just explain to him?

988
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,167
No. They must not meet.

989
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,377
-Hurry up and go.
-Okay.

990
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,422
You two…

991
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,883
Where did you come from?

992
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,636
How did you leave here?

993
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,978
Sang-cheol…

994
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,438
What happened was that--

995
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,897
Look.

996
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,567
If you're going to
lie again like yesterday,

997
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,402
just shut up.

998
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,739
You may have fooled the others,

999
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,741
but you can't fool me.

1000
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,245
Detective Goh, calm down for now.

1001
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,747
Let Il-yong talk first, okay?

1002
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,499
Don't come near me.

1003
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,461
Put the gun down, Detective Goh.

1004
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,378
Put it down.

1005
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,840
Answer my question truthfully.

1006
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:40,928
You two…

1007
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,016
are not dead, are you?

1008
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,039
Il-yong

1009
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,499
is dead.

1010
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,503
Like you, Detective Goh.

1011
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,089
And…

1012
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,633
-I--
-Wook.

1013
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,385
Look over there.

1014
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:27,600
I'm not dead.

1015
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,956
Who made this law?

1016
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,457
It's not fair.

1017
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,793
And Captain Kang knew all this?

1018
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,044
Just tell us.

1019
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,964
-You have news of your family, don't you?
-My goodness!

1020
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,842
But it seems that whether alive or dead,
there is no secret.

1021
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:04,137
From the start, Lee Dong-min
has been after you, Detective Shin.

1022
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,514
Just who are you tracking?

1023
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,975
I think he could be testing me.

1024
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,144
What are they planning?

1025
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,938
What I want to know is who "he" is.

1026
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,023
There's someone else.

1027
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:20,903
