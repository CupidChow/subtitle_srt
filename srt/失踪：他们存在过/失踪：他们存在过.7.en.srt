Do not enter

00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,506
Is there a cafe here?

4
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,756
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- I've never seen you before.

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,086
Are you really not dead?

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,656
Why do you keep asking me if I'm dead?

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,126
Everyone in this village is dead.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,996
I'm not going to stand still
when you spew nonsense.

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,620
If you're not going to stay still,
what are you going to do?

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,696
Only you and I can see that.
Aren't you curious why we can see it?

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,046
I'm not curious,
so you should stop being curious as well.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,616
What is this place?

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,786
Those who are dead but
are missing their bodies.

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,540
The missing dead stay
here before departing.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,846
W-Who are you?

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,366
This is a cafe that I run, Cafe Hawaii.,

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,796
I'm Thomas.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,796
This looks the same as my house.

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,496
That's because the objects in
your memory come with you.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,590
This is me.

21
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,326
My wife cherishes it like her own life.

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,776
It belongs to her?

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,266
To me, this is my everything.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,586
Yeo Na's light,

25
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,446
cannot light up that world.

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,376
You should at least have hope. Then,
there might be a miracle..

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,046
Do you think it's easier
for me not to have hope?

28
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,666
How long has it been since you came here?

29
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,966
When you were this small.

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,896
I don't want to do this either.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,066
The people in this town are
all like my Hyeon Ji to me.

32
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,140
I am sure my Hyeon Ji is waiting.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,486
You remember my mom, don't you?

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,376
She was there 27 years ago,
at that house. Kim Hyeon Mi.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,696
Jang Myeong Gyu
suffered from a strike and run

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,996
and Kim Nam Gook died
after a vehicle hit-and-run.

37
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,732
There is no relationship
between the two events, so

38
00:01:56,756 --> 00:01:58,426
the investigation will be
coming to a close soon.

39
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,076
The contents of the Chairwoman's
will are still confidential.

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,926
When the time comes,
it will all be revealed.

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,780
Memory Day? What is that?

42
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,606
It's an anniversary once
a year. A feast and holiday.

43
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,526
Wook's drink is an iced Americano.

44
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,436
- Is your name Wook?
- Choi Wook.

45
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,696
Why did they come here
when Nam Gook wasn't here?

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,876
- Did they come here to get you?
- I think so.

47
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,456
These guys were taking
some girl in their car by force.

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,046
We can find Choi Yeo Na too.

49
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,756
We don't have any evidence. No evidence!

50
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,986
I'm telling you that I'll do it.

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,776
Kim Su Yeon, daughter of Chairwoman Han,...

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
She was alone at home,
fell and hurt her head.

53
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:28,136
The cause of death
was excessive blood loss.

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,796
Where is Detective Park Yeong Ho,
the one who investigated the case?

55
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,446
He just disappeared, without a trace.

56
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,196
Where on earth is Mother Kim Hyeon Mi,
ID number 571025?

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,736
- The name of Wook's mom is Kim Hyeon Mi?
- Yes.

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,266
My mom abandoned me,
you see? When I was small.

59
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,776
But she couldn't recognize me!

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800

63

- For what?
- Because it's a special day.

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,036
The day when you want to remember
someone and to be remembered.

65
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,276

saw my Hyeon Ji, something like that.

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,196
After Kim Su Yeon died,
Housekeeper Kim Hyeon Mi and

180
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,520
Detective Park Yeong Ho went missing.

181
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,760
Doesn't something seem strange?

182
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,556
- Yeah, I think so too.
- What?

183
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,996
What you just said is
great. I agree with you.

184
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,170
Go home and sleep.

185
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,876
It's already time. I'll go
and get some shut eye.

186
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,076
- Aren't you going?
- You can go first.

187
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,270
You should also go.

188
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,056
Wait a minute,

189
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,750
Detective Sin,
you've been here throughout this time?

190
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,806
Did you stay up all night?

191
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,086
What if Kim Su Yeon
didn't die by missteping?

192
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,036
And Detective Park Yeong Ho found that out?

193
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,826
Aren't you looking for Choi Yeo Na?

194
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,096
What does Choi Yeo Na
have to do with Detective Park?

195
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,326
I think there is a connection.

196
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,106
Kim Su Yeon's death is a 27 year old case.

197
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,966
We've done the autopsy, and have confirmed
that she died due to a misstep and fall.

198
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,896
Even if that isn't the case,
the statue of limitations has passed.

199
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,626
Aren't you thinking a bit
too much? Go and rest.

200
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,696
Please just go home
already. Go get some sleep.

201
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,090
Yes, I was just about to. I'll call you.

202
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,050
Is he alright?

203
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,585
Yes Doctor,
this is Jun Ho. The DNA sample collected

204
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:35,936
during Jang Myeong Gyu
and Kim Nam Gook's autopsy,

205
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,280
No, not that. I had a favor to ask of you.

206
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,526
This is Lee Dong Min.

207
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm Detective Sin Jun Ho.

208
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,196
That's why nobody reported them missing.

209
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,980
Ah, there. Yes, I'll see you later.

210
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,596
There will be bust at Manager
Wang's cold storage today.

211
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,296
Go there and search the office.

212
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,950
I can't to it today. Postpone
it to some other day.

213
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,890
I can't. I only have time today.

214
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,990
Sunbae, are you busy today?

215
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,786
I was going to go with Dectective Park
to the place where Jang Mi used to work.

216
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,276
Perhaps if you have time,...

217
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,150
We're here from the Food and Drug
Administration. Where are the staff here?

218
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,466
What is it?

219
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,436
We've received a report that you're
reporting false origins of your products.

220
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,916
What are the times we are living in?

221
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,336
We don't do that sort of thing
anymore. Who exactly reported this?

222
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,327
We received an anonymous report.

223
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:13,500
-Wait a minute
-What is this?

224
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,966
This is a violation of Rule 6 in the
report of agricultural and marine products.

225
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,406
The person in charge should come with us.

226
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,090
What happened!

227
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,256
Department Head Wang must be
very angry right about now, right?

228
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,846
Well, he'll probably just pay a fine
and be done. Going somewhere?

229
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,776
I have someone to meet. I'll be right back.

230
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,036
Sure.

231
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,026
Try eating this.

232
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:04,430
Look at these! I brought
snacks to give you.

233
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,866
Why do you keep visiting?

234
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,370
Ahjussi said I can come whenever I want.

235
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,506
Why do you keep wandering around?
You're supposed to be running the pawnshop.

236
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,066
Did I tell you sales have
increased after I took over?

237
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,596
Hyung! Let's play together.

238
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,126
How long are you gonna be here, Oppa?

239
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,516
It's because you're
here that I keep coming.

240
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,836
Let's play together.

241
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,096
Leave. Leave!

242
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,636
Not right now.

243
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,636
You can't right now?

244
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,296
Ahjussi said I can't, so why can't you?

245
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,830
No, I'm not talking to you, Jjong Ah.

246
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,546
What the hell? Who are you talking to?

247
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,730
Is there a wild boar?

248
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,816
Why are you here?

249
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,446
Why didn't you tell me that you
were looking for your mother?

250
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,996
What are you talking about? Who says?

251
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,960
- You.
- Me?

252
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,330
That's today.

253
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,536
Aren't you trying to meet
Chairman Han there?

254
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,816
You asked me about her last time, too.

255
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,166
It's because of you mom, right?

256
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,306
Do you hack my the insides of my head, too?

257
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,616
Not hacking. Anyone could tell.

258
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,856
I'm telling you again,
but do everything together from now on.

259
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,466
This is something personal.

260
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,716
Why would you work
hard looking for your mom?

261
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,680
If it was about my mom,
would you ignore it?

262
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,656
If it's your mother,
she's family to me too.

263
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,656
Also, my pride is on the line, too.

264
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,676
Pride?

265
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,106
Choi Yeo Na and your mother both.

266
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,776
I'm looking hard,
but I can't find any evidence.

267
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,416
There's never been a time I haven't
been able to find something for this long.

268
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,896
Do you know how I've been feeling lately?

269
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,728
I feel like I'm looking
for a ghost that

270
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:19,930
doesn't exist in this
world. I feel defeated.

271
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,490
Jong Ah, if it's something you can't find,
it must not exist in this world.

272
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,700
Since you're the best.

273
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,946
The best?

274
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,196
What are you doing? You're
going to be late at this rate.

275
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,316
Ahjussi, nice style.

276
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,067
Does it look okay?

277
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,636
What concept are you going for today?

278
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,990
Can't you tell? I'm a photographer.

279
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,076
Yea, we've made the entire plan.

280
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,976
What is it with you two? Did you
lend him some money or something?

281
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,957
What?

282
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,626
- President Lee, are you rich?
- Huh?

283
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,310
Let's hurry up and go.

284
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,206
[Jang Oh Foods]

285
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,706
Ahjussi, if you film with this,
I can see it real time on the computers.

286
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,356
We'll follow Chairman Han,
so you just wait until we're ready.

287
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,346
We're not even filming a spy movie,

288
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,306
It's so hard to meet the
Chairman of a corporation.

289
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,250
Let's go. Go!

290
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,310
Good luck!

291
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,306
Jang Pan Seok

292
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,160
- You've been verified.
- Thank you.

293
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,806
Can you see it?

294
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,560
Ahjussi, can you zoom in a bit?

295
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,946
Good.

296
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,356
There is a North Korean saying that states

297
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,966
a stream that runs long enough
can puncture a hole through stone.

298
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,416
It means that nothing is
impossible if you put in the effort,

299
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,666
but my mother passed away without
being able to visit her home town.

300
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,611
Someday,
a day will come when the stone blocking

301
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:32,280
the South from the
North will be punctured.

302
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,176
Chairman Han had a
daughter named Kim Su Yeon.

303
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,876
She died 27 years ago.

304
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,576
It's around the same time
your mother passed away.

305
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,346
Kim Su Yeon died,

306
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,576
and my mom went
missing two days after that.

307
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,376
How are the two related?

308
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,660
Chairman Han is leaving. Wook,
you need to move.

309
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,690
Okay.

310
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,110
Chairman Han!

311
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,950
A suspicious person is moving
towards the VIP area. Please check.

312
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,046
Chairman Han! Who will get
the inheritance to your home?

313
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,746
Over here!

314
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,916
No, over here! Please look here!

315
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,706
I'll help you inside.

316
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,076
The Chairman is leaving.

317
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,806
I want to ask!

318
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,726
Let go!

319
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,676
Yes!

320
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,570
Okay! Nice acting, Ahjussi.

321
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,980
Chairman Han! Chairman Han!

322
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,840
Where did she go?

323
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,476
You, over there.

324
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,540
You guys hurry up and look for her!

325
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,340
Please have a seat.

326
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,266
You're not part of the staff.

327
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,406
No. I apologize for approaching
you so rudely ever time.

328
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,450
The secretary's office
would not let me meet you.

329
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,156
What's wrong?

330
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,726
What is this?

331
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,886
I've looked through the office,
freezers, and even the bathroom

332
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,306
There's nothing.

333
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,626
Okay, I understand.

334
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,530
Thank you.

335
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,526
Yes, this is the secretary's office.

336
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,096
What? The Chairman?

337
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,946
Yes, I understand.

338
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,676
Is something wrong?

339
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,726
If you know it's rude,

340
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,300
why are you trying so hard to meet me?

341
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,296
27 years ago,

342
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,776
my mother was your maid.

343
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,326
Do you remember

344
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,686
a Kim Hyeon Mi?
- I mean,

345
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,456
you trapped me in here
to ask that? Why now?

346
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,496
I only recently found out.

347
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,560
Auntie Su Yeon-

348
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,960
I mean,
a few days after your daughter died,

349
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,956
my mother disappeared.

350
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,060
To be exact, she died.

351
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,220
She died?

352
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,640
Chairman Han.

353
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,490
Chairman, are you inside?

354
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,546
Yes.

355
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,736
Oppa, security is right outside your door.

356
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,666
Oppa! Wook Oppa!

357
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,076
He must've turned off the earphone earlier.

358
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,406
This won't do.

359
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,010
Ahjussi, come to the parking lot.

360
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,380
- I've got it.
- Open it quickly.

361
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,286
Chairman, are you okay?

362
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,716
I'm fine.

363
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,456
It was so loud, I wanted to momentarily
hide, but the door locked from the inside.

364
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,750
Nothing happened. Let's go.

365
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,366
Do you really know nothing

366
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,556
about why my mother died?

367
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,766
As you're aware,
Su Yeon was in an accident.

368
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,616
Her daughter... died in an accident?

369
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,080
At the time,
things were budy at work, so I

370
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:39,736
didn't have the mind to
focus on someone else.

371
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,200
That's why Choi Seung Construction
is as successful as it is today.

372
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,096
Then other than my mother

373
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,790
did anyone else work at your home?

374
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,496
Why do you want to know that? I'm
more curious as to why you want to know.

375
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,516
My mother's death... may have
something to you with your household.

376
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,980
Including you, Chairman.

377
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,586
Though what happened to
your mother is unforunate,

378
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,220
I'm not sure why the death of a
maid would have benefitted me.

379
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,550
The life of a maid is trivial?

380
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,346
How the death of my mother

381
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,660
must have helped you.

382
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,950
I guess I'll have to look into that.

383
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,500
Then, I'll be able to find the culprit.

384
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,730
Do whatever you'd like.

385
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,430
More than that,

386
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,986
did you call our Su Yeon auntie?

387
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,920
What about it?

388
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,556
Chairman!

389
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,686
Are you inside?

390
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,870
I think we'll meet again soon.

391
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,020
He's coming!

392
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,060
What the heck?

393
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,926
Goodness, how upsetting.

394
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,146
I think I'm getting surpassed by you.

395
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,186
- Shut up.
- Do you know how much we worried?

396
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,386
Why did you take out your earpiece?

397
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,706
Why did you two talk so much? I
took it out because you were so loud.

398
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,266
Did you meet Chairman
Han? What did she say?

399
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,036
Let's get going first.

400
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,536
Put on your belt.

401
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,540
Goodness...

402
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,026
Let's hear you.

403
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,396
Are you really okay?
What happened in there?

404
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,046
As you can see, nothing happened.

405
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,960
I heard you wanted to
meet about the car incident?

406
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,086
Yes. I won't beat around the bush.

407
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,896
Is it true that you're
looking for a grandchild?

408
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,676
For now, it's just a suspicion.
I'm not sure whether I have one.

409
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,980
If I do, of course I'd want to find them.

410
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,066
Jang Myeong Gyu and Kim Nam Gook

411
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,156
did not die in an accident,
but were killed,

412
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,360
for the reason that they
may be your grandchild.

413
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,556
There is one more person.

414
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,570
A child who survived
the fire at the orphanage.

415
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,100
She's currently missing.

416
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,856
They were killed because
they may be my grandchild?

417
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,826
That's what I suspect.

418
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,946
It seems like someone knew you
were searching for your bloodline,

419
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,790
and is committing murder.

420
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,556
Who would do such a thing?

421
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,446
Someone who knows you
are looking for you family,

422
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,776
some who may benefit if the family
you are looking for was not found,

423
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,746
or someone who holds a
personal grudge against you.

424
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,810
These are all possibilities.

425
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,636
Of the victims,

426
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,176
we will conduct a DNA test to
determine if they were part of your family.

427
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,580
I'm sure above all,
you will be curious about those results.

428
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,400
It'll overflow like that.

429
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,376
The man we saw on the hot-air
balloon on Remembrance Day.

430
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,936
Do you remember him?

431
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,386
Your fiance?

432
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,896
It's the second time he's come here.

433
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,966
I'm sure he came to look for me,

434
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,230
but how did he know I was here?

435
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,396
Power of love.

436
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,216
I'm sure his love for you drew him here.

437
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,808
How would I know why a
man I've never seen before

438
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:29,320
just happened to be
standing there on that day?

439
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,910
How is someone like me supposed to
stand watching you, when I'm so lonely.

440
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,236
Sometimes he's wise beyond his years,

441
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,480
but at other times he's childish...

442
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,966
- Doctor.
- Oh goodness!

443
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,986
Why are you so shocked?

444
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,906
I've been looking at bodies laying down all
day, and now I'm seeing a standing body-

445
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,360
I mean, a person. Of course I'd get
scared! I thought you were a zombie.

446
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,916
This is what I requested yesterday,
over the phone.

447
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,246
DNA test? I just need
to compare it with this?

448
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,936
Yes. When will the results come out?

449
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,176
Do you know you're the most impatient
of all the police in this country?

450
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,496
If I resign before my age of retirement,
it'll be because of you!

451
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,836
I really need it in a hurry.
Maybe... the day after tomorrow?

452
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,510
I don't know.

453
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,666
Okay, I'll let you know.

454
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,540
Thank you.

455
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,306
Wow!

456
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,056
This is all you've been playing with
these days. Did Thomas make it for you?

457
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,436
No. The other uncle.

458
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,290
- Which uncle?
- Bright as the sun Wook.

459
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,906
Bum Soo, what did you just say?

460
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,766
Bright as the sun Wook Hyung.

461
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,860
That's what Hyung said, to Noona.

462
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,516
You're not just Wook. You're
bright as the sun, Wook.

463
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,186
You'll brighten the entire world.

464
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,976
Bright as the sun-Wook?
Wow that's 5 characters!

465
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,840
My name is the longest!

466
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:22,920
Hyung didn't tell me that was a secret...

467
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:28,886
Wait, wait! Wook.

468
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,860
What's Wook's name? Is it really Choi Wook?

469
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,936
He told me it was Kim Wook.

470
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,026
On that day,
I did think it was a bit weird

471
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,280
he was Choi Wook. He lied about his age,
too.

472
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,320
Kim Wook?

473
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,810
By chance, do you know what
Chinese characters were used?

474
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,220
I'm not sure about that..

475
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:10,680
Oh, he said he wasn't any ordinary Wook,
but bright as the sun Wook.

476
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:17,070
Bright as the sun...

477
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,536
Are you okay?

478
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,730
What's wrong?

479
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,380
It's nothing.

480
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,250
I think it's best to just leave her be.

481
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,496
I thought there was no way...

482
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,636
When did you come?

483
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,196
Maybe when you were about wee big.

484
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,480
Why?

485
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,870
Was it really Wook?

486
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:15,310
Even then, he knew it all,
but acted like he didn't.

487
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,460
How can you do that?

488
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,326
How can you Wook all the way here, too!

489
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,810
What did my son do wrong?

490
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,310
I'm sorry...

491
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,240
Mom was wrong.

492
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:08,850
I'm sorry. Mom...

493
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,130
There was a place like this?

494
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,776
Jang Myeong Gyu and Kim
Nam Gook didn't die in an accident,

495
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,966
but were killed,

496
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,400
for the reason that they
may be your grandchild.

497
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,440
You dare... kill my bloodline?

498
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,336
Another thing.

499
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,886
After your daughter,
Kim Su Yeon, died 27 years ago,

500
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,134
two more people went
missing. They were both

501
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:47,606
individuals involved in
Choi Seung Construction.

502
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,066
A Detective who was investigating
Choi Seung at the same, Park Young Ho,

503
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,386
and your housemaid Kim Hyeon Mi.

504
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,396
Hyeon Mi?

505
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,396
My mother disappeared.

506
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,076
To be exact, she died.

507
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,236
Detective Park was investigating
Choi Seung's redevelopment plan.

508
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,076
I think he was also interested
in the death of your daughter.

509
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,096
The time of your maid's
disappearance is a bit strange as well.

510
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,206
What do you mean?

511
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,876
Why was he interested in Su Yeon's death?

512
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,793
It had been a long case,
and there aren't many

513
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:23,796
records left of Detective
Park's investigation,

514
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,616
so this is all I know so far.

515
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,606
But now, I plan to start investigating
the case from 27 years ago.

516
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,460
So I will need your help.

517
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,016
Are you sleeping?

518
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,776
No.

519
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,846
What did the Chairman say?
Does she remember your mother?

520
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,320
She does,

521
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:20,050
but doesn't know what happened to my mom.

522
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,920
Isn't it weird?

523
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:29,006
Someone killed my mother,

524
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,136
but isn't it strange that

525
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,006
it was a few days after
Chairman Han's daughter died?

526
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:40,606
Do you think your mom's death is
related to their daughter's death?

527
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:46,090
I think there must be.

528
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,466
I wish I could ask my mom.

529
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,896
Just ask her.

530
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,670
Not yet.

531
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:03,230
I'm not ready yet.

532
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,160
What is this place?

533
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,000
What are you doing?

534
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:26,050
You're here? As you can see,
I'm sharpening this blade.

535
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,686
Where are you going today?

536
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,966
I just met someone.

537
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,906
If you're meeting someone, I guess
you aren't going to look for a body.

538
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,946
You aren't even dressed
like a ginseng digger.

539
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,006
What is the bag for? What's inside?

540
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,236
Why are you so curious? You're not a child.

541
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,076
This is all interest and consideration.

542
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,026
Don't wait for me and eat.

543
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,550
Suspicious.

544
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,370
I don't have the time for this.

545
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,196
Welcome in, boss!

546
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,656
Turn down the music.

547
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,446
Okay.

548
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,896
No. I didn't promise.

549
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,590
Where is he going with that bag?

550
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,336
Oppa, call me later.

551
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,146
Noona, I promoted our store today.

552
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,356
Then, we got ten customers!

553
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,836
On top of that, I got 7 cases.

554
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,216
What if we open a second location
and I become the manager there?

555
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,126
Are you going to become the owner of a
pawnshop instead of debuting as an idol?

556
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,746
If you forget about your trainee dreams,
I'll cut you!

557
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,336
Practice.

558
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,110
Okay.

His daughter is missing.

562
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,606
Oh goodness.

563
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,076
Hello.

564
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,096
I haven't seen you
around. Are you new here?

565
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,326
Yes. It's been two weeks
since I've come here.

566
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,266
Oh, I see. Can you please take this.

567
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,386
I'm Jang Hyeon Ji's father.

568
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,676
Even if their name is different,

569
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,706
if their age or face seems similiar,
please contact me.

570
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,506
Okay, I understand.

571
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,736
Mr. Jang!

572
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,816
Oh, hello.

573
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,916
What brings you here?

574
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,556
I was just stopping by.

575
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,716
Oh, this is Hyeon Ji's father.

576
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,336
Oh, nice to meet you.
I've heard lots sabout you.

577
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,256
It probably wasn't anything
good. Thanks for your hard work.

578
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,446
- I'll be going.
- Where are you going?

579
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,586
Didn't you come to see me. Come inside.

580
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,320
Come on!

581
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,720
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

582
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:24,866
Mr. Jang,
stop living in that forest and come out.

583
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,066
Don't you know living in the
forest is the trend nowadays?

584
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:31,250
The view from my house is great,
and so is the air.

585
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,556
She went missing a year ago,

586
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,226
it was reported last week.

587

[Looking for Jang Mi, missing]

588
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,486
How lovely. Who is she?

589
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:50,566
She used to work in an adult entertainment
establishment. The manager reported this.

590
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:55,066
A corpse was found a few days ago, but
apparently it was a female worker there.

591
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,506
I think it's been about
a year since she died.

592
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,420
Apparently this lady here also stopped
coming to work about a year ago.

593
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,626
Where are you going now? I'm
going to stop by a woman's shelter,

594
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,916
then head to court.

595
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,926
Why the court?

596
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,476
The person who killed Kim Mi Ok

597
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,026
has his trial today.

598
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,880
That kind of person's
appeal needs to get declined.

599
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,060
But... how do you know Kim Mi Ok?

600
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,160
Have I told you about her?

601
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,996
Of course you did. How else would I know?

602
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,390
Sunbae, can you look at this?

603
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,840
Sure. One moment please.

604
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,310

They're looking for our Jang Mi...

607
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,345
We will highlight that
you have no previous

608
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:53,616
convictions and have
confessed to your crime,

609
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,306
and will emphasize you are
currently repenting for your deeds.

610
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,356
I am deeply regretting my
actions and reflection on myself.

611
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,766
Yes. The trial is beginning soon,
so I'll be going up first.

612
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,260
Thank you, sir.

613
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,310

What are you up to here? Have a trial?

615
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,626
It's for Kang Myeong Jin's trial.

616
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,306
Bok Seong Bae had
agreed to testify as a witness,

617
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,546
but something came up for him suddenly,
so I came in his place.

618
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,086
What brings you here?

619
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,736
Same for me. Kim Mi Ok's parents

620
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,696
asked me to come, saying they're
afraid of seeing that man's face.

621
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,086
That's good. Just go and
land a punch with your words,

622
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,526
so that he can't ever come out.

623
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,896
This is his first offense,
and he's confessed to his crimes.

624
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,536
His sentence will likely be reduced.

625
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,866
It's not his first offense!

626
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,346
I asked him why he
killed Kim Mi Ok in a visit,

627
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:01,540
and he said he couldn't
hold it in any longer.

628
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,910
I'm sure there have been more.

629
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,166
They even had an interview with a profiler.

630
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,836
I'm telling you,
it's not it! He's a Psy-path!

You have to run about.

00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,950
Wook.

00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,336
Why are you standing there?

639
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,576
The neighborhood... feels empty.

640
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,600
The kids aren't at the playground,
and there are no customers here.

641

00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,066
He's in the warehouse making something.

00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,536
Jang Mi said she wanted to ride a bike.

644
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,066
Maybe he's making that.

00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,216
He's really something.

646
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,470

Unni, this is where you were?

00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,360
You're looking at that picture again?

649
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,676
Isn't he handsome. He
looked just like a doll, so I-

650
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,716
You didn't go anywhere with lots of people,
you were afraid he'd get taken by others?

651
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,476
Were you going to say that agai?

652
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,436
Goodness, if I hear that once more,
my ears are going to stab over.

653
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,266
I wonder what he'd have
looked like in middle school.

654
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,946
When he was younger,
he was such a picky eater,

655
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,460
I worried that he wouldn't grow tall.

656
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:46,940
In high school, it was probably popular
among the female students, right?

657
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:53,746
If he wasn't full of himself, he probably
would've gotten some confessions.

658
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,846
Hey, my son isn't like that!

659
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,680
How would you know that?

660
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,490
I just know. But what brings you here?

661
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,476
I didn't want to eat alone,

662
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,176
so I wanted to get a meal from you.

663
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,080
Sure. Jun Su must be hungry too.

664
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,976
Why do you always only talk
about your son and Jun Su?

665
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,246
You never talk about yourself.

666
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,726
I don't have much to say.

667
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,346
I've talked about my trashy
boyfriend and my horrible mom, all of it.

668
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:32,576
I don't think you grew
up getting beat by others,

669
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,496
or had any bad relations with anyone.

670
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,476
How did you end up here?

671
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,070
An accident? A hit and run?

672
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,946
I wish someone would tell me.

673
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,590
The reason I'm here.

674
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:54,210
Unni, you seem like you're in
a particularly bad mood today.

675
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,956
Did your husband drink again?

676
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,856
Apparently someone who used to work
with Jang Mi reported her as missing.

677
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,446
If we help,
it'd be easier for them to find.

678
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,556
That's a relief that there's someone
who still remembers Jang Mi.

679
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,876
Did she wait a year before
reporting it because she remembers?

680
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,836
At least they put in a report.

681
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,656
There are more people nowadays
who couldn't care less about others.

682
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,696
You think all people in this
world are meddlers like you?

683
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,386
Says you.

684
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:24,096
You're someone who meddles
even in the work of the police.

685
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,776
Thanks to your meddling,
the people here are beginning to hope.

686
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,296
I'm grateful.

687
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,896
Be grateful later, when we go find you.

688
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,280
Then, I'll receive all the thanks together.

689
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,566
You're going to find Thomas?

690
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:38,756
Why are you so surprised?

691
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,060
Do you think he died
getting blasted off into space?

692
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,240
I'm grateful for you even saying
you're thinking of finding me.

693
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,076
He isn't a first-time offender.

694
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,906
I asked him why he
killed Kim Mi Ok in a visit,

695
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,106
and he said he couldn't
hold it in any longer.

696
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,716
It's not true! He's a psy-path!

697
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,380
A psychopath!

698
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,596
Yes, sir.

699
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,526
The DNA test results are
out. None of them are related.

700
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,426
None of the three are related?

701
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,920
Not even 1% similarity.
None of them are it.

702
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,436
Yes? I see.

703
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,826
I'll contact you again shortly.

704
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,650
Sure.

705
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,336
What's your name?

706
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,226
Kim Wook.

707
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:04,916
I think Su Yeon might
have called you sunshine...

708
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,596
Not sunshine, but bright as the sun Wook.

709
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,240
My mother used to call
me that when I was younger.

710
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:21,480
Sunshine. Bright as the sun, Wook.

711
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,696
Yes, I'm the boss.

712
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,260
Are these punks all working together?

713
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:51,426
Look into what they're doing.

714
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:54,620
If I tell you that,
things'll get troublesome for me.

715
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,200
Go start the car.

716
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,880
Forest Kindergarten

717
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:46,840
Jang Hyeon Ji

718
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,536
Can I go in for a minute?

719
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,330
Yes.

720
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,486
Are you clocking out now?

721
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,916
Yea...

722
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,766
Wook was right.

723
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:19,356
He said it's a waste
that you're stuck here.

724
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,120
- Get home safe.
- Okay.

725
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,946
Can I borrow this?

726
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,636
What do you need that for?

727
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,176
For self-protection. The
night roads are scary.

728
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,100
See you tomorrow.

729
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,120
Let's go.

730
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,036
Are you going to fight

731
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,416
I'm bringing it in case.

732
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,086
I'm just saying it in case,
but I am no good at fights.

733
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:55,460
Just follow me.

734
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:02,886
Did something happen with Jun Su's mom?

735
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,416
No. Nothing happened.

736
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,116
Why?

737
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:12,590
I mean,
your relationship just seems a bit weird.

738
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,916
Is it far from here?

739
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,926
If I get home late, Mr. Jang worries.

740
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,186
We're almost there.

741
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:24,310
Be careful.

742
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,586
- Is it this?
- Yes.

743
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:35,996
I've been here a few times alone,
but wasn't able to go in.

744
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:39,116
It's an abandoned place.

745
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,886
Right?

746
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:44,446
But I can hear some
sounds coming from inside.

747
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,776
What sounds?

748
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,196
Something like metal?

749
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:52,856
It must just be the insects or something.

750
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,086
Come this way.

751
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,040
Where are you going?

752
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,746
This lock... hasn't rusted
away nor does it have dust on it.

753
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:11,260
I think someone uses it.

754
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,476
Do you think you can open this?

755
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,336
Of course, you just put this into the hole,

756
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,926
twist it, it unlocks, and bam.

757
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,026
- You want me to open it?
- Yes.

758
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,890
Can I?

759
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,850
Stick close to me.

760
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,596
Did you just hear that?

761
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,260
Yes.

762
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,460
What should we do?

763
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,440
Let's go.

764
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:13,650
Wait a minute.

765
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:06,720
Who are you?

766
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:14,096
Thomas. Isn't Thomas here?

767
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,156
You know... Thomas?

768
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,416
Thomas trapped me in here.

769
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,360
Let me go!

770
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,496
Why would Thomas...

771
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,696
You're all dead, right?

772
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,500
I'm not dead. I'm alive!

773
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,020
Missing: The Other Side

774
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,886
There's someone other than us!

775
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,306
Another living person in this village.

776
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,336
I will be hands off about this,
so you can vote or do whatever.

777
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,566
Why are you do bent over
backwards about Chairman Han?

778
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:08,206
Since they haven't found her grandchild,
the murders haven't stopped.

779
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,996
What is it that you don't even need a plan?

780
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:14,206
I thought we've been comrades this
whole time, but I guess that was just me.

781
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,546
Still, we need to

782
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,036
save the living person first!

783
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,776
Please hurry. There are
only four days left now.

784
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,306
Choi Yeo Na... is dead.

785
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:25,300
I'm asking you what that means!
