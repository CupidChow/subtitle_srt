00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,887
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,389
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,476
1 YEAR AGO, DUON VILLAGE

4
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,769
So how did

5
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,272
those two end up
being able to see ghosts like us?

6
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,776
I don't even know why I'm here.

7
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,487
So how would I know why they can see us?

8
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,699
And why do you want to know that?

9
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,743
A living person can see us.

10
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,453
Aren't you curious?

11
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,208
There must be a reason.
Some kind of a connection.

12
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,918
A connection, you say…

13
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,838
Kim met his mother here.

14
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,715
And Mr. Jang

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,218
found his daughter's remains
right outside the village.

16
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,394
I love you, Wook.

17
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,652
Me too.

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,949
Jang Hyeon-ji.

19
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,575
It's his daughter.

20
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,661
She went missing 15 years ago.

21
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,496
Missing?

22
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,749
She went missing at an amusement park
and still hasn't been found yet.

23
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,044
Hyeon-ji.

24
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,256
Don't you miss me?

25
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,342
I…

26
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,513
I miss you even more today.

27
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,141
This way!

28
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,226
-Where is it?
-Follow me.

29
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,938
Hyeon-ji.

30
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,066
I finally found you.

31
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,277
I can't see the village.

32
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,988
I can't see anything!

33
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,663
And one more thing.

34
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,624
I heard that they both had
near-death experiences.

35
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,918
They nearly died?

36
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,421
I'm not sure.

37
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,173
It could be that they may have nearly died

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,926
or were brought back to life.

39
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,222
One thing for sure is

40
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,100
that they both had
a desperate longing for someone.

41
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,313
I should go now.

42
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,523
I can't leave my café empty for too long.

43
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,039
Oh, come on.

44
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,376
The people here are dead like me.

45
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,713
They're dead,
but their bodies haven't been found.

46
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,053
So there's another place like this.

47
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,263
-Sorry?
-What?

48
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,974
Nothing.

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,647
This is the first time that the living
have come to Industrial Complex Three.

50
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,982
-So you should--
-Act like we're dead?

51
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,526
I'm not that stupid, you know.

52
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm not dumb.

53
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,198
And he's also better at lying
than you'd expect.

54
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,741
Wait.

55
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,911
The people here are dead
without knowing where their bodies are.

56
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,246
Imagine how they must feel.

57
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,457
Do phones work here?

58
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,084
Probably not, right?

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,503
I asked just in case.

60
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,673
So where's Eun-hee?

61
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,177
Before that,
there's someone I want you to meet.

62
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,387
Il-yong!

63
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,107
The kids are playing soccer at school.

64
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,734
Growing kids are always hungry.

65
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,113
But here, they don't age or grow.

66
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,491
They've been kids for five to ten years.
Imagine how hungry they must be.

67
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,909
Captain, these people--

68
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,287
-Take these quickly to them.
-Okay.

69
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,872
They're probably starving by now.

70
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,925
Goodness, my sweetie is here.

71
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:50,016
The older kids are
playing soccer over at the school.

72
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,351
Shall we go over and join them?

73
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,648
Let's go play soccer. Come on.

74
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,983
Up you go.

75
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,699
What's that smell?

76
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,701
Something seems to be burning.

77
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,037
-Captain.
-Yes?

78
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,455
Something's burning.

79
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,664
Oh, my goodness.

80
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,583
It's burning.

81
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,173
-Il-yong.
-Yes?

82
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,299
Quick. Get in here.

83
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,843
Here, sir.

84
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,513
When you go down the road,
you'll come across the school.

85
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,806
Could you take this there?

86
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,938
SUPERMARKET

87
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:37,980
Where did he say?

88
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,736
Bo-ra.

89
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,282
Hello.

90
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,409
Your mom still hasn't come home?

91
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,035
She hasn't even called?

92
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,539
No.

93
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,457
Goodness.

94
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,209
This isn't something
I should be talking to you about,

95
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,378
but you're far behind on rent.

96
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,756
Your mom promised she'd pay this month.
Where did she go without a word?

97
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,175
Gosh.

98
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,595
I just wanted to let you know.

99
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,222
My goodness.

100
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,308
No matter how much she loves a man,

101
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,435
has she no shame in front of her kid?

102
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,352
Goodness.

103
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,836
MOM

104
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,007
The phone is off. Please leave…

105
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,260
Why won't you pick up the phone?

106
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,557
Where are you, Mom?

107
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,309
Why won't you pick up the phone?

108
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,645
Are you busy? Has something happened?

109
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,939
I'm worried about you, so please call me.

110
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,941
And why aren't you checking your texts?

111
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,943
Just call me or pick up the phone!

112
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,322
If it's because you'd rather be
with someone else than me,

113
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,742
I don't need you either.

114
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:04,335
-Up above the world so high
-Up above the world so high

115
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:09,131
-Like a diamond in the sky
-Like a diamond in the sky

116
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,344
-Twinkle, twinkle, little star
-Twinkle, twinkle, little star

117
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:17,431
-How I wonder what you are
-How I wonder what you are

118
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,684
How old are you?

119
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,896
Oh, you're five years old.

120
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,606
You sing well.

121
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,525
Did you learn that song at kindergarten?

122
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,610
No.

123
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,570
Please, Mr. Jang.

124
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,738
Kids these days learn things
all on their own.

125
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,823
Right, Alice?

126
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,245
Where's my mommy?

127
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,793
Your mom…

128
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,337
I'll find her for you.

129
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,257
So…

130
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,175
these kids are all…

131
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,885
Right?

132
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,021
Get it.

133
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,065
There are so many of them.

134
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,234
Oh, my!

135
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,819
Alice, are you okay?

136
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,405
You shouldn't have kicked
in that direction.

137
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,576
Hey, the snacks are here!

138
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,578
-Sounds good!
-Sounds good!

139
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,204
What is it?

140
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,541
You should apologize first.

141
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,501
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

142
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,670
Are you all right?

143
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,428
SEARCHING FOR YANG EUN-HEE

144
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,140
Hello.

145
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,017
You must be new here.

146
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,227
My name is Yang Eun-hee.

147
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,312
I see.

148
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,606
My name is Kim Wook.

149
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,485
Nice to meet you.

150
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,070
What's your name?

151
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,281
Alice.

152
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,033
Alice?

153
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,704
Wow, that's also the name
of a character in my favorite story.

154
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,750
We…

155
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,252
We brought snacks.

156
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,339
Let's go eat the snacks.

157
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,386
-Let's go, kids.
-Yes.

158
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,349
This is nuts. Just crazy.

159
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:27,478
Just how many kids are here
that they even have a school?

160
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,772
Seriously.

161
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,233
Come on, let's go!

162
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,567
Hey. Look over there.

163
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,070
I don't think so.

164
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,407
Hey, Mister.

165
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,784
-You're Hyeon-ji's dad, aren't you?
-What?

166
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,003
You know my daughter?

167
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,801
Why aren't you coming?

168
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,888
Coming!

169
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,726
Mr. Jang.

170
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,145
Get a hold of yourself.

171
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,062
What?

172
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,480
Remember where we are?

173
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,275
Yes.

174
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,780
Right.

175
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,411
-What are you doing?
-What?

176
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,414
I'm waiting for them.

177
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,833
They've been gone for a while.

178
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,670
They probably met Eun-hee by now, right?

179
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,007
I wonder if Ha-yun recognized him.

180
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,427
If she had,
she would have mentioned Hyeon-ji.

181
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,806
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your snack.

182
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,641
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

183
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,060
-Thank you.
-Enjoy…

184
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,813
-Let's switch.
-Sure.

185
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,857
I don't see Ha-yun and Yeong-rim.

186
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,650
Ro-ha, have you seen them?

187
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,153
They were talking to that man.

188
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,740
Mr. Jang had a stomachache,

189
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,910
so the kids took him to the restroom.

190
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,210
Your name is Kim Wook, right?

191
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,212
Not just Wook.

192
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,755
It means "bright sunshine."

193
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,259
My mother named me that
so that I would light up the world.

194
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,515
Others tend to feel strange and anxious
when they first arrive here.

195
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,266
But you're not like that.

196
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,643
You also take good care of the kids.

197
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,145
I adjust quickly wherever I go.

198
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,605
And I like kids.

199
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,650
By the way, Eun-hee.

200
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,734
Yes?

201
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,985
I mean…

202
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,570
Ms. Yang,

203
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,739
when did you first arrive here?

204
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,450
I've been here for 20 years.

205
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,619
I'm older than you.

206
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,955
Okay.

207
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,171
How did you know

208
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,174
that I was Hyeon-ji's dad?

209
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,802
I saw you in the picture
that Hyeon-ji had.

210
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,971
So my daughter

211
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,724
was here with you guys.

212
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,143
Yes. She was my best friend.

213
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,438
But Hyeon-ji isn't here anymore.

214
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,942
We were drawing together
by the lake one day

215
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,777
when she suddenly disappeared.

216
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,237
Stupid.

217
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,698
She didn't disappear. She left.

218
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,615
Gosh.

219
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,493
Did you take Hyeon-ji away?

220
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,037
Lee Yeong-rim, you idiot.

221
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,039
-That's not it.
-Come here.

222
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,670
Hyeon-ji was with such good friends.

223
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,589
Thank you.

224
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,008
Hey kids.

225
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,386
If you don't go now,
there will be no rice balls left.

226
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,304
Right.

227
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,348
Go and get your snacks.

228
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,558
-Okay.
-Okay.

229
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,117
Hyeon-ji was here.

230
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,393
SUPERMARKET

231
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,363
You're Wook,

232
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,157
and you're Hyeon-ji's dad, aren't you?

233
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,660
How did you know I was Hyeon-ji's dad?

234
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,370
Il-yong told me.

235
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,164
And Hyeon-ji also talked a lot about you.

236
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,291
The villagers may not know
what you look like,

237
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,627
but they probably all know about you.

238
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,004
I see.

239
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,174
Go ahead and eat.

240
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,885
You can't leave until you eat all of this.

241
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,306
I'm still full
from the rice balls I had earlier.

242
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,143
Hey, just burp
and it will all be digested.

243
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,813
Oh, here.

244
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,730
Try this.

245
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,524
It's okay.

246
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,817
I'll feed you.

247
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,734
Here.

248
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,822
Wow. What is this?

249
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,241
This is so good!
You should try it, Mr. Jang.

250
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,826
Wow.

251
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,911
-Thank you for the food.
-You're welcome.

252
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,337
Everyone who comes to this village…

253
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,839
Like the girl earlier,

254
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,049
they all show up
through the big tree outside.

255
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,094
But I didn't see you two arrive.

256
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,722
That means you came through another route.

257
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,265
For example, from outside.

258
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,939
Captain Kang knows everything.

259
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,112
I'm the big cheese around here.

260
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,281
Everyone around here knows who I am.

261
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,658
Everyone has eaten my food.

262
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,577
And no one ever said my food tasted bad.

263
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,789
However, this is the first time
I've cooked for the living.

264
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,709
Well? How is it?

265
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,628
It's really delicious.

266
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,629
Right, Mr. Jang?

267
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,631
It's good enough to sell somewhere.

268
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,010
Thank you for this meal.

269
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,555
But Hyeon-ji…

270
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,141
takes after her mom, not her dad.

271
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,309
It's very fortunate.

272
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,771
There's something
I really want to say, but won't.

273
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,064
What do you want to say?

274
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,899
That my daughter should take after me,

275
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,359
but it's good that your daughter
takes after her mom.

276
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,362
Sure. I really hope you get
a daughter who's just like you.

277
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,698
You need to see what it's like
to deal with such--

278
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,950
I was just teasing you.
Don't get so angry.

279
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,079
You're not married
and you don't have a girlfriend.

280
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,580
"You"?

281
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,417
Mr. Kim.

282
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,214
-Don't you have to go home?
-I work part-time here.

283
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,257
Come visit often.

284
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,759
I may be stuck here like this,

285
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,761
but I can still cook lots of food for you.

286
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,931
Sure.

287
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,229
Goodbye.

288
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,190
-Thanks for the food.
-Be safe on your way back.

289
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:32,945
This way.

290
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,073
-He must be overwhelmed right now.
-Let's get inside.

291
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,324
Doesn't Captain Kang

292
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,409
remind you of Thomas when she's chatty?

293
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,621
Even the way she takes care
of everything in the village.

294
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,123
When Alice arrived,

295
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,041
none of us realized her presence,

296
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,709
yet she alone went running to her.

297
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,171
Then the tree just split in the middle
and out came Alice.

298
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,093
She must feel something when it happens,
don't you think?

299
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,639
What are you doing?

300
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,526
Wook.

301
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,615
What is it?

302
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,161
I can't seem to walk away.

303
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,957
Because of Hyeon-ji?

304
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,835
Yes.

305
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,093
I'll go by myself then.

306
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,531
This seems to be the place.

307
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,367
This is Bo-ra's mom's friend's workplace?

308
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,747
Hello. I'm Detective Shin Jun-ho
from the Missing Persons Team.

309
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,999
What brings you here?

310
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,294
We have a few questions
about Ms. Mun Se-yeong.

311
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,004
Did something happen to Se-yeong?

312
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,758
She's been ignoring my calls and texts.

313
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,468
It's been about a week.

314
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,470
Have you been to her workplace?

315
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,764
Where is that?

316
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,808
Welcome.

317
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,855
You must be the designated driver.

318
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,440
"Designated driver"?

319
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,692
You kidding me?

320
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,403
Do I look like I don't belong here?

321
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,363
Here.

322
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,366
I'm the police.

323
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,369
Did Ms. Mun Se-yeong come to work?

324
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,829
Why are the police looking for Se-yeong?

325
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,122
What's this about?

326
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,208
She's been reported missing.

327
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,294
She hasn't come home in a few days
and can't be reached.

328
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,462
Missing?

329
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,839
Se-yeong is on vacation.

330
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,841
-On vacation?
-Yes.

331
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,135
She said she was taking some time off.

332
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,513
Did she seem different than usual?

333
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,806
No.

334
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,476
That night, there was a customer
who was a mean drunk.

335
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,521
Se-yeong was in charge of that room
and had some trouble.

336
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,898
Besides that,
nothing was out of the ordinary.

337
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,192
"Trouble"? What kind?

338
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,694
Did the customer assault her?

339
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,529
He was too drunk to stand up straight.

340
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,864
She had to clean up after him
because he threw up.

341
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,617
May I take a look
at your security camera footage?

342
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,036
The security camera footage?
You can watch it here.

343
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,416
She's not in a hurry,

344
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,002
nor does it look like
she's being followed.

345
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,839
I'd like a copy
of this video file, please.

346
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,132
All right.

347
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,138
What's this?

348
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,806
It's so hot in here.

349
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,309
I lit the stove earlier
to make scorched rice.

350
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,604
The main building uses
a new boiler for heating,

351
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,733
but this is an old-fashioned,
underfloor heated room.

352
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,123
I don't even know who did all this.

353
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:18,253
This place is open to everyone
and they doodle here from time to time.

354
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,551
Where did Hyeon-ji stay?

355
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,388
She lived with Eun-hee
in the school residence.

356
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,391
Eun-hee takes such good care of the kids.

357
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,226
I see.

358
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,770
If you'd like some water…

359
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,022
No, thanks. It's okay.

360
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,775
I shouldn't keep you from resting.

361
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,487
-Get some rest now.
-I will.

362
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,363
Thank you.

363
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,740
Not at all.

364
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,216
Ms. Kim.

365
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,763
Eun-hee is here.

366
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,601
Eun-hee…

367
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,940
looked after Hyeon-ji.

368
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,372
Goodness.

369
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,711
Stupid Dragon King, Buddha, and God…

370
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,882
You could have let him see her
just once before she left.

371
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,823
A woman in her 20s
wearing a wedding dress was found dead.

372
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,616
The police are investigating.

373
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,035
Reporter Myeong Min-jun is on the story.

374
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,247
Today, around 1 p.m.,
on a beach in Namcheong-ri, Cheongam-gun…

375
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,748
Why's the light off?

376
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,041
Aren't you scared?

377
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,585
The police were on the scene.

378
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,963
The victim was in a wedding dress.

379
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,299
-The police believe this woman to be
-Jong-a.

380
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,217
-Choi Jeong-ah, reported missing…
-Are you sick?

381
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,596
Wook, she's a friend of mine.

382
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,556
She suddenly disappeared before…

383
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,726
What? That's your friend?

384
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,643
Yes.

385
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,353
She's an old high school friend,

386
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,106
but we didn't keep in touch.

387
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,318
I heard about her
when I met my friends two days ago.

388
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,403
I was told she ran away
on her wedding day.

389
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,448
But she's been found dead.

390
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,491
Ran away?

391
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,328
I heard she was kidnapped.

392
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,830
Kidnapped?

393
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,042
Jeong-ah was kidnapped?

394
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,254
How do you know Jeong-ah anyway?

395
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,089
Well…

396
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,592
I don't know her, exactly.

397
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,141
So…

398
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:22,020
The dead who came to see you
witnessed Jeong-ah being kidnapped,

399
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,815
and he said he knew where the daughter
of the old lady from the café was

400
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,692
and took you to the industrial complex.

401
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,946
And there was
another place like Duon Village?

402
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,866
Then you found out
this village was where Hyeon-ji stayed?

403
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,867
Yes.

404
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:36,785
That's right.

405
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,164
But this Oh Il-yong?

406
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,251
How did he know to come and see you?

407
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,044
We met by chance at the café.

408
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,755
I had no idea he was one of the dead.

409
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:52,634
He was probably just as surprised
to find out that he could talk to me.

410
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,179
He probably came to see me again
because he was amazed.

411
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,141
You think that was all coincidental?

412
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,229
Another one of your theories?

413
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,007
I'm sorry.

414
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,102
That I came so late.

415
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,307
Mommy.

416
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,600
Why are you crying, Alice?

417
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,560
What's wrong?

418
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,897
It's all right.

419
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,238
You miss your mommy?

420
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,034
I miss my mom too.

421
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,372
But I'm working hard not to cry.

422
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,924
Ms. Yang!

423
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,095
Alice, why are you crying?

424
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,890
Let's eat together,
then go have fun at the school playground.

425
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,784
Is it her that you like
or is it the playground?

426
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,707
Ha-yun, is it a special day today?

427
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,126
You only wear that headband
on special days.

428
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,712
I want to show this to Hyeon-ji's dad.

429
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,130
Hyeon-ji's dad?

430
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,382
Where's Hyeon-ji's dad?

431
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,885
He was here at the school yesterday.

432
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,023
Here you are.

433
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,694
I've been looking for you, Mr. Jang.

434
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:46,659
I must really be famous around here.

435
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,704
Hyeon-ji bragged a lot about you.

436
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,707
The books you read to her,

437
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,210
the headbands you bought for her,

438
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,629
the trips she took with you…

439
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,966
I'm relieved to hear that.

440
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm glad she had those happy memories.

441
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,429
That's not all.

442
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,349
If you ask anyone in this village
who they most want to see,

443
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,352
some might say it's you.

444
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,648
I was just kidding!

445
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,237
I heard that you always
took good care of my daughter.

446
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,030
Thank you.

447
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,824
Not at all.

448
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,410
Rather, Hyeon-ji was the one
who helped me a lot.

449
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,871
She looked after her friends,

450
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,457
and her heart was
as beautiful as her face.

451
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,670
When she left two years ago,

452
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,881
everyone believed
that you'd finally found her.

453
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,387
So how did you end up here?

454
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,808
Don't worry. I'm okay.

455
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,022
How long have you been here?

456
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,649
It's been 20 years.

457
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,734
It's been a long time.

458
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,196
I'm still the same,
but my mom probably has grown old.

459
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,492
Whenever Hyeon-ji talked about you,

460
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,619
it reminded me a lot of my mom.

461
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,957
My mom thinks I'm the most beautiful
and smartest girl in the world.

462
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,751
She bragged to all the neighbors
when I got into med school.

463
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,753
She used to call me her doctor.

464
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,298
I was so embarrassed by that.

465
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,175
She had a right to be proud of you.

466
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,886
I guess.

467
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,929
She was right to be proud of me.

468
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,518
I'm always grateful to my mom.

469
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,439
All of my memories are from 20 years ago,

470
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,859
but every moment I remember

471
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,402
is full of love and happiness.

472
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,117
That must also be why
Hyeon-ji was always so happy.

473
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,581
Thanks.

474
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,208
I appreciate it.

475
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,381
No.

476
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,342
I want to go with you.

477
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,426
Come on.

478
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,928
I'm going with you.

479
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,763
I'm just going to go get Mr. Jang.

480
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,097
You can't go there.

481
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,974
Why not? It's where Hyeon-ji used to live.

482
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:15,934
Is she a stranger to me?

483
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,602
Even if you go, you won't see anything.

484
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,356
This time, it has to do with me too.

485
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,733
You said Oh Il-yong's a witness
in Jeong-ah's case.

486
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,652
We have to catch the kidnappers.

487
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,569
Hey, Jong-a.

488
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,863
Hurry up! Let's go.

489
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,907
Goodness.

490
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:41,250
COMPLEX 3

491
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,753
Jong-a. Where are you going?

492
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,880
I have to go alone from here.

493
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,340
You should wait in the car.

494
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,342
Fine. I'm not a kid, you know.

495
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,760
Don't worry about me and go.

496
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,387
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

497
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,434
If you're so worried,
you could take me with you.

498
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,561
I can't see the place anyway.

499
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,647
What's the harm in bringing me along?

500
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,815
How annoying.

501
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,693
Go ahead.

502
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,335
You think I can't go there
if you don't take me?

503
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,103
What?

504
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,731
It's closed off?

505
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,193
He definitely went that way.

506
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,012
It's the village
where Hyeon-ji used to live,

507
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,430
so Mr. Jang has a reason.

508
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,974
But how come I can see it?

509
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,279
Mr. Jung, look at this.

510
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,782
I'm an artist. Call me Artist Kang.

511
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,741
Oh, boy.

512
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,744
I told you to paint
the background before the flowers.

513
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,872
-Goodness.
-This color is prettier.

514
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,831
Hello.

515
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,124
What are you doing here?

516
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,753
You're that young man.

517
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,129
Yes, he is.

518
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,964
He's the new one. Wook.

519
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,300
This is Mr. Jung Young-jin, the principal.

520
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,259
I see.

521
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,095
Hello, my name is Kim Wook.

522
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,429
It means "bright sunshine."

523
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,847
Welcome.

524
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,016
Although this is not a good place to be.

525
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,520
I don't know what brought
a young man like you here,

526
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,106
but I hope your stay here is comfortable.

527
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,820
Thank you.

528
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,155
So why did you come?

529
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,407
I couldn't find Mr. Jang anywhere.

530
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,952
I went to the supermarket,
but no one was there.

531
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,037
He went out early this morning.

532
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,040
I didn't see his shoes
when I went to the door this morning.

533
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,669
Where would he go
when he doesn't even know the place well?

534
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,504
By the way,

535
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,341
why do the people here call you Captain?

536
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:39,053
Because she's a captain.
What else would they call her?

537
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,348
You're a real captain?

538
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,391
Of course.

539
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,227
I actually used to sail a fishing boat.

540
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,938
I always came home
full of fish whenever I went out.

541
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,231
Excuse me.

542
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,025
We have to finish this
before our paint dries. Could you--

543
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,486
I should go and bother you no more.

544
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,618
-He's a strange one.
-What do you mean?

545
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,289
He looks as if he's been here
for years already.

546
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,833
It's his first time here,
but he doesn't seem sad.

547
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,253
I heard that's just the way he is.

548
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,504
He adjusts quickly.

549
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,089
He said that himself.

550
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,550
Let's get this done before the kids come.

551
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,551
Okay.

552
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,219
Mr. Jang!

553
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,144
Hey, Il-yong.

554
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,478
What are you doing here?

555
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,063
This is my home.

556
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,648
So this is where you live.

557
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,526
I can't find Mr. Jang anywhere.

558
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,569
Have you seen him?

559
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,904
No, not today.

560
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,739
Then help me find him.

561
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,657
The village is bigger than I thought.

562
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,409
You're on your own. I have to go.

563
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,203
Where are you going? The supermarket?

564
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,038
But there weren't any customers there.

565
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,040
No, I have something to do
outside the village.

566
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,542
To do what outside the village?

567
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,630
By the way, how are you able to
come and go as you please?

568
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,925
I don't know.

569
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,344
I just do it because I can.

570
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:05,890
I look for the villagers' families to see
how they're doing while I'm outside.

571
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,642
May I go now?

572
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,188
Wait.

573
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,649
The woman in a wedding dress.

574
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,025
Did they catch the culprit?

575
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,444
What's your relationship?

576
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,613
I told you, I don't know her.

577
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,490
Not with her. I mean with the culprit.

578
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,991
You were following him around.

579
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,911
You were there
when that phone scammer died,

580
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,289
and you were there when that woman
was being injected with something.

581
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,085
Don't you ever tell others
about yourself from now on.

582
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,339
I just went to see
the guy scamming Eun-hee's mom

583
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,674
and saw the whole thing by accident.

584
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,843
You witnessed all this by accident?

585
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,847
Never tell others
what happened before you died.

586
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,809
Yes.

587
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,060
Then what about me?

588
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,479
So it was just a coincidence

589
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,189
you met me at that café?

590
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,235
Yes, just a coincidence.

591
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,365
May I go now?

592
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,911
A coincidence?

593
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,579
You think

594
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,040
that was all coincidental?

595
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,959
Another one of your theories?

596
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,377
Listen.

597
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,715
Oh Il-yong could have
intentionally approached you.

598
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,300
He could have been tailing you,

599
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,593
then casually starts a chat
with you at the café.

600
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,429
What's this? You can hear him!

601
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,346
Amazing.

602
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,474
So he invites you to the complex,
and you can see all the villagers.

603
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,434
Even more amazing!

604
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,729
Just a coincidence.

605
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,367
Ms. Lee?

606
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,952
Mr. Jang.

607
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,041
What are you doing here?

608
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,045
I heard about Hyeon-ji.

609
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,047
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

610
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,757
Are you here alone? Where's Wook?

611
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,925
He went to find you.

612
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:05,926
You didn't see him?

613
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,470
We must have missed each other.

614
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,597
Hey, there he comes.

615
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,724
Mr. Jang.

616
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,977
When did you leave?
I was looking all over for you.

617
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,062
I left in a hurry.

618
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,023
Wook, could you call
Detective Shin for me?

619
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,400
-Why?
-Just do it, please?

620
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,072
So you're saying this med student

621
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,823
is in that village of the missing?

622
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,035
The missing who are dead, to be specific.

623
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,828
How many people are there?

624
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,374
I'm not sure exactly,
but at least a few dozen.

625
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,835
We're not sure yet either
since yesterday was our first time there.

626
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,463
No one knows that
Yang Eun-hee died 20 years ago.

627
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,799
There's nothing but speculative articles.

628
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,675
Because over here, she's still missing.

629
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,346
Imagine how it must be for her mom.
Every day must be painful.

630
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,765
If you just tell them the truth--

631
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,184
Even you didn't believe us at first,
Detective Shin.

632
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,894
That's true.

633
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,896
No one would believe it.

634
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,940
So let's look for Eun-hee.

635
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,484
Please help us, Detective Shin.

636
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,278
I feel bad for her mom,

637
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,279
and above all,

638
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,490
Eun-hee looked after my daughter.

639
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,118
I'd like to find her to repay her.

640
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,912
Of course. Let's find her.

641
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:16,997
What about you?

642
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,917
I'll do all that I can, of course.

643
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,421
I'll go and take a look at her case file.

644
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,339
Thank you, Detective Shin.

645
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,632
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

646
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,970
I'm not doing it. I refuse.

647
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,433
How long are you going to do charity work?

648
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,851
You also said you were going to quit.

649
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,940
And you too, Jong-a.

650
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,609
You're the one who nagged us
about overdue rent.

651
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,404
Looking for the dead
takes time and money, you know?

652
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,405
I'm not doing it.

653
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,324
I didn't nag you that bad.

654
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,536
Doing good work like this is an exception.

655
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,829
Then…

656
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,247
I'll pay more of the rent.

657
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,292
-That's settled then, right?
-Okay. Don't back out.

658
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,336
-What?
-Then I'll go talk to Eun-hee tomorrow.

659
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:07,673
Okay.

660
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,801
Sweetie.

661
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,721
Let's just eat one bite, okay?

662
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,229
Alice, you're having your meal.

663
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,648
Stay here.

664
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,276
-I'll go fry an egg.
-Sure thing.

665
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,403
She won't eat anything.

666
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,407
Okay.

667
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,826
Did you eat a lot, Alice?

668
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,454
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

669
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,816
How about some rice?

670
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,114
-Good. Such a good girl.
-My sweetie.

671
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,367
How about a fried egg?

672
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,620
Good girl.

673
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,498
I love fried eggs.

674
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,500
I should eat this instead.

675
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,045
I want it.

676
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,717
She's such a difficult customer.

677
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,512
You're good at this
for a young, single man.

678
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,556
Don't say that.

679
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,975
Our cute kitten is eating on her own.

680
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,813
Right.

681
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,523
Where is Ms. Yang Eun-hee's home?

682
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,941
The school residence.

683
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,067
-School residence?
-Yes.

684
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,820
I was actually going to take Alice there
after feeding her.

685
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,030
No need. I'll take her there.

686
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,366
Have some soup.

687
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,623
She's sleeping well.

688
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,710
Alice seems to be at ease with me.

689
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,546
I carried her when she said
her legs hurt and she fell asleep.

690
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,967
May I take a look around your home?

691
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,635
Of course.

692
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,803
Take your time.

693
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:00,262
Yang Eun-hee disappeared
on September 3, 2002.

694
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,556
First, they treated it as a runaway case.

695
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,225
A week later, they investigated her
as a missing person.

696
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,228
So many things
could have happened in a week.

697
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,399
Stop being temperamental and listen,
you quick-tempered idiot.

698
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,902
Right. It wasn't Detective Shin's fault.

699
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,656
Back then, they only investigated
if there was circumstantial evidence.

700
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,784
And Yang Eun-hee
disappeared into thin air.

701
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,995
Nothing was missing from her home either.

702
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,540
What about her phone? Where is it?

703
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,417
They couldn't find it.

704
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,587
Then who was with her last?

705
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,423
I'd fought with my boyfriend

706
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,009
and was at the library
by myself until late.

707
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,178
Then Jung-sik saw me home.

708
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,931
We arrived home safe and sound.

709
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,728
Thanks, Jung-sik.

710
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,146
Sure.

711
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,565
Go inside.

712
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,486
Wait.

713
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,448
I have something to say to you.

714
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,453
I like you a lot.

715
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,333
I've fallen for you badly.

716
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,876
Jung-sik, what's wrong with you?

717
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,339
I can treat you
far better than Yeong-jun could.

718
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,049
I love you.

719
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,968
I really love you.

720
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,429
Let go of me!

721
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,815
Eun-hee…

722
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:38,902
Get up.

723
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,446
Eun…

724
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,290
That's all

725
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,708
that I can remember.

726
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,084
Then…

727
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,961
Jo Jung-sik or whatever his name was.

728
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,505
He's your murderer?

729
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,883
Jo Jung-sik was the last witness.

730
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,635
Someone saw them
leave the library together.

731
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,513
Jo Jung-sik gave a statement
that after he took Eun-hee home,

732
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,765
he went home.

733
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,935
The police thought he was a prime suspect
and investigated him.

734
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,812
Soon after, Jo Jung-sik left a will

735
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,148
saying he was sorry to Eun-hee

736
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:17,816
and killed himself.

737
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,488
Eun-hee's mom said that Jung-sik
called her before his suicide.

738
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,032
He said that Park Yeong-jun
would know where she was.

739
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,869
Park Yeong-jun stated that after arguing
with his girlfriend Eun-hee,

740
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,498
he went home early and slept
after taking cold medicine.

741
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,374
His parents confirmed his alibi.

742
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,294
And three months later,
he left to study abroad.

743
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,089
Park Yeong-jun is the murderer.

744
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,344
Did Yang Eun-hee say that?
That Park Yeong-jun killed her?

745
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,596
No. She didn't.

746
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,515
I saw her cell phone at her home.

747
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:50,849
RECEIVED MESSAGES

748
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,684
I'm at your house. When will you arrive?

749
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,898
Are you ignoring my calls on purpose?

750
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,735
You bitch. How could you, with Jung-sik?

751
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,072
Park Yeong-jun was there,

752
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,491
and he was watching Jung-sik and Eun-hee.

753
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,161
I saw the texts that Yeong-jun sent me
after I came here.

754
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,873
He must have jumped to conclusions
when he saw me with Jung-sik.

755
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,210
Yeong-jun has always been
the jealous type.

756
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,628
So…

757
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,798
he could have seen you fall to the ground.

758
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:23,966
I don't know.

759
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,467
He could have left before that.

760
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,677
You never know.

761
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,303
He could have been watching.

762
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,013
That would be strange.

763
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,976
If I'm here,
that means someone hid my body.

764
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,895
Yeong-jun saw me lying on the ground

765
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,855
and didn't report it?

766
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,649
He didn't report it

767
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,443
because he was the one who killed her.

768
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,659
If we had those text messages,
they could be evidence.

769
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,121
But they found nothing
on Park Yeong-jun's phone.

770
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,497
He probably deleted them.

771
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,291
Back then, forensics wasn't possible.

772
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,376
And telecom companies
didn't keep records long.

773
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,544
Goodness.

774
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,629
Not knowing this, Eun-hee's mom

775
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,258
has been paying
Eun-hee's phone bills all these years.

776
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,886
She believed that she'd call someday.

777
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,804
What?

778
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,433
-Eun-hee's cell phone is still in service?
-Yes.

779
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,813
PLASTIC SURGEON PARK YEONG-JUN

780
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,205
How are you, Yeong-jun? It's me, Eun-hee.

781
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:44,671
No way.

782
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,765
SEARCHING FOR YANG EUN-HEE

783
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,603
I'm sorry I didn't meet with you earlier.

784
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,188
I've just been so busy.

785
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,774
It's been 20 years
since Eun-hee disappeared.

786
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,027
What kept you so busy for 20 years?

787
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,197
I'm sorry.

788
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,742
Yeong-jun.

789
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,328
Where's Eun-hee? Just tell me that.

790
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:19,206
Jung-sik called me
and said that you'd know.

791
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,167
I already told the police many times.

792
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,961
I'd like to know
why Jung-sik said that myself.

793
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,048
I really don't know.

794
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,054
You're married, right?

795
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,681
Do you have kids?

796
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,478
I have two.

797
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:46,358
Imagine if your kid
disappeared one day without a word.

798
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,901
Would you feel like eating?

799
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,736
Or sleeping?

800
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,239
You're a parent yourself.

801
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,408
-You know how I must feel.
-Ms. Kim.

802
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:07,003
Has Eun-hee ever contacted you?

803
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,228
You were there that night.

804
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,273
People still must not know what you did.

805
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,736
Remember the texts you sent me?

806
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,003
It was here somewhere, damn it.

807
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,817
Damn it.

808
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,653
After all these years.

809
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,080
If only my cell phone was found,

810
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,792
everything that you did would be revealed.

811
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,560
You bitch.

812
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,896
How could you, with Jung-sik?

813
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,012
Jung-sik.

814
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,807
Jung-sik.

815
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:33,525
You've kept it safe, right?
I'll be there to pick it up soon.

816
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,490
The address is 12-gil, Harisan,
Gokjang-myeon, Hyeonseong-gun.

817
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,243
The grave that he dug up

818
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,828
is his grandparents' grave.

819
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,913
What a bastard.

820
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,084
It's in his mother's name, Lim Seon-hee.

821
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,878
It's at his family gravesite.

822
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,922
I thought so.

823
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,301
There he comes.

824
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,930
REMEMBER THE TEXTS YOU SENT ME?

825
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,056
SENT!

826
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,066
That suspicious bastard.

827
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,444
-Let's follow him for now.
-Sure.

828
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,618
That must be it.

829
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:30,999
Shall we just

830
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,376
call an excavator and dig up the place?

831
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,545
Not without knowing where she's buried.

832
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,924
Even Park Yeong-jun dug all night
but returned empty-handed.

833
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,469
We can't find the place
he buried her 20 years ago.

834
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,638
He wouldn't have put up a tombstone.

835
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,141
Mr. Jang's right.

836
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,517
We can't dig her up.

837
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,227
Park Yeong-jun must do it himself.

838
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,812
And you have a plan?

839
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:53,813
I do.

840
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,066
What is it?

841
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,194
Jong-a, could you design a website for me?

842
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:01,947
Hello.

843
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,823
What brings you here
from the district office?

844
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,326
Ma'am, you're a lucky woman.

845
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,328
They're paving a road.

846
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,290
They sent me here
to get the consent form signed.

847
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,334
Nice place.

848
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,336
Very nice.

849
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,381
Well-built houses are good and all,

850
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,549
but how long does it take
to reach downtown?

851
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,926
An hour and 30 minutes.

852
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,386
An hour and 30 minutes?

853
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,804
It's more like two hours.

854
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,641
Two hours? Seems about right.

855
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:32,060
So from here to downtown Hyeonseong,

856
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,689
they're going to pave a brand new road
that leads straight there.

857
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,357
Five minutes to downtown.

858
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,360
Here. Do you see
the mountain that is in your name?

859
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,363
So you mean they'll dig
through our family gravesite

860
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,281
and pave a road?

861
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,241
Right.

862
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,869
As soon as we collect the consent forms
and get the documents ready,

863
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,830
we'll start construction early next year.

864
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,331
Oh, dear.

865
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,041
The land may be in my name,

866
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,960
but my son is the one who manages it.

867
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:00,088
Even if your son manages it,
if it's in your name, it's your land.

868
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,633
I'll need to have a talk with my son.

869
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,677
Of course, you should.

870
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,554
Then should I call…

871
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,514
Yes. You should call him right away.

872
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,517
What do you mean?

873
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,185
You're suddenly selling the gravesite?

874
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,106
Did you receive
the employee's business card?

875
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,775
I'll call him, so send him away for now.

876
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:24,946
Road or no road, you can't right now!

877
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,455
HYEONSEONG-GUN DISTRICT OFFICE

878
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,089
HYEONSEONG-GUN NEW ROAD PROJECT

879
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,926
Why now, of all times?

880
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,305
AREA OF NEW ROAD CONSTRUCTION
FOR BETTER ACCESSIBILITY

881
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:59,189
Yeong-jun, I'm thinking
of retrieving my phone today.

882
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,571
Who are you?

883
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,119
Eun-hee is dead.

884
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,213
Mr. Jang!

885
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,311
Hyeon-ji gave me this as a present.

886
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,689
I've been wearing it every day
so that I could show you.

887
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,441
I see.

888
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,401
I've been a bit busy lately.

889
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,821
It's very pretty and looks good on you.

890
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:48,905
Ha-yun!

891
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,365
Throw us the ball!

892
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,033
Here you go.

893
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,452
Bring your teacher
to the supermarket after a bit.

894
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,830
Captain Kang is making pizza for you.

895
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,373
-Really?
-Yes.

896
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,125
Guys!

897
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,961
Captain Kang is making pizza.

898
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,337
-Really?
-Yes.

899
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,802
Who wants pizza?

900
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,971
-Me!
-Me!

901
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:15,098
There's a slice for everyone. Here.

902
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,099
Ms. Yang.

903
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,725
Go over there and eat.

904
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,352
I'll take care of the kids.

905
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,603
-Shall I?
-Sure.

906
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,275
Alice, Ro-ha. Are you enjoying your pizza?

907
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,192
Here.

908
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,531
I've gotten so used to your cooking
that other foods don't taste good anymore.

909
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,490
What do I do?

910
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,617
I'll just continue
to take care of you then.

911
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,411
I've done it for 20 years.

912
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,788
What's another 20?

913
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,375
Hold it like this.

914
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,877
It's good.

915
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,546
What?

916
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,008
Enjoy your food.

917
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,051
Can I eat this?

918
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,761
It's delicious.

919
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,805
-How did it go?
-Everything's ready to go.

920
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,098
We have to join Jong-a.

921
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,143
I have to go too?

922
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,194
Doctor, you have
an appointment in ten minutes.

923
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,281
Cancel everything.
Something urgent came up.

924
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,659
You don't have to do that.

925
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,369
Goodness.

926
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,705
You can't wash
all those dishes by yourself!

927
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,957
I can take care of my own dishes.

928
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,834
Just go home and get to bed!

929
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:25,835
Hurry.

930
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,545
Come on.

931
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,880
Good job today!

932
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:29,964
SUPERMARKET

933
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,925
She's incorrigible.

934
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,134
Are you going home now?

935
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,177
Yes.

936
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,555
I wanted to help clean up,
but Captain Kang threw me out.

937
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,266
Good job today taking care of the kids.

938
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,352
Ha-yun must be waiting. Hurry home.

939
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:43,978
Okay.

940
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,021
See you again.

941
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,734
Ms. Yang?

942
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,444
Yes?

943
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,160
Get home safe.

944
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:03,581
This whole village
is in the palm of my hand.

945
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,500
Don't worry!

946
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:26,521
Jong-a.

947
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,523
Just keep an eye on him

948
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:31,067
and call the police
if you sense anything strange.

949
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,069
Don't get close to him until I get there.

950
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,028
Got that?

951
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,655
Okay, I got it.

952
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,449
You have to hang up

953
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,535
for me to get back
to keeping an eye on him.

954
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,078
I'm hanging up now.

955
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,665
SHIN JUN-HO

956
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:47,959
This is Shin Jun-ho.

957
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,919
Detective Shin, it's me.

958
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,547
Please come quickly
to the address I'm about to send you.

959
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,013
Where is he?

960
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:03,850
Found him.

961
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,023
A little bit more to the left.

962
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,399
Just a bit more.

963
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,362
I have to be able
to see something to report it.

964
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,823
This won't do.

965
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:29,250
"She left her bed
and went to the princess's room."

966
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:34,339
"She turned the door handle
and opened the door."

967
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,507
"She could see a doll wearing a dress

968
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,843
and a pink wallet."

969
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,556
"In the wallet was a picture she took

970
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,602
with her mom and dad."

971
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:20,820
Are you all right?

972
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,201
I was scared to death.

973
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,136
Park Yeong-jun.

974
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,556
You're under arrest for murder
and abandonment of a corpse.

975
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:33,226
Don't move.

976
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:49,700
Get him!

977
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,577
Stay still!

978
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,495
Let go of me!

979
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,811
Good job, everyone.

980
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,033
YANG EUN-HEE
WENT MISSING IN 2002

981
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,202
Day 10,878.

982
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,873
Whether alive or dead,

983
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,125
people are all the same.

984
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,171
You're glad when you meet nice people

985
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:30,092
and happy when a day goes by
without any trouble.

986
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:35,348
Oh, there is something different.

987
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,644
If you leave without saying goodbye,

988
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,729
that's considered unfriendly,

989
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:43,981
and you'd be criticized for being rude.

990
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,025
But here,

991
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,527
it's such good news.

992
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,654
It's a good thing.

993
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,281
We are all relieved when it happens.

994
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,699
Goodbye, Eun-hee.

995
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,452
Ms. Yang,

996
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,579
goodbye.

997
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,625
Goodbye, Ms. Yang Eun-hee.

998
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,172
Thank you.

999
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:13,511
Today or tomorrow…

1000
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,389
Hurry and leave.

1001
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,571
Ha-yun.

1002
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,657
Ha-yun, are you awake?

1003
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:38,953
Ms. Yang is gone.

1004
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:45,626
You were scared when you woke up
because Eun-hee was gone?

1005
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:50,047
Did she leave like Hyeon-ji did?

1006
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:52,800
Yes.

1007
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,513
Then it's a good thing, isn't it?

1008
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:44,060
THE LATE YANG EUN-HEE

1009
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:51,567
Eun-hee, have breakfast.

1010
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,610
It's time for school.

1011
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,153
Oh, no!

1012
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,321
Mom, I'm late!

1013
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:57,239
Take your lunch with you!

1014
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,449
Hurry.

1015
01:07:58,532 --> 01:07:59,533
I'm heading out!

1016
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:02,953
Mom, are you crying?

1017
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,832
Goodness, people might think
I'm getting married or something.

1018
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,127
I'll be back every weekend.

1019
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,923
I'm not crying.

1020
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,010
I'm glad I don't have
to wake you up every morning.

1021
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,388
My doctor.

1022
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,974
Take care of yourself.

1023
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:28,312
Don't skip meals.

1024
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,481
And call me often.

1025
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,526
Okay.

1026
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,402
I'll call you once a day.

1027
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:10,980
You're still here.

1028
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:13,899
Mr. Jang.

1029
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,696
I saw the moving truck pass by
and thought I might be late.

1030
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,575
Where are you going?

1031
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,745
When Eun-hee was young,

1032
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,415
she always said
she wanted to live by the sea.

1033
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,667
I plan to do that with her this time.

1034
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,127
I see.

1035
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,213
Thank you, Mr. Jang.

1036
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,215
Not at all. I didn't do anything.

1037
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,222
You're a very good mother.

1038
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,437
What happened to Eun-hee is tragic,

1039
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,648
but you loved her very much
and never gave up.

1040
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:02,698
I'm sure that Eun-hee knows how you feel.

1041
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,285
I'm always grateful to my mom.

1042
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:11,290
Every moment I remember
is full of love and happiness.

1043
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,752
That must also be why
Hyeon-ji was always so happy.

1044
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,923
I'm sure it was the same for Hyeon-ji.

1045
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,888
When I saw on the news
that Hyeon-ji had been found,

1046
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:27,223
I envied you.

1047
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,268
I didn't even know whether
my daughter was dead or alive.

1048
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,272
But Hyeon-ji came home at least.

1049
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,316
That's what I thought.

1050
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,819
But this isn't what I wanted.

1051
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,616
I can't see her

1052
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:48,535
or touch her.

1053
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,165
How do you live with this pain?

1054
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,488
Just find my brother.

1055
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,948
I hope she's not caught again.

1056
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,742
Caught? Where?

1057
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,619
There must be proof,
but we haven't found anything yet.

1058
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,539
What are you talking about?
They killed someone!

1059
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:19,501
If nothing works, we'll just have
to find Seung-jae on our own.

1060
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,754
I can't even apologize to her now.
What do I do?

1061
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,589
It's my fault.

1062
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:26,342
There's no one else we can turn to.

1063
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,635
Please help him.

1064
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,349
You were far more important.

1065
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:38,437
