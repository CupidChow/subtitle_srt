THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,389
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,482
Dad.

4
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,488
Who?

5
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:12,947
Me?

6
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,657
Yes.

7
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,243
I'm not even married.

8
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,454
How can I be your dad?

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,039
I'm sure you're confused.

10
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,918
But I'm just as flabbergasted.

11
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,128
Why are you flabbergasted?

12
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,839
I'm flabbergasted
that you're so flabbergasted.

13
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,842
Why are you doing this?

14
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,427
Did someone put you up to this?

15
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,054
Where do you live? Who are your parents?

16
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,765
I can't answer
if you ask me everything at once.

17
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,267
Mun Bo-ra.

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,185
How old are you?

19
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,144
Fourteen.

20
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,230
-Who are your parents?
-My mom is Mun Se-yeong.

21
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,817
-Who?
-Mun Se-yeong.

22
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,028
And my dad is right here.

23
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,991
WOOK AND SE-YEONG'S 100TH DAY

24
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,202
That's you next to my mom, isn't it?

25
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,706
Although your hair looks a bit different…

26
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,042
you still look good.

27
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,303
You don't look

28
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,223
anything like Se-yeong.

29
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,391
Of course not.

30
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,684
I look like my dad.

31
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,645
See the double eyelids,
big eyes, and straight nose?

32
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,771
I'm an exact copy.

33
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,733
You're really…

34
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,404
Se-yeong's daughter?

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,197
Yes, I am.

36
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,796
What on earth is going on?

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,298
Are you filming a soap opera?

38
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,174
Where did this daughter come from?

39
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,302
Calm down, Ms. Lee.

40
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,262
Sit down first.

41
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,514
How can I be calm, Mr. Jang?

42
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,808
Wook has a daughter I didn't know about!

43
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,809
Are you her?

44
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,270
You sit down too.

45
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,189
You're driving me nuts
going back and forth.

46
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,941
How can I be still right now?

47
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,402
You're Wook's daughter?

48
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,488
No. This must be a dream.

49
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,990
She suddenly shows up and calls me Dad?

50
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,242
You two look exactly alike.

51
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,578
-No we don't!
-Calm down.

52
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,455
Don't yell!

53
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,166
-You'll scare the kid.
-I'm not a kid.

54
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,336
Look at her.

55
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,505
The way she talks back to me
at every word.

56
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,257
She's exactly like you, Wook.

57
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,301
Does Se-yeong…

58
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,553
your mom, know you're here?

59
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,305
Of course, she doesn't.

60
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,433
I wouldn't even be here
if I could get in touch with her.

61
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,727
What does that mean?

62
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,104
She couldn't contact her mom
for the last few days,

63
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,105
so she came to her dad.

64
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,815
I'm not her dad. Stop calling me that.

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,026
Okay, he's not her dad.

66
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,153
Did you report this to the police?

67
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,739
Yes, I did.

68
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,158
According to my landlord,

69
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,870
she ran away with a man and abandoned me.

70
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,415
What?

71
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,834
It's okay.

72
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,378
It doesn't hurt me anymore.

73
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,885
What's with the mood?

74
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,432
So why did you come here?

75
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,851
Well…

76
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,106
May I stay here for a while?

77
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,483
What?

78
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,277
No way!

79
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,988
There's no reason why she can't.

80
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,699
It makes no difference
whether it's three people or four.

81
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,033
Mr. Jang.

82
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,160
Bo-ra.

83
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,039
It's only been three hours since we met…

84
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,919
I'm on a diet.

85
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,296
What nonsense!

86
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,588
You're a growing child.

87
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,300
Let's all eat something
before we talk more.

88
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,552
I'm dying of hunger here.

89
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,221
Ms. Lee, can I talk to you for a minute?

90
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,139
Come here.

91
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,851
Come on, Ms. Lee.

92
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,477
Let's talk.

93
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,299
Use this room tonight.

94
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,177
I'll be sleeping with Mr. Jang
in the room across the hall.

95
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,846
Is this your room?

96
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,515
Let's just make one thing clear.

97
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,310
The man in the photo is me,

98
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,604
but that doesn't prove that I'm your dad.

99
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,940
Do you understand?

100
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,817
Yes.

101
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,944
That the man in the picture is my dad.

102
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,408
I mean the man in the picture is me.

103
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,536
But I'm not your dad.

104
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,498
I understand.

105
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,959
The picture is you,
but it's not proof that you're my dad.

106
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,754
Then it's also not proof
that you're not my dad.

107
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,838
Right?

108
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,548
You don't let anything go.

109
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,342
Who do you really take after?

110
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,052
I take after you.

111
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,887
The other man also said that.

112
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,848
I really can't get used to
being called a dad.

113
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,558
It's the same for me too.

114
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,770
I haven't called anyone that in 14 years.
I also feel awkward.

115
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,483
I'll only stay until my mom comes home.

116
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,528
This isn't the first time
she's left the home.

117
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,071
She'll come back.

118
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,282
Did Se-yeong leave home often?

119
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,077
She often stayed out for a night or two.

120
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,787
Sometimes she stayed out longer.

121
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,207
She would always call me, though.

122
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,795
So I decided not to wait
for her from now on.

123
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,549
I don't like how my neighbors pity me.

124
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,552
And I don't want to deal with my landlord.

125
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,013
What did your landlord do?

126
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,391
Nothing serious. Just this and that.

127
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,685
Like what? Tell me everything.

128
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,857
She said that I was behind on rent
where my neighbors could hear.

129
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,984
I'm too embarrassed to stay there.

130
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,656
You must be tired.

131
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,201
You can sleep here for now. Get some rest.

132
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,806
It's not like I came here
because I wanted to.

133
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,601
I came

134
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,686
because you're my dad.

135
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,442
Mom.

136
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,903
Dad says

137
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,405
he's not my dad.

138
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,961
Mun Se-yeong's phone number.

139
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,428
The phone is off. Please leave…

140
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,648
Are you asleep?

141
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,401
What do you think?

142
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,242
She's really not your daughter?

143
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,161
People say the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

144
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,581
I can't have a kid
when I'm not even married.

145
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,252
You don't have to be married
to have a kid.

146
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,003
That's what people say.

147
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,756
I'm not the one who said it.

148
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,386
Anyway, the kid didn't do anything wrong.

149
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,765
What are you saying?

150
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,143
Even if you're not really her dad

151
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,480
and you may feel wronged,

152
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,900
Bo-ra is blameless in all this.

153
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,862
She didn't ask to be born.

154
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:36,117
It wasn't her fault
that she grew up without a father.

155
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,954
I know that.

156
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,248
That's fine then.

157
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,042
By the way, is Bo-ra's mom okay?

158
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,088
According to Bo-ra,
she usually comes home after a while.

159
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,049
Still, I should contact her.

160
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,509
Do that.

161
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,095
They'll feel at ease
if they know the other is okay.

162
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,388
So look into it.

163
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,309
You two really do look a lot alike.

164
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,812
-She's really not your kid?
-Come on!

165
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,022
Goodness.

166
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,566
I'm not deaf. Don't yell at me.

167
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,694
You know what?

168
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,781
You're fun to tease.

169
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,994
Sure, you can laugh about this.

170
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:25,166
You must've had a wild youth.

171
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,794
Oh, boy.

172
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,180
Are you really Wook's daughter?

173
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,807
I think so.

174
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,560
You "think so"?

175
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,147
Then it's not for certain?

176
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,815
Are you dad's girlfriend?

177
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,733
What?

178
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,860
Does it look that way?

179
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,737
No.

180
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,281
I see.

181
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,991
Please drop me off here.

182
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,743
Okay.

183
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,126
-What time do you finish?
-I can get home by myself.

184
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,878
Thank you for the ride.

185
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,630
Sure.

186
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,637
She's nothing like Wook.

187
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,972
Wook is not sensible like she is.

188
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,183
She's a smart one for sure.

189
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,061
-Mr. Jang!
-Hi!

190
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,024
Oh, dear. Ha-yun!

191
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:33,943
Oh, dear.

192
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,611
Oh, no.

193
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,154
Are you okay, Ha-yun?

194
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,073
You shouldn't have run!

195
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,908
You could have just walked.

196
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,410
I'm okay.

197
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,787
But it does hurt a little.

198
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,589
What was it that you wanted to give me?

199
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,924
Oh, it's this.

200
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,093
A key?

201
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,762
It's a key to the treasure box.

202
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,641
Hyeon-ji kept the box, and I kept the key.

203
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,561
What's in the box?

204
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,354
Our treasures.

205
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,859
She put in a family photo and a letter.

206
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,987
But the treasure box is gone.

207
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,367
After Hyeon-ji left, the box disappeared,

208
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,911
and only the key was left behind?

209
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,040
So I wanted to give this to you.

210
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,669
When you give something as a gift,
it doesn't disappear,

211
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,380
even when I'm gone.

212
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,223
I see.

213
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:53,147
I will keep it safe.

214
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,903
Thank you.

215
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,769
Here's Bo-ra's overdue rent.

216
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,396
Why are you giving this to me?

217
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,148
It's okay. You can take it.

218
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,150
I'll take it, but still…

219
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,569
Who is it?

220
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,283
Hello. The front gate was open.

221
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm…

222
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,703
I'm a friend of Mun Se-yeong.

223
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,585
A friend of Mun Se-yeong?

224
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,088
She sure has a lot of male friends.

225
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,423
Bo-ra's mom is not home,
and neither is Bo-ra.

226
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,634
Yes, I know that.

227
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,471
So how much is the overdue rent?

228
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,976
I just received it
from this detective here.

229
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,395
Is it really okay for me to take this?

230
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,605
-Well…
-Of course.

231
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,315
You should absolutely take it.

232
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,902
It's from a police officer,
so you can certainly take it.

233
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,910
By the way,

234
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,371
if you happen to hear any strange rumors,

235
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,373
please let me know.

236
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,333
Strange rumors?

237
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,710
You know,

238
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,964
rumors saying she abandoned her daughter
and ran away or whatever.

239
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,676
People who spread
unfounded rumors without proof

240
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,929
should be sued for defamation.

241
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,017
Then they'll realize just how hard
and frustrating it can be.

242
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,435
And it stays on your records.

243
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,770
And you know what Bo-ra's like.

244
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,772
Seventh grade is a very sensitive time.

245
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,274
And if she hears those rumors?

246
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,191
"Hey, lady."

247
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,860
"Did you see my mom run away?"

248
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,653
"Did you actually see her do that?"

249
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,072
Just thinking about it
gives me goosebumps.

250
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,991
Right, Detective Shin?

251
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,784
Doesn't this happen a lot these days?

252
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,497
Right, that happens sometimes.

253
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,458
It happens often these days.

254
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,378
I've never heard rumors like that.

255
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,380
Of course not.

256
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,883
You seem like someone
who's very cultured and refined.

257
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,219
Like someone who would scold others
for spreading rumors like that.

258
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,681
Yes, I am kind of like that.

259
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,394
Here.

260
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,899
Hey, this isn't cheap.

261
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,400
No, it's not.

262
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,154
You really are from a rich family,
buying things like this.

263
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,074
My grandmother is rich, not me.

264
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,575
I paid for this with my salary.

265
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,702
Police officers must make a lot,

266
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,622
seeing how you easily pay off
other people's rent like that.

267
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,831
"Easily"?

268
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,002
That was the money I'd saved up
for months to buy a new computer.

269
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,296
Gosh.

270
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,385
But why were you going to pay her rent?

271
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,720
Are you really Mun Se-yeong's friend?

272
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,972
And how do you know Bo-ra?

273
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,057
Well…

274
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,228
I was going to pay Bo-ra's rent
so that she wouldn't be discouraged.

275
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,564
But since you already paid,
I guess I don't have to.

276
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,943
I really am a friend of Se-yeong.

277
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,027
And Bo-ra…

278
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,864
I don't know.

279
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,033
She suddenly showed up
and told me I'm her dad.

280
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,286
Hey.

281
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,372
That's disgusting.

282
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,498
My goodness.

283
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,293
Dad?

284
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,547
Bo-ra is your daughter?

285
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,674
I'm not her dad.

286
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,925
I'm still single.

287
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,678
So what's your relationship
with Mun Se-yeong?

288
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,471
You seem to be more than just friends.

289
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,140
Se-yeong and I are friends,

290
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,392
but I haven't seen her in 15 years.

291
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,603
Anyway, Bo-ra will be staying
with us for a while.

292
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,190
But she's quite a girl.
I wonder who she takes after.

293
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,984
She's really not your--

294
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,777
She's not!

295
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,946
It's not what you're thinking, okay?

296
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,489
I'm leaving.

297
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,079
You're not mistreating her
or anything, right?

298
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,002
Get in.

299
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,213
It's okay. I can go home on my own.

300
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,381
I'm on my way home too.

301
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,091
Get in. Let's go together.

302
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,897
I can take the bus home.

303
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,441
I happened to be passing by.

304
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,905
So how long do you plan to stay with us?

305
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,408
Did Dad tell you to ask me?

306
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,535
Is he uncomfortable with me here?

307
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,288
No. He's not like that.

308
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,248
I'm asking because I want to know.

309
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,670
Until my mom comes back.

310
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,591
Are there any places
you'd often go with your mom?

311
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,177
Places where she might have gone.

312
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,222
No.

313
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,725
If I manage to get a part-time job
before she comes back, I'll leave.

314
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,186
Hey, you got it all wrong!

315
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,563
I was just asking so I can investigate.

316
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,235
And you're too young
to work a part-time job.

317
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,445
We're not going to kick you out.

318
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,614
Forget all that
and just focus on your studies.

319
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,368
Jong-a.

320
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,204
No need to thank me.

321
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,749
Do you have a crush on my dad?

322
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,793
What?

323
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,420
Hey.

324
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,465
He doesn't have a good job,
and he's been behind on his rent.

325
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,217
As if I would.

326
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,886
Do you like people
just because they're good-looking?

327
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,889
Forget all that nonsense and just study.

328
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,351
She does like him.

329
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,611
This is the room I use for studying.

330
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,779
You can use this room.

331
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,907
Here's the key to the front gate.

332
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,951
I'll text you the passcode.

333
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,913
This is so nice.

334
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,585
Get some rest.

335
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,754
Or you can study or do your homework.

336
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,558
They say to keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

337
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,520
For now, this is the best option.

338
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,067
You're not going home?

339
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,319
No.

340
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,612
See this?

341
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,156
This is the key
to Hyeon-ji's treasure box.

342
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,490
Ha-yun gave it to me.

343
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,452
You can come back later and look at it.

344
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,080
This used to be hers.
I can't leave this behind here.

345
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,709
You're right.
I'm sure that belonged to Hyeon-ji.

346
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,794
But you sent Hyeon-ji on her way.

347
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,214
She's not here anymore.

348
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,883
It's because Hyeon-ji isn't here.

349
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,970
I was her dad,
but I was always a step behind her.

350
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,305
But now that I can,

351
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,307
I want to know everything.

352
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,309
Where she sat, what she touched,

353
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,561
what she ate, and what she talked about.

354
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,898
Wook.

355
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,445
Wook.

356
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,239
You…

357
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,221
RECIPIENT: KIM WOOK

358
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,983
PLEASE NOTIFY SENDER OF NEW ADDRESS

359
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,574
Professor Jung usually becomes
sleepy early evening,

360
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,951
so he turns in early.

361
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,203
Hye-ju can't drink a drop of alcohol.

362
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,539
Il-yong is too young, so he's no fun.

363
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,001
By Professor Jung,

364
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,252
you mean the principal?

365
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,253
Yes.

366
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,839
I heard he used to be
a Korean Literature professor.

367
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,300
Scholarly things come out
whenever he opens his mouth.

368
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,343
Apparently, he also
published several books.

369
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,804
So how did he end up here?

370
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,764
Let me see.

371
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,600
That man…

372
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,395
So his name

373
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,065
is Jung Young-jin.

374
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,692
Right?

375
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,573
Jung Young-jin.

376
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,699
Now tell me.

377
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,034
Oh, dear.

378
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,494
Are you planning to find
the bodies of everyone here?

379
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,750
-Then leave him out.
-What?

380
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,751
He said

381
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,337
he should never be found.

382
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,838
Why not?

383
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,341
Ten years ago,
he was diagnosed with cancer.

384
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,800
After hearing it was terminal,

385
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,219
he went to a place
no one would find out and jumped.

386
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,891
After his wife died young,
he met someone new when he grew old.

387
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,479
His grown children objected,
so he couldn't officially marry her.

388
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,565
They were likely worried about
sharing their inheritance.

389
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:43,528
But his kids all lived overseas
and barely called him once a year.

390
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,782
Why did he jump? He should have
fought harder to live instead.

391
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,493
There was a sad reason.

392
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:54,372
After he retired,
the couple lived on his pension.

393
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,333
If he passed away,

394
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,377
she'd have nowhere to live
with nothing but what's on her back.

395
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,671
She didn't even have a child
she could depend on.

396
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,006
She was also frail.

397
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,469
"Since I'm already a dead man walking,

398
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,806
I would like you to live
on my pension while you're alive."

399
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,182
He told her that and left.

400
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,813
Everyone has a sad story.

401
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,981
It's a pity.
Everyone here has a sad story.

402
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,447
Let me see that.

403
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,157
Why? It's mine.

404
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,159
I'm not going to take it. Just let me see.

405
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,704
Why are you staring at it like that?

406
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,873
Where did you get this?

407
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,458
Ha-yun gave it to me earlier.

408
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,252
Ha-yun gave you…

409
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,380
This is it.

410
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,925
Follow me, Mr. Jang.

411
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:47,926
Where are we going?

412
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,761
That's mine!

413
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,596
Give that back!

414
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,765
But that's…

415
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,233
What's all this?

416
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,986
What is this place?

417
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,113
It's the room of memories.

418
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,906
"Room of memories"?

419
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,617
Yes. That's what I call this place.

420
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,671
This picture is my most precious item.

421
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,049
It's a bit embarrassing to give you this.

422
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,802
It's the book I wrote.

423
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,637
Goodness.

424
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,017
This is what I treasure the most.

425
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,686
I'll keep it safe for you.

426
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,691
This isn't special, but if it's okay…

427
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:16,097
The memories of those
who stopped by this village

428
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,141
have all been kept here for 30 years.

429
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,603
I keep forgetting,

430
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,689
so I have to do this to remember
to whom each of these belongs.

431
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,317
HAN SO-MI
FROM JULY 11, 1976

432
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,569
Wait a minute.

433
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,615
She's worse than Thomas.

434
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,828
Here it is!

435
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,165
It's Hyeon-ji's.

436
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:45,877
Yes.

437
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,671
Come here and take a look.

438
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,880
Okay!

439
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:54,177
I was curious about what was inside
but didn't have the key.

440
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,804
I had forgotten about this.

441
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,265
Why didn't I think of Ha-yun?

442
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,059
They were best friends.

443
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,743
I thought it was gone!

444
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,331
I'm more surprised than you.

445
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,710
Hyeon-ji came to me one day with this

446
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,629
and said this treasure box
should be kept in the treasure room.

447
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,090
She said she'd stop by
once in a while to look at it.

448
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,844
And here you are
with the key to the treasure box.

449
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,887
I just took it
because Ha-yun gave it to me.

450
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,723
Right.

451
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,642
Hyeon-ji, that smart girl.

452
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,352
That was why she gave me the box

453
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,564
and gave the key to Ha-yun.

454
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,779
Here.

455
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,325
You're the rightful owner of this box.

456
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,410
Thank you.

457
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,203
Thank you.

458
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,455
Thank you, Captain Kang.

459
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,707
Thank you.

460
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,916
Thank you.

461
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,710
Thank you.

462
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,218
Thank you.

463
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,556
The phone is off. Please leave…

464
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,771
MOM

465
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,731
Fine.

466
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,858
I won't try to get in touch anymore.

467
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,152
You live your life.

468
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,701
Yes?

469
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,536
Are you asleep?

470
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,454
No.

471
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,247
May I come in?

472
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:47,957
Yes.

473
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,722
How's school?

474
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,308
I saw many bad things on the news.

475
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,102
No one's bullying you at school?

476
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,896
Why do you ask that as if you're my dad?

477
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,147
You said you're not.

478
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,276
Parents aren't the only ones
who can ask that.

479
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,529
Social interest.

480
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,197
The duty of adults.

481
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,408
Don't you know that?

482
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:25,620
I'm not an adult, so I wouldn't know
what the duty of adults is.

483
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,666
Who does she take after?

484
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,379
Do you talk back to your mom like this,

485
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,839
argue with her,

486
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,257
and run away from home?

487
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,508
I told you.

488
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,677
Mom's the one who usually runs away.

489
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,178
I don't do things like that.

490
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,805
Running away only brings suffering.

491
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,766
I'm most comfortable at home,
even if it is a basement.

492
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,936
You're right. Good.

493
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,605
Why run away and leave a comfortable home?

494
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,359
Are you mocking me for being here?

495
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,154
Not at all.

496
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,780
Why would I do that?

497
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,242
If you leave, then that really counts
as running away. Got it?

498
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,204
What?

499
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,959
You're really not my dad?

500
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,680
Let's pretend that I am

501
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,308
until your mom comes back.

502
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,935
Call me whatever you'd like to call me.

503
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,021
It's late.

504
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,105
Go to bed.

505
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:40,904
Dad.

506
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,707
What?

507
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:55,919
Nothing.

508
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,504
I just tried it out.

509
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,592
You better not run away from home.

510
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,896
"Let's pretend that I am."

511
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,816
"Call me whatever you'd like to call me."

512
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:50,849
Who was that?

513
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,640
Are you leaving already?

514
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,809
I'm late from sleeping in
because of you, Dad.

515
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,227
I'll see you later.

516
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,396
Have a good day.

517
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,069
Where are you going so early?

518
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,071
I'm off to meet a realtor.

519
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,032
A realtor? Why?

520
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,242
There's something I have to do. Bye!

521
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,327
Bye.

522
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,540
Why is everyone so diligent?

523
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,963
Hello, Mr. Principal!

524
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:04,881
Hello.

525
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,299
Hello, Mr. Jang.

526
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,802
Are you coming back from the field?

527
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,930
Oh, these?

528
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,516
I'm going to weed the school's flowerbed.

529
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,394
-Oh.
-I was afraid it'd hurt the kids.

530
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,229
There's a field day soon too.

531
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,689
Good idea. Hand me those.

532
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,942
-I'll do it.
-No. Not at all.

533
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,526
I can do this myself.

534
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,029
Besides, you only just got here.

535
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,574
I've always been sorry for doing nothing
but eating and playing around.

536
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,202
-Here. I'll do it.
-Come on.

537
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,120
The school is this way, right?

538
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,080
Yes.

539
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,289
I'll do it.

540
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,210
If Hyeon-ji were here,

541
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,505
she'd have a bone to pick with me
about making her dad work.

542
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,676
How was my Hyeon-ji?

543
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,095
Can't you tell by looking at Ha-yun?

544
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:57,558
They say if you don't know your kid well,
you should look at their friends.

545
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,477
Look at Ha-yun.

546
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,814
She's bright, smart, and may look aloof,

547
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,023
but she's a softie.

548
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,109
She's always taking care of others.

549
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,486
That's right.

550
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,240
Ha-yun's just a little kid,

551
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,450
but she's such a considerate person.

552
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,246
Hyeon-ji was the same.

553
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,126
Ha-yun and Hyeon-ji
even spoke in a similar manner.

554
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,628
Probably because they were together
for several years.

555
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,047
They were like twins.

556
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,720
After Hyeon-ji left,
she was probably upset the most,

557
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,596
but she never let it show.

558
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:41,728
Then one day,
I asked Ha-yun if she missed Hyeon-ji.

559
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,522
She said she was enduring it.

560
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,860
Because if she's sad,
then Yeong-rim would also be sad.

561
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,112
Oh, dear.

562
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,781
I'm an old man
and even I didn't consider that,

563
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,366
yet Ha-yun did.

564
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,164
I see.

565
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,918
By the way,

566
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,547
you look quite young.

567
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,260
I look young?

568
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:19,057
I heard that you already retired
and were living on your pension.

569
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,479
I often hear that I look young for my age.

570
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,273
Probably because
I'm with kids all the time.

571
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,399
Oh, over there.

572
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,486
Please weed that flowerbed over there.

573
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,279
Thanks for your help.

574
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,449
I'll just go clean up the backyard then.

575
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,034
You go on ahead. Over there?

576
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,660
-Yes, that's it.
-Okay.

577
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,842
I'm home!

578
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,302
I'm home too.

579
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,971
You guys left together
and came home together too?

580
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,389
Yes, I guess so.

581
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,604
-What's all that?
-We have to eat dinner.

582
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,689
Jong-a.

583
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,858
Yes?

584
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,360
You're cooking?

585
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,820
Yes.

586
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,593
I can do everything by myself.

587
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,680
I just need you to help a bit.

588
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,598
When you can't even peel potatoes?

589
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,310
Please set the table.

590
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,813
Yes, sure.

591
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,481
The chopsticks were here?

592
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,152
The chopsticks were…

593
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,529
I'll do it.

594
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,074
Jong-a, you…

595
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,201
Why don't you just sit still?

596
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:06,122
The last time you cooked,
you burned all the pots.

597
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,540
I'll…

598
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,708
I'll do it.

599
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,126
I'll do it.

600
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,883
You really cooked
all this by yourself, Bo-ra?

601
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,260
I helped prep the ingredients.

602
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,846
Great, Jong-a.
You continue to do just that.

603
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,556
Don't cook if you can help it.

604
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,183
Wook.

605
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,101
I'm good at making pasta too.

606
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,813
Bo-ra, is there anything you can't do?

607
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,523
I heard you're also a good student.

608
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,441
There isn't.

609
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,277
I also wish
there was something I was bad at.

610
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,780
The taste is what matters
when it comes to food.

611
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,199
Let's eat.

612
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,958
It's delicious! Isn't it good, Jong-a?

613
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,794
You're not bad.

614
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,924
Is everyone free this weekend?

615
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,134
Cancel any other plans.
We're going somewhere.

616
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,844
Sorry?

617
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,393
Ta-da! I'd like to introduce you

618
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,897
to the first branch of So Good Coffee.

619
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,066
Coffee?

620
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,067
Is it a café?

621
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,944
I even signed a contract.

622
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,362
Let's go!

623
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,573
Stop joking. Why are we here?

624
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,041
What do you think?

625
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,211
Are you serious?

626
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,546
You're going to open a café here?

627
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,464
Yes.

628
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,549
Ever heard of an industrial café?

629
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,845
It will look great with a bit of work.

630
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,348
You really rented this place?

631
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,474
Yes.

632
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,269
How could you?
You could have discussed it…

633
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,812
with us first.

634
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,898
Hey, let's go outside.

635
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,233
It's too dusty in here.

636
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:00,778
Hurry up.

637
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,035
Where's the restroom, Jong-a?

638
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,079
It's right around the corner.

639
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,205
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

640
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,086
This place is close to the village
where Hyeon-ji used to live,

641
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:21,173
and the profit from this café
will be used to find the villagers.

642
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,176
You really do think differently
than the rest of us.

643
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,761
I always have a plan.

644
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,139
I succeeded last night, remember?

645
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,307
-Last night?
-Yes.

646
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,433
What did you do?

647
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,143
You are so clueless.

648
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,769
I made Bo-ra cook last night.

649
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,566
After school, she's always in her room
staring into space.

650
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,693
Sometimes she even cries.

651
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,404
She only acts tough.

652
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,490
She may say that she doesn't need
a mom who abandoned her,

653
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,700
but she's still a kid.

654
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:51,620
-So you went grocery shopping on purpose?
-Yes.

655
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,748
I casually asked her
when giving her a ride,

656
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,750
and she said she was the one
who cooked at home.

657
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,127
I figured cooking would be
a good distraction

658
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,628
and also a confidence booster.

659
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,088
And we get to eat good food.

660
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,132
Wow. You're the best, Jong-a.

661
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,134
Thanks.

662
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,344
That's it?

663
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,598
It's because of the dust.

664
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,807
Do you have water?

665
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,684
It's in the car. I'll go get it.

666
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,602
Wait.

00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,094

Bo-ra.

675
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,807
If you wish to talk to the caller…

676
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,685
Mun Se-yeong?

677
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,438
Who is this?

678
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,731
Who are you?

679
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,899

680
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,485
What did you do to Bo-ra?

00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,320
I…

682
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,905
This is Wook. Kim Wook.

Kim Wook?

684
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,287
Bo-ra's at my place, so don't worry.

685
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,246
Where are you?

686
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,915
Are you all right?

688
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,338
I'm…

689
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,426
Se-yeong.

690
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,261

692
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,106
Don't kill me!

693
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,983
I just wanted to know
if my daughter was okay!

694
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,485
I just wanted one phone call!

695
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,529
-I didn't say anything!
-Didn't you hear me?

696
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,489
I told you to behave.

697
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,908
Because of you, I'm about to be killed.

698
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,285
I'm sorry.

699
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,204
I'm sorry!

00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,373

Mister, please. Don't hurt me.

00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,668
Please just let me see my daughter.

00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,878
Mister!

704
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,550
Detective Oh, play this.

705
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,301
What's this?

706
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,136
The dashcam footage
from the cab outside the shop

707
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,846
when Mun Se-yeong disappeared.

708
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,265
She has to be on this, right?

709
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,141
I hope so.

710
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,402
-This is her, isn't it?
-Yes.

711
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,656
What? Why is she hesitating?

712
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,456
Hey, right there.

713
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,042
Find a better shot of his face
and take a screenshot.

714
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:07,960
Yes, sir.

715
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,671
Anything on the customer
who was with her that day?

716
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,964
-Lee Gyeong-seon?
-Yes.

717
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,757
He disappeared without a trace.

718
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,686
This is Shin Jun-ho.

719
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,229
I just received a call from Se-yeong.

720
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,065
I texted you the number.

721
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,611
Okay. I'll be there too.

722
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,572
What's wrong? What happened?

723
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,906
Se-yeong called.

724
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,408
Bo-ra's mom?

725
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,743
Where is she? Is she okay?

726
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,827
The call was cut off.

727
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,579
-Jong-a.
-Yes?

728
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,582
I'm heading over to Detective Shin.
You go home with Bo-ra.

729
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,542
Wook!

730
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,548
KIM WOOK

731
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,438
Mun Se-yeong called from here.

732
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:13,525
Have forensics collect DNA
and fingerprints while we look around.

733
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,777
Yes, sir.

734
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,656
Please secure security videos
on all cars that entered Route 388.

735
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,366
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

736
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,039
Good day.

737
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,208
You can't go in there.

738
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,335
-Right. I know that.
-No, you can't.

739
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,212
He's with me.

740
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,006
Detective Shin, how did it go?

741
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,425
-Did you find her?
-No.

742
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,304
She called Bo-ra from that pay phone.

743
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,515
You said the call was cut off, right?

744
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,474
Yes.

745
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,017
I asked her where she was.

746
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,437
She was about to answer
when the call suddenly ended.

747
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,273
She sounded anxious,
as if she was being chased.

748
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,749
Se-yeong was here?

749
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,000
I think so.

750
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,045
I don't see signs of a fight
or bloodstains, though.

751
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,215
She should have called
the police if she was in danger

752
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,466
instead of calling Bo-ra.

753
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,012
There must've been a reason
why she couldn't report it.

754
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:54,895
Wook?

755
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,147
Thank you.

756
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,692
How did it go?

757
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,277
What do you think?

758
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,154
Sir, did you find my mom?

759
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,823
We're looking for her.

760
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,706
Bo-ra, there's something
I want to ask you.

761
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,128
Go upstairs to your room.

762
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,130
Let's go.

763
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:30,806
What is it?

764
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,267
You said she wasn't your daughter.

765
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,978
Is she actually your daughter?

766
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,231
She's not. How could you ask me that?

767
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,526
Instead of just repeating yourself,
prove it.

768
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,486
There's a thing called a paternity test.

769
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,698
She had nowhere to go
after her mom went missing.

770
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,784
She may act tough,
but imagine how scared she must be.

771
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,995
She's only 14 years old.

772
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,163
In this house,

773
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,833
you're the only one who ever scolds her.

774
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,751
I'm just going along with it.

775
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,297
I don't want to hurt her pride
by pitying her.

776
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,677
What's your relationship with Bo-ra's mom?

777
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,305
I've known her for a long time.

778
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:13,974
My goodness!

779
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,976
It's gotten late already.

780
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,896
Kids need lots of sleep
if they want to grow tall, right?

781
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,648
You have school tomorrow too.

782
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,113
One would think
she's really his biological daughter.

783
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,201
Do you recognize this?

784
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:34,828
Is this your mom's?

785
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,416
It is my mom's.

786
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,792
Where did you find this?

787
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,586
Where is my mom right now?

788
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,341
We found a site where she might've been.

789
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,884
It was on the ground near there.

790
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,471
Does she know anyone who lives in Inju?

791
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,139
A relative or a friend?

792
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,018
No. We've never been to Inju.

793
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,020
She's lived in Seoul all her life.

794
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,106
Then…

795
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,067
It's a bit blurry,

796
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,527
but do you recognize this person?

797
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,571
Have you seen him with your mom?

798
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,616
Is he the one she's with?

799
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,493
She ran away with this man?

800
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,789
No. That's not what it is.

801
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,127
You'll be able to meet your mom soon.

802
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,463
Don't worry about it too much,
and stay calm.

803
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,092
What a nice room.

804
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,891
Wow, they grew so big.

805
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,436
They're the mutts
from Duon Village, right?

806
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,647
Who are you calling "mutts"?

807
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,900
Janggun, Meonggun.
They have names, you know.

808
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,236
Who's that?

809
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,278
That's Jjamppong.

810
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,530
Meonggun's puppy.

811
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,323
We don't know who the dad is.

812
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,244
Don't eat that, Jjamppong.

813
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,540
I'm sorry I barged in here late at night.

814
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,709
So you do know that it was rude of you.

815
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,752
By the way,

816
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,755
what was the long talk with Bo-ra about?

817
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,508
I had to ask her and confirm a few things.

818
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,885
We have a picture of an unknown man.

819
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,846
I wanted to know if she knew him.

820
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,222
Has she seen him before?

821
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,598
She hasn't.

822
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,308
But I think that man

823
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,311
took Mun Se-yeong.

824
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,149
Then Mun Se-yeong was kidnapped?

825
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,902
Did you tell her
that her mom was kidnapped?

826
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,614
I couldn't tell her that.
I was afraid she'd be shocked.

827
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,536
Let me see the picture.

828
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,454
Okay.

829
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,839
-The man who took Jeong-ah.
-Choi Jeong-ah?

830
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,466
-The one in the wedding dress?
-Yes.

831
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,969
Jeong-ah exited the bridal shop
and got in his car.

832
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:59,306
I found him after looking through
a bunch of dashcam footage.

833
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,640
I even reported it.

834
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,019
-When did you report it?
-A few days ago.

835
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,146
I thought the police were looking for him.

836
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,483
Give me that phone.
Let me take a closer look.

837
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,833
Where were you today?
You even turned off your phone.

838
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,460
Oh.

839
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,670
I had to see someone.

840
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,088
Who?

841
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,216
Your girlfriend?

842
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,093
Girlfriend, my foot.

843
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,931
GOLIATH

844
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,265
Let's just make the delivery.

845
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,100
DROP-OFF AT CHAEYEONG VILLA
IN MIJEONG-DONG

846
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,891
Chaeyeong Villa,
on top of the second outdoor unit.

847
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,313
Drop-off completed.

848
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,567
Chaeyeong Villa,
on top of the second outdoor unit.

849
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,592
Goodness, you're still here.

850
00:52:59,092 --> 00:52:59,926
What a relief.

851
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,639
Why did you ask me to wait?

852
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,725
Hye-ju's parents' home address.

853
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,685
The principal brought it over
early in the morning.

854
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,022
This year marks
her parents' 70th birthday.

855
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,983
She was lamenting that
she couldn't do anything for them.

856
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,402
That's sad.

857
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,362
You want me to go see how they're doing?

858
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,530
Yes.

859
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,575
Also, I'm going to check
Ro-ha's home while I'm at it.

860
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,202
What happened to asking Wook for help?

861
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,831
I haven't seen him yet.

862
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,291
He must be busy.

863
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:32,876
I'll see you later.

864
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,545
Be careful out there!

865
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,992
Oh, my goodness.

866
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,327
Gosh.

867
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,788
Back here again.

868
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,999
This is a prison.

869
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,522
Hyeon-ji.

870
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,785
Ha-yun and Hyeon-ji
even spoke in a similar manner.

871
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,913
Probably because they were together
for several years.

872
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,999
They were like twins.

873
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,589
Good morning.

874
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,341
Detective Shin.

875
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:07,137
The Missing Persons Team seems
to be doing great these days.

876
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,016
Team Leader Baek seemed overjoyed
after getting complimented by the chief.

877
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,643
That's not going
to bring back dead victims.

878
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,271
You're starting to sound like Il-du.

879
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:20,108
What's up?
I'm sure you're not here to have fun.

880
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,402
Why isn't there a notice out
for Choi Jeong-ah's murder suspect?

881
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,903
I heard an informant reported him.

882
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,655
The dashcam footage?

883
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,658
I can't determine his identity from that.
The license plate was also fake.

884
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,744
You should have spread his photo at least.

885
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,620
Damn it. Hey.

886
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,582
Who are you to tell us
how to manage our case?

887
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,333
Because you guys aren't doing your jobs.

888
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,627
-This little punk…
-Hey!

889
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,254
Stop it. Sit down.

890
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,213
I said sit down!

891
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,595
Shin Jun-ho,

892
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,805
we're also investigating the case.

893
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,226
This guy also kidnapped
someone else besides Cho Jeong-ah.

894
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,520
-Who?
-Mun Se-yeong.

895
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,855
She has a teenage daughter.

896
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:00,732
Mun Se-yeong?

897
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,986
Never heard of her.

898
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:09,157
Then I'll investigate this guy
assuming he has nothing to do with drugs.

899
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,494
Then you wouldn't know
Lee Gyeong-seon either?

900
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,412
Who's that?

901
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,749
He also disappeared
the night that Mun Se-yeong did.

902
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:18,666
Just in case.

903
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,043
Have a good day.

904
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:26,633
So the Drug Squad seems
to know something but won't say?

905
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,550
Yes.

906
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,678
They definitely didn't seem
to know Mun Se-yeong,

907
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:34,015
but when I mentioned Lee Gyeong-seon,
a team member looked over at me.

908
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:38,436
What's the relationship
between Mun Se-yeong and Lee Gyeong-seon?

909
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,607
Lee Gyeong-seon was a customer
at the bar Mun Se-yeong worked at.

910
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,983
They both disappeared that night.

911
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,694
The employee said
Gyeong-seon was very drunk that night,

912
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,279
so Se-yeong went into that room.

913
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,032
However, I don't think
he was intoxicated by alcohol

914
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,243
but by drugs.

915
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,620
Anyway, for now…

916
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,832
he's the key.

917
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,209
The Drug Squad said
they're also investigating him.

918
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:07,841
You startled me.

919
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,093
-What?
-Sir.

920
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,010
What?

921
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,513
Let's make this an open investigation.

922
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,266
Open investigation?

923
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,811
If we do that, Mun Se-yeong could be
put in greater danger.

924
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:23,690
Whether on the run or captured,
they'll watch the news.

925
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,525
They won't be able to act rashly.

926
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,990
So you want to do an open investigation?

927
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,076
What about him?

928
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,162
This is just wrong.

929
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,123
He's not feeding, walking,

930
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,624
or playing with his dogs.

931
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,669
You're just worried
about Mr. Jang, aren't you?

932
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,505
I know it's because of Hyeon-ji.

933
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,467
But I'm just worried
that he might take a turn for the worse.

934
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,137
I'm going to stop by a furniture shop,
then go to the café.

935
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,847
Bring him to the café.

936
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:59,517
The police are openly investigating
the disappearance of a woman in her 30s.

937
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,687
-Are you listening, Wook?
-They're continuing to investigate,

938
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,314
-but so far…
-Jong-a.

939
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,733
I have to go. I'll see you later.

940
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,610
Reporter Kim Ye-ri with the story.

941
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:11,112
A woman walks out of a building.

942
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,114
Mun has been missing for two weeks,

943
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,159
and this was the last time
that she was seen.

944
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:20,038
Mun, who had been working in a bar,
went to work on August 6th…

945
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,628
Yes.

946
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,966
I'm aware of the shipment
that's coming in tonight.

947
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,929
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

948
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:37,388
Goodbye.

949
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,811
PUBLIC SAFETY MESSAGE
POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR MUN SE-YEONG…

950
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,611
MISSING FOR 16 DAYS,
POLICE OPEN INVESTIGATION

951
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:10,588
Wook!

952
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,425
Kim Wook!

953
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,118
Did you see the news about Bo-ra's mom?

954
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,078
-She apparently worked in a bar.
-Really?

955
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,538
She lives with just her mom.

956
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,124
She probably doesn't even know her dad.

957
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:47,959
Hey, girls.

958
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,170
-Are you in seventh grade?
-Yes.

959
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:52,922
What's it to you?

960
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,549
-Class Seven?
-Yes.

961
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,343
You must be in the same class as Bo-ra.

962
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,636
Are you her friends?

963
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,097
Mun Bo-ra?

964
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,849
Who are you?

965
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:05,893
I'm her dad.

966
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:10,940
Bo-ra.

967
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,234
Why didn't you say anything?

968
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,278
I didn't want the attention.

969
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,779
I see.

970
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,782
It must've been hard
going through this on your own.

971
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:21,826
Yes?

972
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,413
Hello.

973
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,876
Your friends told me that you were here.

974
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,086
Who are you?

975
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,631
I'm Bo-ra's guardian.

976
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,050
I'm sorry, Bo-ra.

977
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,926
But could you give us some time alone?

978
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,511
I'd like to talk to your teacher.

979
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,555
Sure.

980
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,522
Please take good care of Bo-ra.

981
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,066
Of course. Don't worry.

982
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,486
Bo-ra, you don't have to come
to school this week.

983
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,404
It won't affect your attendance.

984
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,156
Okay.

985
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,116
I'll be leaving now.

986
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,043
Walk with your head held high.

987
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,961
Straighten your back.

988
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,881
Pull in your chin.

989
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,720
You surprised me.

990
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:23,888
Why did you come here?

991
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,556
Because I wanted to.

992
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,600
You came to my home because you wanted to.

993
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,107
Are you okay?

994
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,277
Your friends all seem to know.

995
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,906
Of course, they do. It was on the news.

996
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:45,785
How dare they do an open investigation
without saying anything?

997
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:46,786
My goodness.

998
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,830
I knew about it.

999
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,040
You did?

1000
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,711
Yes. Detective Shin
called me this morning.

1001
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,171
Yes?

1002
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,923
Bo-ra, it's Detective Shin.

1003
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:01,426
About finding your mom…

1004
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,595
We're thinking about doing
an open investigation.

1005
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:08,224
If we do that,
your mom's face will be on the news

1006
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,560
and everyone at your school
will know about this.

1007
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,564
If you do that, could you find her faster?

1008
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:16,899
I can't be sure.

1009
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,861
But witnesses might show up.

1010
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,741
We won't do it if you don't want us to.

1011
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,452
Please do it.

1012
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,912
Please find my mom quickly.

1013
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,833
They needed my consent, so I gave it.

1014
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,835
Why didn't you call me?

1015
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:39,005
Jong-a said you don't like to be
woken up when sleeping.

1016
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,883
This is different.

1017
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,885
You should have called me.

1018
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:46,804
I'm sorry.

1019
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,515
And how could Detective Shin do that?

1020
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,435
Why get consent from a minor
instead of the guardian?

1021
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,729
Who's my guardian?

1022
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,689
It's me, of course!

1023
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:57,940
Do you even need to ask?

1024
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,069
I asked because I didn't know.

1025
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,244
Mr. Jang!

1026
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,371
My goodness.

1027
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,416
You seem out of breath. Don't run.

1028
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,085
Is Wook not here?
He wasn't at home either.

1029
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,463
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

1030
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,422
I was here.

1031
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,382
Then you didn't see the news?

1032
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,384
What news? What happened?

1033
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,928
I'll tell you later.

1034
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,638
I have to find Wook first.

1035
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,015
Hey!

1036
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,226
The way he talks…

1037
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,019
He's just like Wook.

1038
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,564
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

1039
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,782
Jong-a will be inside when you go in.

1040
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,743
Go home together, okay?
I have to go somewhere first.

1041
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,786
Where?

1042
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,330
I have to go see Mr. Jang and…

1043
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,082
-Wook, did you see the news?
-What?

1044
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,417
I didn't say anything.

1045
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,839
About the missing woman in her 30s.

1046
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,298
I saw her myself.

1047
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,176
Tell me. Hurry.

1048
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,761
I even know who took her.

1049
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,514
It's one of the guys who kidnapped
the woman in the wedding dress.

1050
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,558
I know that too.

1051
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,600
Know what?

1052
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,937
There's no one here.

1053
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,480
Who are you talking to?

1054
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,108
Although we couldn't save
the woman in the wedding dress,

1055
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,193
we may be able to save this woman.

1056
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,614
She even has a young daughter.

1057
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,345
Here?

1058
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,223
This is where Se-yeong was held?

1059
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,392
Yes.

1060
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,604
Please, let me see my daughter.

1061
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,938
Please.

1062
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,482
Let me see Bo-ra just once.

1063
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,610
Is there anyone there?

1064
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,612
Anyone? Please save me!

1065
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,113
In the trunk,

1066
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:12,241
she begged to see her daughter just once.

1067
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,331
Who are you?

1068
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:21,709
What do you mean?

1069
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,544
The murder of the phone scammer,

1070
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,088
the kidnapping of the woman
in the wedding dress,

1071
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,840
and now, the kidnapping of Se-yeong.

1072
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,675
You were there every time.

1073
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,764
Don't you think it's strange?

1074
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,438
Approaching me was
part of your plan, right?

1075
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,196
And if it was?

1076
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,574
You…

1077
01:05:58,746 --> 01:05:59,747
Look who's here.

1078
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,460
It's you.

1079
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:05,836
Right?

1080
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,631
I hardly recognized you
with your long hair.

1081
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:11,926
It's been two years, right? No.

1082
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,178
You were at the club a few days ago.

1083
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,390
You bastard!

1084
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,727
Stop fooling around.

1085
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,439
Mang-chi, grab him.

1086
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:55,071
I warned you.

1087
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:58,074
If anything happens to her,
it's all your fault.

1088
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,617
What if we lose the victim?

1089
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,660
We need to find Mun Se-yeong quickly!

1090
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,996
Three hours. Give me just three hours.

1091
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,832
Did you see him? Se-yeong's kidnapper.

1092
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,209
So he died?

1093
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,795
Is he a scary one? How bad is he?

1094
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:11,837
He's a murderer.

1095
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,423
-Search the empty houses as well.
-Okay.

1096
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,217
We must protect the kids no matter what.

1097
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,928
Have you seen Alice?

1098
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,012
Alice!

1099
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,515
But we don't know what they'll do
when cornered.

1100
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,682
Don't come near me!

1101
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,185
You only die once.

1102
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:32,441
