1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,887
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,972
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,570
I'm hungry.

4
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,330
Who are you?

5
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,456
What's your deal?

6
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,670
Who sent you?

7
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,880
Was it Lee Dong-min?

8
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,632
Answer me, you bastard.

9
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,542
Bo-ra.

10
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,382
Do you know me?

11
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,758
Of course I know you.

12
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,637
Who are you?

13
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,764
Me?

14
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,100
Let's just say…

15
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,603
that I'm your dad's friend.

16
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,272
So?

17
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,732
What do you mean?

18
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,118
Go enjoy some snacks with your friends.

19
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,913
No, thank you.

20
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,082
It's okay to take gifts from adults.

21
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,251
Take it.

22
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,298
Bo-ra.

23
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,424
-Jong-a.
-Are you okay?

24
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,261
And you are?

25
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,473
Who are you to offer money
to a young student at night?

26
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,601
Do you know him?

27
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,273
Don't ever show up near her again.

28
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,317
What a weirdo.

29
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,693
Let's go.

30
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,537
Bo-ra has an interesting friend.

31
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,087
Hey.

32
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:36,841
Good job.

33
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,427
Go and treat yourself with your guys.

34
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,595
I'll pay for it.

35
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,067
A woman we've never seen before

36
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,361
appears in my dreams.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,780
She also feels familiar to you.

38
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,990
It could be a coincidence.

39
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,117
You still believe in coincidences?

40
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,954
There are no coincidences in this world.

41
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,748
Didn't I tell you about Duon Village?

42
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,418
I went there because of a woman
I met on the street by chance.

43
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,462
And I met my mom there.

44
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,547
It turned out

45
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,049
that woman

46
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,386
was somehow involved in my mom's death.

47
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,724
There's a reason for everything
that happens in this world.

48
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,646
So I'm going to find out
why I can see your village.

49
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,064
You should

50
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,526
also find out why these things
are happening to you.

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,238
This is the house.

52
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,586
She must not be home yet.

53
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,630
Should I go inside?

54
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,678
I thought you don't
go into strangers' homes.

55
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,432
Well, this has nothing to do
with the violation of privacy.

56
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,601
Our lives are on the line.

57
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,398
Hey.

58
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,902
Tell me if you see anything
strange or suspicious.

59
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,655
Don't miss out on any detail
that you see in there.

60
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,574
All right.

61
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,793
What's wrong?

62
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,878
Just give me a minute.

63
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,267
I can't

64
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,061
go inside this house.

65
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,066
Then let me try.

66
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,419
Wook!

67
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,670
What's this?

68
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,839
-She must have a security system.
-You didn't check?

69
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,133
Just come down for now.

70
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,969
You have to run. Hurry!

71
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,681
What's that loud noise?

72
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,336
You were home. Is everything okay?

73
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,004
Everything's okay.

74
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,131
Any damage?

75
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,590
Would you like to report this?

76
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,550
Please don't.

77
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,220
Nothing happened.

78
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,098
Someone must have touched it by mistake.

79
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,726
Are you sure you're okay?

80
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,019
Yes.

81
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,521
You can go.

82
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,482
All right, ma'am.

83
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,554
The phone is off. Please leave…

84
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,432
GUARDIAN

85
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,942
The kids left a big space to fill.

86
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,279
I feel cold inside like the chilly wind.

87
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,701
I didn't see you around for a few days,
so I thought you might not come back.

88
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,330
If you had stopped coming now that
all of Heon-ji's friends are gone,

89
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:21,292
I was going to give you a mouthful.

90
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,919
That must be why

91
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,339
I kept getting goosebumps
and having nightmares.

92
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,551
I'm here for the same reason.

93
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,597
I also feel empty like a single dad
whose daughter just got married.

94
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,310
And you've been with them for ten years,
so you must miss them a lot.

95
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,021
I thought we could sob over it together.

96
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,148
When I was alive,

97
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,151
I had to see
my husband and son die before me.

98
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,488
And even when dead,
I'm only seeing people off.

99
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,032
It must be my fate or something.

100
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,077
It's the same for you too, isn't it?

101
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,161
Not at all.

102
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,956
Even though my wife and daughter
died ahead of me,

103
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm alive and well, sending people off.

104
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,293
That's nothing to be proud of.

105
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,253
It is.

106
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,046
Good for you.

107
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,092
By the way,

108
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,303
who's that person
that holds memorials for you?

109
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,305
Jong-yun.

110
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,474
When my husband was young,

111
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,436
they grew up together like brothers.

112
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,109
When my husband said he was buying a boat,
he quit his job to work on it.

113
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,654
They were basically brothers.

114
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,406
If it weren't for him and his wife,

115
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,284
I would have died five years earlier.

116
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,910
What do you mean?

117
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,620
Exactly what I said.

118
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,415
Ju-won…

119
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,666
JUWON

120
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,547
How can I live without you and Ju-won?

121
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,341
Take me with you.

122
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,721
Let the three of us live together
on the other side.

123
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,683
Eun-sil!

124
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,726
Let me go!

125
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,478
Let go of me! Leave me alone.

126
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,731
Please, Eun-sil!

127
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,734
I'm going to go be with my son!

128
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm the only one…

129
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,862
Don't do this.

130
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,282
-Eun-sil.
-My goodness…

131
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,666
They took care of me since that day.

132
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,086
Sun-hee even moved in with me.

133
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,342
Jong-yun stopped by day and night
to make sure I was all right.

134
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,470
It's good to have people around you
when you're not well.

135
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,554
Of course.

136
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,182
How do you think I became a captain?

137
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,934
It's all thanks to Jong-yun.

138
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,646
He said I should just enjoy the boat ride

139
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,856
and that he'd do all the work.

140
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,943
At first, I didn't think I'd do well.

141
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,572
But then I figured, why not?

142
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,407
Goodness.

143
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,786
The sea was endless.

144
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,747
I felt so refreshed on the boat

145
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,624
unlike when I was on land.

146
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,503
It looks delicious.

147
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:11,921
Eun-sil!

148
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,130
Come here and eat!

149
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,216
-Come on!
-It's getting cold!

150
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,550
-Come on!
-Hurry over.

151
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,635
Come and eat.

152
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,636
That was

153
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,930
already 35 years ago.

154
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,265
So they've been holding
the memorials all these years?

155
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,684
Yes, Il-yong saw them and told me.

156
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,978
They hold the memorials even on holidays

157
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:32,858
as well as on the days
that each of us passed away.

158
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,696
They must be over 70 now,
and still they go through the trouble.

159
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,283
Would you like me
to go and thank them for you?

160
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,493
Don't do that.

161
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,370
And tell them what? That a ghost sent you?

162
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,122
You'll scare them to their deaths.

163
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,333
I can just pretend
to be your distant relative.

164
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,252
I'm a better actor than you'd think.

165
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,294
My goodness…

166
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,672
Thanks anyway for your offer.

167
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,716
I have such good people around me.

168
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,886
How's your leg?

169
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,805
It's just fine.

170
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,350
It hurts only for a day or two
on my anniversary.

171
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,561
Afterward, it's fine again.

172
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,980
I think when I drowned,

173
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,524
the fish ate my leg first.

174
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,487
Those damn fish.

175
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,744
Was there any place

176
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,456
you couldn't go in besides that house?

177
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,708
No.

178
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,546
Maybe she cast a spell
that keeps spirits out or something.

179
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,215
Using garlic and a silver cross?

180
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:39,925
Or maybe a talisman?

181
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,220
You're not a vampire.

182
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,724
I'm not a vampire,

183
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,767
but I am abnormal.

184
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,022
I can go to places
that the other dead can't.

185
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,191
I also see what others don't.

186
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,321
I got you in so much trouble too.

187
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,409
Trouble always followed me around
even before I knew you.

188
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,456
And if you can't go inside that house,

189
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,583
then I will.

190
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,752
I should go meet the woman
I see in my dreams.

191
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,631
Oh Il-yong.

192
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,009
Let's work hard together
as abnormal people.

193
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,138
I also see what others can't.

194
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,684
Thank you.

195
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,521
Empty words.

196
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,153
Hey, Jong-a.

197
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,614
What?

198
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,751
Do you know him?

199
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,920
No, I don't.

200
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,964
When I asked him who he was,

201
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,967
he said I should think of him
as your friend.

202
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,594
He even knew Bo-ra's name.

203
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,767
I'll ask Detective Shin to look into it.

204
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,893
Are you okay?

205
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,771
It was fine because Jong-a was there.

206
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,942
-Goodness…
-Look at you.

207
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,570
Bo-ra.

208
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,823
You should go to bed now
since you have to go to school tomorrow.

209
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,992
I'll pick you up starting tomorrow.

210
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,785
Stay at the academy until I call you.

211
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,663
Okay. Good night.

212
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,165
-You too.
-Good night.

213
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,461
Who could that be?

214
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,341
You said Bo-ra's mom
is looking for a house these days.

215
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,427
Would it be okay to let her go?

216
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,264
Until we know who that man is,

217
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,516
it'll be safer for her
to stay here with us.

218
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,434
I agree.

219
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,228
I'll talk to Se-yeong.

220
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,023
Both of you.

221
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,400
I need you to go
somewhere with me tomorrow.

222
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,278
-Where?
-Where?

223
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,130
There?

224
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,762
Other than the people walking,

225
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,263
what else are you seeing?

226
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,349
I don't see anything.

227
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,143
Me neither.

228
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,482
But apparently, the dead people are there

229
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,400
and Alice's mom is there too.

230
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,070
There's another village?

231
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,697
This is the third village that we know of.

232
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,578
How many of these villages are there?

233
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,581
And why are there so many people
whose bodies are missing?

234
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,043
Just what happened to Alice and her mom?

235
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,045
She's a foreigner
who married a Korean man.

236
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,214
But her husband used to beat her

237
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,841
for being poor at speaking Korean.

238
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,468
He also beat Alice when she cried.

239
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,303
And the mom would try to protect her.

240
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,681
Bastards like that should get their hands…

241
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,057
Cut off completely.

242
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,725
That's right.

243
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,560
So where is he?

244
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,062
Il-yong went to see him,

245
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,231
but he sold off everything
and fled overseas.

246
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,277
I'm going to find out where he went.

247
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,199
You nearly died.

248
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,910
Getting stabbed
is no big deal to detectives.

249
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,454
Hey, help me up.

250
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,207
Hey, don't get up. Stay down.

251
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,462
Who would dare stab a detective
in the station parking lot?

252
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,256
It was the guy dressed
as an officer, right?

253
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,507
Did you see his face?

254
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,926
Yes.

255
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,303
Who sent you?

256
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,055
Answer me, you bastard.

257
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,349
I've seen him before.

258
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,810
There was another one behind me.

259
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,771
He must be the one who stabbed me.

260
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,149
That's right.

261
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,775
You were stabbed from behind.

262
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,070
I thought it was strange.

263
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,114
So he had a partner.

264
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,701
Hey, Ms. Lee.

265
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,536
Remember the coffee beans

266
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,663
that Wook said we should buy?
Don't buy those.

267
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,832
-Why not?
-They taste bad.

268
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,334
They taste just fine.

269
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,335
Yes.

270
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,756
A lot of people come
after seeing the café on social media.

271
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,007
They all like the coffee.

272
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,258
-Really?
-Yes.

273
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,301
It tastes strange.

274
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,554
I thought you were
going to go see Detective Shin.

275
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,889
He's not answering my call.

276
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,769
Speak of the devil.

277
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,354
Hey, Detective Shin.

278
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,035
You're here.

279
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,457
You look fine.

280
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,794
Is this a scheme?

281
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,378
Why are you lying there? Where…

282
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,422
I was stabbed.

283
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,924
What the…

284
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,467
My goodness…

285
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,095
What happened?

286
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,848
Remember the guys that followed us
when we went to that club?

287
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,434
They ambushed me
in the station parking lot.

288
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,603
Why would they go after you?

289
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,649
You know the tracker you put on them?

290
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,109
-The GPS tracker?
-Yes.

291
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,445
It was in the mountains,

292
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,280
and we found

293
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,450
Kim Pil-jung's body nearby.

294
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,079
You mean…

295
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,747
Jang Do-ri did it?

296
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,958
They disguised it as a suicide,

297
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,461
but I think Jang Do-ri did it.

298
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,882
Like you said,

299
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,301
Jang Do-ri must have

300
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,847
gone to meet Kim Pil-jung
after seeing Lee Dong-min.

301
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,558
To confirm whether "he" was Lee Dong-min,

302
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,352
I asked him myself

303
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,312
if he was selling drugs
from inside the prison.

304
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,814
You asked Lee Dong-min that?

305
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,482
My goodness.

306
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,527
And you were stabbed afterward?

307
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,239
Was it Lee Dong-min's doing?

308
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,950
I only have suspicions for now.

309
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,118
I have no proof yet.

310
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,953
It's pretty clear it was Lee Dong-min.

311
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,329
That bastard.

312
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,333
He's already in prison,
so we can't arrest him again.

313
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,419
I've left words with the Drug Squad.

314
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,921
Since they're involved,
we should ask for their help.

315
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,673
Anyway,

316
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,216
you should be careful too, Wook.

317
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,845
They're ruthless bastards
with no tomorrow.

318
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,430
Yesterday…

319
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,434
I heard that someone came to see Bo-ra.

320
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,852
Who?

321
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,110
It's this guy, but I don't know him.

322
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,988
If he's someone you don't know,

323
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,407
is he someone that has to do with Ms. Mun?

324
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,909
No, Se-yeong's not related.

325
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,996
Apparently, he said
that he was a friend of mine.

326
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,706
But I don't know him.

327
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,624
Maybe…

328
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,793
he's involved with them.

329
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,093
Hye-ju.

330
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,553
Yes?

331
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,479
What's all this?

332
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,606
Want some help?

333
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,524
Thank you, but no.

334
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,987
The gingers are good.

335
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,447
It's chilly these days.

336
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,825
I'm making ginger tea
for the kids when they cough.

337
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,452
Would you like some too?

338
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,288
I've never caught a cold once
since I got here.

339
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,499
It's also good for a hangover.

340
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,336
So everyone now knows
that I enjoy drinking?

341
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,340
What brings you here today?

342
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,925
Oh, my goodness.

343
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,636
I almost forgot why I came.

344
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,722
It's nothing special.

345
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,432
I just came to see if you're okay.

346
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:09,851
Me?

347
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,736
You lived with Ha-yun

348
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,365
and took such good care of her.

349
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,118
When she was traumatized
by Choi Young-bae,

350
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,287
you took care of her all night.

351
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,622
I just stayed by her side.

352
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,332
She wouldn't eat anything and just cry.

353
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,460
But she'd smile and laugh
when Yeong-rim came.

354
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,586
Right.

355
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,215
When one cried,

356
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,926
the other used to comfort.

357
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,679
Even when they fought,

358
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,889
they'd back each other up

359
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,434
in a blink of an eye.

360
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,735
Now that Ha-yun and Yeong-rim are gone,

361
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,196
the house feels so empty.

362
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,367
Still…

363
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,286
it's a good thing.

364
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,088
Oh, right.

365
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,214
Remember when

366
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,633
Wook and Il-yong

367
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,928
got the villagers together
and did a survey?

368
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,181
They asked them
to write down their home address

369
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,517
and what they would like to know
about their families.

370
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,813
They did a good thing.
People are very grateful.

371
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,483
So Hye-ju,

372
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,902
why didn't you write anything?

373
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,367
Your father is healthy and doing well,
so don't worry.

374
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,914
How do you know that?

375
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,249
I have my ways.

376
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,336
So trust me.

377
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,633
Just hearing you say that
brings me comfort.

378
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,014
Well…

379
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,643
You told me everything I wanted to know.

380
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,562
That my parents are doing well.

381
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,357
That's good enough for me.

382
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,657
I thought you'd be here.

383
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,661
You still can't go in?

384
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,331
I think it's a place
that even the dead can't go in.

385
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,340
Hello?

386
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,384
Is anyone home?

387
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,178
There's been no sign of people
since earlier.

388
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,893
This is the only house in the neighborhood

389
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,521
with a security system.

390
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,898
Don't you think that's strange?

391
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,277
To go to such lengths
for a house that's this run-down.

392
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,041
Why would you get yourself stabbed?

393
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,711
So how bad is it?

394
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,715
They missed the organs, so I'm okay.

395
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,008
Okay, my foot.

396
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,260
I saw the text.

397
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,346
The guy who stabbed you
is involved with Goliath?

398
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,264
Yes.

399
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,975
I think he's the one
who killed Kim Pil-jung.

400
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,437
Why would he stab you though?

401
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,192
Let me get straight to the point.

402
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,652
He's involved with Lee Dong-min.

403
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,070
Lee Dong-min?

404
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,407
The guy from Choiseung Construction?

405
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,410
Isn't he in prison?

406
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,120
He is.

407
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,833
Dong-min?

408
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,462
You were in the Philippines,
so how do you know each other?

409
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,716
I've known him for around 30 years now.

410
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,052
Really?

411
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,303
You've been friends long.

412
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,682
I was an athlete when I was young,

413
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,143
but I had to quit
after I hurt my Achilles tendon.

414
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,480
My family was poor.

415
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,107
I was never much of a student,

416
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,777
so I had nothing to do
after I quit being an athlete.

417
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,864
I managed to graduate from high school
and was doing construction work

418
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,617
when he came to see me.

419
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,702
He must have recognized your talents.

420
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,163
Well, he probably did look into me.

421
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,457
He said he liked me
because I resembled him.

422
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,920
He got hired by Choiseung Construction
after passing the bar exam

423
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,466
while I was just working
at the company's construction site.

424
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,970
How did I ever resemble him?

425
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,266
We both have no connections, no family,

426
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,644
and were ruthless when pursuing our goals.

427
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,897
My goal is simple.

428
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,401
Both then and now…

429
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,362
Money.

430
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,951
At the time, I was barely
making enough to eat.

431
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,620
I'd accept anything
that would pay me well.

432
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,623
I wasn't curious about the reasons at all.

433
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,293
Wook…

434
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,296
Wook…

435
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,634
I did what I was told.

436
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,386
As long as I was paid, I was fine.

437
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,099
I got things done,
and he was prompt with payments.

438
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,185
We were a pretty good duo.

439
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,733
But that didn't mean I resembled him.

440
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,863
We'd like your cooperation.

441
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,961
There's one thing
I surely learned from him.

442
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,465
That anything is possible with money.

443
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,884
No matter what it is.

444
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,615
-What?
-Hey, Lee Dong-min!

445
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,210
What on earth is happening?

446
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,087
Call an ambulance.

447
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,546
Wook.

448
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,840
Hey.

449
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,759
Detective Shin is hurt
so he's in the hospital.

450
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,803
What happened?

451
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,471
Is he hurt bad?

452
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,597
We should go see him.

453
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,765
Let's do that.

454
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,434
It's Detective Shin we're talking about.

455
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,936
He said not to come.

456
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,646
He was stabbed.

457
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,982
Luckily, the knife missed his organs.

458
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,776
Who would do that to him?

459
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,073
He thinks it was
one of Lee Dong-min's henchmen.

460
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,449
Who? Lee Dong-min?

461
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,162
The cops are investigating the matter,

462
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,665
and he'll be discharged soon,
so he said not to worry.

463
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:31,918
Anyway,

464
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,545
did you find out

465
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,964
where Alice's dad fled to?

466
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,925
Yes. His name is Lee Chun-beom.

467
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,260
He fled to Guam.

468
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,430
I have no idea how to get him.

469
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,226
How much is the airplane ticket to Guam?

470
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,566
Bo-ra.

471
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,277
Are you exercising?

472
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,948
Why are you out here when it's so cold?

473
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:02,949
You'll catch a cold.

474
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,369
Don't you think this is too much?

475
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,206
It's not too much to say
it's cold when it's true.

476
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,584
You drive me to school,
then pick me up from the academy.

477
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,336
You also send me
a bunch of texts in between.

478
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,797
Then you give me juice and fruit
when I come home.

479
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,174
Now you bring me a blanket.

480
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,761
I'm really okay.

481
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,097
All right.

482
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,225
But just in case,

483
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,603
if anything at all bothers you,

484
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,731
you have to tell me, all right?

485
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,149
Sure.

486
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,317
Let's go in.

487
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,943
Is your meeting finished?

488
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,322
What meeting?

489
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,700
Don't you have meetings to catch bad guys?

490
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,161
What are you talking about?

491
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,455
I have eyes, you know.

492
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,082
The serial killer
that was on the news the other day.

493
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,002
She was caught
after all three of you went off together.

494
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,922
About that…

495
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,509
We just came across something by chance.

496
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,552
You also received
the Brave Citizen's Award.

497
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,471
You caught a voice phishing scammer.

498
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,933
Yes, I'm a brave citizen.

499
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,562
You, Jong-a, and Mr. Jang are all so cool.

500
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,317
Can I help you catch bad guys too?

501
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,404
What?

502
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,156
I learned from Jong-a

503
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,409
how to search the news
and categorize information.

504
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,708
Didn't you say you have exams next week?

505
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,210
You're the one who told me

506
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,962
that life isn't all about studying.

507
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,339
A student's duty is to study.

508
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,466
Let's go inside and study.

509
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,387
It's so cold.

510
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,889
Today is the coldest day of the year.

511
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:55,520
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

512
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,857
Hello.

513
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,110
Hi.

514
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,278
Hey.

515
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,865
I thought I told you
to rest up in the hospital.

516
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,992
I was feeling too restless.

517
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,327
Your wound might get worse.

518
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,246
I just need to take my meds on time.

519
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,790
Being in bed all day
would make me even sicker.

520
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:20,378
Hey. I handed the security camera
and dashcam videos over to Man-su.

521
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,754
I was told you asked to do that.

522
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,922
Yes.

523
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,258
They're related to Goliath.

524
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,512
Hello.

525
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,763
Hello, Mr. Jang.

526
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,307
What's up?

527
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,101
I want to file a missing person's report.

528
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,812
Did something happen to Wook?

529
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,022
No.

530
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,774
Wait, Detective Shin.

531
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,154
I heard you got hurt.

532
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,114
Are you all right?

533
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,532
Yes. I'm fine.

534
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,743
Why that idiot…

535
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,037
I told him to rest in the hospital,
but he wouldn't listen.

536
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,955
-Come this way, Mr. Jang.
-Sure.

537
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,332
Would you like something to drink?

538
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,750
Instant coffee would be good.

539
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,667
Sure.

540
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,378
Lee Alice

541
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,671
and Nah Su-jin?

542
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,589
Yes.

543
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,257
She's from a multicultural family.

544
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,135
Nah Su-jin is Alice's mom.

545
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,054
Her dad is Lee Chun-beom.

546
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,556
I teach Korean to kids
from multicultural families

547
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,643
at the foundation
where I do volunteer work.

548
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,687
But Alice has been
missing classes without a word,

549
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,105
and they haven't seen her mom either.

550
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,734
According to their neighbors,

551
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:28,154
the dad took his family and went abroad.

552
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,491
But who does that
without even saying goodbye?

553
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,992
The whole thing seems strange.

554
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,913
Sir, should I check the departure records?

555
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:37,830
Yes.

556
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,669
So you taught Korean to this kid?

557
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,922
Not me personally.
But I saw her around once or twice.

558
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,968
She was a cute kid with big, shiny eyes.

559
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,136
Well…

560
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,930
I never met her mom though.

561
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,393
What was her dad like?

562
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,644
Lee Chun-beom?

563
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,145
Well, rumor has it

564
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,940
that he's got quite a temper.

565
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,694
He left for Guam a month ago.

566
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,405
But there's no departure record
of Nah Su-jin or Lee Alice.

567
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,702
Detective Yu.

568
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,121
You take charge of this case
and investigate it.

569
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,623
And Detective Shin.

570
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,667
You are on desk duty for a while.

571
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,253
Don't you go running around
and tear out your stitches.

572
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,170
And Mr. Jang--

573
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,089
I'm actually…

574
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,215
I'm busy.

575
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,591
I've got to get going now.

576
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,801
Detective Yu.

577
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,719
-Thank you.
-Sure.

578
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,303
Please look into this for me.

579
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,514
-Take care.
-Wait, my coffee.

580
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,516
Goodbye.

581
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,439
I'm curious where he gets
his information from.

582
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,149
Why does that matter?

583
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,693
Finding the missing people
is the most important thing.

584
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,203
Good to see you.

585
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,040
I…

586
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,751
I'd like two bottles of rice wine.

587
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,129
You had rice wine yesterday too.

588
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,133
That was because I couldn't fall asleep.

589
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,468
And today?

590
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,845
Are you going to bed this early?

591
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,683
It must be because I'm a fool.

592
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,103
My heart is aching so much.

593
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,324
Drink with me.

594
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,951
Let's get wasted together.

595
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,038
Don't be like that. I feel bad.

596
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,624
I shouldn't have said anything.

597
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,960
I regret that I burdened you
with my story.

598
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,673
Do you know how much I envied you

599
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,300
and admired you?

600
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,470
You were so respectable and knew so much.

601
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,516
You made people laugh and cry
with such impressive words.

602
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,103
But now, you look so pitiful.

603
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,441
I'm an idiot, aren't I?

604
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,319
Yes, you are.

605
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,281
As a parent myself,

606
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,117
I understand what you must be feeling.

607
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,495
But I don't know
if that's really the right thing

608
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,914
to do for your child.

609
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,177
Forget the rice wine.

610
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,930
I'll come back later.

611
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,743
Jjamppong!

612
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,249
Alice, slow down.

613
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,752
You run so well!

614
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,753
Good!

615
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,050
Alice's dad, Lee Chun-beom,

616
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,219
fled to Guam.

617
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,098
So you can't catch him?

618
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,933
Please go ask Alice's mom

619
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,769
if he has any relatives
or friends in Guam.

620
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,396
All right.

621
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,400
Jjamppong!

622
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,114
Alice seems to have settled well here.

623
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,533
She cried a lot at first

624
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,951
and refused to eat.

625
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,371
When she first arrived here,

626
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,831
I went to that park.

627
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,335
At first, I couldn't see anything.

628
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,712
Then I saw a building and went inside.

629
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,341
The person who called out to me first

630
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,093
-was Alice's mom.
-She's this tall.

631
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,470
Have you seen her?

632
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,474
Excuse me.

633
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,142
Have you seen my baby?

634
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,394
-Sorry?
-She was just here,

635
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,979
but I can't find her.

636
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,068
I just arrived here so…

637
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,362
What does your baby look like?

638
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,738
Alice.

639
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,324
She's a girl.

640
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,117
She's this tall

641
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,703
and has bobbed hair.

642
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,205
She has round eyes.

643
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,498
Alice?

644
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,625
-She's missing her front teeth?
-That's right.

645
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,418
Where is she?

646
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,090
I think I became capable
of seeing that building

647
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,050
because of Alice's mom.

648
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,345
Mr. Jang can see this village

649
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,930
because of Hyeon-ji,

650
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,224
and you can see this place…

651
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,520
probably because of me, right?

652
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,443
I was searching for you.

653
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:01,862
You were

654
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:03,948
searching for me?

655
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,578
How did those two end up
being able to see ghosts like us?

656
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,163
One thing for sure

657
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,334
is that they both had
a desperate longing for someone.

658
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,837
Excuse me.

659
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,757
-I didn't know where to go to find you.
-Can you see me?

660
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,387
I blindly searched for you for a year.

661
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,223
I was very desperate.

662
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,934
At first,

663
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,478
I wanted to find Pil-jung, who killed me.

664
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,649
Then I wanted to find my body.

665
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,192
But now…

666
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,988
I just want to know why.

667
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,907
Why I'm different
from the other dead people.

668
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,910
You said that there are

669
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,538
no coincidences in this world.

670
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,166
Yes.

671
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,546
Wow.

672
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,049
I was right.

673
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,093
I told you he approached you
on purpose from the start.

674
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,097
But it is pretty sad for Mr. Oh Il-yong.

675
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,392
He searched for someone
to hear his story for a year,

676
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,478
talking into the air.

677
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,646
You're right.

678
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:22,610
It's quite sad to hear
that Thomas is still in Duon Village.

679
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,820
Well…

680
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,405
it's thanks to Thomas

681
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,657
that I got to meet Il-yong.

682
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,117
I think

683
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,995
that also counts as a fateful encounter.

684
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,331
We went to a house recently,

685
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,749
and Il-yong

686
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,210
couldn't enter it.

687
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,213
There's a place Il-yong can't enter?

688
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,383
He said it's just that house
that he can't enter.

689
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,302
It's a really run-down house

690
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,179
but has all kinds of security systems.

691
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,556
What's the address?

692
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,767
I have it here.

693
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:01,941
BROWSE ADDRESS REGISTRATION

694
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,321
There's a tenant living here.

695
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,906
Jin Hee-jeong.

696
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,034
That woman's name must be Jin Hee-jeong.

697
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,494
You met her?

698
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,539
No, I ran into her
by chance a few days ago.

699
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,626
But even if you ring the doorbell,
no one ever comes out.

700
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,671
Something must be hidden in that house.

701
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,759
By the way,

702
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,178
I went to the police station,
and Detective Shin was there.

703
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,805
Why did you go there?

704
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,348
I went to do my work.

705
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,475
He must be out of the hospital.

706
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,269
I guess so.

707
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,147
Detective Baek was nagging him
to stay in the office.

708
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,982
Both you and Detective Shin

709
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,693
don't take care of your bodies
because you're young.

710
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,777
He's right.

711
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,654
Wait until you're my age.

712
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,448
You should take care of your health.

713
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,909
Mr. Jang, that's mine.

714
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,537
You said I could have it last time.

715
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,791
-You should still ask her.
-Be quiet.

716
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,127
I'll allow it since it's you.

717
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,338
Take care of your joints, people.

718
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:10,926
Lee Dong-min

719
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,137
died in prison.

720
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:14,930
What?

721
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,515
Last night,

722
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,934
we went to search his solitary cell.

723
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,020
But he had killed himself.

724
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,231
He would never kill himself.

725
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,441
Exactly.

726
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,818
Imagine how many inmates
they have under control

727
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,737
to be able to make someone
in a solitary cell kill himself.

728
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,990
They can easily stab
a detective at a police station.

729
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,326
It's really dangerous
for you to be out like this.

730
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,590
No, I'm not with anyone.

731
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,887
I enjoy eating and traveling alone.

732
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,681
By the way,

733
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,141
what happened with Oh Il-yong?

734
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,357
You think I'm a bum
because I'm touring around?

735
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,817
You know why I'm here.

736
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:10,986
Pull yourself together.

737
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,032
Excuse me.

738
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,951
Could you take a picture for us, please?

739
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,426
You're such a good girl, eating so well.

740
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,096
Captain, I'm done.

741
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,306
Say, "I'm finished eating."

742
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,599
I'm finished eating.

743
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,767
Okay.

744
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,935
Go play inside.

745
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,022
You should eat well too.

746
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,190
I am.

747
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,026
You get hungry quickly when you're young.

748
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,615
I remember when I first came here.

749
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,285
I didn't even know I was dead,
and you were feeding me.

750
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,288
When I heard that I was dead while eating,

751
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,998
it didn't hit me too hard.

752
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,666
It felt like

753
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,085
it was natural

754
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,211
that I was dead.

755
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,047
You realized that now?

756
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,634
What? Was it all a scheme?

757
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,845
Nothing like that.

758
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,140
It's just that being dead is no big deal.

759
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,226
I wanted you to eat up
and lighten up a bit.

760
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:29,356
Comrade Jeong told me that people
don't become useless when they're dead.

761
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,191
But that they die

762
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,277
when they become useless.

763
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,155
I'm not much of a fancy talker,

764
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,865
so I did the only thing I could.

765
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,491
I wanted you to eat and be strong.

766
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,952
Even if you're dead,
you can still have a good life here.

767
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,288
You're pretty eloquent now.

768
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,666
Just eat up.

769
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,711
Leave the empty dishes in the kitchen.

770
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,421
Or you could wash them if you want.

771
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,422
Where are you going?

772
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,841
To take some rice wine over to Mr. Jung.

773
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,180
Here.

774
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,515
If you have trouble falling asleep,
drink some.

775
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,476
No.

776
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,646
I can't continue to rely on alcohol.

777
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,189
You said your heart was aching.

778
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,902
Like you said…

779
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,988
I've been reflecting upon
myself as a parent

780
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,491
on whether I was
truly acting for my child.

781
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,328
If I rely on alcohol,
I think I will just compromise

782
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,414
and hide myself again.

783
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,835
So you mean,

784
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,588
you're not going to drink
rice wine tonight?

785
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,715
You're really good

786
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,176
at getting to the heart of the matter.

787
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,138
Then what did I come all the way here for?

788
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,140
You should get some rest.

789
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,643
I need to go put Alice to bed.

790
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,354
Captain Kang.

791
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:54,942
Thanks.

792
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,153
Not at all.

793
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,198
Stop bothering me and go to bed now.

794
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,737
My goodness…

795
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,114
You actually did the dishes?

796
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,657
You told me to.

797
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,703
So why are the dishes still hardly washed?

798
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,582
I played dolls with Alice,

799
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,792
and she began to yawn,
so I put her to bed.

800
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,377
I just started on this.

801
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,296
Look at you whining.

802
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,756
I'm not whining.

803
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,966
Look at this.

804
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:04,136
You'd think I do
all the dishes in this village.

805
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,596
Fine. I'll rinse them.

806
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,514
It's all right.

807
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,099
I was joking, go rest.

808
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,018
But…

809
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,311
there really are

810
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:13,770
a lot of dishes.

811
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,398
That's because
you're talking instead of working.

812
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,150
There are not that many.

813
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,818
-Come out of there.
-No, it's fine.

814
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,404
-I'll wash them like a machine.
-Never mind.

815
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,530
-Like this.
-Come on.

816
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,157
You're supposed to take your time.

817
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,533
Wash this first.

818
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,202
-Why?
-So I can sit here and drink.

819
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,412
I'm sitting down.

820
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,164
You should stop drinking.

821
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,188
The reason she keeps
showing up in my dreams.

822
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,068
The reason Il-yong can't enter that house.

823
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,405
You can see this place…

824
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,616
probably because of me, right?

825
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,369
You said that there are

826
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,913
no coincidences in this world.

827
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,458
How did you know he was Kim Pil-jung?

828
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,960
The ring he's wearing.

829
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,088
Il-yong was also wearing it when he came.

830
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,677
What if…

831
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,224
what I saw in my dreams…

832
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:01,712
Hello, sir.

833
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,467
You look good.

834
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,096
You got something on Oh Il-yong?

835
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,097
Yes.

836
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,348
Take a look at this, sir.

837
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,519
This was on Kim Pil-jung's phone.

838
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,397
He was up to no good.

839
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,233
Send me the address.

840
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,526
I need to see for myself.

841
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,444
Yes, sir.

842
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,116
That was so clever of you.

843
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,743
Good job!

844
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,827
Have…

845
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,495
Have a good day, sir!

846
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,208
Don't even mention it.

847
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,377
"There are so many dishes, my back hurts…"

848
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,880
I had no idea he was such a chatterbox.

849
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:46,923
I see.

850
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:49,760
But…

851
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,428
you know what?

852
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,181
Even though he's chattering away,

853
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,475
he never

854
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,477
talks about himself.

855
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,980
These days, he doesn't eat much either.

856
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,399
The way he looks so somber…

857
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,735
He must be worried about something.

858
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,280
I plan to cook this special dish for him

859
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,075
and get him to talk about it.

860
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,163
He's been working so hard
getting news for the villagers.

861
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,249
I don't think
I thanked him enough for that.

862
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,379
I've been busy looking after the kids

863
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,297
that I've been neglecting on Il-yong.

864
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,677
I'm sure he knows and understands.

865
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,804
He's like Wook.

866
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:37,891
Lee Chun-beom.

867
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,310
He fled to Guam.

868
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,271
Does he have family in Guam?

869
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,023
No.

870
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:48,026
His sister lives in Singapore.

871
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:52,280
Is it not good?

872
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,658
What?

873
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,659
No, it's not that.

874
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,788
The police are looking for him.

875
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,332
I can't say when they'll catch him,

876
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,376
but there are people helping us.

877
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,170
Thank you.

878
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,675
Alice has a new friend.

879
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,343
It's a puppy called Jjamppong.

880
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,220
She adores him and plays well with him.

881
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,931
Alice loves dogs.

882
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,975
And she can even talk politely to elders.

883
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,477
We taught her and she learned fast.

884
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,647
Thank you.

885
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,566
Thank you.

886
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:32,279
Is that Alice's favorite book?

887
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,864
We have it in our village too.

888
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,991
If she likes it,
I'd like to read it to her.

889
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,746
This is my favorite book.

890
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:44,416
I study Korean using this book.

891
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,002
I feel the same way about the story.

892
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,133
"Mommy…

893
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,011
is always running."

894
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,431
"She runs because the way you smile

895
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,059
is so pretty."

896
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,231
"She runs in surprise

897
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,277
when she hears you've been hurt."

898
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,490
"Even now,

899
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,576
she's running."

900
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,039
"To get you,

901
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,291
who are all alone."

902
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:30,670
MOMMY RUNS

903
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,448
Hey, Wook.

904
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,371
Lee Chun-beom's sister is in Singapore.

905
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,289
She doesn't know about Guam.

906
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:07,958
Really?

907
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,294
Then we'll have to dig some more.

908
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,214
By the way, Il-yong.

909
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,133
Remember I told you
that I saw that woman in my dreams?

910
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,553
I dreamed again this morning.

911
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,263
She was

912
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,723
holding something in her hands.

913
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,392
What was it?

914
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,020
It looked like an IV fluid.

915
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,438
An IV fluid?

916
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:36,361
I think, in that room…

917
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,279
Wook.

918
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,540
Il-yong.

919
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,167
Il-yong!

920
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,386
Wait.

921
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,013
Someone is here.

922
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,185
I didn't hear anything.

923
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,362
SUPERMARKET

924
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,573
Il-yong.

925
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,034
Why are you here?

926
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,120
There's no one else?

927
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,333
I don't know why I'm here.

928
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,296
You…

929
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,340
Did you just come from there?

930
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,595
I'm sure I was outside with Wook.

931
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,639
With Wook?

932
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,432
Where?

933
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,102
At the park…

934
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:56,775
Wait.

935
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,234
-Hey!
-Hey!

936
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,364
What is he saying?

937
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,366
He…

938
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,869
He just came out from here?

939
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,914
Yes. But except when he first arrived,

940
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,875
this is the first time he came from there.

941
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,671
But where is he going?

942
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,633
You don't think anything
happened to him, do you?

943
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:25,512
He's already here, so it isn't right
for something else to happen to him.

944
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,549
Il-yong,

945
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,343
hang in there.

946
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,016
I'm sure it's nothing.

947
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,642
He turned pale.

948
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,312
Il-yong!

949
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,815
What happened to you?

950
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,316
Where have you been?

951
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,029
You tried to go outside but couldn't?

952
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:30,535
I can't go outside.

953
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,453
Why not?

954
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,163
All of a sudden?

955
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,916
I don't know either.

956
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,717
Explain slowly what's going on.

957
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,011
Well…

958
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,806
I was with Wook at the park.

959
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,728
We were talking about his dreams.

960
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:58,396
Dreams?

961
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,647
I mean…

962
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,525
Wook keeps seeing a woman in his dreams,

963
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,360
and he thinks…

964
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,238
-that--
-Try to make sense.

965
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,656
What dream did he have?

966
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,876
Captain Kang.

967
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,669
Yes?

968
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,131
I feel strange.

969
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:26,841
Hey.

970
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,384
Il-yong.

971
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,058
Thank you…

972
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,479
for everything.

973
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,483
Il-yong.

974
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,236
No! Just a little longer!

975
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,164
How could…

976
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,875
How could you go like this?

977
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,419
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

978
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,091
He really left?

979
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,261
He really did.

980
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,598
How could he go like this?

981
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,645
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

982
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,196
I didn't get to thank him.

983
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,410
I shouldn't have made him
do the dishes last night.

984
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,913
Il-yong.

985
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,673
How could you go like this?

986
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,055
I didn't even get to give him a hug.

987
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,402
Il-yong!

988
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,703
Il-yong.

989
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,747
Il-yong!

990
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,373
Wake up.

991
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,460
Oh Il-yong!

992
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:03,456
I'm Ms. Kang Eun-sil's distant nephew.

993
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,542
They brought the ghost in here!

994
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,627
What happened to Captain Kang…

995
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,170
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

996
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,714
The original owner drowned at sea,

997
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,716
and it's been around 30 years
since the owner changed.

998
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,303
Then why did you try to run,
leaving behind your patient?

999
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,097
It's your turn now.

1000
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,557
Wake up.

1001
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,308
He's really alive?

1002
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,018
Now the puzzle is almost complete.

1003
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,312
I should go visit him.

1004
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,107
We'd meet again soon.

1005
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:34,988
