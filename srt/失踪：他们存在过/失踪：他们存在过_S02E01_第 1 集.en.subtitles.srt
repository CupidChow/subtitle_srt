1
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,887
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,389
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,905
1 YEAR AGO, DUON VILLAGE

4
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,251
There were.

5
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,506
There were people who could
see us dead folks.

6
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,259
They helped us.

7
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,055
They sent word to our loved ones for us

8
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,682
and even helped us resolve our regrets.

9
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,810
Thanks to them,

10
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,856
many of the villagers
were able to leave this place.

11
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,528
They're like family to us.

12
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,489
I'm very grateful for their help.

13
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,453
I wonder how they're doing.

14
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,492
Are you okay?

15
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,518
Let's go.

16
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,314
-Stay here and keep watch.
-Yes, sir.

17
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,695
Obviously, you don't do drugs.

18
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,989
As for allergies, everyone has those.

19
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,451
If only his condition hadn't deteriorated…

20
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,121
Everyone comes to me
with people that are about to die.

21
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,457
Forget the sob story.

22
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,959
Here's ten million won up front.

23
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,086
You'll get the rest after the surgery.

24
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,092
Sir.

25
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,472
I'd like just another million.

26
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,143
After all, I am selling
a completely healthy organ.

27
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,270
So please take pity on me.

28
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,189
Just another million won.

29
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,524
Let's see how fresh it is
after the surgery.

30
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,568
You may not get the rest of the money.

31
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,906
If you happen to just
take the money and run,

32
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,616
then this won't end at one kidney.

33
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,661
You may have two kidneys,
but you've only got only one life.

34
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,412
He also only has one life.

35
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,915
So be sure to eat well
and exercise an hour a day.

36
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,257
Stay healthy until we next meet.

37
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:25,932
-Hello.
-Hello.

38
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,351
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

39
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,019
-Take your time.
-Thank you.

40
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,855
Please tell me if you need anything.

41
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,439
Where did he go?

42
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,899
Where is he? Damn it.

43
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,277
Boss.

44
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,084
-Hey!
-Hey!

45
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,337
Get him! Hurry!

46
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,177
Hey, go up this way!

47
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,804
Hey, get him!

48
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,018
Let go!

49
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,603
Let go of me!

50
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,229
Let go of me. Wait.

51
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,856
Let go of me first and we'll talk.

52
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,693
You dare try and scam me?

53
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,320
Huh?

54
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,365
Hey, let's cut this fool up
and take out all his organs.

55
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,409
What? Take out what?

56
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,452
Your organs.

57
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,995
Don't you know what organs are?

58
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,289
Liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys.

59
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,207
And the rest here.

60
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,418
Large intestines, small intestines,
stomach, gallbladder, and bladder.

61
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,546
We'll sell what we can
and throw away the rest.

62
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,382
-Bring him.
-Wait a minute! Hey!

63
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,176
You're making a big mistake.

64
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,220
-Let me go first--
-Hey, Kim Seok-hun.

65
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,892
Hey, Detective Shin.

66
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,144
What are you doing here?

67
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,145
What do you think?

68
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,189
I came to catch a con man, of course.

69
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,357
Bastards.

70
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,735
Kim Seok-hun,
you're under arrest for fraud.

71
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,740
What?

72
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,826
Did he con you guys too?

73
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,453
That's great. Let's all go
to the station as witnesses.

74
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,665
Witnesses? They're criminals!

75
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,251
They threatened
to cut out my organs just now!

76
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,418
Threatened you?

77
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:00,837
Not at all.

78
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,047
We weren't conned at all.

79
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,757
We were just about to be conned,

80
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,010
but you arrived
just in time to prevent it.

81
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,720
We'll be leaving now.

82
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,973
Let's go, friends.

83
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,017
Hey!

84
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,144
Goodbye.

85
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,896
Hey…

86
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,318
You're always one step too late,
but you were right on time today.

87
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,320
What have you been up to?

88
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,738
Those thugs

89
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,451
conned Su-hyeok's mom
over an organ transplant so I…

90
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:32,952
Goodness.

91
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,996
Anyway, what are you really doing here?

92
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,998
Jong-a called.

93
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,126
I knew it.

94
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,596
Wow, I thought I was
really done for this time.

95
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,432
Detective Shin arrived
just in time to save me.

96
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,185
I was waiting for you,
but you didn't show up.

97
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,854
-So Ms. Lee made a call.
-What?

98
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,440
That doesn't make sense.
He came too quickly for that.

99
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,108
I actually called him in advance.

100
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,153
He was the Plan B in case of an emergency.

101
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,822
Smart as ever.

102
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,076
You know me, I'm incredibly meticulous.

103
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,536
Speaking of which,

104
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,705
you both know rent's due tomorrow, right?

105
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,500
Hey.

106
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,419
You were a week late last month,
so I paid for you, remember?

107
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,756
What did we say when we moved in here?

108
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,133
We'd share the rent and the space equally.

109
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,302
That was the promise!

110
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,304
You said we'd split the rent!

111
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,348
If you guys keep this up,

112
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,183
I can't live here with you anymore.

113
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,269
Of course, we'll pay our share.

114
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,981
Do we look like people
who wouldn't pay our rent?

115
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,066
Goodness, my joints hurt.

116
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,529
I'm heading in.

117
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,326
Gosh, it's been a while since I ran,
so my legs hurt.

118
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,328
My goodness.

119
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,669
Thank you for your transaction.

120
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,549
I'm sorry, Jong-a.

121
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,428
But this is really
going to be the last time.

122
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,985
The bone marrow donor

123
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,196
disappeared without a word…

124
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,452
so I sought them out in my desperation.

125
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,540
Even so,
soliciting organ transplants is illegal.

126
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,793
And they conned you out of your money.

127
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,881
Here.

128
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,341
The ten million won they took.

129
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,801
Thank you.

130
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,098
Use it for the hospital bills.

131
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,519
You said you were behind in your payments.

132
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,731
How can I possibly take this?

133
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,983
With your hands, of course.

134
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,281
I had some money saved up,
but I don't have anywhere to spend it.

135
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,410
And it's not like
Su-hyeok is some stranger.

136
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,289
I've known him since he was in diapers
and barely knew how to walk.

137
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,129
-Still…
-I'm not just giving you the money.

138
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,173
Pay me back when you can.

139
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,931
I'll get going.

140
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,110
You went there again?

141
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,153
I'm just checking it out on my way home

142
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,280
in case anyone stopped by.

143
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,741
Hey, listen up.

144
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,744
Just how incompetent are you
as a detective

145
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,581
that you can't find a missing person
for three months?

146
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,750
I've heard that before.

147
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,921
You said that to me two years ago.

148
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,008
Stop wandering around alone and go home.

149
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,260
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,520
It's always been open.

151
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,400
Is anyone home?

152
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,068
Mr. Jeon Dae-gyeong?

153
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,989
Be quiet if you don't want to die.

154
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,121
You want to die?

155
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,042
Mr. Jeon Dae-gyeong.

156
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,377
Are you home?

157
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,385
Be quiet, you idiot.

158
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,307
Be quiet.

159
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,809
Unless you really want to die.

160
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,809
Goodness.

161
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,561
Are you okay?

162
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,897
What happened?

163
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,482
That's what I want to know.

164
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,692
You were out cold in the front yard.

165
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,736
You called 911 yourself.

166
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,820
See?

167
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,405
I did?

168
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,949
I don't remember doing that.

169
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,200
See?

170
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,330
Do you remember who hit you?

171
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,750
According to the officers
who were sent there,

172
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,085
the place seems to have been robbed.

173
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,254
They took everything
that seems to be of worth.

174
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,172
-Any witnesses?
-No one yet.

175
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,591
The local patrol officers
are asking around, so wait a bit.

176
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,515
Wook.

177
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,393
Wook.

178
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,021
Kim Wook!

179
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,943
Wake up. We're supposed
to go to the bank together.

180
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,820
Right, the bank.

181
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,032
Hurry up.

182
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,078
What do you mean, I have no credit?

183
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,540
I worked hard all my life
and paid all my taxes.

184
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,334
Look. I also have a history
of consistent bank transactions.

185
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,544
You don't have proof of income

186
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,921
or an Earned Income Tax
Withholding Receipt.

187
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,756
Then you can't get a line of credit.

188
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,050
You must prove your income.

189
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,095
So how can I do that?

190
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,515
There's a history of deposits
in my bank account records.

191
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,726
This won't work.

192
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,228
Do you have any collateral you can put up?

193
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,189
Like a house or a building.

194
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,362
Here.

195
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,992
120,000 won.

196
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,124
Wow, Wook.
You really came through this time.

197
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,840
Darn it.

198
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,511
You know,

199
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,598
you may look slick on the outside,
but you're poorer than I am.

200
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,186
You and I will really
be kicked out at this rate.

201
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,815
You're right.

202
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,068
We can't continue to live like this.

203
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,028
We need to pay our rent

204
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,155
as well as prepare for our retirement.

205
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,325
We can't continue doing something
that doesn't pay.

206
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,411
And it's not like anyone will
acknowledge the good work we do.

207
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,454
Right.

208
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,624
Since we found
all the people from Duon Village,

209
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,335
I'm going to look for a regular job.

210
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,839
My former employee called
to say he opened a factory.

211
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,216
I should go visit.

212
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,343
That's good news.

213
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,053
Does he have a spot for me too?

214
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,225
I'm going to find a new job

215
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,686
and be successful
so I can brag about it to Jong-a.

216
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,439
I'm not going to even glance
at helpless victims now.

217
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,149
-Okay.
-Just you watch.

218
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,110
I'm going to only look out for myself.

219
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,736
You do that. We'll see.

220
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,071
I need to use the restroom.

221
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,198
This always happens when I drink coffee.

222
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,788
Yes, Prosecutor.

223
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,124
I found it and left it
where you told me to.

224
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,376
Yes.

225
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,004
I'm waiting at the café. Please hurry.

226
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,630
Okay.

227
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,178
Who in the world
would steal someone else's bankbook?

228
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,141
Something's going on.

229
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,978
You said we'd split the rent!

230
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,523
If you guys keep this up,
I can't live here with you anymore.

231
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,658
No, ma'am. That's not it.

232
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,869
That's what the prosecutor told me.

233
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,996
That they conned me using my money.

234
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,999
That prosecutor is the con man.

235
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,169
Why would a prosecutor con someone?

236
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,589
A prosecutor didn't con you.

237
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:32,301
A con man fooled you
into thinking he's a prosecutor.

238
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,011
Oh, dear.

239
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,262
When did he say he was coming?

240
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,264
The one who told you
to withdraw the money?

241
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,517
I'm going to catch that guy
and expose him for the criminal he is!

242
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,729
He said he'd be here soon.

243
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,316
If he sent his lackey,

244
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,069
he's probably around here somewhere.

245
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,112
He ran away just now.

246
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,739
Who?

247
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,074
The one that just left?

248
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,618
Damn it.

249
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,954
Call the cops
and report a case of voice phishing!

250
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:01,914
What? The cops?

251
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,919
-Oh, dear.
-What?

252
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,630
Are you all right?

253
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,423
Wait just a minute.

254
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,927
Hello. Is this the police?

255
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,806
This is Poongin Intersection.
There's been a voice phishing scam.

256
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,849
The place that sells fruit juices.

257
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,392
Yes.

258
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,758
Damn it.

259
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,263
Hey! Where are you going?

260
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,016
Hey. Bring that back.
I'm a police officer!

261
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,143
Hey!

262
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,647
Someone stop that guy!

263
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,190
He's a scammer!

264
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,025
-Stop that man!
-Hey!

265
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,861
The scammer!

266
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,862
Get him!

267
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,954
Hey! You punk!

268
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,541
Hey…

269
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,377
Please step back and tap the card…

270
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,879
Please step back…

271
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,672
Tap one card at a time.

272
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,175
Tap the card first.

273
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,469
Insufficient balance.

274
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,389
Insufficient balance.

275
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,153
-He went that way.
-What? Okay.

276
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,822
Why didn't you catch him if you saw him?

277
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,659
If I don't catch you today,

278
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,661
I'll shave my head.

279
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:31,897
Over there!

280
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,208
Move!

281
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,797
Move!

282
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,800
Damn it.

283
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,931
-Oh my!
-Goodness!

284
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,150
Hey.

285
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,653
I nearly had to shave my head
because of you.

286
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,823
Help.

287
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,074
Sir.

288
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,203
Let go of me, please.

289
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,454
Thank you.

290
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:31,999
Come here.

291
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,795
The money!

292
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,172
Why should I give you the money?

293
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,425
Come here, you bastard. Where's the money?

294
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,718
-Wait.
-Where is it, you jerk?

295
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,844
Here it is.

296
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,057
This is the old lady's money.

297
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,767
You mean her?

298
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,769
-Yes! That's right.
-Take him away!

299
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,733
You little weasel!

300
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,324
Here you go. This is yours, right?

301
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,035
Thank you so much.

302
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,163
Thank you.

303
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,756
-I think that's…
-Thank you.

304
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,759
I don't know how I'll repay him.

305
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,177
Not at all.

306
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,388
He just did what he had to do.
Be careful with that money.

307
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,266
Great job. Would you like a picture?

308
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,517
You were awesome.

309
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,810
Not at all.

310
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,856
Now, now. Come, everyone.

311
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,149
You can take pictures.

312
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,859
It's fine if you take pictures.

313
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,196
-You're awesome.
-Take as many as you want.

314
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,114
Oh, my shoulders.

315
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,407
It was nothing.

316
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,242
-Come this way.
-Goodness!

317
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,327
Come here.

318
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,913
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

319
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,043
RECENT CALLS

320
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,462
Why so serious?

321
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,756
Something feels off.

322
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:07,719
Is it possible to call 911
when you've lost consciousness?

323
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,430
Did you check the recording
in the situation room?

324
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,140
They only heard groans.

325
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,934
They thought it was a prank at first,

326
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,186
but they dispatched someone
because the caller didn't hang up.

327
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:20,857
Hey, kid.

328
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,236
What brings you here today?

329
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,742
I'm Mun Bo-ra, a seventh grader
at Seohan Girls' Middle School.

330
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,495
My mother went missing.

331
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,666
So…

332
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,836
your mother didn't come home for two days?

333
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,254
And her phone's turned off?

334
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,296
Yes.

335
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,509
Has your mom ever done this before?

336
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,427
She did stay out a few times,

337
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,346
but she always told me beforehand.

338
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,557
She's never turned off her phone before.

339
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,475
What about your other family?

340
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,393
Your dad or--

341
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,062
I wouldn't be reporting this myself
if I had anyone else.

342
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,356
All I have in this world is my mom.

343
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,527
Then by any chance,

344
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,737
is there anyone your mother

345
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,239
meets or contacts often?

346
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,283
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

347
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,743
Her best friend is Aunt Ji-yeong,
but I don't know her phone number.

348
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,911
Aunt Ji-yeong?

349
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:15,996
What's her last name?

350
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,289
Where does she live?

351
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,166
Mister, do you know
your mom's friends' full names,

352
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,293
phone numbers, and where they live?

353
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,588
Sorry.

354
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,008
Then do you know where your mother works?

355
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,218
Did Bo-ra say that?

356
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,928
That her mom works at a restaurant?

357
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,680
She's wrong, you know.

358
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,557
Then where does she work?

359
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,309
Isn't it obvious?

360
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,103
She goes out wearing heavy makeup
and scanty clothes

361
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,313
then comes home at dawn.

362
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,814
A restaurant, my foot.

363
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,649
She probably works at a bar or something.

364
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,818
Right. A bar.

365
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,863
I heard that Ms. Mun Se-yeong
hasn't been home in two days.

366
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,698
It's only been two days.

367
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,117
She often doesn't come home
for three to four days.

368
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,161
How do you know that?

369
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:00,290
I always wake up
at the sound of her heels clacking.

370
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,543
My bedroom is right next to
the front gate, so I can hear everything.

371
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,421
Sometimes, when I'd look outside
early in the morning,

372
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,299
I would see her with some man.

373
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,636
She probably ran away with a man
and left her child behind.

374
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,471
I see.

375
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,534
When you were waiting at the café,

376
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,662
did you see?

377
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,080
See what?

378
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,166
Anything strange,
suspicious, or disturbing.

379
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,751
I did see something.

380
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,338
Someone who felt strange,
suspicious, and disturbing.

381
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,006
I caught him, remember?

382
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,551
And I received
the Brave Citizen's Award for it.

383
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,305
-What I meant was--
-Wook!

384
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,307
Mr. Jang! Turn on the news.

385
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,392
Hurry!

386
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,768
What?

387
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,854
No, this is an important scene--

388
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:05,814
This afternoon,

389
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,983
a citizen caught a voice phishing scammer

390
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,609
and handed him over to the police.

391
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,736
-The police gave the citizen…
-Amazing.

392
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,239
-Hey! That's me!
-the Brave Citizen's Award…

393
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,865
THIS AFTERNOON, A CAFÉ IN SEOUL

394
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,450
I was recorded?

395
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,078
You're so small on the screen
that I can't tell it's you.

396
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,914
You can see me just fine!
Anyone can tell it's me!

397
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,125
Take a look. Look how fast I run.

398
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,544
My vision's been blurry lately,
so I can't see well.

399
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,504
You have no problem watching dramas.

400
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,339
It's also on social media.

401
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,885
"A long-haired hunk
who caught a phone scammer."

402
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,805
Awesome.
The view count is through the roof.

403
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,349
Why didn't you give an interview?

404
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,934
I can't do that on my own.

405
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,145
Someone must ask me
for an interview, you know.

406
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,397
Reporters are always the problem.

407
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,232
They don't think to look for the hero.

408
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,235
Instead, they just copy the video
and write articles on that.

409
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,070
They're not doing their jobs properly.

410
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,574
I'm having instant noodles too.

411
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,701
You haven't had dinner yet?

412
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,618
No.

413
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:02,954
You sure eat well.

414
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,792
I'm closing the store tomorrow,
so I had to do inventory.

415
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,175
-Why are you closing the pawnshop?
-Hey, they were showing my face.

416
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,218
-Are you going somewhere?
-My parents' home.

417
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,553
-Oh.
-It's my dad.

418
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:22,599
He still nags me for quitting
my government job.

419
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,767
He wants me to get married

420
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,270
or take another exam
and find a stable job.

421
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,439
-If not, he wants me to move back home.
-I see.

422
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,566
I'm going to end this discussion
once and for all.

423
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,735
Plus, I'll get to see my friends.

424
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,736
I see.

425
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,156
Want to come with me, Wook?

426
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,492
You can meet my parents and say hello.

427
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,744
Forget it.

428
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,995
Listen to your dad.

429
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,499
A stable source of monthly income
is a wonderful thing.

430
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,127
You should try paying
your monthly rent on time.

431
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,670
Okay?

432
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,005
Okay.

433
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,132
What now?

434
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,220
That's it?

435
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,556
Yes. I really thought it was a loan.

436
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,642
Hey.

437
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,229
What moneylender would order
a stranger to collect money for them?

438
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,481
You were the middleman
in a voice phishing scam.

439
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,024
That's how they operate.

440
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,651
I really didn't know.

441
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,403
Normally, you'd be detained,

442
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,406
but since you have no previous record
and were cooperative, I'll release you.

443
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,573
Got it?

444
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,117
Thank you so much, Detective.

445
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,078
You'll be sent to trial
and have to pay for your crimes anyway.

446
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,830
They'll contact you soon.

447
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,624
-Be sure to take the call.
-Yes, I will.

448
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,876
I'll be sure to stay out of trouble.

449
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,673
Yes, sir.

450
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,676
I had the bad luck
to be caught by some jerk.

451
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,387
Of course, I didn't tell them any names.

452
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,680
Don't worry, sir.

453
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,473
Yes, I'll take care of it.

454
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,308
Yes. Take care.

455
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,269
Yes, sir.

456
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,065
Damn it.

457
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,818
Damn it.

458

HANGUK UNIVERSITY MED STUDENT

00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,269
I thought she looked familiar.

461
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,812
Goodness…

462
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,273
She's grown old already.

YANG EUN-HEE
PLEASE FIND MY DAUGHTER

468
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,167
It is her.

469
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,110
-When are you going to move?
-Stop holding out.

470
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,655
-The residents…
-If you ruin the redevelopment here,

471
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,073
will you take responsibility?

472
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,491
I'm sorry.

473
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,951
I have my reasons.

474
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,244
DEMOLISH

475
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,287
-How could you do this to us?
-Come on.

476
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,457
-Reasons, my foot. Don't we all?
-What's going on?

477
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,626
Why are you ganging up on an old woman?

478
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,169
Who are you?

479
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,088
You're on the same team, aren't you?

480
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,131
-Stay out of it if you don't live here!
-Stay out!

481
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,677
You should stop causing a ruckus
in front of someone else's home and leave.

482
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,512
-We're the victims here.
-What are you talking about?

483
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,847
What do you want her to do?

484
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,223
Leave before I call the police!

485
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,307
We're not going anywhere!

486
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,767
-The police?
-I'll call the police!

487
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,685
Go inside.

488
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,687
-Go in.
-Where do you think you're going?

489
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,689
-Keep it up.
-Come here!

490
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,607
-Huh? Come talk!
-We want to talk!

491
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,860
-Okay. Keep going.
-Why are you filming?

492
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,903
I'm recording all of you.

MS. YANG EUN-HEE
YOUR BILL FOR JULY IS 34,500 WON

497
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,851
I'm sorry.

498
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,561
You didn't have to see that.

499
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,608
Ms. Kim.

500
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,612
You remember me, don't you?

501
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,450
How could I not, Mr. Jang?

502
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,036
Things were so chaotic two days ago.

503
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,330
And I was in a panic.

504
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,419
Anyway, who are those people outside?

505
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,130
This area was approved
for redevelopment three years ago

506
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,507
and everyone has moved away

507
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,468
except for me.

508
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,971
They can't start
the construction because of me.

509
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,264
Of course, they'd act like that.

510
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,183
I understand how they feel.

511
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,353
But I'm not going anywhere.

512
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,730
Not until I find Eun-hee.

513
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,982
If our house is torn down,

514
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,693
my daughter won't be able
to find her way home.

515
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,406
I feel like she'll come home anytime now,

516
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,580
calling out to me as she comes in.

517
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,917
Mom!

518
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:47,340
-Mom, I got fried chicken.
-My doctor daughter is here.

519
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,092
You must be tired. Sit down.

520
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,971
Mom, I'm not a doctor yet.

521
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,056
You're a doctor
if you're in medical school.

522
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,474
Oh, hush.

523
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,062
Ta-da.

524
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,647
What is it?

525
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,152
This is really expensive.

526
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,446
Mom, you shouldn't have.

527
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,700
Now call me whenever you want
at your place.

528
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,369
Mom.

529
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,329
Thank you.

530
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,414
My baby.

531
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,459
You're my very own doctor.

532
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,836
I told you. I'm not one yet.

533
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,050
It's been 20 years

534
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,387
since I stopped locking my front gate.

535
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,767
I'm not afraid
of my neighbors criticizing me.

536
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,563
Dying without ever finding out
what happened to my daughter

537
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,773
is the only thing that scares me.

538
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,407
You understand how I feel,

539
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,243
don't you, Mr. Jang?

540
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,797
Ms. Kim Myeong-ja.

541
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,592
-Are you home?
-You stay here.

542
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,968
I'll go see what it's about.

543
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,929
Those people should be
ashamed of themselves.

544
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,392
Goodness.

545
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,936
I thought you were one of the neighbors.

546
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,855
We're from the court.

547
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,648
From the court?

548
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,941
Is Ms. Kim Myeong-ja home?

549
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,610
I have a court notice for her.

550
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:31,736
What notice?

551
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,113
I'm Kim Myeong-ja.

552
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,493
It's a restraining order
from Mr. Park Yeong-jun.

553
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,131
For not neglecting someone in difficulty

554
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,427
and helping catch a criminal
despite the dangers,

555
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,554
we thank you for your brave actions.

556
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,224
JANGUN POLICE STATION

557
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,895
BRAVE CITIZEN'S AWARD CEREMONY
JANGUN POLICE STATION

558
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:10,566
I just did what I'd normally do
without expecting an award.

559
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,651
Thank you!

560
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,203
That's some retirement party. Right, Wook?

561
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,872
That was a good thing you did.

562
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,126
Now stop sticking your nose
in other people's business

563
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,418
and take care of yourself.

564
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,545
Okay?

565
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,088
Oh, I'm sorry.

566
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,847
I'm sorry. I'll be on my way.

567
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,306
Excuse me.

568
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,726
What?

569
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,354
Is there something you want to say?

570
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,526
Could you let go of me first?

571
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,782
Hey.

572
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,534
He ran away just now.

573
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,660
He went that way.

574
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,292
It's you, isn't it?

575
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,501
From the café yesterday.

576
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,963
It is you.

577
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,548
Why are you here?

578
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,883
Why did you follow me here?

579
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,842
Are you…

580
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,179
with those criminals from yesterday?

581
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,349
What are you doing there
instead of coming in?

582
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,767
Oh.

583
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,687
-Where are you going?
-My parents' house. I told you yesterday.

584
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,064
What? Did someone scratch my car?

585
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,818
No, it's just that this guy is
holding me up.

586
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,737
-Who is?
-This guy here.

587
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,654
Him.

588
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,702
What's the matter with you?

589
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,724
Wook.

590
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,146
Wook.

591
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,607
Are you seeing them again?

592
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,028
Is someone here?

593
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,905
Wook.

594
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,866
Are you okay, Wook?

595
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,035
Wook.

596
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,705
Hi, Mom.

597
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,540
No, I won't be late.

598
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,210
Okay. I'm leaving now.

599
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,127
Okay.

600
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,005
Wook, you know I even
believe in aliens, right?

601
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,966
Call me if anything happens.

602
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,008
I'll come right away.

603
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,845
Okay.

604
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,430
-Have a safe trip home.
-Okay.

605
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,765
Drive carefully.

606
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,352
And you should get a hold of yourself.

607
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,778
It's been two years
and he's seeing ghosts again?

608
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,156
Is our home haunted?

609
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,626
You.

610
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,423
Are you dead?

611
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,511
Yes.

612
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,018
I'm seeing ghosts again?

613
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,521
I'm seeing ghosts again?

614
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,834
How have you been, Meonggun and Jjamppong?

615
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,253
How dare you come in here uninvited?

616
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,466
Didn't you see the faces
of that lady and her child just now?

617
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,843
They avoided you as if you were crazy.

618
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,345
And whose fault is that?

619
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,139
Anyway, I came in here for your sake.

620
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,057
You.

621
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,351
Are you really a ghost?

622
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,269
Are you from Duon Village?

623
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,395
No.

624
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,230
The villagers can't leave the village.

625
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,607
How did you get out?

626
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,237
I don't know.

627
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,114
Other people can't see me,

628
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,324
but you can.

629
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,992
No, I can't see you.

630
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,536
I can't see the dead or Duon Village.

631
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,288
-It seems like you can again.
-Why?

632
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,915
The man you caught yesterday.

633
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,750
He died.

634
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,245
Are you done crying?

635
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,665
If you took the product,
you should pay for it.

636
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,834
Don't you think so, Choi Jeong-ah?

637
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,009
Damn it.

638
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,273
Stay still.

639
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,406
The voice phishing scammer
I caught yesterday is dead,

640
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,366
and the person who killed him

641
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,535
kidnapped a woman in a wedding dress?

642
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,954
He called her Choi Jeong-ah.

643
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,499
Her life is in danger.

644
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,086
You should have reported that
to the police.

645
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,923
Anyway, why should I trust you?

646
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,967
My name is Oh Il-yong.

647
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,303
I died 3 years ago when I was 24.

648
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,180
Go ahead and check.

649
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,683
You don't have to believe me.

650
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,226
But then, that woman will die.

651
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,022
Fine. I'll report it, then.

652
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,024
I have nothing to lose.

653
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,027
People think I'm crazy anyway.

654
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,279
So where is she now?

655
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,614
In a warehouse?

656
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,240
I don't know if she's still there.

657
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,284
I just came here to tell you about her.

658
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,996
You can't just leave like this!

659
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,290
Do you know how many
Choi Jeong-ahs there are in Korea?

660
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,083
Hey, Mr. Oh Il-yong!

661
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,460
Darn it.

662
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,004
Mr. Oh Il-yong!

663
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,889
Mr. Jang.

664
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,806
Yes.

665
00:41:59,058 --> 00:41:59,975
They're back.

666
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,144
I can see them again.

667
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,231
What are you trying to say? Be specific.

668
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,857
Don't be cryptic.

669
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,025
What can you see now?

670
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,193
The dead.

671
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,112
Ghosts.

672
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,619
This is from a sponsoring company?

673
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,455
You received this car
as part of the award?

674
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,250
A car is part of
the Brave Citizen's Award?

675
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,126
That's not important right now.

676
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,795
When did you know?

677
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:31,549
When and how did you realize
that he was a ghost?

678
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:36,095
I realized it on my way back
from the bathroom at the café.

679
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,013
He passed through the window

680
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,183
instead of using the door.

681
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,894
He even passed through our front gate.

682
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,938
Why didn't you say anything?

683
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,566
I did.

684
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:52,111
I asked you if you saw anything
strange, suspicious, or disturbing.

685
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,155
How can you expect me to understand that?

686
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,324
You should have told me he was a ghost.

687
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,868
Why couldn't you say that he was dead?

688
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,161
That you saw everything!

689
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,123
You're so close-mouthed.

690
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,627
Even back in Duon Village, you saw
everything but pretended you didn't.

691
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,006
I just thought you didn't see him.

692
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,549
It's not like it's a good thing.

693
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,592
Anyway…

694
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,804
you and I are now seeing ghosts again.

695
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,181
There's something else.

696
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,726
Jjamppong can see them too.

697
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,478
Goodness.

698
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,689
Maybe seeing ghosts is hereditary.

699
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,025
Gosh.

700
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,193
Anyway, where are we going?

701
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,036
Did you see something?

702
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,537
-Be quiet.
-What?

703
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,164
What was that?

704
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,605
Look at this.

705
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,191
Oh, Detective Shin.

706
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,817
It's been a while.

707
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,027
How have you been?

708
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,111
Good enough.

709
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:21,241
What do you mean a woman
in a wedding dress has been kidnapped?

710
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,036
He said he saw them here.

711
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,665
Detective Shin. Did you find the car?

712
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,502
The license plate number you told me
was a fake one.

713
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,921
And no Choi Jeong-ah
has been reported missing.

714
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,547
I asked the Crimes Division.

715
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,132
So who reported it?

716
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,511
What does it matter who reported it?

717
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,554
What's important is
that there's a witness.

718
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:51,271
You're not telling me
that a ghost told you, are you?

719
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:54,983
What?

720
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,610
Really?

721
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,279
I don't know anything about this.

722
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,657
I really don't.

723
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,747
Yes.

724
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,918
A dead man named Oh Il-yong entered
through my front gate

725
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,129
and told me the guy
from the café was dead.

726
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,297
He also said a woman named Choi Jeong-ah

727
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,258
was trapped inside the car
of those who killed him.

728
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,343
He did.

729
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,303
Goodness.

730
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,806
So it is a ghost that told you.

731
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,599
You don't seem surprised.

732
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,643
I was very surprised.

733
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,812
Why would I be
when this isn't the first time?

734
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,230
So you're seeing them again.

735
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,232
Anyway,

736
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,735
it is true that Ahn Seong-jun,
the scammer you caught,

737
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,654
is dead.

738
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,450
He was stabbed,
but there were no security cameras

739
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,701
and no witnesses.

740
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,579
There was a witness.
Oh Il-yong saw the whole thing!

741
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,497
We should get a hold of him first.

742
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,790
Oh Il-yong or whatever.

743
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,751
I mean, the person that Wook saw.

744
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,421
Right.

745
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,632
Then we should find Oh Il-yong first.

746
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,925
He died three years ago,

747
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,761
and I think he said he was 24 at the time.

748
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,973
Okay. I'll look into it,

749
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,142
but you can't be calling me all the time

750
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,769
based on reports
from unreliable witnesses,

751
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,355
especially from dead people.

752
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,609
You're not the only one in a tough spot
because of this. I am too.

753
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,194
I don't want to do this anymore.

754
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,863
I really don't want to be involved
with the dead anymore.

755
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,907
I'm a bit busy so I should go now.

756
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,200
Okay.

757
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,702
Wow. The witness was a ghost?

758
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,454
My goodness.

759
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,041
How could you do that?

760
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,084
You could have told him what you saw.

761
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,961
Why did you make me out to be a madman?

762
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,671
You sure you won't get involved?

763
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,132
Il-yong or whatever his name is
will be back.

764
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:48,931
Here.

765
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,896
Did you find my mom?

766
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,358
Oh…

767
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,818
We're looking for her,

768
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,154
but we need to look further into it.

769
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,741
My mom…

770
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,078
She wasn't working
in a restaurant, was she?

771
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,802
She told me she worked in a restaurant.

772
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,304
But she'd smell of alcohol
when she came home at dawn.

773
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,432
So I had my suspicions.

774
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,438
Bo-ra…

775
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,650
Where your mom worked is not important.

776
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,569
What's important is
that we find her quickly.

777
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,489
So if you remember anything at all,
no matter how minor it is, tell me.

778
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,075
I'll do all that I can to find her.

779
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:51,910
Okay.

780
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,289
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

781
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,713
Oh, I'm on a diet.

782
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,006
Right.

783
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,555
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

784
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,689
Where are you?

785
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,401
Then we should find Oh Il-yong first.

786
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,736
He died three years ago

787
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,031
and I think he said he was 24 at the time.

788
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,534
Right.

789
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,914
MISSING PERSON SEARCH
OH IL-YONG

790
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,416
NO RESULTS

791
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,922
BACKGROUND CHECK

792
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,470
OH IL-YONG

793
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,189
-This is amazing.
-Awesome.

794
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,153
I'll be paying for everything,
including your cab fares,

795
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,279
so drink all you want.

796
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,530
Let's drink! Cheers!

797
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,282
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

798
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,002
This is unbelievable.
It doesn't make sense.

799
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,630
So Jeong-ah ran away on her wedding day?

800
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,006
Without paying Seul-gi back?

801
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,424
It's true.

802
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,386
She said she'd pay her back
after the wedding.

803
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,137
It must have all been a lie.

804
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,682
She turned off her phone
and just disappeared.

805
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:40,268
Apparently, she owed money
to a lot of people.

806
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,228
Jong-a.

807
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,730
Want to order
just two more bottles of beer?

808
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,691
So where did she spend all that money?

809
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,567
No one knows.

810
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,861
But there were rumors about her.

811
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,863
She once collapsed
after taking sleeping pills.

812
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,990
There were also rumors
that she worked as a hostess.

813
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,450
-What?
-Jong-a.

814
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,744
Can we order just one more bottle of beer?

815
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,289
She worked hard to save up
and move out of her parents' home.

816
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,292
Seul-gi, get up.

817
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,545
Wake up! We need to get your money back!

818
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,838
Wake her up.

819
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,216
Hey, Seul-gi.

820
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,801
Get up. Are you okay?

821
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,222
-What about the beer?
-Darn it.

822
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,058
Wake up!

823
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:24,730
Are you asleep?

824
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,024
You think this is your bedroom?

825
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,860
Sir, that's not what's important.

826
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,528
You know Jeong-ah, right?

827
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,822
Please find her. Choi Jeong-ah.

828
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:34,906
Goodness.

829
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,366
Don't even mention it.

830
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,536
I was at her wedding yesterday
and her mom fainted.

831
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,080
I skipped dinner
to take her to the emergency room!

832
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,081
Exactly my point.

833
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,917
A bride went missing on her wedding day.
We need to find her!

834
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,712
She had her face made up
and was wearing her wedding dress.

835
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,673
She said she'd pay off her balances
with the wedding gift money

836
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,300
and disappeared completely.

837
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,135
In any case,

838
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,596
it's not our job to find her
so she can pay back the money.

839
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,474
You should sue her instead.

840
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,018
-What?
-Then her case will be filed.

841
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,311
Come on.

842
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,105
Suing a friend
is a bit too much, isn't it?

843
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,148
What else can you do?

844
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,694
This is crazy.

845
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,119
You said you were done.

846
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,288
So why are we here?

847
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:27,584
I came here to say goodbye
if I can see them again.

848
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,021
Mr. Jang.

849
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,105
Can you see it?

850
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,024
No.

851
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,318
Why can't I see Duon Village

852
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,320
when I can see Oh Il-yong?

853
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,571
I don't know.

854
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,491
He must have some unresolved regrets.

855
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,284
But that's his problem.

856
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,911
What does that have to do with you and me?

857
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,206
He wouldn't have anything against us.

858
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,084
Why so curious
when you're just here to say goodbye?

859
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,128
Goodness.

860
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,046
Let's go.

861
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,554
What are you doing?

862
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,181
I should at least say hello
after coming all this way.

863
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,852
Even if we can't see them,
they can see us.

864
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:27,811
Hey.

865
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,064
It's not that way.

866
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,358
It's this way.

867
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,819
I lived here for ten years, Wook.

868
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,864
You can say hello in that direction.
I'll say hello over here.

869
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,116
You're being stubborn again, as always.

870
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,327
-Go on and wave in that direction.
-You idiot! It's over here!

871
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,122
-This is the right direction.
-I lived here for ten years…

872
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,126
You lived here for a decade
and still can't tell where it is.

873
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,461
There's nothing over there.

874
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,463
Please let me see him.

875
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,800
Please go home. The doctor is in surgery!

876
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,678
I can't go home like this.

877
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,263
Please let me talk to Mr. Park.

878
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:10,770
What's going on?

879
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:14,649
Mr. Park.

880
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,611
It's me. I'm Eun-hee's mom.

881
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,945
Let her go.

882
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,157
You know, don't you?

883
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,575
You know where Eun-hee is.

884
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,119
Just tell me that
and I'll never come back.

885
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,121
Please tell me where Eun-hee is.

886
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:32,042
I was in the middle of surgery
and have to go back.

887
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,669
-I'll call you after I'm done.
-I don't trust you!

888
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,795
I'm not leaving.

889
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,089
You said you'd call the last time
and you didn't!

890
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,382
You never took my calls

891
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,676
or see me when I went to your house!

892
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,220
And now you've reported me to the court?

893
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,722
I'll really call you this time.

894
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,223
Mr. Park.

895
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,017
We received a report.

896
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,689
What seems to be the problem?

897
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:01,237
Can't you go any faster?

898
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,114
We're nearly there.

899
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,201
You know, you're such a softie.

900
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,119
Didn't you say
you were looking for a new job?

901
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,081
You're one to talk. What about yourself?

902
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:16,169
So why was she even there?

903
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,546
The hospital director
was Eun-hee's boyfriend.

904
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,549
He returned a few years ago from abroad
and opened his practice.

905
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,009
But he's been avoiding Eun-hee's mom.

906
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,470
She even received
a court notice, didn't she?

907
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,347
If she violates the restraining order,

908
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,307
she can go to jail.

909
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,935
Instead of just barging in there,

910
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,853
she has to find a legal way to see him.

911
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,523
Imagine how desperate
she must have been to do that.

912
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,526
You really can't go any faster?

913
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,111
Calm down.

914
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,783
I don't believe you. Not anymore!

915
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,284
-There's been a misunderstanding.
-Ms. Kim.

916
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,662
-There's no trouble here.
-"No trouble"?

917
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:51,830
Jung-sik told me.

918
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,124
He said you know where Eun-hee is.

919
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,043
Where is my daughter?

920
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,336
Please calm down.

921
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,089
Let go of me. Let go!

922
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:04,426
Please don't let her
face any repercussions.

923
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,430
Where is my daughter?

924
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,144
Ms. Kim, what happened?

925
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,940
He knows where my Eun-hee is.

926
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,942
But he won't tell me.

927
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,986
I see. Is that so?

928
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,738
Let's get you up.

929
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,406
Let me take you home, okay?

930
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,412
On the way here,

931
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,498
my heart was beating so fast…

932
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:40,003
I didn't have anyone to call.

933
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,131
I'm sorry.

934
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,425
There's nothing for you to be sorry about.

935
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,303
Let's rest a bit here, okay?

936
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,808
SEARCHING FOR YANG EUN-HEE

937
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,560
-I know where she is.
-Goodness sake!

938
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,812
What are you doing here?

939
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,734
Don't talk to me.
I'm not getting involved with you.

940
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,612
That old lady's daughter.

941
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,031
I know where she is.

942
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,830
I'm a detective.

943
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,792
Thank you.

944
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,680
-Has the body been identified?
-Yes.

945
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,599
Choi Jeong-ah, 29 years old.

946
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:39,145
A woman wearing a wedding dress
has been kidnapped.

947
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,355
Her name is Choi Jeong-ah.

948
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,107
Please look for her.

949
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,784
Say that again.

950
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,369
You know what?

951
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,996
That old lady's daughter.

952
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:58,998
I know where she is.

953
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,959
She's been missing for 20 years.

954
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,168
I know.

955
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,462
Don't you dare lie.

956
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,880
I don't believe you.

957
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:09,467
The kidnapped woman in a wedding dress?
I went to the warehouse you mentioned.

958
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,468
She wasn't there.

959
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,303
And the plate number you gave me was fake.

960
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,346
-No, I--
-Hush!

961
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,597
I even went to Duon Village.

962
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,807
But I couldn't see anything.

963
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,016
Not the people nor the village.

964
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,188
I know you're dead.

965
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,482
but don't come to me anymore.

966
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,401
I never lied.

967
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,194
And I never said I was from Duon Village.

968
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,948
Don't come near me, okay?

969
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,623
Hello?

970
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,792
Hi, Detective Shin.

971
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:46,921
What?

972
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,346
What's going on?

973
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,349
Two police cars.

974
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,559
Was someone robbed?

975
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,520
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Lee.

976
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,772
Hey Jong-a, I heard
you're going back to Seoul today.

977
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:05,732
You're still here?

978
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,525
-I was about to leave.
-I see.

979
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,776
What's that all about?

980
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,778
My goodness.

981
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,238
I can't believe this happened.

982
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:14,908
Jeong-ah…

983
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,827
Her body was found down by the beach.

984
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,831
-Her body?
-Yes.

985
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,793
Her mom fainted,
so Officer Kim took her to the hospital.

986
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:26,794
She's dead?

987
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,297
The woman in a wedding dress?

988
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,346
I knew this was going to happen.

989
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,431
Did you see his face?

990
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:39,974
Yes.

991
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,018
They were wearing black clothes,
hats, and masks.

992
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,687
There were two of them,
and one had a tattoo on his arm.

993
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:45,772
Hold on.

994
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,608
Do you still think that I'm lying?

995
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,569
Do you still not believe
that I've seen the old lady's daughter?

996
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,698
Where is Yang Eun-hee?

997
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,180
I'd heard that factories
that went broke during the IMF crisis

998
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,516
were put on the market
at their scrap value.

999
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,143
So they ended up like this.

1000
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:27,063
It looks like it's haunted.

1001
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,482
We're supposed to meet him here?

1002
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,193
Yes. This is the address
that Il-yong gave me.

1003
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,529
One to fifty are this way.

1004
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,447
COMPLEX 3

1005
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:38,741
Is it this way?

1006
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,587
Wow.

1007
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,547
There's not even a stray cat around here.

1008
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,090
Is there really something here?

1009
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:57,552
You're the one who insisted we come
and you're worried?

1010
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,430
I'm more worried
that we'll really find Eun-hee here.

1011
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,690
Oh, 13-7.

1012
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,191
Here it is.

1013
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,612
It's really here.

1014
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:26,247
FACTORIES AND WAREHOUSES FOR URGENT SALE

1015
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:19,133
IN DANGER OF COLLAPSE
ENTRY RESTRICTED DUE TO RISK OF COLLAPSE

1016
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:11,144
There's another place…

1017
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,814
just like Duon Village.

1018
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,066
Mr. Jang.

1019
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,484
Yes?

1020
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,862
Do you see that too?

1021
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:24,741
Yes.

1022
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,285
I see it.

1023
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,483
You really came.

1024
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,628
The village is bigger than I thought.

1025
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:03,297
People here are dead
without knowing where their bodies are.

1026
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,632
Imagine how they must feel.

1027
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:07,218
You must have had a plan
when you brought them here.

1028
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,053
I have something to do
outside the village.

1029
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,806
How did he know to come and see you?

1030
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,808
You witnessed all this by accident?

1031
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:17,061
Never tell anyone
what happened before you died.

1032
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:20,898
Oh Il-yong could have
intentionally approached you.

1033
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,900
You're Hyeon-ji's dad, aren't you?

1034
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,361
You know my daughter?

1035
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:32,201
