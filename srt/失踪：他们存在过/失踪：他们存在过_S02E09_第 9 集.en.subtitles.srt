1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,887
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,972
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,433
Answer my question truthfully.

4
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,394
You two…

5
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,146
are not dead, are you?

6
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,792
Il-yong

7
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,251
is dead.

8
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,297
Like you, Detective Goh.

9
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,966
And…

10
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,803
-I--
-Wook.

11
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,347
-Look over there.
-I'm not dead.

12
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,228
I'm a living person.

13
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,815
What?

14
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,544
What…

15
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,004
did you just say?

16
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,675
You're not dead?

17
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,636
You're alive?

18
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,687
Yes.

19
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,588
You're really…

20
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,967
alive?

21
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,686
How…

22
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,023
Lead the way.

23
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,944
-To where?
-To wherever you came from,

24
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,904
so I can leave too.

25
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,322
You can't leave.

26
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,618
You said you already tried leaving.

27
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,369
So lead the way!

28
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,789
I mean,

29
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,707
you two

30
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,168
can take me outside.

31
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:31,961
Right?

32
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,759
Detective Goh,

33
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,969
it doesn't work that way.

34
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,474
I don't know.

35
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,559
I'm also curious

36
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,144
to know what would happen.

37
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,438
Kim said

38
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,232
he's a living person.

39
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,113
Put that gun away.

40
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,867
We're all dead
but he's the only one who's alive!

41
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,036
He doesn't deserve to be shot for that.

42
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,789
He's been lying to us!

43
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,416
He didn't intend to…

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,876
Oh, come on.

45
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,045
Right.

46
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,297
He must have had a good reason.

47
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,551
Lead the way.

48
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,392
I'd also

49
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,435
like to know what would happen.

50
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,277
Let's go.

51
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,929
-Let's go.
-Okay.

52
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,515
What's wrong?

53
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,725
I know where they'll show up.

54
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,642
What?

55
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,395
But…

56
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,367
Where are they?

57
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,244
They'll probably

58
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,538
be in front of the supermarket.

59
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,757
Let's go back.

60
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,219
I told you.

61
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,930
We can't go outside no matter what we do.

62
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,265
It doesn't make sense!

63
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,309
How can you all

64
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,311
be so calm about this?

65
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,231
It's nothing.

66
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,649
Go on.

67
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,071
Honestly, I also think this is crazy.

68
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,698
It's probably the same for anyone else.

69
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,326
He's right.

70
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,286
We're not calm because we don't care

71
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,789
but because we know
that him being alive or dead

72
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,207
won't change anything for us.

73
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,170
Unless you're planning
to parade this around,

74
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,713
everyone follow me.

75
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,798
You too, Detective Goh.

76
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,427
Stay here.

77
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,935
Don't be so upset

78
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,854
and go hear him out, Sang-cheol.

79
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,773
Get off.

80
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,529
So to sum it up,

81
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,656
Il-yong went to see Eun-hee's mother

82
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,700
and met Kim there for the first time.

83
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,246
Because he was amazed
that a living person could see him,

84
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,373
Il-yong brought Kim here.

85
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,793
And Kim has been helping
with finding the villagers' bodies

86
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,838
like Eun-hee, Seung-jae, and even Ro-ha.

87
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,089
Am I right?

88
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,841
Yes.

89
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,969
Actually, he did it all.

90
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,972
There's nothing I can do outside.

91
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,849
Il-yong provided a lot of information.

92
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,934
He was a big help.

93
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,564
So the living and the dead
were working together.

94
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,569
Leave them alone.

95
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,405
No use crying over spilled milk.
I'm the problem now.

96
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,198
Why is that?

97
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,870
Since Wook's already been discovered,
shouldn't I tell them too?

98
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,206
I don't think that's a good idea.

99
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,252
Wook has no ties here

100
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,464
but they'll think that you can see us
because of Hyeon-ji

101
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,884
and may demand that their families
be brought here too.

102
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,635
How are we going to deal with that?

103
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,429
So don't.

104
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,725
I just feel guilty
letting them take all the blame.

105
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,399
Thanks to you,

106
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,943
they caught everyone in Goliath's gang.

107
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,070
Goliath is in hiding,

108
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,240
but the police will catch him soon.

109
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,034
Was Gwang-taek caught too?

110
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,619
He's the one who killed me.

111
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,536
I know.

112
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,747
I told the police everything.

113
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,958
I also gave them
the evidence you told me about.

114
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,919
The one who killed you

115
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,587
went to prison for drugs,

116
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,548
but he hasn't confessed
to your murder yet.

117
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,092
The detectives are looking for evidence.

118
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,012
What about Team Leader Lee?

119
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,473
Does he know I'm here?

120
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,850
No.

121
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,810
Even if we tell him, he won't believe us.

122
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,687
They can't see this place.

123
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,064
Still, you must try.

124
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,482
You can see us.

125
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,567
There could be others like you.

126
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,027
I already tried.

127
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,196
When I told them I can see the dead,

128
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,115
they all thought I was crazy.

129
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,035
When I go around with Wook outside,

130
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,870
people all look at him strangely.

131
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,291
They only see him talking to himself.

132
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,380
And Captain Kang knew all this?

133
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,798
Yes.

134
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,177
We were able to find Seung-jae quickly
because she urged us to.

135
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,766
And where did you go today?

136
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,354
I met with Choi Young-bae's wife today.

137
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,523
We must find him
and send him away quickly.

138
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,066
That way, the kids will be safe

139
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,402
and you'll be able to rest easy.

140
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,821
If you thought so much of me,

141
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,073
you should have told me this.

142
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,706
Oh, it hurts.

143
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,499
Goodness, it hurts.

144
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,293
It hurts so bad.

145
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,545
Why did you open the door like that?

146
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,006
I just wanted to peek in a bit and listen.

147
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,675
How can you tumble so easily though?

148
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,677
You should really exercise your legs.

149
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,678
I'm not weak.

150
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,972
You're actually heavier than you look.

151
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,935
I'm as heavy as I look. Oh, it hurts.

152
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,520
By the way…

153
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,857
how come you can go outside?

154
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,111
I don't know why.

155
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,656
When I first came here,

156
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,285
Captain Kang told me
that I can never go out.

157
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,788
But when I tried it just in case,

158
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,416
I was just able to pass through.

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,126
You just passed through?

160
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,044
Yes.

161
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,255
I always return
to the tree in front of the store.

162
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,715
Actually,

163
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,884
there's nothing special
even if you can go out.

164
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,637
People can't see me

165
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,972
or hear me at all.

166
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,390
I'm completely invisible.

167
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,101
They just pass right through me.

168
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,646
Even so…

169
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,359
you can go see the people you miss.

170
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,074
Who is it that you want to see?

171
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,037
Being here

172
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,998
makes me think about my parents a lot.

173
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,794
After I became a cop,
I only went to see them

174
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,046
once or twice a year
saying that I was too busy.

175
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,716
I'd even cut their phone calls short.

176
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,344
I was going to call them later.

177
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,887
At the time…

178
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,265
I thought I had all the time in the world.

179
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,979
They'll be worried
that they can't contact me.

180
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,902
You want to know how they're doing?

181
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,703
SUPERMARKET

182
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,707
There are a lot of information
on kids at school,

183
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,334
so tell me if you need them.

184
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,293
Thank you.

185
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:52,962
Right, also…

186
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,425
When you find the body…

187
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,137
Do you meet the family?

188
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,807
It depends on the situation.

189
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,016
But sometimes we do.

190
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,895
We also tell them about the dead
in a roundabout way.

191
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,566
May I ask you for a favor?

192
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,318
Would you like to know about your family?

193
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,987
It's not that.

194
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,115
Well…

195
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,033
I would like to ask you

196
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,328
to never go to my home.

197
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,915
Why not?

198
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,086
I don't want

199
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,298
anyone to find my body.

200
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,843
I have my own reasons for that.

201
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:48,100
There must be a reason why you and Il-yong

202
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,728
came to have such special abilities.

203
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,147
You did so many good deeds

204
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,066
and there are many more people
you need to help.

205
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,277
I just don't want

206
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,113
you to waste your time on me.

207
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,865
Would you do that for me?

208
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,411
Of course.

209
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,832
All right, go on now.

210
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,002
-Good night.
-You too.

211
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,382
MUJIGAE BRANCH SCHOOL RECORDS

212
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,383
CHOI HA-YUN, LEE YEONG-RIM…

213
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,219
He asked you to do that?

214
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,178
Yes.

215
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,680
He doesn't want me to find him

216
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,265
or go see his family.

217
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:34,104
He also kept changing the subject
when I talked about him.

218
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,607
According to Captain Kang,

219
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,318
it has to do with his pension
that his wife gets.

220
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,070
Still…

221
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,572
It felt a bit strange.

222
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,534
What can we do?

223
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,537
We can't go digging
into other people's affairs.

224
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,579
I guess not.

225
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,040
Oh, dear.

226
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,793
It'd be perfect
if only we could take this with us.

227
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,794
Right.

228
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,422
I wish we could take people too.
Come on, let's go.

229
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,903
Hyeon-ji.

230
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,324
I'll make sure to find your friends too.

231
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,509
How did you

232
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,052
know about him?

233
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,723
He did bad things

234
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,100
to little kids.

235
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,274
That was a long time ago.

236
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,986
He can't do that now.

237
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,072
Not here, he can't.

238
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,410
You may find this hard to believe

239
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,121
but Choi Young-bae

240
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,708
is still doing bad things

241
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,211
even after he's dead.

242
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:48,405
Why did you want to meet me here?

243
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,076
I cremated his body in secret

244
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,578
and hid it here.

245
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,456
In there?

246
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,251
I wanted her

247
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,254
to take responsibility for her son.

248
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,840
I wanted her

249
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,885
to take her beloved son to the afterlife.

250
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,929
I thought he'd be in hell

251
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,807
but to hear that he's still
tormenting kids even after death…

252
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,601
I can't apologize enough

253
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,979
to those kids.

254
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,528
Now…

255
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,905
What do I do?

256
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,039
He's shamelessly asleep.

257
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,511
I met with Choi Young-bae's wife today.

258
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,221
We must find him
and send him away quickly.

259
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,764
That way, the kids will be safe

260
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,891
and you'll be able to rest easy.

261
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,813
He really did send him away.

262
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,207
Thank you.

263
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,086
For believing me.

264
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,088
I was…

265
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,051
actually surprised.

266
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,346
You said he was

267
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,725
still tormenting kids.

268
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,395
Do you

269
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,689
really believe me?

270
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,192
When a stranger comes up to me

271
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,320
and tells me things only I know,

272
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,781
how can I not?

273
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,618
For the past 15 years,

274
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,037
not a day went by

275
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,665
without me remembering what I did.

276
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,126
Thankfully…

277
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,880
my daughter doesn't know anything.

278
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,384
She doesn't remember
what she went through when she was young.

279
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,304
That's all I want.

280
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,058
That's enough.

281
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,122
You're…

282
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,542
the angel of death, aren't you?

283
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,919
You came to reveal my sins

284
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,588
because it's time for me to die, right?

285
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,676
It's nothing like that.

286
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,720
And I'm not the angel of death.

287
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,806
Then…

288
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,559
are you a policeman?

289
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,312
No.

290
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,108
It doesn't matter.

291
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,026
I'm not going to confess.

292
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,155
I don't plan to confess what I did

293
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,866
and die in peace.

294
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,161
I'd rather be imprisoned.

295
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,458
You can report me.

296
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,097
Okay.

297
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,849
All right.

298
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,895
He found Choi Young-bae.

299
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,937
Where?

300
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,899
He was cremated
and hidden in an urn in a columbarium.

301
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,859
His mother's urn, in fact.

302
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,904
I'm off to the village.

303
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,572
Right now?

304
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,035
I missed it.

305
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,127
Il-yong!

306
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,257
Oh Il-yong!

307
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,345
Why are you yelling
when you can just come in?

308
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,138
Choi Young-bae.

309
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,015
He's gone.

310
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,601
He escaped?

311
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,144
No, he disappeared.

312
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,145
Like Ro-ha.

313
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,775
They found him faster than I expected.

314
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,526
Have you told Captain Kang?

315
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,694
I'm on my way to her.

316
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,612
Let's go.

317
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,406
Even so…

318
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,076
you can't all come here and complain.

319
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,994
I told you it's not like that.

320
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,704
This is so frustrating.

321
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,040
Stop saying that and just tell us.

322
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,792
I was passing by

323
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,794
-and I saw it myself.
-What?

324
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,172
I knew he didn't hang around here much.

325
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,548
You all know me.

326
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,676
We've all known each other
for a long time.

327
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,678
So just tell us everything!

328
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,223
What's going on?

329
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,226
Can you go see if my kids are doing okay?

330
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,105
Just tell me
if my parents are still alive.

331
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,648
Tell me if my wife remarried.

332
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,775
-Let's not do this everyone.
-How dare you?

333
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,610
You acted just like us.

334
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,778
I saw you!

335
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,531
I hear there's
someone else besides Il-yong.

336
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,241
Was it Kim Wook?

337
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,909
Where is he?

338
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,161
-Is he out?
-Just stop it!

339
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,580
Everyone, get out.

340
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,957
-What?
-Why?

341
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,252
There's already enough to do for the dead.

342
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,587
So don't you dare bother
Il-yong about the living.

343
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,965
Stop bothering him and go home now.

344
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,174
-Come on.
-Please.

345
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,676
Who are you to butt in?

346
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,553
-You're not his mom.
-Who gave you the right?

347
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,221
I want to hear about the outside too!

348
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,307
-Yes.
-I can't believe you'd be like this.

349
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,018
-You have news of your family, don't you?
-My goodness!

350
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,644
How dare you?!

351
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,566
Every year,

352
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,152
I hold a service to commemorate
my husband and son here.

353
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,322
I have no family to ask about!

354
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,699
Why would you be so angry?

355
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,410
-You must be hiding something.
-I know, right?

356
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,330
Stop saying that
when you don't know anything.

357
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,831
You don't need to stand up for me.

358
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,168
You stay out of this.

359
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,210
Wait!

360
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,712
We want to talk to Il-yong.

361
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,432
I came running
when I heard that Choi Young-bae is gone.

362
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,268
Ha-yun was stuck inside all this time.

363
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,772
At least Yeong-rim was there
for her to play and laugh with.

364
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,649
But she must have been
feeling a bit stuffy.

365
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,777
She left just now to go to the playground.

366
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,362
That's great, I guess only kids
can understand kids.

367
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,239
Is this magnolia berry tea?

368
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,866
It's delicious.

369
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,452
Do you think

370
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,871
he's really gone?

371
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,581
What if he shows up again?

372
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,917
He's gone for good this time.

373
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,169
His remains were hidden in a columbarium

374
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,214
but his wife confessed
and scattered his ashes at sea.

375
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,591
How do you know that?

376
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,305
Well, didn't Mr. Jung tell you this?

377
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,557
I mean…

378
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,936
I heard the kids saw it outside.

379
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,270
Which kids?

380
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:18,897
What?

381
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,023
I'm talking about

382
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,901
Il-yong and…

383
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,362
Do you dry the berries yourself?

384
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,406
I do.

385
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,700
Call me when you make it next time.

386
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,202
This is really good.

387
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,580
Very nice.

388
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,960
I can't believe this.

389
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,090
What do you mean?

390
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,967
The villagers.

391
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,887
I now understand
why Captain Kang kept this a secret.

392
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,306
They're just desperate, that's all.

393
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,433
They

394
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,186
probably didn't have
the chance to say goodbye.

395
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,856
It was the same for me

396
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:02,899
and for you too.

397
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,363
I have no family since my mom passed away.

398
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,496
You guys had a fight?

399
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,919
How could you
when they explained everything?

400
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,171
-No.
-We didn't.

401
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,548
We didn't fight.

402
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,385
What's with you then?

403
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:34,264
The villagers came to Captain Kang

404
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:38,351
complaining that she's the only one
who knew I could go outside.

405
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,521
We tried to stop them
and ended up like this.

406
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,231
Where is she?

407
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,317
She wanted to go clear her head.

408
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,736
Where did she go?

409
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,280
She went that way.

410
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,907
What?

411
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,638
So all the villagers know?

412
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,431
Even that I'm alive?

413
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,100
I don't think they know that.

414
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,394
They only know that we can go outside.

415
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,562
She said she saw us.

416
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,232
She only heard bits while passing by.

417
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,025
So I don't think she heard that part.

418
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,693
But then…

419
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,155
who'd imagine
that a living person could be here?

420
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,990
The problem is Captain Kang.

421
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,079
She must have been hurt so much.

422
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,373
It's all my fault.

423
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,920
-I'm sorry.
-It's no one's fault.

424
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,296
We're all victims.

425
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,839
Captain Kang is also a victim.

426
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,342
This happened because of us.

427
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,552
So let's take care of it.

428
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,891
They can't believe I'd be like this?

429
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,560
It's making me angrier
the more I think about it.

430
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,564
How long have we lived here together?

431
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,316
Come on…

432
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,281
I'll just…

433
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,034
Lady Buan!

434
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,119
Come on out!

435
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,831
You came here after you were caught

436
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,625
stealing some pooled fund seven years ago.

437
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,751
I thought

438
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,629
even though you did something bad
you didn't deserve to die.

439
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,507
So I kept my mouth shut!

440
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,885
But now, I'm going to tell
everyone what you did!

441
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,305
That way it's only fair!

442
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,308
How could you be so selfish
when you're an adult?

443
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,600
Il-yong is a poor boy.

444
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,853
Did it anger you that I kept his secret?

445
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,022
Why aren't you answering?

446
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,441
I should really tell people everything.

447
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,067
Come on out!

448
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,779
Where is she?

449
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,490
Where did she go?

450
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,243
My goodness…

451
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,454
Who have I been talking to?

452
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,123
I'm so angry.

453
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,625
Lady Buan!

454
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,349
On that piece of paper

455
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,143
please write your name, address

456
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,354
and one thing you'd really like to know.

457
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,980
Then Il-yong and I

458
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,815
will go find out for you.

459
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,110
Sometimes, we find out
that people have moved away

460
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,820
and can't find them.

461
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,197
And even if we do find them,

462
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,616
they can't see me.

463
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,326
So all I can do

464
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,994
is just see how they're doing.

465
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,330
-That's enough for me.
-Of course.

466
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,041
It's more than we can hope for.

467
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,459
Let's fill this out.

468
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,212
I hope they didn't move.

469
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,598
Why aren't you writing anything, Mr. Jang?

470
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,059
What?

471
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,522
Everything I want to know
is in this village.

472
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,900
-About Hyeon-ji?
-Yes.

473
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,695
What about you, Mr. Jung?

474
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,198
Me?

475
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,616
I have no regrets

476
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,369
left outside.

477
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,206
I like it here.

478
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,918
If you're done,

479
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,462
you can turn in your paper to us.

480
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,256
I'm so happy.

481
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,924
-This is great.
-I feel better.

482
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,149
There's no one here either.

483
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,693
Where could they be?

484
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,697
Captain Kang.

485
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,283
You weren't in the store

486
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,243
or your home so I wondered where you were.

487
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,329
I felt so angry
the more I thought about it.

488
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,706
So I decided to take a walk.

489
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,251
Why is the village so quiet?

490
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,794
Everyone is at school.

491
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:16,921
School?

492
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,424
Everyone in the village found out.

493
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,593
Since they all know, they explained it

494
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,888
and had people write down
their names, addresses,

495
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,140
and what they want to find out.

496
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,934
Then Il-yong and Wook will go find out.

497
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,227
So they're doing that.

498
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,814
They're going to check out
all those places?

499
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,276
They'll do what they can
and give up what they can't.

500
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,112
But thanks to that,

501
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,239
we finished taking a census of everyone.

502
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,996
I've been feeling sorry
about bothering you for their stories.

503
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,709
It must have been annoying,
me asking you so many questions.

504
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,796
Not at all.

505
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,172
Don't say that.

506
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,594
I heard everything
that happened from Il-yong.

507
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,846
Captain Kang.

508
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,723
Yes?

509
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,352
You did well all on your own.

510
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,153
Let's go.

511
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,531
Okay. Heading to school?

512
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,865
No, I want to go home.

513
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,659
How about some rice wine?

514
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,911
-You want rice wine?
-Yes.

515
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,038
I had soju, so let's drink that.

516
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,794
These are the names
and addresses of the villagers.

517
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,421
I have half and the other half

518
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,965
is in Mr. Jang's notebook.

519
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,383
So are you now

520
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,593
officially known in the village

521
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,136
as someone who can go outside?

522
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,638
Together with Mr. Oh Il-yong?

523
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,223
Yes.

524
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,309
Mr. Jung said to me

525
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,021
that there must be a reason
why I have such an ability.

526
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,899
But I still don't know why.

527
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:04,112
Let's assume Mr. Jang can see them
because of Hyeon-ji, but why me?

528
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,074
I really don't know why I can see them.

529
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,662
Your mother was in Duon Village.

530
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,666
Maybe you have a family member
you don't know about.

531
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,377
Someone I don't know about?

532
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,088
Besides Bo-ra?

533
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,632
You said Bo-ra isn't
your biological daughter.

534
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,428
Biological family isn't everything.

535
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,306
You, Mr. Jang, and I are a family.

536
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,475
Bo-ra is now our family too.

537
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,519
Anyway,

538
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,898
there definitely must be a reason
why you can see the village.

539
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,170
Who is she?

540
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,381
Why do I keep seeing her?

541
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,719
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

542
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,263
They deny even when faced with evidence.

543
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,891
I asked them
about Sang-cheol several times

544
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,476
but they're denying everything.

545
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:17,936
Don't worry.

546
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,779
I already said this many times
to the other detective.

547
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,572
I don't know where he is.

548
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,078
Who else would know but you?

549
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,497
Would Goliath know?

550
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,127
Delivery boys like us
don't even know Goliath's face.

551
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,963
Sang-cheol, that traitor,

552
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,132
ran because he knew cops were coming.

553
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,678
Hey.

554
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,555
How can a dead man run?

555
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,225
Sang-cheol is dead?

556
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,644
Yes, in a container.

557
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,688
I heard he said this before he died.

558
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,025
"Gwang-taek,

559
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,236
it's a misunderstanding."

560
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,571
Gwang-taek.

561
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,699
It's a misunderstanding.

562
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,534
It's a misunderstanding.

563
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,289
I have no idea what you're talking about.

564
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,086
I'd better go now.

565
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,175
Do you know that the needle
you used on Choi Jeong-ah is at the NFS?

566
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,218
About that,

567
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,596
Sang-cheol hid that carefully
before he died

568
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,975
and sent it to us after his death.

569
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,187
After you killed him

570
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,440
by stabbing him with a knife.

571
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,696
See you again.

572
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,543
SO GOOD COFFEE

573
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,754
This is nice.

574
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,130
Hey, Detective Shin.

575
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,174
Where's Ms. Lee Jong-a?

576
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,175
Oh, her?

577
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,010
I don't know.

578
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,387
She's in her office.
Do you want me to get her?

579
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,222
-No, it's okay.
-Okay.

580
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,683
Here.

581
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,396
I didn't order this.

582
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,107
It's something I recently created.

583
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,028
Very sweet amazing choco latte
with cocoa chocolate chips.

584
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,696
I named it. It's cute, isn't it?

585
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,616
This is on the house.

586
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,619
I'd like your honest opinion on this.

587
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,204
-Okay, thank you.
-Enjoy.

588
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,291
He's Jong-a's friend
and a bit too enthusiastic.

589
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,709
He also eats a lot.

590
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,002
He's okay though.

591
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,550
Two years ago…

592
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,386
Remember those criminals
who fled to China?

593
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,890
They're back in Korea.

594
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,893
The ones that followed you around?

595
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,019
Yes.

596
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,855
The ones that hit Nam-guk with a car
and killed Yeo-na.

597
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,196
Where did you see them?

598
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,073
At the prison.

599
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,909
They came to see Lee Dong-min.

600
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,786
They were visiting him?

601
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,205
Yes.

602
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,582
Why were you there?

603
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,459
Lee Dong-min

604
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,087
sent me some letters.

605
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,213
What letters?

606
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,048
Threats?

607
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,926
It's kind of hard to say they were threats

608
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,762
but he regularly sent me a lot of letters.

609
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,976
So that's why you went
to see Lee Dong-min?

610
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,103
Yes.

611
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,691
Stop laughing.

612
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,110
You're making me sick.

613
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,363
It's been a while.

614
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,991
Why did you come all this way?

615
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,784
You called me.

616
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,370
In your letter.

617
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,456
The big picture?

618
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:09,792
You crazy bastard.

619
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,338
Focus on atoning for your sins.

620
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,841
Don't try pulling any tricks.

621
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,803
Pull tricks?

622
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,804
Me?

623
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,479
Your lackey that came
to see you a while ago.

624
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,524
You know he's the one
who killed Detective Shin's fiancée?

625
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,196
It seems that he ran away to China
but recently came back.

626
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,451
And he's been here.

627
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,500
Are you sure you're not up to something?

628
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,253
What are they planning?

629
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,880
I don't know.

630
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,634
I just have a bad feeling about it.

631
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,302
Your feelings are usually straight on.

632
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,763
And you've been having
weird dreams lately.

633
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:07,099
But I don't know if the dreams
have anything to do with Lee Dong-min.

634
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,770
So many weird things
have been happening lately.

635
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,023
Detective Shin.

636
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,401
I'm telling you this now

637
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,861
to warn you to be careful.

638
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,656
From the start, Lee Dong-min has been

639
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,866
after you, Detective Shin.

640
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,204
I should find the ones from China first.

641
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:30,915
I'll call you.

642
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,422
Should I not have told him?

643
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:46,514
CLOSED TODAY

644
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,059
Captain Kang?

645
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,895
Are you in here?

646
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,068
Didn't you see the sign outside?

647
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,072
I didn't come because I needed something.

648
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,032
I came to apologize.

649
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,701
Just leave if you're going
to spout nonsense.

650
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,327
I mean it.

651
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,495
About yesterday…

652
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,833
I came to ask you for your help,
not complain.

653
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,421
I gave up the hope
of ever hearing news of my kids

654
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,008
but I must have gone crazy
when I heard about Il-yong.

655
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,010
I think I lost it for a minute there.

656
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,765
The fact that I stole the pooled fund…

657
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,144
You've kept my secret all along.

658
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,022
I'm going to tell everyone now.

659
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,982
Do that!

660
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,234
Just go tell everyone! I deserve it.

661
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,864
Thank you.

662
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,575
And I'm sorry.

663
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,122
Okay.

664
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,749
You should go.

665
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,167
Take this with you.

666
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,588
Thank you.

667
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,590
They say to kill your enemy with kindness.

668
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,681
Did you forget something?

669
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,269
Hye-ju.

670
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,444
Why didn't you say anything?

671
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,447
Are you here to talk about Il-yong too?

672
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,282
I can't believe

673
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,702
the things you did for us.

674
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,331
What do you mean?

675
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,881
I heard that something awful
happened in the store this afternoon.

676
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:44,840
Actually…

677
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,678
even though she knew we could go outside,

678
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,098
Captain Kang never once

679
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,892
asked us to do anything for herself.

680
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,978
Instead, she asked me
to do things for the villagers.

681
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,315
"Hye-ju's father is 70,
so go see how he's doing."

682
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,693
"Go see if Lady Buan's eldest son
went to college."

683
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,656
"See if Mr. Choi's family
got compensation and moved."

684
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:13,077
Captain Kang personally asked me
to do those, so I went and checked.

685
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,287
Think about it, everyone.

686
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,915
You heard it all from Captain Kang.

687
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,753
Here you go.

688
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,008
I thought if other people found out,

689
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,010
they'd bother Il-yong

690
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,555
and make trouble,
so I kept it from you all.

691
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,850
But it seems that whether alive or dead,

692
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,643
there is no secret.

693
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,969
CERTIFICATE OF FAMILY RELATIONS
NAME: JUNG YOUNG-JIN

694
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,680
VISITATION RECORD
PRISONER: LEE DONG-MIN

695
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,320
Sir, I'm going to send you a photo

696
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,114
so could you check
the security footage at the arrival hall?

697
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,866
Yes, thank you.

698
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,542
His name is Jang Do-ri.

699
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,460
Jang Do-ri?

700
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,295
What a weird name.

701
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,672
Since it's a fake passport,
the name must be too.

702
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,633
He arrived via Haecheon Port a month ago.

703
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,385
I probably saw him
at the prison around that time.

704
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,929
He deposited money for Lee Dong-min,

705
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,722
so I got suspicious and followed him.

706
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,849
He went in there.

707
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:01,977
Let's go.

708
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,773
When I saw him here the second time…

709
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,947
You're saying that Jang Do-ri and Goliath
were in this room together?

710
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,864
Yes.

711
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,576
Jang Do-ri ordered Kim Pil-jung
to go off the grid.

712
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,245
What I want to know…

713
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,412
He…

714
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,790
did that?

715
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,376
…is who "he" is.

716
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,586
There's someone else.

717
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,009
The head of Goliath's gang isn't Goliath?

718
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,596
The reason why Jang Do-ri came back
to Korea was because "he" called him.

719
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,183
MR. STEVE

720
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,498
You think that's Lee Dong-min?

721
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,794
He mentioned something
about the big picture in his letters.

722
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,631
I think he could be testing me.

723
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,676
Even for Lee Dong-min,
it can't be easy to run a drug cartel

724
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,096
and bring over killers from China
when he's in prison.

725
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,558
There must be someone else helping him.

726
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,936
We have to find out what they're up to.

727
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,816
At my nine. Do you see them?

728
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,776
Yes, they've been there since we went in.

729
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,084
A GPS?

730
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:31,752
Yes.

731
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,545
See if it's working.

732
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,344
It's moving towards
Mahyeon-dong Intersection.

733
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,305
-Whose car is it?
-I'll explain later.

734
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,765
Thanks.

735
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,769
What the…

736
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,021
Just who are you tracking?

737
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,403
Should we keep going?

738
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,071
No.

739
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,490
He saw us too,
so let's stop here for today.

740
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,950
Move out.

741
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,962
I don't have to go, so cancel it.

742
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,046
Okay?

743
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,048
I'm hanging up.

744
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,009
Bo-ra.

745
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,305
It's you today.

746
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,182
Yes, Wook's a bit busy today.

747
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,642
Let's go.

748
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,527
What is it?

749
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,903
Is there something wrong?

750
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,365
My mom wants me to go
to an English camp on Jeju Island.

751
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,242
An English camp?

752
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,743
Yes.

753
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,913
I told her that my friends
were going to English camps overseas.

754
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,459
So she wants to send me
to Jeju Island at least.

755
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,795
That's why we were behind on our rent.

756
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,548
Are you going?

757
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,218
Of course not,
I told her to get a refund right away.

758
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,555
She did it so you won't feel
discouraged by your friends.

759
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,016
I won't be discouraged by this.

760
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,768
It's not cheap.
It costs more than a million won.

761
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,522
It's because she does something
like this that I can never rest easy.

762
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,359
You're such an old soul.
Who did you get that from?

763
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,115
My mom's a bit childish,
so it's not from my mom.

764
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,534
I don't think it's from my dad either.

765
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,372
You're the smartest
and the most responsible person around me.

766
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,333
Me?

767
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,419
I guess I am.

768
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,179
Forget that I called you an old soul.

769
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,723
The way I see it,

770
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,934
you're just

771
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,561
a kind and considerate middle schooler.

772
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,825
I thought you left
because I couldn't see you.

773
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,994
I've been busy,

774
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,579
going here and there.

775
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,748
Is my baby

776
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,500
doing well?

777
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,210
Of course.

778
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,670
She is eating well

779
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,171
and doing great.

780
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,215
She's the most popular kid in the village.

781
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,676
You know…

782
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,054
She loves reading

783
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,306
and music.

784
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,739
You don't have to worry
about Alice anymore.

785
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,832
Thank you.

786
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,050
I'll come again.

787
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:45,130
Wook and Il-yong
won't be around for a while.

788
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,174
They have to visit tons of places.

789
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:01,188
Anyway, the kids would be
happy to be back in school.

790
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,856
Since that guy is gone now,

791
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,734
I'm pretty sure the kids are happy
that it's safe again.

792
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,152
Right.

793
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,784
I think

794
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,328
they'll be really happy
if we take them camping.

795
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,915
It seems like you'll be
more excited than the kids.

796
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,670
"The pleasant spring breeze

797
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,880
is blowing again today."

798
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,592
Read it again, please.

799
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,677
Again?

800
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,763
But we read this book twice already.

801
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,181
One more time.

802
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,519
Okay.

803
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,105
I want to pee.

804
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,773
You want to pee, Alice?

805
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,442
I'll take you to the restroom.

806
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,736
I'll read it to you again
when you come back.

807
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,702
My goodness…

808
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,537
Shall we rest for a while now?

809
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,538
-Yes.
-Yes.

810
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,623
That book was fun, wasn't it?

811
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,791
Yes.

812
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,501
No, go away!

813
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,503
Go away. No!

814
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,713
-What--
-No!

815
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,673
-What's wrong?
-I said no!

816
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,299
Go away!

817
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,342
-No!
-Ha-yun!

818
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,385
I said no!

819
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,386
What's wrong?

820
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,097
-No! Go away!
-Ha-yun, what's wrong?

821
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,640
What's wrong?

822
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,935
-He's scary.
-What?

823
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,522
What's wrong?

824
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:26,940
I don't know.

825
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,483
I just said hi and she just…

826
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,361
Lee Yeong-rim, watch out!

827
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,197
Yeong-rim, come here.

828
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,700
Ha-yun, what's the matter with you?

829
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:38,744
You idiot.

830
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,495
He's just like that woman.

831
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,497
"That woman"?

832
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,709
I don't look like a woman, do I?

833
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,633
He's not.

834
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,510
What woman are you talking about?

835
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,680
-I'm scared.
-I know. It's okay.

836
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,726
Go on for now.

837
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,479
Go on.

838
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,981
Ha-yun, it's okay.

839
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:11,151
He's gone now.

840
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,403
Yes, he's gone. Don't look.

841
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,905
You're okay.

842
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,324
This is confusing.

843
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,744
That banana milk woman is the culprit.

844
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,914
But Detective Goh looks like that woman?

845
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,916
But that doesn't make sense.

846
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,001
I saw her every day for the field day,

847
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:30,253
and she was with me
the whole time that day.

848
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,880
But she was just fine then.

849
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,301
Maybe seeing Yeong-rim
drink the banana milk

850
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,136
brought back bad memories.

851
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,138
Her trauma?

852
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,265
Yes, scary memories.

853
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,852
There must be something in common.

854
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,604
The face?

855
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,066
Maybe the hairstyle?

856
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,027
Wait a minute.

857
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,531
This is from
the Blue Hope Foundation, right?

858
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,282
I used to donate there.

859
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,451
It looks like you did too.

860
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,577
Nice to know that.

861
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,288
I did some volunteer work there
when I was in college.

862
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,249
And you still wear that?

863
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,042
What's wrong with it?

864
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,210
It's nothing but cute.

865
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,884
Maybe…

866
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,303
what Ha-yun saw was…

867
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,068
Art therapy for Ha-yun?

868
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:36,111
Yes.

869
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,280
I think it has to do with the T-shirt

870
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,949
that Detective Goh was wearing
as well as the banana milk.

871
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,953
Okay, I'll try.

872
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,162
But…

873
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,373
It may take some time.

874
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,501
Ha-yun must reveal
what is buried in her heart herself.

875
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,712
She also recently
went through a hard time.

876
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,214
Of course, you're right.

877
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,259
When you think Ha-yun is ready,

878
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,344
let's proceed step-by-step then.

879
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,473
Hello.

880
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,601
Is Ms. Kim Jin-ah here?

881
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,478
Did she use to live here before?

882
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,897
I don't know much.

883
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,607
Did she move away?

884
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,692
I wouldn't know.

885
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:16,776
Then…

886
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,778
could you tell me where she went?

887
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,495
I'm a bit thirsty.

888
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,706
-Really?
-Yes.

889
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,333
I'll get you something to drink.

890
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,724
Hey, son.

891
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,644
Yes, we ate.

892
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,145
All right.

893
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,648
Okay.

894
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,074
HONOR AWARD
GOH SANG-CHEOL

895
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,285
The eldest is coming
this weekend with the kids.

896
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,665
Goodness…

897
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,209
Sang-cheol hasn't called in a while.

898
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,419
Why don't you give him a call?

899
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,797
He said he was busy catching criminals.

900
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,675
He said he'd visit
after this investigation wraps up.

901
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,259
So let's wait and see.

902
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,137
I'm afraid he might get hurt
catching bad people.

903
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,472
Don't be.

904
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,307
Just focus on this.

905
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,614
I would like to ask you
to never go to my home.

906
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,951
I have my own reasons for that.

907
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,286
It has to do with his pension
that his wife gets.

908
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,542
JUNG JI-HOON

909
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,085
Not Jung Young-jin,

910
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,254
but Jung Ji-hoon?

911
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,592
Didn't he say his son lives in the US?

912
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,519
I think it was around here.

913
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:17,022
It's hard to find.

914
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,025
Where…

915
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,333
Are you okay?

916
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,251
Yes.

917
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:41,880
Wait…

918
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,235
Who is she?

919
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,654
If she's someone I met before,

920
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,656
I would remember.

921
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:18,291
Maybe you have a family member
you don't know about.

922
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,209
No way.

923
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:20,919
That can't be.

924
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,099
Wook, get him! It's Pil-jung!

925
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,736
Hey!

926
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,862
Stop right there!

927
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,323
Hey!

928
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,463
You punk.

929
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,381
Get out.

930
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,340
Come out.

931
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,093
Hey, come out!

932
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,010
Come on out.

933
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,681
Hey! Open this now!

934
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,849
Hey!

935
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,189
Hey! Stop right there!

936
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,973
She's a bad woman.

937
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,017
Can we find her with just a T-shirt?

938
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,396
I'm looking for someone
among your long-time sponsors.

939
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:29,816
They were watching us
so we should do the same.

940
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,359
You said his name was Oh Il-yong?

941
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,735
I'm still looking for him.

942
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,903
What do I do now?

943
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,280
What should I do?

944
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,156
We must find the place
where she hid the bodies.

945
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,576
You can still go outside

946
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,786
and Wook will help you in any way he can.

947
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,371
You stay strong.

948
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,998
I'm going to find you no matter what.

949
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,125
You know me, don't you?

950
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:52,046
