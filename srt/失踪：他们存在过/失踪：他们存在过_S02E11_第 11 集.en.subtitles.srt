1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,887
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,972
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED IN
AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,349
A WEEK BEFORE THE OPERATION

4
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,269
A woman in her eighties
living in a slum alone

5
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,189
was found dead
three weeks after her death.

6
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:08,234
The woman was living on a basic livelihood
provided by the government,

7
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,071
subject to the one-person
household monitoring program.

8
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:15,366
However, after a public officer
checked on her three weeks ago,

9
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,036
she passed away alone unnoticed.

10
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:18,953
The government…

11
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,371
-That old lady--
-My goodness!

12
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,165
…promised active support,

13
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,543
and the local government will be
preparing preventive measures…

14
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,922
Kim Geon-ju also visited
that lady two years ago.

15
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,423
Don't you think it's strange?

16
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,219
Jong-a, I have a weak heart.

17
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,471
Don't shock me like that.

18
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,641
Why are you such a chicken?
You even see ghosts.

19
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,518
…the woman had suffered
from chronic disease…

20
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,894
Dad, you can see ghosts?

21
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,316
They're just joking around.

22
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,860
I need to go see Detective Shin.

23
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,446
And I need to check
the security camera footage

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,658
for evidence that Kim Geon-ju
visited that neighborhood.

25
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,785
I need to go see Director Choi.

26
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,286
What's going on?

27
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,665
Bo-ra, you should go out
for a meal with your mom.

28
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,129
Go enjoy your food.

29
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,797
I'll pick you up later.

30
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,967
What's going on?

31
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,969
Why is everyone leaving all of a sudden?

32
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,515
We can't do an autopsy.

33
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,516
That old woman

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,017
has been cremated already.

35
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,770
What if Kim Geon-ju is seen
on the security cameras there?

36
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,689
That's hardly evidence.

37
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,400
Finding the kids' bodies would be faster.

38
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,320
Kim Geon-ju has been living
in the same house for 30 years.

39
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,198
We may find something
if we search her house.

40
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,118
But they won't issue a search warrant
just based on suspicions.

41
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,288
I'll be counting on you.

42
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,249
Okay.

43
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,835
You'll have to explain later
what this is about.

44
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,128
Of course.

45
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,547
Goodbye.

46
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,300
What should I look for?

47
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,969
Suspicious drugs
or places where she might hide bodies.

48
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,470
And anything else suspicious.

49
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,681
I've never been
inside someone's house before.

50
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,602
This isn't an invasion of privacy
but just looking for Yeong-rim and Ha-yun.

51
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,147
Of course you should do it.

52
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,233
Thanks, I'm glad you have my back.

53
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,153
I'll take care of things here.

54
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,405
Go find Yeong-rim and Ha-yun.

55
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,407
They've been here too long.

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,118
Just them?

57
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,495
Everyone has been here too long.

58
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,125
THE DAY OF THE OPERATION

59
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,007
If you're ever in any danger,

60
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,550
talk about the weather.

61
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,302
Then we'll move in.

62
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,095
-Okay.
-Are you okay with this?

63
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,723
-What?
-Can you hear me?

64
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,391
I can hear you.

65
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,518
No.

66
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,686
I'll go in.

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,772
I'll tell her that I came on your behalf.

68
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,940
Forget it.

69
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,817
If you show up when she's expecting me,

70
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,154
we don't know what she'll do.

71
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,072
Ms. Lee.

72
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,823
You know I'm a good actor.

73
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,533
I'm a professional, remember?

74
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,285
Don't worry.

75
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,580
Still, be careful.

76
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:08,998
Be careful.

77
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,418
Maybe I can't hear some things.

78
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,544
We didn't say anything.

79
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,046
What?

80
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,816
Hello.

81
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,234
Welcome.

82
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,027
I heard from Director Choi.

83
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,988
It's nice to finally meet you.

84
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,864
My name is Jang Pan-seok.

85
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,700
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

86
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,204
He's going in.

87
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
Mr. Jang.

88
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,541
Can you hear me?

89
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,713
I haven't seen these clay pots in a while.

90
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,673
I make pastes and sauces every year

91
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,300
and share them.

92
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,218
I donate some to the welfare center too.

93
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,181
Do you farm too?

94
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,102
Nothing so fancy.
I just grow enough for myself.

95
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,813
I'd rather not do anything
when I'm at home.

96
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,148
You're so diligent.

97
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,817
Now that I'm old, I don't sleep much
and all I have is time.

98
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,860
Come on in.

99
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,528
You're right.

100
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,447
People do sleep less when they grow old.

101
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,823
Same for me.

102
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,576
Come inside.

103
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,493
Okay.

104
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,645
It's magnolia berry tea.

105
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,522
I picked and dried them myself.

106
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,983
This is a precious one.

107
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,360
Smells nice, doesn't it?

108
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,030
Yes. Excuse me.

109
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,784
Mr. Jang, I think you should
drink something else.

110
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,455
This is nice but…

111
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,999
Would you like something else?

112
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,250
Yes.

113
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,004
I'm allergic to magnolia berry tea.

114
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,591
You have instant coffee.

115
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,177
I'll make it myself.

116
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,220
Stay seated.

117
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,184
Let's see.

118
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,186
This is my favorite kind.

119
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,648
May I use some water?

120
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,565
-Yes.
-Thank you.

121
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,171
This is nice.

122
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,049
I'm sorry, you've prepared so much.

123
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,179
But I really love this.

124
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,726
There's something you wanted to ask me?

125
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,146
Yes.

126
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:24,986
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,197
Well…

128
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,702
Do you remember Ha-yun and Yeong-rim?

129
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,245
Yes.

130
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,915
Who?

131
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,127
Before, you…

132
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,130
Well…

133
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,756
You…

134
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,302
At the playground…

135
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,513
Banana milk…

136
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,445
The playground

137
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,780
and banana milk?

138
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,588
I remember them.

139
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,132
The kids I met at the playground.

140
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,261
I already sent them to a better place.

141
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,430
Mr. Jang.

142
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,017
Put down all your painful memories,

143
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,978
and rest in peace now.

144
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,197
I need to wait a bit more
for it to turn dark.

145
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,539
Mr. Jang.

146
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,374
Is the weather not good?

147
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,500
Mr. Jang!

148
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,629
Jong-a, call the cops.

149
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,547
Okay.

150
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,176
Goodness, why are there
so many books in here?

151
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,638
The other room is filled with books too.

152
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,847
Yes.

153
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,350
So where are the children's books?

154
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,268
Here.

155
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,730
You wrote all these books?

156
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,065
Yes.

157
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,985
Reading books and studying are what I do.

158
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571
But why did you want
children's books all of a sudden?

159
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,281
Are you planning another recital?

160
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,198
Yes.

161
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,659
I'm planning to hold
another kids' recital.

162
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,956
When Ha-yun first came here,
she could barely read and write.

163
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,375
Yeong-rim couldn't even write
his own name.

164
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,127
They're so fluent now.

165
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,629
They've learned so much.

166
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,260
These days, Alice also
tries to read things aloud.

167
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,513
She's been copying older kids,
so I want to do this again.

168
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,018
I saw Ha-yun teaching her
when we went camping.

169
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,353
Yeong-rim was meddling from the side.

170
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,231
They both take good care of younger kids.

171
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,652
One's smart, and the other is kind.

172
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,156
Had they been alive,

173
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,658
they would have grown up
to be such fine young people.

174
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,039
-Now, let's see.
-I like this too.

175
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,673
This one has a stain.

176
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,842
It looks like blood.

177
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,932
It must have been stained
from something before.

178
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,852
Here. This is for you, Captain Kang.

179
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,187
What is it?

180
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,481
You asked me before

181
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,025
where I get such nice sayings.

182
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,943
They're all in here.

183
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,028
It's a gift.

184
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,530
All in here?

185
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:01,077
I love getting books as presents.

186
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,496
Strangely enough,
just holding it feels good for me.

187
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,331
It'll feel even better if you read it.

188
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,375
-It makes me sleepy.
-Come on.

189
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,671
Mr. Jang.

190
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,630
Mr. Jang!

191
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,090
Wake up, please!

192
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,135
Mr. Jang.

193
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,429
Wake up. Come on!

194
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,681
Wake up, Mr. Jang.

195
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,474
Mr. Jang.

196
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,392
Come on.

197
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,228
Mr. Jang, are you in there?

198
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,146
Mr. Jang!

199
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,440
Mr. Jang.

200
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,566
Mr. Jang!

201
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,109
-What happened?
-I don't know.

202
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,611
-Mr. Jang!
-Mr. Jang!

203
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,780
Wake up, please.

204
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,575
Why did you drink that
when you didn't have to?

205
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,826
-Call an ambulance.
-I'll do it.

206
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,910
Get an ambulance here.

207
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,414
Mr. Jang…

208
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,416
Are you okay, Mr. Jang?

209
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,375
Mr. Jang!

210
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,795
There will be drugs in the mini-fridge.

211
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,921
The mini-fridge?

212
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,425
Mr. Jang…

213
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,096
Come on.

214
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,558
Jong-a, get me a bowl with water.

215
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,019
-Get me some water.
-Water!

216
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,562
Wake up, Mr. Jang.

217
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,194
What's this?

218
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,452
Be careful.

219
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,661
Mr. Jang.

220
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,288
He's breathing, right?

221
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,707
What do we do? Mr. Jang…

222
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,711
Move out right away.

223
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,344
What…

224
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,764
Where am I?

225
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,681
Mr. Jang.

226
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,600
Are you okay?

227
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,477
Are you okay, Mr. Jang?

228
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,021
Yes, of course.

229
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,023
What happened with Kim Geon-ju?

230
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,902
I thought my heart would stop.

231
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,322
How could you just
walk in there to catch a criminal?

232
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,783
What if something bad had happened?

233
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,245
Do you know how scared I was
to see him unconscious?

234
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329
I'm sorry, sir.

235
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,499
I was shocked too.

236
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,585
Why did you have to tell him?

237
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,421
Why did you report it?
I told you to call me.

238
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,756
Hey, Shin Jun-ho.

239
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,467
What were you thinking?
You're a detective.

240
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,220
I was waiting to move in
when I get the report.

241
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,721
It was me.

242
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,351
A serial murder was happening,

243
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,186
but the news was ruling them
as natural deaths.

244
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,188
And the police didn't even have a clue.

245
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,232
So I planned the whole thing

246
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,192
and asked Mr. Jang, Wook,

247
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,403
and Detective Shin for their help.

248
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,823
Yes, this situation was unexpected,

249
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,117
but I'll pay the fine
and take the punishment.

250
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,703
So can we please find
the missing people first?

251
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,872
You said they died of natural causes.

252
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,332
That means they've already been found.

253
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,250
No.

254
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,127
There are many who haven't been found yet.

255
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,962
There are even kids.

256
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,380
I'll take this case, sir.

257
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,595
So…

258
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,347
Who are the missing people?

259
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,476
"Scabs were born to protect new flesh."

260
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,855
"'Leave the safety of new flesh to me!'"

261
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,485
-Ha-yun is next?
-Yes.

262
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,945
-Let's get ready.
-Okay.

263
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,948
-Ha-yun, come here.
-"At that moment,

264
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,201
a terrible itchiness appeared."

265
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,579
"Itchy, itchy."

266
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,956
"It was so itchy."

267
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,042
"They attacked with no mercy."

268
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,335
"'Yeong-rim,

269
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,713
never scratch this
even if it's itchy, okay?'"

270
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,341
Ji-hoon.

271
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,220
Never scratch this
even if it's itchy, okay?

272
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,473
Scabs form

273
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:37,144
to let the wound heal and make new flesh.

274
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,148
"'When it's too itchy,
try blowing on it.'"

275
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:47,029
"Yeong-rim blew on it with his mom."

276
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,867
From now on, call me right away
if there's any danger.

277
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,119
Shin Jun-ho. We'll talk later.

278
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,204
Go on now.

279
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,624
Wook, wait.

280
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,337
We got you in trouble, didn't we?

281
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,047
It's not that.

282
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,215
About…

283
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,508
Kim Pil-jung.

284
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,301
Are you sure he's dead?

285
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,136
Yes.

286
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,347
He arrived in the village in Complex 3.

287
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,724
And I saw him disappear myself.

288
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,436
We're looking for his body, but…

289
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,356
Goliath showed up again on the dark web.

290
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,191
What?

291
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,444
It must be a fake.

292
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,197
I'll look into it and call you.

293
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,451
No way.

294
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,912
He couldn't have died
then come back to life again.

295
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,961
What are all these drugs?

296
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,171
What did you use these for?

297
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,549
I didn't know possessing them was illegal.

298
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,009
You used to be a nurse's aide.

299
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,844
How could you not know that?

300
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,721
I've been ignorant.

301
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,266
I'm willing to take the punishment.

302
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,271
You know who they are, right?

303
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,108
They're the elderly people I visited.

304
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,068
They're all dead.

305
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,196
When I visited them, they were alive.

306
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,877
Where are these kids?

307
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,673
Why are you asking me that?

308
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,842
At the playground 15 years ago,

309
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,304
you gave them banana milk.

310
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,765
What?

311
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,018
Have you forgotten
because it's been so long?

312
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:45,981
Detective Shin.

313
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,418
Here, I insisted that there could be
more drugs in that house to get this.

314
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,795
You better find something.

315
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,798
We need proof
to catch the criminal for sure.

316
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,801
Sir.

317
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,805
-Let's go.
-What?

318
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,432
-What's wrong?
-Why should I go?

319
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,768
Who else should go but you?

320
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,186
There are other officers.

321
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,729
They're all busy, so let's go.

322
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,606
Hey. The guys--

323
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,650
Lately, you've been lacking spirit.

324
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,568
-Where are they?
-I'm a bit disappointed.

325
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,280
Now, the next reciter is…

326
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,658
Choi Ha-yun.

327
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,659
A round of applause!

328
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:43,539
COMPLEX 3 RECITAL

329
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,624
Ha-yun is going to read us,

330
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,626
The Dancing Cherry Blossoms.

331
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,003
Shall we hear what the story is about?

332
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,713
-Yes!
-Yes!

333
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,231
There's nothing in the room.

334
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,280
I don't think
there's anything in the house.

335
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,866
I'll go check out the backyard.

336
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,035
"'Guys, wake up now.'"

337
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,453
"'The day is finally here,'

338
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,208
shouted the big cherry blossom
on top of the tree."

339
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,086
"Today is the day."

340
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,464
"Today is the day the cherry blossoms

341
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,925
go out into the world
to find happy stories."

342
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,388
"It is time when the gentle spring wind
begins to blow."

343
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,558
"It's time to leave the tree."

344
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,104
"'I'll be going first. Goodbye.'"

345
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,151
"The big blossom flew off in the wind

346
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,069
as the sun shined down upon it."

347
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:01,533
"Then it landed softly on a child's head."

348
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,786
"'Do you want Dad
to get you an ice cream?'"

349
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,124
"The cherry blossom
smiled together with the child."

350
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,930
-Enjoy your food.
-Thank you.

351
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,514
You were so good today, Ha-yun.

352
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,267
It was a very moving recital.

353
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,317
What's wrong?

354
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,318
Are you hurt?

355
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,695
I think I worked too hard today.

356
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,240
You should get some rest. We'll clean up.

357
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,368
Yes.

358
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,667
Hey, push in deeper.

359
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,918
Did you check those clay pots?

360
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,545
-There's nothing notable.
-Don't just open it.

361
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,256
Check the inside with a stick.

362
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,173
Yes, sir.

363
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,300
-Lift that basin.
-Yes, sir.

364
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,845
What was in the greenhouse?

365
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,599
Nothing else besides
cabbages and dried greens.

366
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,268
All right.

367
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,645
Go in.

368
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,984
Poke every corner.

369
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,568
-Yes, sir.
-Go look around inside.

370
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,486
Yes, sir.

371
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,416
What is it?

372
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,961
This smells fishy.

373
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,134
The lock is unusually big
for a place like this.

374
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,564
My sweeties.

375
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,482
Goodbye.

376
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,319
-Bye.
-Bye, Captain Kang.

377
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,908
I'll take you home, kids.

378
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,201
-Okay.
-Let's go.

379
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,119
Let's go.

380
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,662
Goodbye.

381
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,121
Sir.

382
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,334
Let's plow up the place.

383
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,294
Goodness…

384
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,006
Ha-yun, why do you like
that cherry blossom book so much?

385
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,592
Because petals can travel anywhere.

386
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,719
They can go far in the wind.

387
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,722
I think the scab book is funny.

388
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,516
It looks just like a booger.

389
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,561
Mr. Jang.

390
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,771
Yes?

391
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,942
When are you going to take us?

392
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,320
We've had the field day,

393
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,989
the camping, and the recital.

394
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,827
What are you talking about?

395
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,620
Hyeon-ji told me

396
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:37,040
that when she meets you
she'll tell you to take us too.

397
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,293
Did she?

398
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,213
He's right here.

399
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,464
How could he take us?

400
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,758
Wait.

401
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,596
Here.

402
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,936
What are they?

403
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,273
I took this one with Hyeon-ji.

404
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,734
But after Hyeon-ji left,
she left from the picture too.

405
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,996
And this?

406
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,790
That's you.

407
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,628
You look good, right?

408
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,963
-It looks great.
-Right?

409
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,047
So pretty.

410
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,007
Take one of me too.

411
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,383
-Hold this.
-Okay.

412
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,342
How do I do this?

413
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,552
-Look in here.
-Okay.

414
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,512
-Then press this.
-Okay.

415
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,390
One, two, three.

416
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,352
Did it come out well?

417
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,565
-One more time.
-One more?

418
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,025
-Hold this too.
-Okay.

419
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,995
-Here.
-Okay.

420
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,288
Here, Uncle Il-yong.

421
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,624
I look good.

422
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,125
-You look good.
-Right?

423
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,252
You're a good photographer, Ha-yun.

424
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,928
This is you.

425
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,514
He's here,

426
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,808
but he's gone from the picture.

427
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,436
Stupid. That's not it.

428
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,816
You're just visiting, aren't you?

429
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,485
To take people.

430
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,155
It's all right.

431
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,990
I didn't tell anyone.

432
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,579
There's no fooling you.

433
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,748
You're right.

434
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,166
I came to keep a promise.

435
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,420
I promised Hyeon-ji
that I'd find her friends too.

436
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,380
Really?

437
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,841
Can we go ride on the swings?

438
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,261
I feel so good that I want to fly.

439
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,887
Me too.

440
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,515
Okay. Let's go ride the swings.

441
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,894
My goodness, slow down!

442
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,481
Kids, slow down.

443
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,949
Hey.

444
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,951
Where did you get that outfit?

445
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,578
Did you wear that when you were alive?

446
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,955
No.

447
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,207
Captain Kang found them
in the room of memories.

448
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,086
They were a bit old, so I mended them.

449
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,754
How do I look?

450
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,506
They look good on you.

451
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,344
Hey.

452
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,513
It's good to see you smile.

453
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,807
I'm just pretending to be okay.

454
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,976
I'm still angry, but…

455
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,484
You're still going to find my body for me.

456
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,904
I'm going to

457
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,990
find you no matter what.

458
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,622
Captain Kang looked like
her leg was hurting.

459
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,624
I hope she's well soon.

460
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,877
Don't wounds heal fast here?

461
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,712
Yes.

462
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,757
But when the anniversary
of her death comes around,

463
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,008
her leg hurts.

464
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,635
-The day she died?
-Yes.

465
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,847
She becomes fine again the next day.

466
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,102
She keeps her husband and son's
anniversary of death here.

467
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,730
But no one is left

468
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,441
to keep the anniversary of her death.

469
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,526
She has no family left alive.

470
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,114
But a sailor that used to work with her
holds a memorial service every year.

471
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,576
He even keeps Captain Kang's husband

472
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,702
and son's anniversary.

473
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,330
Is that so?

474
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,012
There's more here!

475
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,605
Hey!

476
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,857
Contact the NFS.

477
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,574
I'm an airplane in the sky!

478
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,910
I'm a petal that flies with the wind!

479
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,788
Hold on tight so you won't fall.

480
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,415
Okay, I will!

481
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,046
Ha-yun, why do you like
that cherry blossom book so much?

482
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,050
Because petals can travel anywhere.

483
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,887
They can go far in the wind.

484
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,643
I think the scab book is funny.

485
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,563
It looks just like a booger.

486
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,890
If it weren't for me,

487
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,811
they'd still be suffering.

488
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:56,813
I…

489
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,107
saved…

490
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,735
those people.

491
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,370
A serial killer

492
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,040
who has killed dozens of people
over 23 years has been caught.

493
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,376
The suspect, Kim Geon-ju,
a woman in her fifties,

494
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:22,589
was found to have been killing
children and the elderly.

495
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:27,385
CHOI HA-YUN…
LEE YEONG-RIM, WENT MISSING IN 2007…

496
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,453
Yeong-rim, Ha-yun.

497
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,163
Goodbye.

498
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,373
Go see Hyeon-ji.

499
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,792
Have fun together.

500
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,297
When you see Hyeon-ji,

501
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,507
tell her that Mr. Jang is doing okay.

502
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,302
Tell Hyeon-ji

503
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,931
not to worry about her dad.

504
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,934
Mr. Jang has us.

505
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,061
And Hyeon-ji…

506
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,482
has good friends.

507
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,152
Don't worry.

508
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,780
I know…

509
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,283
I'm not worried…

510
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,955
Goodbye…

511
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,886
Hyeon-ji kept her promise.

512
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,641
She said her dad will come to get her,

513
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,937
and that he'll find
all of her friends too.

514
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,817
She bragged to all of the villagers.

515
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,404
And Mr. Jang really did come…

516
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,738
DAY 10,911…

517
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,700
…and even found Yeong-rim and Ha-yun.

518
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,245
-Captain Kang.
-Yes?

519
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,287
Are you in there?

520
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,205
Coming!

521
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,311
For 30 years since I arrived here,

522
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,024
I felt like I'd been trapped.

523
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,735
But when Il-yong came three years ago,

524
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,447
I got to hear news from the outside
when I needed it.

525
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,532
And now,

526
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,660
starting with Eun-hee,

527
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,287
and even Ha-yun and Yeong-rim…

528
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,831
They were all found and they moved on.

529
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,876
It's a good thing

530
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,628
that the kids moved on.

531
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,255
Yes.

532
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,760
I can really feel the changes these days.

533
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,305
The world has changed a lot,
even this place.

534
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,894
Yes,

535
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,772
which is why I'm scared.

536
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,524
Why?

537
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,319
Because Wook may find you

538
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,863
and your wife won't get the pension?

539
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,494
What is the matter with you today?

540
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,162
You're acting strange.

541
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,915
And that blood on that book was also--

542
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,000
I told you, it's not!

543
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,049
I'm sorry.

544
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,885
It's not you.

545
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,846
I'm just angry at myself.

546
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,686
I don't know what's going on,

547
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,856
but you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

548
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,943
They say you take
some secrets to your grave.

549
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,194
And we're not

550
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,822
even in our graves yet.

551
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,075
The truth is…

552
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,412
my son…

553
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,834
is not in the US.

554
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,188
SOLGI FISHERY

555
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,964
Good morning, sir.

556
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,766
You're all good,
but your clothes make you look…

557
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,645
like a gangster.

558
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,230
I'm sorry, sir.

559
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,357
And the stuff?

560
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,942
I took care of it with no trouble.

561
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,568
Trust is everything in business.

562
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,529
Customers go crazy
if you make false offers.

563
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,615
And our customers
are especially sensitive.

564
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,493
And the delivery?

565
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,622
All 20 are people I know,
and I'll be overseeing them myself.

566
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,123
No need to worry, sir.

567
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,876
And Oh Il-yong, the guy you mentioned,

568
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,419
I'm looking for him myself.

569
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,505
Okay, I'll leave it up to you.

570
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,883
What happened two days ago
must not happen again.

571
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,638
Do you know how much
the stuff that the cops seized was worth?

572
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,684
Thirty billion won in market price.

573
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,522
I get so angry
whenever I think about that.

574
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,278
I'm counting on you!

575
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,405
Goodbye, sir.

576
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,623
Is this the person you were looking for?

577
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,208
Yes.

578
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,376
Hey, Team Leader Lee.

579
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,752
Hello, Doctor.

580
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,170
You're here.

581
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,047
Yes.

582
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,681
The car rolled down deep into the woods.

583
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,725
Hikers found the car and reported it.

584
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:35,146
But there was no ID and no fingerprints
because they burned off his fingers.

585
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,356
It also took time
because the car was a rental.

586
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,402
There were also drugs in the car.

587
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,279
A lethal amount
was also found inside his body.

588
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,448
What?

589
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,992
You mean Goliath did drugs?

590
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,702
According to the test results, yes.

591
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,789
He never even allowed
his lackeys to do drugs.

592
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,833
The drugs are just a cover.

593
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,626
I'm sure he was murdered.

594
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,586
Right.

595
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,381
How did you find out about this?

596
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,386
When I was searching for Detective Goh,
I made some calls.

597
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,433
I asked them to call me
if an unidentified male body showed up.

598
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,185
I see.

599
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,065
If Goliath showed up
on the dark web again,

600
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,068
then I guess Kim Pil-jung
was no longer useful.

601
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,153
It's not like we didn't expect it.

602
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,781
Any idea who's behind it all?

603
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,452
It's still under investigation.

604
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,872
But why are you so fixated on Goliath?

605
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,749
You found Mun Se-yeong

606
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,210
and even Sang-cheol.

607
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,336
So you should stop here.

608
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,715
I wanted to see if it's connected
to other missing cases.

609
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,134
We have to be open to all possibilities.

610
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,345
They're not your average criminals.

611
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:55,267
WE WILL REHABILITATE WITH LOVE
SEONGJU PRISON

612
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,567
I'm sorry.

613
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,155
Thank you.

614
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,877
My goodness…

615
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,546
-Goodbye.
-Sorry about that.

616
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,630
-No problem.
-Thank you.

617
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,469
How long are you
just going to think about it?

618
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,847
How many rejections does that make?

619
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,642
The last house was great,
except it didn't have window guards.

620
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,437
The second one had a small bathroom.

621
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,646
Right.

622
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,857
I wanted to point that out too,
but I bit my tongue.

623
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,320
Did you two plan this?

624
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:49,738
-No.
-What plan?

625
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,619
I'm hungry. Let's just go eat something.

626
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,790
I've been hungry since way before.

627
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,212
That place was all good but…

628
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,715
I sell drugs?

629
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,133
In here?

630
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,968
What? Feeling guilty?

631
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,971
You killed someone
with drugs two years ago.

632
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,682
I don't think it's impossible.

633
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,975
You have a lot of money,

634
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,394
and you have your henchmen out there.

635
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,356
I have henchmen?

636
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,026
Your lackey's lackey came to see you.

637
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,157
Detective Shin,

638
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,035
you're a lot like your mother.

639
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,412
Su-yeon was also very suspicious,

640
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,747
which made her attractive.

641
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,513
You forgot why you're in there?

642
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,847
How can I forget?

643
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,226
It's all thanks to you

644
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,102
and Kim Wook.

645
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,020
Yes.

646
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,440
Don't forget that we're watching you.

647
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,153
No matter how much you scheme,
it will all come to nothing.

648
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:15,658
Don't try to do anything.
Just stay quiet and repent.

649
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,207
You useless sociopathic bastard.

650
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,264
Officer.

651
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,809
I'd like to make a phone call.

652
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,448
Who's this?

653
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,578
Yes, sir.

654
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,037
It's me. Go ahead.

655
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,418
So you have decided?

656
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,713
Not at all when it's your request.

657
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,384
I'll take care of it
when the time is right and call you.

658
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,427
All right.

659
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,388
I hope you're well, sir.

660
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,307
I'll see you soon.

661
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,934
Okay.

662
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,169
You said we're going
to go see Captain Kang.

663
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,213
She's in Complex 3, so where are we going?

664
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,759
Today is the anniversary
of Captain Kang's death.

665
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,469
Really?

666
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,220
A sailor who used to work with her

667
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,264
holds a memorial for her every year.

668
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,975
I wanted to see it,
and I have some questions.

669
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,187
I'm more curious about
what goes on in your head.

670
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,440
Why would you attend a memorial
that someone else is holding?

671
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,026
It's a good day to drive and all.

672
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,736
Just the two of us.

673
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,114
Oh, my goodness.

674
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,117
Do you know
how you've been since the kids left?

675
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,119
How was I?

676
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,412
Very depressed and gloomy.

677
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,207
Like a single dad
whose daughter just got married.

678
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,458
Hey!

679
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,129
Why do you always ruin it at the end?

680
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,633
Now you sound like yourself.

681
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,526
You always cry when you come here.

682
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,613
It's been more than 30 years
since she passed away.

683
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,706
I'm going now.

684
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,208
See you down there.

685
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,265
I have to go now, Eun-sil.

686
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,524
They're gone.

687
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,078
LEE HUI-NAM, KANG EUN-SIL

688
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,802
They took care of the grave very well.

689
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,763
It must take a lot of money

690
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,390
to take care of this for so long.

691
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,726
They're good people.

692
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,604
Yes.

693
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,024
I heard they were like family.

694
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,360
That lady was crying a lot.

695
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,655
Some sadness

696
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,575
never goes away.

697
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,417
When the anniversary
of her death comes around,

698
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,752
her leg hurts.

699
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,213
Mr. Jang.

700
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,175
Captain Kang's body

701
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,427
wouldn't be in there, right?

702
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,555
They probably only engraved her name.
She said she drowned out at sea.

703
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,641
It's because her body's not in there

704
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,559
that she's in Complex 3.

705
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:56,563
Right.

706
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,566
Let's go then.

707
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,862
Already? We came all the way here
because of you.

708
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,197
Don't be like that.

709
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,206
Remember when I said

710
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:19,211
that everything seems bland
now that I'm dead?

711
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,798
Well, it wasn't exactly true.

712
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,428
These days,
my life is filled with surprises.

713
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,016
Il-yong's murderer came, then left.

714
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,562
Yeong-rim and Ha-yun,

715
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,398
I'll miss them, but it's a good thing.

716
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,860
But with Professor Jung…

717
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,364
My son, whom I said was in the US…

718
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,033
he's in Korea.

719
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,913
I actually lived alone
after my wife passed away.

720
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,374
I never remarried.

721
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,961
There's no wife who needs my pension.

722
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,255
Until now…

723
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,841
I've been lying to you, Captain Kang.

724
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,177
And everyone else here too.

725
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,723
So you…

726
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,061
didn't kill yourself,

727
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,731
did you?

728
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,822
The blood on the book…

729
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,825
Is that really it?

730
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,581
It's your blood?

731
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,834
I was…

732
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,547
I was arguing with my son, Ji-hoon…

733
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,592
when I

734
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,094
missed my footing.

735
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,514
-You have a lot of money.
-Ji-hoon.

736
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,892
Is it so bad that I want
my inheritance in advance?

737
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,518
-Ji-hoon…
-Come on!

738
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,945
I slipped

739
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,866
and must have hit my head on the bookcase.

740
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,160
When I woke up,

741
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,245
I was here.

742
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,373
Why would you be here if you just slipped?

743
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,708
-You'd be in a hospital or--
-Captain Kang.

744
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,836
Captain Kang, don't get worked up.

745
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,215
It was my mistake

746
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,133
that I fell and hit my head.

747
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,178
Why would you defend him
after what he did?!

748
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,347
I'm sure he was shocked too.

749
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,892
He was probably shocked by what happened

750
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:44,231
and probably didn't know what else to do.

751
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,650
He didn't know what to do.

752
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,279
It's my fault.

753
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,657
All my fault…

754
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,250
Being a parent itself is a sin.

755
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,878
It's a sin to be a parent.

756
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,848
-Captain.
-Hey, sweetie.

757
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,687
What's with the flowers?

758
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,231
It's your birthday.

759
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,443
My birthday?

760
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,949
I didn't want to tell her
it's the day you died.

761
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,410
Since it's the day you came here,

762
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,328
it would be your village birthday.

763
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,872
My goodness…

764
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,124
What a strange celebration.

765
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,878
Thanks, anyway.

766
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:52,132
Alice, we have a gift for her, right?

767
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,430
Then now…

768
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,056
-What are you doing?
-Here.

769
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,938
My gift.

770
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,566
Say, "It's my gift to you."

771
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,067
It's my gift to you.

772
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,070
My goodness…

773
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,490
You guys are my life.

774
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,327
Be healthy and live long.

775
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,079
Here? That's a curse, right?

776
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:26,917
My sweetie.

777
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,339
Officer.

778
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,924
Hello, everyone.

779
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,467
Hello.

780
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,384
Uncle!

781
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,681
I heard you guys went
to Seoul to be with Jong-a.

782
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,809
You look sophisticated.

783
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,228
Jeong-ah's murderer was caught.

784
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,480
So we went to see Jeong-ah's mother

785
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,148
and stopped by the columbarium.

786
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,442
We stopped by on our way
back to Seoul to say hi.

787
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,735
Good to see you.

788
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,322
I don't know about you all,
but Seul-gi should definitely come.

789
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,450
You came here often drunk.

790
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,869
Officer, things were hard for me then.

791
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,664
I told you not to call me "officer."

792
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,624
I'm the chief of this station.

793
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,709
Officer Kim, arrest this girl.

794
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,127
SEARCHING FOR A MISSING CHILD
SEARCHING FOR A MISSING PERSON

795
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,464
She always came here drunk and vomited.

796
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,675
You look sophisticated, indeed.

797
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,929
You plan to investigate these too?

798
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,431
A psychopathic serial killer,

799
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,350
Blue Hope Foundation, pork back-bone stew.

800
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,519
Anything comes to mind?

801
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,229
Lee Geun-hyeong.

802
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,356
What are you scheming this time?

803
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,567
Officer.

804
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,445
They're all kids who used to live nearby.

805
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,446
Yes.

806
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,615
It's been seven years already.

807
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,951
Trying to find them,

808
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:46,371
I searched every nook and cranny.

809
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:50,000
You know the killer they caught
who killed a lot of kids and the elderly?

810
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,336
I wondered if any of the kids were there,

811
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,755
so I even went to Seoul
with their parents.

812
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,215
And?

813
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,136
None of the kids were there.

814
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,976
NAME: JANG HYEON-JEONG…
NAME: SONG SEUNG-HUI…

815
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,688
NAME: KIM SANG-YEON
(18 AT DISAPPEARANCE, 25 AT PRESENT)

816
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,989
What are you doing here, Wook?

817
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,158
Hey.

818
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,375
She must be bored
without Yeong-rim and Ha-yun.

819
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,753
She keeps asking where Ha-yun is.

820
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,213
She asked me that yesterday too.

821
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,050
We have to find her body too.

822
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,719
But she's so young
that it's hard to ask her anything.

823
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:45,472
Wook.

824
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,057
Yes?

825
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,437
I met Alice's mother.

826
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,356
Alice's mom

827
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,275
is dead too.

828
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,361
Is she here?

829
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,155
No, she's in another village.

830
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:06,034
MOMMY RUNS

831
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,537
After Alice arrived,

832
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,748
I saw that place by chance.

833
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,376
When I passed by that place before,
I couldn't see it.

834
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,419
Where is it?

835
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,464
Over there.

836
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:22,717
Where?

837
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,553
At the end of that tree?

838
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,099
I guess you can't see it.

839
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,559
It's so inconsistent.

840
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,521
I wish it was all or nothing.

841
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,273
Why is it that I see some places
but not others?

842
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,986
Do you have the earphones from before?

843
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,028
Why?

844
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:54,916
Yes.

845
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,713
It's really there.

846
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,383
I believe you.

847
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,720
I just can't see it.

848
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,722
So why are you

849
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,558
different from other dead people?

850
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,274
I'd like to know that too.

851
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,029
Why am I different
from the other dead people?

852
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,158
Then…

853
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,703
Let's find out the answer.

854
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,420
Aren't you going home?

855
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,672
I am.

856
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,050
How about a commemorative drink
before we go home?

857
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,886
There's a new
barbecue restaurant that opened.

858
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:48,970
This is a surprise.

859
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,555
Let's take my car.

860
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,348
You'll pay for the chauffeur.

861
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,976
Hold on.

862
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,562
Why does he keep calling me
when I said no interviews?

863
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,605
Hey, Mr. Choi.

864
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,898
I'll bring the car around.

865
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,901
Can't you do that in writing
rather than going on air?

866
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:05,904
Bo-ra.

867
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,092
Do you know me?

868
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,551
Of course I know you.

869
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,472
Who are you?

870
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,599
Me?

871
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,935
Let's just say…

872
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,438
that I'm your dad's friend.

873
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,065
So?

874
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,609
What do you mean?

875
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,994
Go enjoy some snacks with your friends.

876
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,748
No, thank you.

877
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,834
It's okay to take gifts from adults.

878
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,586
Take it.

879
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,640
What?

880
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,309
Not greeting a senior officer?

881
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,232
What's he doing,
not even turning on the engine?

882
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,277
Hey, Detective Shin!

883
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,736
Wait, Detective Shin!

884
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,696
Jun-ho!

885
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,030
Hey, Jun-ho!

886
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,198
What the…

887
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,116
Hello?

888
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,451
Wait.

889
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,535
Over here!

890
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,911
Is anyone here?

891
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,371
A man's been…

892
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,376
Hello, emergency services?

893
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,836
A man's been stabbed.

894
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,297
The Seoul Metropolitan Police building.

895
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,506
Hurry.

896
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,597
She must not be home yet.

897
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,557
Should I go inside?

898
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,270
I thought you don't
go into strangers' homes.

899
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:05,899
Well, this has nothing to do
with the violation of privacy.

900
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,985
Our lives are on the line.

901
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:13,823
Hey.

902
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:18,286
Tell me if you see anything
strange or suspicious.

903
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:21,039
Don't miss out on any detail
that you see in there.

904
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:22,916
All right.

905
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,260
What's wrong?

906
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,346
Just give me a minute.

907
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,490
I can't.

908
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,247
I can't

909
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,082
go inside this house.

910
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:39,117
This is the only house in the neighborhood
with a security system.

911
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,953
Something must be hidden in that house.

912
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,413
Do you know him?

913
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,622
No, I don't.

914
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,834
I'd accept anything
that would pay me well.

915
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,254
They can easily stab
a detective at a police station.

916
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,880
You should be careful too, Wook.

917
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,507
I want to file a missing person's report.

918
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,967
Did something happen to Wook?

919
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,927
I just want to know why.

920
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,388
Why I'm different
from the other dead people.

921
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,473
Il-yong, hang in there.

922
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:08,688
