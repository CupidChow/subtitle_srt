1
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,619
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,747
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,642
Hey, let's go.

4
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,558
Don't come close!

5
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,810
Get away!

6
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,980
You're with them, aren't you?

7
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,607
I was in a car just now.

8
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,939
Where am I?

9
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,654
Who are you?

10
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,494
This is Café Hawaii, the café I run

11
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,446
and I am Thomas.

12
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,174
What is this place?

13
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,763
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

14
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,681
Let me explain on the way.

15
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,944
The dead?

16
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,112
Are you saying I'm dead?

17
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,107
You must be kidding me.

18
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,735
I know it's hard to accept the truth.

19
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,036
It's just like my place.

20
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,836
Because things in your memory
come along with you.

21
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,913
<i>Do you know him?</i>

22
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,376
Jun-ho!

23
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,013
Jun-ho!

24
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,347
<i>Please help!</i>

25
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,428
<i>Help me!</i>

26
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,436
<i>It's that woman.</i>

27
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,067
Jun-ho, it's me!

28
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,083
No!

29
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,714
Jun-ho…

30
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,792
Jun-ho!

31
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,066
{\an8}Did the detective leave?

32
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,195
{\an8}Does he still think you have something
to do with Ha-neul's case?

33
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,002
{\an8}- It's the same woman.
- Who?

34
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,462
{\an8}I'm here because of that woman.

35
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,713
{\an8}And she is here too.

36
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:41,724
{\an8}- Who are you talking about?
- The tall woman with long hair.

37
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,264
You mean Yeo-na?

38
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,474
Her name is Yeo-na?

39
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,224
Right. She came here
on the same day he came.

40
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,807
You saw her getting abducted?

41
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,603
It looked like she had fainted.

42
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,606
They put her in the car.

43
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,648
Did they kill her?

44
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,652
Where did they take her body?

45
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,574
I don't know.

46
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:05,322
I recorded them putting her in the car
with my phone to report it to the police.

47
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,156
They chased after me because of it

48
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,791
and that's how I ended up here.

49
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,408
I got myself in this mess
because of my sense of justice,

50
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,326
so I can't even blame anyone else.

51
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,004
When you went out,
did you report it to the police?

52
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,924
What are you talking about?
I never went out.

53
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,553
You're talking nonsense.

54
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,670
It's all right.

55
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,377
I already know about you two.

56
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,603
You said no one knows we're still alive.

57
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,810
Thomas knows.

58
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,720
Who is this guy?

59
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,678
Is he the village head or what?

60
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,060
Why have you been playing dumb?

61
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,015
To keep the peace of the village.

62
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,976
Will you continue to stay here?

63
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,356
I don't know. I'm not going to tell you.

64
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,113
So you guys are in it together.

65
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,316
I knew it.

66
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,445
When I made a fool of myself
trying to take Ha-neul outside,

67
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,664
you just sat back and watched
because you knew I couldn't go out.

68
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,076
I had no idea you made a fool of yourself.

69
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,535
So is that your job?

70
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,625
Finding dead bodies
and getting paid for it?

71
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,090
What do you take me for?

72
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,260
Did you look for Ha-neul
because of the money?

73
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,049
- Of course not.
- That's enough.

74
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,723
Tell me more about them.

75
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,930
The people who killed Yeo-na.

76
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,928
Why are you doing something
you don't get paid for?

77
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,694
Looking for dead bodies.

78
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,059
That's a tough job.

79
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,016
A thankless job.

80
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,475
Do you only do things that make you money?

81
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,898
Of course.

82
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,896
I need to be financially stable

83
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,108
in order to help others.

84
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,118
Kids these days are so selfish.

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,830
Go and figure out how to find
the people who killed Yeo-na.

86
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,411
- Why?
- I know you came here

87
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,416
because you're scared of them.

88
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,628
If you catch them,
you can get out of here.

89
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,130
And if you leave this place,

90
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,211
I can finally sleep in peace
in my own home.

91
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,007
It's a win-win for us.

92
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,260
I already paid you to stay at your house.

93
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,222
If it's a win-win for us,
why are you telling me to find them?

94
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,394
What about you?

95
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,062
Me?

96
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,444
I'm busy.

97
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,734
Where are you going?

98
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,909
Well…

99
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,413
You seemed shocked earlier.

100
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,744
I was wondering if you're okay.

101
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,826
Anyway, are you going somewhere?

102
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,004
Yes, I have an interview.

103
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,375
What kind of interview?

104
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,423
Café Hawaii is hiring.

105
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,635
Why would you want to work here?

106
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,388
Take it easy and get some rest.

107
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,681
I'm doing it because I'm here.

108
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,388
I'm going to get out of here.

109
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,387
What?

110
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,808
There's a room in Café Hawaii.

111
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,363
It has a gate into this village.

112
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,572
I'm sure you came through that gate too.

113
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,913
Right. That gate.

114
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,698
But Thomas said

115
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,992
dead people can't go out that way.

116
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,077
You think I'm dead?

117
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,082
When I'm right here?

118
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,464
My heart is beating so hard
like it might explode

119
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,423
and I even have dreams when I sleep.

120
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,513
I cry, laugh, eat, and drink.

121
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,339
I'm not dead yet.

122
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,925
I'm going to get out of this place
as soon as possible.

123
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,681
So you shouldn't give up either.

124
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,393
How are you going to get out of here?

125
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,975
By any means necessary.

126
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,900
I'm going to look into that room
in Café Hawaii.

127
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,060
If there's a way in,

128
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,357
there must be a way out.

129
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,781
And after my shift,
I'll look around the village.

130
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Let me know once you find it.

131
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,197
Fine.

132
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,702
But don't tell anyone.

133
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,003
That you're trying to get out of here
or about what I saw earlier?

134
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,829
Both.

135
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,497
This village is weird.

136
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,634
Really weird.

137
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,594
There are a lot of weird people
and weird incidents.

138
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,587
I'm Choi Yeo-na. What's your name?

139
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,177
I'm Kim Wook.

140
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,102
<i>Wook</i> means "sunshine."
A person who brightens the world.

141
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,101
You can see it on my face.

142
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,443
Wook.

143
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,269
That being said,

144
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,277
did you live near Sang won-dong?

145
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,320
No, I lived in Mahyeon-dong.

146
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,244
Oh, Mahyeon-dong. Right.

147
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,994
My ex-girlfriend lived in that area.

148
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,155
I must have seen you
around the neighborhood.

149
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,615
Where were you right before you came here?

150
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,632
The last thing you remember.

151
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,713
Someone came to my house.

152
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,128
I thought it was a delivery,
so I opened the door.

153
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,545
<i>But some strangers were standing there.</i>

154
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,222
<i>And then I passed out.</i>

155
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,354
<i>When I woke up, I was in a car.</i>

156
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,232
I was scared, so I pretended I was asleep.

157
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,520
When the car stopped, I ran away.

158
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,983
<i>And then they caught me again.</i>

159
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,528
<i>Next, I was here.</i>

160
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,624
Then you don't know who they were at all?

161
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,450
No.

162
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,711
I can take it from here.

163
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,419
Thanks for checking in on me,

164
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,829
Kim Wook.

165
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,377
You're welcome.

166
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,126
Choi Yeo-na.

167
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,093
Mahyeon-dong.

168
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,885
<i>Who is Choi Yeo-na?</i>

169
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,678
Look up her address and social media.

170
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,310
Are you checking her out to hit on her?

171
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,391
I don't have time for that.

172
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,234
The guys who abducted me

173
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,821
also abducted her.

174
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,018
Did you find her?

175
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,108
Good for you!

176
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,200
Now that we have a witness,
we can catch your kidnappers.

177
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,278
You should record her.

178
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,283
Well, it's complicated.

179
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,986
Jong-a, I need your help.

180
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,077
I should go. I'll call you back.

181
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,501
I somehow got myself involved
with a dead person.

182
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,929
Aren't you supposed to work
for the residents?

183
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,048
You're right, but I don't think
I can process that.

184
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,137
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,769
You're sorry? Is that all?
Why can't you process it?

186
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,773
How many times should I tell you?

187
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,063
I know her name
and her resident ID number.

188
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,067
Why can't you do it?

189
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,279
- Who do you think you are?
- I should be asking you that.

190
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,490
Why do you want to know
your ex-wife's address?

191
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,531
This is a community service center,
not a detective agency!

192
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,825
Dae-seong, call the police

193
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,539
and tell them
a stalker is making a scene here.

194
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,410
Hello, is this the police?

195
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,827
I'm calling from the community center.
A stalker is making a scene here.

196
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,207
Please hurry and take him.

197
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,304
What?

198
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,384
You just wait. You two punks.

199
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,375
I won't let this slide. I mean it!

200
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,637
Fine, keep that promise!

201
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,509
If you don't, you're going to be sorry!

202
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,188
I was waiting for him
in front of his apartment.

203
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,282
I was like, "As soon as you step out,
I'm going to get the evidence

204
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,238
and report you to the police."

205
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,279
And then he really came out?

206
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,702
Yes!

207
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,450
He went to the rooftop
where there was a water tank.

208
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,583
No way…

209
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,909
I was thinking that too,

210
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:11,004
but then the jerk pulled out
Ha-neul's school bag.

211
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,288
That's when the police arrived
and found the boy.

212
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,878
Ha-neul's mother…

213
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,588
Must have been heartbroken.

214
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,554
My wife said children

215
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,595
brighten up the world.

216
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,938
Ha-neul…

217
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,059
It's sad that he's no longer with us,

218
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,519
but this is good for him.

219
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,939
I'm happy.

220
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,180
You said you were busy.

221
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,347
I guess you were busy daytime drinking.
You didn't even feed the dogs.

222
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,522
I had a drink with Detective Park.

223
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,518
Go sleep inside.

224
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,606
This is my house.

225
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,198
I decide where to sleep.
Got a problem with that?

226
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,250
You sure make a big deal
about this shabby house.

227
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,545
Probably…

228
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,970
Yes, that's right.

229
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,573
<i>It must be devastating for a parent
to hold a dead child in their arms.</i>

230
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,395
<i>But the thing is…</i>

231
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,034
<i>I was…</i>

232
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,236
<i>Envious of Ha-neul's mother.</i>

233
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,036
<i>I know I shouldn't be saying this,</i>

234
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,792
<i>but at least she was able
to hug her dead child…</i>

235
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,670
<i>I was so envious of her.</i>

236
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,797
<i>So very envious.</i>

237
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,554
{\an8}DO NOT ENTER

238
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,056
- Detective Bok.
- You scared me.

239
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,555
Aren't you supposed to come back tomorrow?

240
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,357
I said you didn't have to come.

241
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,531
It's our case anyway.

242
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,489
What happened?

243
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,819
It was a mugging.

244
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,662
But they didn't take his wallet?

245
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,912
His cell phone is here too.

246
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,794
It's a typical mugging,
but not at the same time.

247
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,619
- Do you have the victim's ID?
- Jang Myeong-gyu.

248
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,250
A reporter from <i>Hanyeong Daily</i>.

249
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,801
No security cameras.

250
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,887
Was it all planned out?

251
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,477
Good work.

252
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,256
YEO-NA

253
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,926
RECENT CALLS
YEO-NA

254
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:19,217
<i>The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message after…</i>

255
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,311
He has a wife.

256
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,313
He didn't drink or smoke.
Only went to work and home right after.

257
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,896
No social media accounts.

258
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,651
He didn't have any enemies
or many friends for that matter.

259
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,004
You can't find a young person
like this these days.

260
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,028
His entire 30-year life
is in this photo album.

261
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,115
Can you believe that?

262
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,617
We've seen crazier things.

263
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,291
It's not surprising at all.

264
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,500
I think this was a random act of violence.

265
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,711
How should I put it?
I don't feel any anger.

266
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,962
Whether it was a random act or not,
we must catch the culprit.

267
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,062
Do you have
Jang Myeong-gyu's call history?

268
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,304
- Yes.
- Give it to me.

269
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,604
A guy I know

270
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,345
broke seven ribs
while riding a motorcycle.

271
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,904
He knows all the biker gangs
around this area.

272
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,649
Yeo-na's number was
on Jang Myeong-gyu's call history.

273
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,485
YEO-NA

274
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,788
<i>The number you have dialed is unavailable.

275
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,450
Hey, Jun-ho.

276
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,868
Hey, wait for me!

277
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,882
An apartment in Mahyeon-dong.

278
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,213
<i>Pick on easy prey.</i>

279
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,507
<i>If things don't seem right,
pull out immediately.</i>

280
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,631
<i>Remember the rules?</i>

281
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,007
It's too late to pull out.

282
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,288
Are you sure about this?
We don't have a warrant.

283
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,667
It's been more than a week
since I heard from her.

284
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,255
You said she changed the pass code
after you guys fought.

285
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,341
Doing this…

286
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,392
Might make her angrier.

287
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,892
Strictly speaking,
this is breaking and entering.

288
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,807
Are you sure I'm allowed to open it?

289
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,555
What if something goes wrong and...

290
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,187
I said I'll take responsibility.

291
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,781
Open the door.

292
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,069
Don't worry about it.

293
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,033
Jeez, don't yell at him.

294
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,367
- Thank you.
- All done.

295
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,752
Thank you.

296
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,826
This coffee smells wonderful.

297
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,365
- Jun-ho.
- What?

298
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,785
Should we open a café
after we get married?

299
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,594
It's only been a month
since you quit your job.

300
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,089
You want to work again already?

301
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,470
It's just that since you're so busy,
I feel bored.

302
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,928
I can already imagine what it'll be like
once we're married.

303
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,425
Jun-ho, what do you think?

304
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,475
Do you think your mother will like it?

305
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,139
Gosh, it's not necessary.

306
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,807
Just exchange it
and get something for yourself.

307
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,766
She doesn't want my gift?

308
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,526
She won't come to our wedding,
and she won't accept my gift.

309
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,160
I never asked to be born as an orphan.

310
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,672
It seems like she hasn't been
home for days.

311
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,300
- She even left her wallet here?
- Only her phone is missing.

312
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,096
She definitely didn't just step out.

313
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,430
Call her family.

314
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,974
She doesn't have a family.

315
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,892
It's just her.

316
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,786
Excuse me.

317
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,424
Does a bell ring
when someone comes through that door?

318
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,252
Or is there lightning?

319
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,012
None of that happens.

320
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,379
Then how did you know?

321
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,046
You came in when I arrived.

322
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,347
I went inside to get something.

323
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,805
I see.

324
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,443
That's the 7th, right?

325
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,738
Show me footage from the next morning too.

326
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,872
We don't have it.

327
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,329
How come?

328
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,076
There was a blackout that morning.

329
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,911
The electrical system
was being inspected until 6:00 p.m.

330
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,377
Excuse me…

331
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,170
It's Jang Hyeon-ji.

332
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,716
Oh no, I'm sorry.

333
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,681

00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,572

MISSING: JANG HYEON-JI

341
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,525
Hey, sweet doggy. I'm home.

342
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Come here, girl.

343
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,038
Forget about it now if the cops know.

344
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,671
Let them take care of it.

345
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,289
Mr. Jang, do you still trust the police?

346
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,247
You saw what they did for Ha-neul's case.

347
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,628
They couldn't find out
whether he was alive or not.

348
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,925
All they did was waste time
and accuse the wrong person.

349
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,390
I'm just worried
you'll get involved again.

350
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,811
They thought you were a lunatic last time.
You want to get arrested again?

351
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,095
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

352
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,379
Please…

353
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,295
Please help me…

354
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,263
Please help me…

355
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,560
CAFÉ HAWAII

356
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,776
Drink up.

357
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,159
This will help you calm down.

358
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,622
How is your stab wound?

359
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,581
I don't know.

360
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,873
I don't feel anything.

361
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,078
Do you remember…

362
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,793
The man's face?

363
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,795
It was dark, so I didn't see it.

364
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,724
He was wearing a cap.

365
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,513
Okay.

366
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,092
You can stay at my place tonight.

367
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,637
Who was stabbed?

368
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,932
Jun-su's mom?

369
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,733
Gosh, Jang-mi. Are you all right?

370
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,022
She is really shaken up.

371
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,565
Okay, sure.

372
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,690
Let's talk outside.

373
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:05,834
I guess this isn't paradise after all.
There's a criminal on the loose.

374
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,085
This has never happened
since I moved here.

375
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,799
- Who did it?
- By the time I got there, he was gone.

376
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,591
But there's nowhere to run.

377
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,474
I'm sure he's still in the village.

378
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,641
Jeez.

379
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,099
The security here is so lax.

380
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,186
Oh, did Yeo-na come here?

381
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,728
She said she had
an interview here yesterday.

382
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,272
She left early
because it was her first day.

383
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,283
<i>If there's a way in,</i>

384
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,490
<i>there must be a way out.</i>

385
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,315
And after my shift,
I'll look around the village.

386
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,809
POLICE
PARK YEONG-HO

387
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,187
I think that really scared Jang-mi.

388
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,483
She barely fell asleep.

389
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,244
Why did you take those out?

390
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,740
I'm going to patrol the village

391
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,156
with Mr. Jang.

392
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,293
Remember the man who wielded an axe?

393
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,249
You got hurt badly then.

394
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,632
Come on, that was ages ago.

395
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,839
It's been almost 15 years.

396
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,261
There's another lunatic on the loose.

397
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,550
I'm scared.

398
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,763
I can only die once.

399
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,345
I can't die twice.

400
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,227
I heard that men die
when they finally grow up,

401
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,348
but you never grew up even after you died.

402
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,307
Keep the door locked tight

403
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,687
and go to bed.

404
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,443
Okay.

405
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,450
Yeo-na.

406
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,240
Yeo-na, are you inside?

407
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,745
Damn it. Where is she?

408
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,795
Yeo-na, are you all right?

409
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,351
Watch out!

410
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,475
Yeo-na, go and get the others.

411
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,982
Hurry!

412
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,398
I'll go and get the others!

413
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,273
What the hell?

414
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,423
Does it hurt?

415
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,505
I guess there's a difference
between you and me.

416
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,511
Who are you?

417
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,262
None of your business, you bastard!

418
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,138
You can't kill me anyway.

419
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,518
You knew you wouldn't die
even if you got caught.

420
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,232
Is that why you attacked the women?

421
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,062
You scumbag!

422
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,025
Why do you live like this?

423
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,070
Come here.

424
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,527
You're different from me.

425
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,366
Do the others know too?

426
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,661
Stop talking nonsense.

427
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,124
If you ever show your face again,

428
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,285
I'll make you wish you were dead.

429
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,205
Over there! Hurry!

430
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,633
Where?

431
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,711
Get out of here!

432
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,134
Get lost, you jerk!

433
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,674
- There?
- Over there!

434
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,626
- Where?
- Over here!

435
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,047
- Where?
- He's there.

436
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,022
- Are you okay?
- Where is he?

437
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,639
Where did he go?

438
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,635
I don't know.

439
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,976
Maybe I blacked out
after getting hit in the head.

440
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,482
When I woke up, he was gone.

441
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,824
- Let me see your stab wound.
- You got stabbed?

442
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,530
No, it didn't go through me.

443
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,862
Look. I'm fine.

444
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,867
What? I saw you get stabbed.

445
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,619
He can't even bear a little pain.

446
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,794
If he got stabbed,
he'd have screamed his head off.

447
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,214
What do you mean
I can't bear a little pain?

448
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,633
I'm glad you're fine.

449
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,591
If you mean it, give me a drink later.

450
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,802
I'm going to take Yeo-na home first.

451
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,883
Let's go.

452
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,342
Right…

453
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,017
Thank you.

454
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,267
I don't even want to imagine
what might've happened

455
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,686
if you hadn't shown up.

456
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,610
So go straight home after work
from now on.

457
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,409
There are a lot of bad guys out there.

458
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,790
I feel restless.

459
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,333
I can't find the exit
and I don't have much time.

460
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,344
You don't have much time?

461
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,165
I have an appointment.

462
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,344
It must be very important.

463
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,137
I have to attend a wedding.

464
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,639
Whose wedding is it?

465
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,853
A family member's?

466
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,023
A friend's?

467
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,017
It's my wedding.

468
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,859
In three weeks.

469
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,360
Is the groom the man you met on the hill?

470
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,531
I should go now.

471
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,406
Get home safe, Wook.

472
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,880
Hey.

473
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,758
Give me a knife.

474
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,926
A knife?

475
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,184
What for?

476
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,073
What are you doing?

477
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,493
So what Yeo-na saw was right.
Did he stab you?

478
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,156
Yes, but I didn't feel a thing.

479
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,078
Then you knew about it?

480
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,747
We can't harm anything
from the outside world.

481
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,167
That's what makes people
in this world feel worse.

482
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,006
No matter how hard we struggle,

483
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,550
our cries will never reach them.

484
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,806
Did you find him?

485
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,403
No.

486
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,058
I can't find him.

487
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,607
Who the hell is he?

488
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,276
Woo Il-seok.

489
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,738
He arrived two days ago.

490
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:55,161
I offered to show him around,
but he refused and shut the door.

491
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,292
His eyes were a bit shifty,
but I didn't expect him

492
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,249
to do something like this.

493
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,039
So the only way to make him
disappear is to…

494
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,124
Find his body?

495
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,086
First, we should find him and lock him up.

496
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,090
Detective Park and I
are going to patrol the area.

497
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,723
Oh, there's a detective here?

498
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,429
Yes, he got caught while trying
to catch a criminal and ended up here.

499
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,971
Thanks to him, I got lots of advice

500
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,846
and learned how to find missing bodies.

501
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,595
There's a detective and a criminal.

502
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,976
This village has everything.

503
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,823
Right. I saw something strange
around Woo Il-seok's ankle.

504
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,502
What is this?

505
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,578
He was wearing this around his ankle?
It's an ankle monitor.

506
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:47,754
Let's go find him now.
This town is full of women and children.

507
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,415
We can't let him roam around.

508
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,634
There's never a quiet day here.

Jeez.

513
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,230
They don't even know
he's causing trouble here.

514
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,228
How would they know he's here?

515
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,773
That's exactly the problem.

516
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,524
If they put an ankle monitor on him,

517
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,146
they should be keeping track of
his whereabouts.

518
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,112
That's what we're paying taxes for.

519
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,945
For once, you have a point.

520
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,990
Check what he was arrested for.

521
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,374
Okay.

00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,264
You haven't heard from Yeo-na yet?

539
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,379
No.

540
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,757
Who's this Kim Nam-guk
that you can't reach?

541
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,468
He runs a business.
He has no criminal records.

542
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,177
I'm going to visit him.

543
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,059
Where are you going?

544
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,357
I'm going to get some information
on that jerk from yesterday.

545
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,782
Okay.

546
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,280
And visit my friend's shop
while I'm at it.

547
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,202
The people who abducted Yeo-na
went to his shop too.

548
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,832
I'm going to check the security footage
for possible clues.

549
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:45,911
- I see.
- Right.

550
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,713
No one will know even if I help the dead.

551
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,419
It doesn't pay the bills
and makes me look like a lunatic.

552
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
This is all because of
my sense of justice.

553
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,168
Gosh, no one asked you!

554
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,339
Look at him brag.

555
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,226
WOO IL-SEOK

556
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,823
{\an8}SO GOOD PAWNSHOP

557
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,948
I can't see anything.

558
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,697
Mr. Kim Nam-guk, are you here?

559
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,542
Why are you here?

560
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,625
What are you doing here?

561
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,682
I should be asking you that.

562
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,678
Didn't you see the closed sign?

563
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,680
Can't you read English?

564
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,972
Where is Kim Nam-guk? His phone is off.

565
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,466
How do you know Nam-guk?

566
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,427
I need to ask him a few questions.

567
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,355
How do you know Kim Nam-guk?

568
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,895
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

569
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,315
We're not blood-related,
but we're like brothers.

570
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,614
We grew up together in a children's home.

571
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,698
Children's home…

572
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,743
Which children's home?

573
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,486
Will you know if I tell you?

574
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,287
Anyway, Nam-guk is on leave.

575
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,462
I don't know where he is now.

576
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,671
Is he hiding somewhere here?

577
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,881
Kim Nam-guk, come out!

578
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,551
What are you doing? I said he's not here.

579
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,301
And why would he hide?
He didn't do anything wrong.

580
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,434
I'm curious myself too.

581
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,600
Is Kim Nam-guk the bad guy,
or is he in danger?

582
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,469
Nam-guk is in danger? Why?

583
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,888
You can find out
if you call him right now.

584
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,727
You just said that his phone is off.

585
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,362
How can I call him?

586
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,530
Let me check the security camera…

587
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,739
Don't waste your time on an innocent guy.
Go and catch bad guys out there instead.

588
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,662
For example, the guys who abducted me.
Once you catch them…

589
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,207
You'll be able to find out what they did

590
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,125
and find other people they went after.

591
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,513
So please go and catch them.
Let me sleep in peace.

592
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,389
If you want to check the security footage,
come back with a warrant.

593
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:14,023
If you can reach Kim Nam-guk,
tell him I'm looking for him.

594
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,810
He might be in danger too.

595
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,881
IF YOU SEE THIS MAN,
REPORT TO CAFÉ HAWAII

596
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:26,905
Is this…

597
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,867
Supposed to be a composite sketch?

598
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,616
Well, even the great Thomas

599
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,213
is bad at something.

600
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,168
The world has become so advanced.

601
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,706
You can even look up
criminals on the computer.

602
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,554
When did they start
using those ankle monitors?

603
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:47,090
- Do they even put it on gangsters?
- Only on sex offenders.

604
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,304
{\an8}Anyway, Woo Il-seok, that punk.

605
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,218
I wonder how he died.

606
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,846
The fact that he's here
means his body hasn't been found.

607
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,225
I bet he was murdered.

608
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,122
It's highly likely
that it was an act of revenge.

609
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,566
What could he have done
to warrant such revenge?

610
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,189
You said he has a long rap sheet.

611
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,645
If you look into the victims
or their families,

612
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,196
you'll easily find a lead.

613
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,319
Since you're not a cop,
it'll be hard to get information.

614
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,498
Let's go on our patrol.

615
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,834
Gosh, he still talks like a cop.

616
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,803
<i>Tell him I'm looking for him.</i>

617
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,224
He might be in danger too.

618
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,184
Is this the police?

619
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,137
Hi.

620
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,687
I'd like to make a report.

621
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,610
Some strange people keep hanging around
in front of my house.

622
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,977
CHACHA DESIGNATED DRIVER SERVICE

623
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,285
Hey.

624
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,372
What are you doing?

625
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,343
My shoelace was undone.

626
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,959
You've been loitering around here.

627
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,665
Fine, I'll take it back.

628
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,968
What the hell? Let go of that.

629
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,143
Seriously?

630
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,636
Let me see your face.

631
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,971
What's your problem?

632
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,060
You punk.

633
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,232
Let me see your face!

634
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,901
You're...

635
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,042
There you go. It's moving!

636
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,340
If you keep using the same method,
you'll draw attention.

637
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,973
Having a funeral isn't a bad idea.

638
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,510
They don't have evidence anyway.

639
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,473
RISE IN MUGGING INCIDENTS…

640
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,602
We can't have this all over the news.

641
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,099
You should take care of it
quietly like before.

642
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,732
I'll handle it soon and call you back.

643
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,572
ILGONG COLD STORAGE WAREHOUSE

644
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,656
Where is Kim Nam-guk?

645
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,528
He hasn't come to work or home for days.

646
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,124
You stupid bastard!

647
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,952
How long do I have to wait?

648
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,756
Goodness.

649
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,934
You're going to chase all the fish away.

650
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,103
Why do you keep calling me?

651
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,982
<i>It sounds like you're enjoying fishing.</i>

652
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,518
It feels great to be back in my hometown.

653
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,109
Do you even have a hometown?

654
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,391
Your birth registration
was done at the children's home.

655
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,203
Exactly. There's no evidence
that this isn't my hometown.

656
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,280
I'm sure I was born near the East Sea.

657
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,905
I feel at ease whenever I'm here.

658
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,264
That's how a hometown
makes you feel, right?

659
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,498
Good for you.

660
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,791
<i>I've never taken time off
since opening my shop four years ago.</i>

661
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,205
Thanks to you, I'm on vacation
and get to use a burner phone.

662
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,464
Anyway, what happened to those guys?

663
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,678
They're still in front of your house.

664
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,179
Did anything strange happen recently?

665
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,722
Not really.

666
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,465
My life was very peaceful

667
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,227
until you got yourself
into trouble last week.

668
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,345
Well…

669
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,017
It's probably not important.

670
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,356
A friend from the children's home called.

671
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,569
We hadn't spoken in about 20 years.

672
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,532
Children's home? Which one?
Sunshine Children's Home?

673
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,883
The one I was at before
I went to Sunshine Children's Home.

674
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,037
It burned down.
I don't even remember the name.

675
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,826
I'll keep looking into it.
Have fun fishing for the time being.

676
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,955
Come on, you should come down here.

677
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,133
I'll serve you raw fish
with the fish I caught.

678
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,921
Let's have that with some soju.

679
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,665
I don't have time for that.

680
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,757
I should go.

681
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,175
Okay.

682
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,596
I won!

683
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,725
Again.

684
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,437
One, two.

685
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,727
I won!

686
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,715
{\an8}IF YOU SEE THIS MAN,
REPORT TO CAFÉ HAWAII

687
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,659
My goodness.

688
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,620
A composite sketch from the Joseon Dynasty
would look better than this.

689
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,042
Big bro.

690
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,087
I'm asking you out of curiosity.

691
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,054
How old are you?

692
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,919
Jun-su is eight and five.

693
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,337
Ha-neul is seven and one.

694
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,469
What does that mean?

695
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,523
Big bro, I saw that scary man.

696
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,848
Who? That guy?

697
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,024
When? Where?

698
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,402
Yesterday.

699
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,358
He stabbed you and you stabbed him back…

700
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,689
Quiet. Did you see everything?

701
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,895
Yes.

702
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,815
Don't tell anyone.

703
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,235
Is it our little secret?

704
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:03,332
Yes, it's our little secret.

705
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,159
I like that.

706
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,584
Go home before it gets dark.

707
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,042
That scary man
will be going around with a knife.

708
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,332
Jun-su, you should go home too.

709
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,088
Hurry up and go home.

710
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,169
It's getting dark.

711
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,590
What's wrong?

712
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,633
Jun-su, you should go home.

713
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,756
Where do you live? I'll take you home.

714
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,224
You bastard!

715
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,265
Jun-su.

716
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,269
Jun-su, it's okay.

717
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,101
Jun-su, it's all right.

718
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,646
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

719
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,359
What was that?

720
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,112
Don't you ever show up
before my son again.

721
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,907
Let's go, Jun-su.

722
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,450
Let's go home.

723
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,453
Come on.

724
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,044
What is her problem?

725
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,838
I think seeing an unfamiliar adult man

726
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,135
still triggers bad memories for Jun-su.

727
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,722
That's probably why he's here.

728
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,675
Once you spend time with him,
things will get better.

729
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,347
I understand Jun-su's reaction,

730
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,146
but what is wrong with his mother?

731
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:17,859
All parents worry about their children.

732
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,401
Jun-su is especially precious to her.

733
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,278
What?

734
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:26,485
I mean she's deeply concerned about him.

735
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,905
She's trying to protect him.

736
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,333
Gosh…

737
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,921
How did a mother and son
end up coming here together?

738
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,958
She's not his real mother.

739
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,752
She's just been looking after him
like her own son since he came here.

740
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,627
Anyway, I don't like that lady.

741
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,675
She made it seem like
I tried to kidnap Ha-neul last time.

742
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,221
That's just the way she is.

743
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,564
She gets worked up easily
and takes action when she sees injustice.

744
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,771
She cares for others
as much as she cares for herself.

745
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,311
Are you saying that
I committed an injustice?

746
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,478
Goodness.

747
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,278
I forgot to bring you some bar snacks.

748
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,778
Please wait just a moment.

749
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,333
It's sad that I don't have a mother
who will protect me like that.

750
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,286
- Unbelievable.
- Amazing.

751
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,084
She just killed him.

752
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,627
- She's going to win.
- Awesome!

753
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,841
- That's so cool.
- She's the best.

754
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:22,802
She's amazing.

755
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,881
- She's like a pro gamer.
- Look at her score!

756
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,177
- My goodness.
- That was amazing.

757
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,301
She's like a pro gamer.

758
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,269
Jong-a!

759
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,227
Jong-a.

760
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,937
I know you'll be out of the army soon,
but you shouldn't be here.

761
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,193
Come on, I'll be done in a week.

762
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,686
I'm almost a civilian now.

763
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,527
Almost jobless, you mean.

764
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,910
So was that your game ID? Awesome.

765
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,662
You won! Tonight's menu is fried chicken!

766
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,504
- Let's go and eat fried chicken together.
- Fried chicken? Please.

767
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,421
Don't follow me.

768
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,919
Go and have fun with kids your age.

769
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,172
Come on, Jong-a.

770
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,593
You come to the internet café alone
on the weekends.

771
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,422
I can tell you don't have a boyfriend.

772
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,837
I do. I'm off to meet him now.

773
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,221
Hey, Jong-a!

774
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,444
JONG-A

775
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,773
Hey, Jong-a.

776
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,688
Why are you calling me so early?

777
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,526
<i>Why is it so hard to reach you?</i>

778
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,242
<i>I got the documents on
Woo Il-seok you asked for yesterday.</i>

779
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,083
<i>I'll meet you at the town bus terminal.</i>

780
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,039
What? You're coming where?

781
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,329
Hey, how do you know where I am now?

782
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,333
<i>Even if you go to space,
I have a way to find you.</i>

783
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,102
<i>It's the weekend.
I want to get some fresh air.</i>

784
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:41,956
<i>I'll take the bus there.</i>

785
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,674
Hey. No, you can't. Don't come.

786
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,205
Stay right there.

787
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,378
<i>I'm already on my way.</i>

788
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,256
What? No!

789
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,223
Then…

790
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,722
Don't go anywhere
once you get off the bus!

791
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,148
Where are you going?
Why are you all dressed up?

792
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,105
I'll get off immediately
once we reach Seoul,

793
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,947
so act like you're blind.

794
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,282
How can I act like I'm blind?

795
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,038
I'm saying let's ignore each other.

796
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,580
How can I ignore you when I can see you?

797
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,536
I mean, I'm sure you have
a life of your own.

798
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,514
Meeting women.

799
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,631
Going on dates.

800
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,224
Right.

801
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,466
I'm going to meet a woman. Happy?

802
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,870
You have that photo album
from Jang Myeong-gyu's house, right?

803
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,734
Give it to me.

804
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,164
Jang Myeong-gyu, Yeo-na, and Kim Nam-guk

805
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,668
- all grew up in a children's home.
- The same children's home?

806
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,777
{\an8}BLUE SUNSHINE CHILDREN'S HOME

807
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,598
13 YEARS OLD, NO FAMILY,
REGISTERED AT LOVE CHILDREN'S HOME

808
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,542
But it says Love Children's Home here.

809
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,630
Blue Sunshine Children's Home.

810
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,969
Mom, do you remember this photo?

811
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,763
This is Blue Sunshine Children's Home

812
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,847
where you used to be
the assistant director, right?

813
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,353
You quit because it burned down.

814
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,595
You're right. Why do you ask?

815
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,898
The children who survived…

816
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,941
Are they in this picture?

817
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,696
It's been more than 20 years.
Of course I don't remember.

818
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,487
Try to think of their names.

819
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,666
The kid with no front teeth is…

820
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,210
Jang Myeong-gyu.

821
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,713
Right, Myeong-gyu.

822
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,514
How do you know Myeong-gyu?

823
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:51,719
Who else?

824
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,801
Let me see…

825
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,178
This boy.

826
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,136
He used to be called "bedwetter."

827
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,097
I forgot his name.

828
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,270
Kim Nam-guk.

829
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,646
Right, Nam-guk.

830
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,533
Then this must be Yeo-na.

831
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,202
You knew, didn't you?

832
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,699
That Yeo-na was at Blue Sunshine.

833
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,457
Why are you

834
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,078
bringing up that place
after all these years?

835
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,669
So all three were
at the same children's home.

836
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,223
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Where are you now?</i>

837
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,063
- <i>We found Kim Nam-guk's car.</i>
- Where?

838
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,991
<i>It was caught on the CCTV
in the Sam do Harbor parking lot.</i>

839
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,385
I'm coming now.

840
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,992
Excuse me, sir. Who are you?

841
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,281
What is your relationship with Wook?

842
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,525
- We don't have much of a relationship.
- He owns the place I'm staying at.

843
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,657
I see.

844
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,583
Is your house close to the village?

845
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,792
It takes about 30 more minutes from here.

846
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,672
It only takes ten minutes by car.

847
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,999
Why do you keep butting in
when an elder is speaking?

848
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,165
Why are you yelling at him?

849
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,125
Are you guys siblings? You're both rude.

850
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,586
Wook and I are...

851
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,386
Just friends.

852
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,799
- Got it?
- Hey, Wook!

853
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,767
Let me focus on driving.

854
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,019
GPS POSITION TRACKING
EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION

855
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,101
I mean, you keep getting a notification.

856
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,517
What?

857
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,358
What? Why are you going that way?

858
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,408
Damn it.

859
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,038
Hey, Seoul is that way!

860
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,887
Is this the police?

861
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,298
Some strange people
are causing a ruckus here.

862
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,257
<i>Where are you calling from?</i>

863
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,847
Well…

864
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,352
It's near Sam do Harbor.

865
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,234
It's 1, Sam do 4-dong.

866
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,151
It's 1, Sam do 4-dong.

867
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,768
Where is that?

868
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,074
Hey, isn't that him?

869
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:34,964
Hello.

870
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,085
Hi, how can I help you?

871
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,721
We got a call saying
someone was causing trouble.

872
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,926
I haven't seen anyone like that.

873
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,390
I see.

874
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,800
Bye.

875
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,536
Go around him.

876
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,971
<i>In 1995, there was a fire
at Blue Sunshine Children's Home.</i>

877
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,048
More than ten kids in the building died,

878
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,724
but the three who'd gone to a hospital
because of a cold survived.

879
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,764
After the fire, they were sent to
different homes.

880
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,426
So the three are Jang Myeong-gyu,

881
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,926
Choi Yeo-na, and Kim Nam-guk?

882
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,654
How did you find that out?

883
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,808
My mom used to be
the assistant director there.

884
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,188
She quit because of the fire.

885
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,317
But Jun-ho.

886
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,240
Jang Myeong-gyu's case
might not be connected to your fiancée's.

887
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,992
I'll find out once I meet Kim Nam-guk.

888
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,655
Are you suspecting Kim Nam-guk?

889
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,083
There's a chance.

890
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,911
Or he could be a victim too.

891
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,320
I said I'd take the bus,
but you insisted I get in.

892
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,577
Where are you taking me?

893
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,538
This is an emergency. Can't you tell?

894
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,038
No, I can't.

895
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,290
I'll explain everything later.

896
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,922
If it happened in 1995,
they were all in kindergarten.

897
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,250
And you said they were sent to
different homes.

898
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:43,125
They didn't even keep in touch.
They just had that one recent phone call.

899
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,756
You're being too rash
unlike your usual yourself.

900
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:50,313
This is the only link to
Yeo-na's disappearance I've found.

901
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,441
They're so persistent.

902
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,901
Why are they doing this to me?

903
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,032
Who are you people?

904
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,497
Wook, the blinking dot
is headed the other way.

905
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,535
Are we there yet?

906
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,167
We're almost there.

907
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,182
NAM-GUK

908
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:38,774
Hey, Nam-guk.

909
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:39,983
Wook.

910
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,733
Where are you now? Are you okay?

911
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,105
Those guys went after you.

912
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,691
I know. They've been on my tail,
but I lost them.

913
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,647
I don't see them now.

914
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,316
Hey, they just made a U-turn.

915
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,485
A U-turn? It's an uphill single lane.

916
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,374
They can't make a U-turn here.

917
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,445
Don't you see other cars there?

918
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,873
No, none.

919
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,917
I think they just left.

920
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,040
Where are you now?

921
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,337
Are you…

922
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,629
Headed here because you're worried?

923
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,137
Nam-guk, park somewhere safe

924
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,218
and run away now.

925
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,180
Come on. I'm fine now.

926
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,265
Stop worrying. Jeez.

927
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,242
Hey, Nam-guk!

928
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,237
NAM-GUK

929
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,826
Nam-guk!

930
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,747
There must be an accident.

931
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,424
A car accident
on a downhill two-lane road.

932
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:51,046
Trace this number and
send over an ambulance.

933
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,583
{\an8}KIM NAM-GUK

934
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,295
How is he?

935
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,126
He's dead.

936
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,901
They cornered him in a remote place
without security cameras on purpose.

937
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,565
They even took the dashcam.

938
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,661
Jang Myeong-gyu.

939
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,909
Kim Nam-guk.

940
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,449
Yeo-na's the only one left.

941
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,326
We can't conclude anything yet.

942
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,207
I'll go take care of things.

943
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,342
Okay.

944
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,175
Nam-guk!

945
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,760
We have to go to him. Nam-guk!

946
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:18,845
Kim Nam-guk!

947
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,853
Sir, you can't. Stop.

948
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,063
You can't enter.

949
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,279
Nam-guk!

950
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:33,824
Hey, Nam-guk!

951
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,662
Look for Nam-guk.

952
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,028
Hey, Nam-guk!

953
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,115
Nam-guk!

954
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,735
Nam-guk!

955
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,326
{\an8}ALL FOR ONE, ONE FOR ALL

956
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,411
{\an8}Where's Nam-guk?

957
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,496
{\an8}Get out of my way!

958
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,713
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

959
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:47,791
Where are they going?

960
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,754
He needs a guardian to go with him!
I'm his guardian!

961
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,304
It's too late.

962
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,635
When we arrived,

963
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,224
he was already dead.

964
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,244
No…

965
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,156
No…

966
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,916
Nam-guk!

967
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,755
Nam-guk!

968
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,444
Nam-guk!

969
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,918
Nam-guk!

970
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,973
{\an8}<i>We must find the guys who killed Nam-guk.</i>

971
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,016
{\an8}<i>We must find Choi Yeo-na first</i>

972
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,018
{\an8}<i>in order to find the culprit
who killed Kim Nam-guk.</i>

973
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,269
{\an8}<i>Do you think she's still alive?</i>

974
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,673
{\an8}<i>"I'm here."</i>

975
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,593
{\an8}<i>"Come and find me."</i>

976
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,512
{\an8}I can't come to you yet.

977
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,152
{\an8}It will never reach the real world.
I think she still can't accept that.

978
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,612
{\an8}<i>I don't care if I go to hell
or someplace else.</i>

979
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,886
{\an8}Just get me out of here!

980
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,351
{\an8}<i>You don't believe that lunatic, do you?</i>

981
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,602
{\an8}<i>That's how desperate she is to reach him.</i>

982
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,604
{\an8}If you have time for this,
go catch the culprit.

983
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,556
{\an8}<i>We don't have time!
Someone's life is at stake!</i>

984
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,791
{\an8}<i>Just because you're dead
doesn't mean your sins are forgiven.</i>

985
