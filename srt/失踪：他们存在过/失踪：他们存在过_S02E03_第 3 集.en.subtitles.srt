1
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,928
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCALES, INSTITUTIONS,

2
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,389
RELIGIONS, AND EVENTS ARE USED
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER.

3
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,105
Whether alive or dead,

4
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,275
people are all the same.

5
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,154
You're glad when you meet nice people

6
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,406
and grateful when a day goes by

7
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,576
without any trouble.

8
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,289
Oh, there is something different.

9
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,719
Why is he looking at her so tenderly?

10
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,574
She's gone.

11
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,203
Our Eun-hee is gone.

12
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,082
If you leave without saying goodbye…

13
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,084
Good job.

14
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,880
…that's considered unfriendly,
and you'd be criticized for being rude.

15
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,883
But here,

16
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,344
it's such good news.

17
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,054
It's a good thing.

18
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,849
We are all relieved when it happens.

19
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,354
This is great.

20
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,858
But tears keep falling.

21
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,946
Who knew she'd leave so suddenly?

22
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,536
I wish she could have said goodbye
before she left.

23
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,791
Tomorrow morning,

24
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,669
Ha-yun will be so shocked
when she wakes up.

25
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,548
Let's see…

26
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,468
Ha-yun likes beef and radish soup.

27
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,849
Yeong-rim's favorite is seasoned pumpkin.

28
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,145
I should wake the kids
after I boil the soup.

29
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,528
SUPERMARKET

30
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,946
Today…

31
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,158
or tomorrow…

32
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,744
Hurry and leave.

33
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,890
So…

34
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,018
Mr. Jang asked about Yang Eun-hee,

35
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,854
and a few days later,
the criminal dug up the ground himself?

36
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,398
To sum it up, that's it.

37
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,983
And the anonymous informant

38
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,902
used a burner phone.

39
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,863
Wow.

40
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,200
Something smells fishy. It does.

41
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,036
Something similar happened before.

42
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,330
What's that word? That…

43
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,165
Déjà vu.

44
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,959
Yes, déjà vu.

45
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,211
-Hey.
-Yes?

46
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,840
I heard that a few days ago,
you were at the drug squad's site.

47
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,717
Who is Choi Jeong-ah?

48
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,844
How did you know?

49
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,974
Man-su came and caused quite a ruckus

50
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,142
saying not to ruin the investigation
he worked hard on.

51
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,352
So why were you there?

52
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,397
I wanted to check on something.

53
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,609
Déjà vu.

54
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,529
You know, our office does stink.

55
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,787
Please have your passport ready.

56
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,916
Thank you.

57
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,002
Next.

58
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,339
So he's still alive?

59
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,050
He's still living like this?

60
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,138
Let's go, Mang-chi.

61
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:06,848
Yes, sir.

62
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,768
Have we met before?

63
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,729
I've only heard of you.

64
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,230
This time,

65
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,316
Mr. Noh called us.

66
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,985
How is Mr. Noh?

67
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,902
He's doing fine.

68
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,196
He was worried about you, Director.

69
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,866
I'm not a director anymore.
I quit a long time ago.

70
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,410
You should go back
when the timing's right.

71
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,746
Go back? No.

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,664
More importantly…

73
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,503
there's something I haven't finished yet.

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,466
Lee Dong-min's visit reservations
are over for the day.

75
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,384
What?

76
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,636
You said the same thing last week.

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,973
Just who is it that comes
to see him so regularly?

78
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,392
I'm sorry. I can't tell you that.

79
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,770
-I'm sorry.
-Look.

80
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,731
I can't make a reservation
and you won't tell me who's visiting.

81
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,277
Why is it so hard to see a criminal?

82
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,697
If you'd like to send a letter
or a gift instead--

83
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,615
Forget it.

84
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,826
I'd rather not waste paper
on someone like him.

85
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,623
-Number 7107 for Lee Dong-min?
-Yes.

86
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,780
I just did what I'd normally do
without expecting an award.

87
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,823
Thank you!

88
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,658
Thank you.

89
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,201
Bo-ra.

90
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,662
It's Detective Shin.

91
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,543
Your phone was turned off.

92
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,171
Is everything okay?

93
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,883
I think there was someone following me
on my way home from school.

94
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,302
What did they look like?
Did you see their face?

95
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,012
No.

96
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,181
I could have been mistaken.

97
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,225
Why are you holding that?

98
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,852
Are you going to throw that at me?

99
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,438
Well, if I have to.

100
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,816
Why are you here?

101
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,109
Well…

102
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,612
I know you're on a diet,

103
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,238
but you should eat regularly.

104
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,699
You should eat well when growing up.

105
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,618
Have a seat. Let's eat.

106
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,995
-Thank you.
-Sure.

107
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,916
And this is

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,168
dessert.

109
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,171
Eat up. Here.

110
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,678
Have you found my mom?

111
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,514
Oh.

112
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,517
We're still looking for her.

113
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,188
Is there a place you can stay
until your mom comes back?

114
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,066
If there were, I would be there already.

115
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,657
Bo-ra, do you…

116
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,075
Yes?

117
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,203
It's nothing.

118
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,372
Take your time eating.

119
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,749
Drink some water too.

120
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,501
Here.

121
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,441
Wook.

122
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,485
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, hey!

123
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,112
What are you doing here?

124
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,072
It's hard to see you around the village.

125
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,240
He must be crazy.

126
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,616
You like places like this?

127
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,076
Is there a problem with that?

128
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,245
I used to come here often.

129
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,080
Then what about you?

130
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,290
Yes, I do.

131
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,958
Well then, have fun.

132
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,383
-I want beer.
-Beer?

133
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,723
You must come here often.

134
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,310
Can you bring
just one of those girls over?

135
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,269
No.

136
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,819
Where are you going?

137
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,904
Stay and hang out with me.

138
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,240
Hang out? With you?

139
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,871
Other people probably think
I'm crazy right now.

140
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,748
Have fun on your own.

141
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,249
I'm busy. I'll get going.

142
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,919
That bastard.

143
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,715
He used to come here often?

144
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,851
I'm sure it was that bastard.

145
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,696
Hey.

146
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,281
Hey!

147
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,492
Let's drink. Pour some drinks.

148
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,372
Want to do something fun?

149
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,623
-Want to feel good?
-Yes!

150
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,999
-You want to feel good?
-Yes!

151
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:07,917
Want to feel good?

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,834
-Yes!
-Let's go!

153
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,044
Let's go!

154
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,305
Kim Pil-jung.

155
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,934
I won't go down alone.

156
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,337
Please save my brother.

157
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,715
My brother is getting beaten up.

158
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,717
Hurry!

159
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,969
Calm down, kid.

160
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:00,928
What's your name?

161
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,805
Your name and your brother's name.

162
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,682
Min Ye-won.

163
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,143
My brother's name is Min Seung-jae.

164
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,187
Ye-won, where is your brother right now?

165
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,356
Wait a minute.

166
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,158
You're well-mannered.

167
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,703
MIN SEUNG-JAE

168
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,955
Your name is Seung-jae?

169
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,624
Yes.

170
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,167
Where am I?

171
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,422
LEE TAE-HYUN

172
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,926
We received a report
that Min Seung-jae was being assaulted.

173
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,344
In our home?

174
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,386
Yes.

175
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,679
Who reported it?

176
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,266
I'm sorry, we can't tell you that.

177
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,227
Was it Ye-won?

178
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,605
-Do you know her?
-Yes.

179
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,360
We do volunteer work helping runaways.

180
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,530
Ye-won said she had nowhere to go,
so we housed her for a few days

181
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,156
and even gave her some money.

182
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,741
You met her too.

183
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,535
She had long hair and round eyes.

184
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,038
Yes, I remember.

185
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,373
But why would she do that?

186
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,875
Right? She left without a word.

187
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,002
It's been about a month
since we last saw her.

188
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,255
Really?

189
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,174
Thank you for your cooperation.

190
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,676
Not at all.

191
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,052
Thank you for your service.

192
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,388
Let's go.

193
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,276
Hey, Seul-gi. It's me.

194
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,902
Have you heard anything about Jeong-ah?

195
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,279
What did the precinct captain say?

196
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,989
He doesn't know anything either.

197
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,699
They don't even have a suspect yet.

198
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,409
We have to do something.

199
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,286
What time do you get off work today?

200
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,328
Let's call Geun-hyeong too.

201
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,997
What? Why?

202
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,500
If we find the cars that were near
the bridal shop when she disappeared,

203
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,420
we might find something
from the dashcam footage.

204
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,462
You're right.

205
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,172
I'll get off work right at 5 p.m.

206
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,258
Okay. I'll call you later.

207
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,509
See you.

208
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,183
They're doing that again.

209
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,353
Wook!

210
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,522
Wook, come out here!

211
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,451
Oh, I'm tired.

212
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,994
Goodness.

213
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,287
Over there.

214
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,707
The puppies look excited
when there's nothing there.

215
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,833
It's weird.

216
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,627
Someone's there, right?

217
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,007
Mr. Oh Il-yong, are you there?

218
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,342
What are you talking about?

219
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,760
There's no one there.

220
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,349
Since you're out here, walk the dogs.

221
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,516
It's your turn today.

222
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,684
I have to go somewhere.

223
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,479
I'm meeting with friends to look
for clues about Jeong-ah's kidnappers.

224
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,023
I need to take matters into my own hands.

225
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,441
Where's Mr. Jang?

226
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,609
He went hiking.

227
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,822
Why is everyone so diligent?

228
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,991
You're just lazy.

229
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,246
You…

230
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,668
Why are you here so early in the morning?

231
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,504
You said she knows everything.

232
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,089
Why did you lie?

233
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,300
Even if I had told her the truth,
she can't see you.

234
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,386
It would only frustrate and scare her.

235
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,388
So why are you here?

236
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,265
Are you stalking me?

237
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,267
Me?

238
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,480
Captain Kang
wishes to see you and Mr. Jang.

239
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,608
Why does she want to see us?

240
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,279
Il-yong never tells us anything outright.

241
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,282
That's why I can't trust him.
Don't you think he's strange?

242
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,575
I don't know.

243
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,453
From his perspective,
we're the ones who can't be trusted.

244
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,708
That's your problem, you know.

245
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,793
You're too generous to the dead.

246
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,258
Where's the sister then?

247
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,218
Okay. I'll send someone right away.

248
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,261
All right.

249
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,679
Detective Oh, Detective Shin.

250
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,763
-Yes, sir?
-Yes, sir?

251
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,558
A teenage girl reported that
her brother was getting beaten,

252
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,184
but they found nothing at the scene.

253
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,061
They thought she had lied,

254
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,896
but her brother didn't show up
at school today.

255
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,440
He wasn't at home either.

256
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,026
-What about his parents?
-No mom. The dad is overseas.

257
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,029
The girl's in a shelter for now,
so go find out more details.

258
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,367
We're here.

259
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,368
Welcome.

260
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,995
Have you had lunch?

261
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,038
Come sit here.

262
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,498
-What's the occasion?
-I'll get some rice. Wait here.

263
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,128
-It's a feast.
-You cooked so much food!

264
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,506
-Looks delicious.
-Here.

265
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,010
-Wow.
-Wow, that looks delicious.

266
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,637
Is today a special day?
Is it someone's birthday?

267
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,473
What?

268
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,142
I just invited you over
so we could have a meal together.

269
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,644
Eat before the food gets cold.

270
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,896
-Okay.
-Mr. Jang.

271
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,445
It's very savory.

272
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,363
It's really delicious. Try it.

273
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,994
Thank you for the food.

274
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,288
Oh.

275
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,208
Come here and say hello. Hurry.

276
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,585
This is Min Seung-jae,
who arrived yesterday.

277
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,046
Hello.

278
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,506
Nice to meet you.

279
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,343
By the way, Seung-jae,
where did you say your sister was?

280
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,846
I keep forgetting things.

281
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,307
I saw her leave the house,

282
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,017
but I'm not sure.

283
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,104
I hope she's not caught again.

284
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,688
What?

285
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,191
Caught? Where?

286
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,486
Here.

287
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,530
Come here.

288
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,490
Come sit here and tell us.

289
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,911
His sister ran away,

290
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,996
and some bad people took her.

291
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,624
So Seung-jae went there
to save his sister.

292
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,377
Then he got beaten up
and lost consciousness.

293
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,171
What did you say your sister's name was?

294
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,673
It's Min Ye-won.

295
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,758
She's 14 years old.

296
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,389
Where's the house that Ye-won was held in?

297
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,599
A family of runaways.

298
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,059
SKY YOUTH HOME

299
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,687
When you post
that you have no place to sleep,

300
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,274
helpers offer support
and even give you a place to sleep.

301
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,860
They also introduce you to part-time jobs.

302
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,739
Put those on.

303
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,745
I said put them on!

304
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,835
Things were good at first,

305
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,796
but then they kept telling me
to do strange things.

306
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,966
I want to go home.

307
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,974
When I told them I didn't want to,

308
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,518
they took my cell phone

309
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,812
and kept me locked up inside the house.

310
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,817
How did Seung-jae know to find you there?

311
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,819
Tae-hyun, look at that.

312
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,573
That's so funny.

313
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,657
What now?

314
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,910
When Lee Tae-hyun was distracted,

315
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,662
I secretly texted my brother
from his phone.

316
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,374
It's Ye-won.

317
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,835
Please come and get me.

318
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,503
I'm at 93 Eunsa-ro, Unit 401.

319
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,131
DELETE THIS CONVERSATION

320
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,136
Soon after,

321
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,722
my brother came.

322
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,144
-Who are you?
-Stop it.

323
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,395
Stop it!

324
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,313
Let go!

325
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,898
Let go of my brother!

326
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,733
Ye-won!

327
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,819
Ye-won, run!

328
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,779
Hurry!

329
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,741
Where do you think you're going?

330
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,534
You little…

331
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,452
Hey!

332
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,373
Min Seung-jae really wasn't there?

333
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,332
No.

334
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,794
The officers looked around
but didn't find him.

335
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,879
If he got away safely,

336
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,174
he definitely would have gone home.

337
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,801
He's…

338
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,263
a hard worker and a good student.

339
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,140
He's not like me.
He wouldn't go off the grid.

340
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,604
We'll look for him,

341
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,481
so don't worry too much and stay here.

342
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,276
Your dad is coming on the earliest flight.

343
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:22,072
Are there any places Seung-jae frequents?

344
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,034
We're not close, so I don't know.

345
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,788
I shouldn't have called him.

346
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,540
It's my fault.

347
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,134
The fortunate thing is…

348
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,431
it's me that's here, not Ye-won.

349
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,769
If something had happened to her
instead of me,

350
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,024
I don't think I could have handled that.

351
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,531
I'll go now.

352
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,533
Okay. Sure.

353
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,123
-Go on.
-Goodbye.

354
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,541
Bye.

355
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,178
First, we should find out where Ye-won is.

356
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,974
But can you find her with just her name?

357
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,977
Of course. The internet
is so convenient these days.

358
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,189
You don't think she was recaptured
by those people, do you?

359
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,275
I'm worried.
The world is such a dangerous place.

360
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,238
Wook, come on.

361
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,825
Let's go look for her right now.

362
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,160
You're not going to eat?

363
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,289
-Why?
-Come on. Listen to your elders!

364
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,834
Okay.

365
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,253
You should go. You do that.

366
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,008
My goodness.

367
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,015
I can't do this anymore.

368
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,810
I…

369
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:18,188
I tried to just gloss it over,

370
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,190
but I need to be honest.

371
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,319
This was the reason I wanted to see you.

372
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,322
Seung-jae's story
made me so sad when I heard it.

373
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,783
Please help him.

374
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,247
You two found Eun-hee last time.

375
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,706
Right?

376
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,086
I guess we can't fool you, Captain Kang.

377
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,713
It was kind of obvious last time.

378
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,341
I'm sure Eun-hee left without knowing.

379
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,136
However, I'm grateful for what you did.

380
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,595
Don't mention it.

381
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,597
Since you know everything,

382
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,224
don't get your hopes up.

383
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:58,728
We'll do our best,
but finding someone is not that easy.

384
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,021
Trying is enough.

385
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,816
I'm grateful enough
that you were willing to listen.

386
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,609
But you'll even try to look for her.

387
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,069
I want nothing more.

388
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,489
I should have asked him
for more details then.

389
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,950
For example, the weapon used to murder.

390
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,245
What else do you need
when you know the murderer's name?

391
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,081
Even if we know his name,
he's not going to admit it easily.

392
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,417
We need irrefutable proof.

393
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,418
"Irrefutable"?

394
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:22,878
What's that?

395
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,379
You know.

396
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,716
Proof that he can't refuse.

397
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,427
You mean "refute," not "refuse."

398
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,433
Captain, don't throw away the food.

399
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,185
I'll be back next time to eat it.

400
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,896
All right.

401
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,982
I'll be waiting with a feast,
so hurry back.

402
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,985
And where is Il-yong?

403
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,571
How come your part-timer
is always gone when we're here?

404
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,906
Il-yong?

405
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,535
BYEON SEOK-HA

406
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,642
Hello.

407
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,062
I'm Detective Shin Jun-ho
from the Missing Persons Team.

408
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,688
May we come in?

409
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,442
Excuse me.

410
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,532
Are you going on a trip?

411
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,119
Yes. We're going to Thailand
to play some golf.

412
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,289
Your suitcases make it look like
you're moving overseas.

413
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,333
I have a lot of clothes.

414
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,918
Would you like to look inside?

415
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,461
I'd appreciate it if I could.

416
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,678
Do you know Min Seung-jae?

417
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,471
Min Ye-won's brother.

418
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,557
He was here yesterday.

419
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,102
This again?

420
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,187
We told you, we don't know him.

421
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,482
Ye-won was known to spout lies
every time she opened her mouth.

422
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,694
Can I close this now?

423
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,238
Ji-won, stop.

424
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,699
They searched the whole place yesterday.
Why are they back?

425
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,454
Next time, bring a warrant.

426
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,543
I'll be back with a warrant,
so don't go too far.

427
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,545
Don't even think about running.

428
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,965
We're pros at finding people.

429
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,676
-Right, Detective Oh?
-Yes, sir.

430
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,802
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

431
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,361
Let me take this.

432
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,904
-I'll be in the car.
-Okay.

433
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,574
-This is Shin Jun-ho.
-Detective Shin.

434
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,618
Is there a missing person's report
for Min Ye-won?

435
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,288
-Min Ye-won?
-Yes. She's 14 years old.

436
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,040
The brother's name is Min Seung-jae.

437
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,082
This is urgent.

438
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,005
I'm looking for Min Seung-jae.
What's going on?

439
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,506
Where did you hear about this?

440
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,633
Min Seung-jae

441
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,427
is dead.

442
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,013
Seung-jae's dead?

443
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,556
His sister might be in danger.

444
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,059
Ye-won is in a safe place.

445
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,853
Goodness. That's a relief.

446
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,647
Detective Shin, you believe me, right?

447
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,693
If you do, immediately arrest the people
that had been holding Ye-won.

448
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,779
They killed Seung-jae.

449
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,784
Whether I believe you or not
is not what's important.

450
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,496
There must be proof,
but we haven't found anything yet.

451
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,122
You must arrest them right away!

452
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,665
If they run, you don't know

453
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,501
what they'll do with Seung-jae's body!

454
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,628
I can't arrest them
just based on your story.

455
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,296
It's not that easy.

456
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,132
What are you talking about?
They killed someone!

457
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,930
If you can't do it,

458
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,390
we'll come over and get them.

459
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,266
We'll hold them in place for now

460
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,685
while you find Seung-jae and some proof.

461
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,480
Okay. I'll do my best
to take care of it first.

462
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,481
Don't cause trouble.

463
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,584
If he already moved the body
and evidence that day,

464
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,670
we have no time to waste.

465
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,468
Hey, Detective Shin.

466
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,179
Sir, please prohibit Lee Tae-hyun
from leaving the country.

467
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,849
Min Seung-jae

468
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,101
is likely dead.

469
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,202
Yes, Mr. Jang?

470
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,955
When are they going to come out?

471
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,915
Be patient now.

472
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,502
Oh, here they come.

473
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,466
Delivery.

474
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,926
Why won't they come out?

475
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,479
They just went down.

476
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,275
Now, it's my turn.

477
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,360
You're all dead.

478
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,748
Damn it. What is this?

479
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,754
You go out and see.

480
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,798
Hey, old man!

481
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,591
Move if you want to live!

482
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,807
Damn that jerk.

483
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,606
Hey, old man.

484
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,107
Can't you hear me?

485
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,193
Get out of the way so we can go!

486
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,321
Oh, I'm sorry.

487
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,635
-You're so irritating!
-Oh, my!

488
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,976
Oh, my back.

489
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:53,893
What is he doing?

490
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,355
Hey, how could you do that to an old man?

491
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,899
Sir, are you all right?

492
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,776
-My back…
-You're badly hurt.

493
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,570
Oh, dear. What do we do?

494
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,281
Are you crazy?

495
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,490
Who are you to butt in?

496
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:11,077
-You're a menace to others.
-Just go on your way, delivery boy.

497
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,954
You won't get away with this.

498
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,041
Hello? Is this the police?

499
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,210
Let go.

500
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,129
Don't touch me.

501
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,839
-This is 95 Eunsa-ro.
-Damn it.

502
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,090
An old man is dying here.

503
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,676
He's been assaulted. Please hurry.

504
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,513
Oh, my.

505
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,848
Sir, are you okay?

506
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,308
You, delivery boy!

507
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,977
Hey, move your motorbike.

508
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,645
I won't.

509
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,480
I will when the cops get here.

510
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,608
Let's back out.
We'll be late for our flight.

511
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,942
I'll back it out so get in.

512
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,236
I said, move your bike! Move it!

513
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,405
You're doing great.
Stay down for a bit longer.

514
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,409
Are you con men or something?

515
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,619
Hey!

516
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,578
Hey, mister!

517
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,167
Where is Seung-jae's body?

518
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,639
Thank you for your cooperation.

519
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,016
-Not at all. Good luck.
-Thank you.

520
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,853
I told him not to cause trouble.

521
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,527
I didn't hit him.

522
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,613
Are you taking turns pressuring me?

523
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,990
I don't know what you're talking about.

524
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,080
Hey.

525
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,207
Where's Min Seung-jae?

526
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,460
Detective.

527
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,507
I told you I don't know who that is.

528
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,218
The last signal from his phone
was from your house.

529
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,261
-He must've been in the area.
-There's a witness.

530
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,430
A witness to what?

531
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,687
Korean police are useless.

532
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,105
What?

533
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,065
Detective Shin?

534
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,609
Lee Tae-hyun's father and lawyer are here.

535
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,868
Hello, Detective.

536
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,706
I'm Tae-hyun's father.

537
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,423
MASTER POTTER
LEE SU-OK

538
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,009
I'm Mr. Lee Tae-hyun's lawyer.

539
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,885
You can talk to me from now on.

540
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,315
Not a word out of him
since his lawyer arrived.

541
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,234
Hey, Detective Shin.

542
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,445
You really think that Seung-jae is dead?

543
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,239
We have to be open to that possibility.

544
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,701
In any case,
he lied about not knowing Seung-jae.

545
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,745
Did we get the search warrant
for his house?

546
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,662
Wait a bit.

547
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,999
I threatened them
saying I'd send out a press release

548
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,625
if they don't issue the warrant.

549
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,253
I'll be waiting. Call me when it arrives.

550
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,636
These are hackable?

551
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,388
It's only possible because I'm doing it.

552
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,515
Don't you tell anyone about this.

553
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,184
What if you get caught?

554
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,185
I won't.

555
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,481
Why are there so few cameras here?

556
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,816
This is a rural area.

557
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,780
Hey, I need to call my dad.

558
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,866
What?

559
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,576
Where is he going?

560
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,205
This isn't working.

561
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,083
Doing fieldwork is the only option now.

562
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,043
Let's go.

563
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,337
-Hello.
-Hello.

564
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,005
-May I ask you something?
-Sure.

565
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,176
On August 8th, did you go to a wedding
that was held downtown?

566
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,095
-No, we didn't go.
-We didn't.

567
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,012
Did you go?

568
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,597
-No.
-No.

569
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,186
I'm sorry to bother you,
but did you park here on August 8th?

570
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,104
Hello.

571
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:10,566
Does this security camera
show the other side of the street?

572
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,403
Did you happen to attend
the wedding downtown on August 8th?

573
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,617
Where's Geun-hyeong?

574
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,077
He hasn't come back yet?

575
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,539
Maybe he's off somewhere eating something.

576
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,671
Lee Geun-hyeong!

577
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,718
Sorry I took so long.

578
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,303
Where have you been?

579
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,099
You know my dad
is the head of the village.

580
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,893
In a rural area like this,

581
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,897
using his connections is faster than 5G.

582
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,693
There's more.

583
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,071
He told people to bring
dashcam footage to the village hall,

584
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,447
and everyone brought theirs.

585
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,286
So did you find anything?

586
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,621
No. Nothing came up.

587
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,583
Apparently, cleaners came that day.

588
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,586
Cleaners.

589
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,463
It seems that Lee Tae-hyun's dad
sends them regularly.

590
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,592
The son is spoiled rotten by his parents.

591
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,679
Anyway, they couldn't find
bloodstains or Seung-jae's DNA.

592
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,849
Maybe the cleaning service
is working with him.

593
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,310
Which is why Detective Oh
is investigating them right now.

594
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,903
-By the way, Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

595
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,322
Are you receiving word
from the other side again?

596
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,115
What do you mean?

597
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,203
Just like what happened
with Yang Eun-hee and Min Seung-jae,

598
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,205
we're getting a lot
of strange information.

599
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,332
-Okay.
-Detective Shin

600
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,959
is not someone
who trusts other people's words easily.

601
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,963
But he keeps insisting
that Seung-jae was murdered.

602
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,549
He could be right.

603
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,594
Of course, he could.

604
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,598
Then there should be
circumstances or proof.

605
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,562
I'm just saying.

606
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,151
Hey, Il-yong.

607
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,778
Hi, Captain.

608
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,197
-Where are you going?
-To find Seung-jae.

609
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,075
Would you go find and bring him to me?

610
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,702
Who's Seung-jae?

611
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,121
The high school student
who arrived two days ago.

612
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,250
You must have missed him
because you were out yesterday.

613
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,253
Have you been to Ro-ha's home?

614
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,505
Yes. No one was there.

615
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,260
There's something I want to confirm,
but it's beyond my abilities.

616
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,345
You should talk to Wook.

617
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,555
There's no one else we can turn to.

618
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,976
Okay.

619
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,519
I'll go look for Seung-jae.

620
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,036
You must be Seung-jae.

621
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,038
Who are you?

622
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,291
Can't you tell?
I'm your new older brother.

623
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,877
I knew you'd be here
since you weren't at home.

624
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,046
How did you know?

625
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,923
When I first came to this village,

626
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,759
I'd always come here and zone out.

627
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,511
Back then,

628
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,724
I was so, so angry.

629
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,142
It was so unfair.

630
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,728
The ones who killed me were still alive

631
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,354
while I was stuck here like this.

632
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,403
What were you thinking about?

633
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,574
Nothing much.

634
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,618
Until last week,

635
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:54,040
my grades, college entrance exams,
and my top-choice programs

636
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,168
were the only things I thought about.

637
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,005
But now, none of that matters.

638
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,300
So I have nothing to think about.

639
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,766
Let's go eat.

640
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,226
Captain Kang asked me to bring you.

641
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:20,024
Was there a bracelet
with flower embroidery?

642
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,233
A bracelet?

643
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,903
There was no bracelet.

644
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,279
What's that?

645
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,367
It's nothing valuable,
but it's important to me.

646
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,577
My mom left it for me.

647
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,373
-A keepsake?
-I fell when Lee Tae-hyun pushed me.

648
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,500
And I think I dropped it
on the carpet then.

649
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,168
Wait, on the carpet?

650
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,086
Yes.

651
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,546
The one that's in front of the TV.

652
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,216
I don't need my bracelet.

653
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,593
Just find my brother.

654
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,401
Just one bite. Okay?

655
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,738
Welcome.

656
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,241
-Come sit here. I'll get some rice.
-Okay.

657
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:11,826
Eat up.

658
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,161
Let's eat together.

659
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,038
Sure.

660
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,124
Captain, more rice, please!

661
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,917
Sure thing.

662
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,585
You're eating well.

663
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,630
I'm going to eat well,
grow strong, and be a sprinter.

664
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,048
Good.

665
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,550
Eat up.

666
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,888
Goodness, what's going on here?

667
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,724
My sweetie's eating all on her own.

668
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,309
You eat so well.

669
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,396
Il-yong, did you hit her?

670
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,189
Come on, Captain.

671
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,150
I just poured some water over her rice.

672
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,193
And that's why she's
eating so well, right?

673
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,697
She eats her rice separately
from the sides.

674
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,283
You just didn't like
the texture of the rice.

675
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,036
Il-yong, how did you know?

676
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,039
Alice and I have similar eating habits.

677
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,795
They haven't found proof.

678
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,796
Proof?

679
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,549
When we've set everything up for them?

680
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:13,596
Instead of handing him over to the police,
we should have captured him.

681
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,598
And put him where?

682
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:19,310
Since Detective Shin seems to believe you,
I'm sure he'll get him somehow.

683
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,395
But when will he catch him?

684
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,524
-I don't know. Why are you yelling at me?
-Okay, I'm sorry.

685
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,193
-I was a bit loud.
-Goodness.

686
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,611
Okay.

687
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,446
Let's go sit on the bench.

688
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,281
-My darlings!
-I'll give you ice cream.

689
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,366
It's Hyeon-ji's dad.

690
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,244
You darlings.

691
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,705
-Hello, Mr. Jang.
-Hello.

692
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,499
You didn't go to school today?

693
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,708
It's lunchtime.

694
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,377
-What did you have for lunch?
-Something delicious.

695
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,215
-What are you doing now?
-We're going to have ice cream.

696
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,387
Why are you still here?

697
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,183
Uncle Wook.

698
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,851
-How are you?
-Hey, Alice.

699
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,229
Did you miss me?

700
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,981
Kids, let's have some ice cream.

701
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,650
-Look! Ice cream.
-Up you go.

702
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:08,734
-Ice cream!
-Ice cream!

703
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,194
Ice cream!

704
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,779
Alice, let's go eat ice cream.

705
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,155
I want this one.

706
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,198
I want this one.

707
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,408
You're here.

708
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,911
-Alice would like some too.
-Looks delicious.

709
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,371
Alice.

710
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,206
I'm glad to see you here.

711
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,296
Seung-jae, could you
take the kids to school later?

712
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,381
Sure.

713
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,924
Mr. Jang.

714
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,885
Wook. May I talk to you for a minute?

715
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,178
You too, Il-yong.

716
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,475
They arrested him,

717
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,310
but they're just going to let him go?

718
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,688
What kind of foolish thing is that?

719
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,730
Exactly.

720
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,484
If nothing works, we'll just have
to find Seung-jae on our own.

721
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,611
I said we need irrefutable proof.

722
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,657
So what was the murder weapon?

723
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,409
I haven't asked him yet.

724
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,952
There were others around.

725
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,372
-I'll go ask Seung-jae.
-I'll go with you.

726
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,623
Forget it.

727
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,418
I have more in common
with Seung-jae than you.

728
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,595
Did you see that?

729
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,055
He was outright rude to me.

730
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,182
Those are his true colors.

731
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,892
That's not true.

732
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,562
Il-yong has always been brusque.

733
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,022
That's not it.

734
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,982
He's avoiding me because
he feels guilty about something.

735
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,860
Why are you so antagonistic
towards Il-yong?

736
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,407
I have my suspicions about him.

737
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:41,869
"Suspicions…"

738
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,749
It's hot in here.

739
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,139
Let's play some one-on-one.

740
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,057
Sure.

741
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,559
But let me ask you something first.

742
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,936
I heard from Captain Kang

743
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,314
that you came here
while saving your sister.

744
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,817
Do you remember
the person who made you like this?

745
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,363
Of course.

746
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,239
It was my first time seeing him,

747
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,659
but he was the last person I saw
before coming here.

748
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,285
What about it?

749
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,287
What?

750
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:27,915
Just…

751
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,875
don't forget that.

752
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,711
There are many here
who don't know how they got here.

753
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,673
-Do you remember?
-Me?

754
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,715
Of course.

755
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,677
I remember everything,
even the knife he stabbed me with.

756
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,346
You were stabbed with a knife?

757
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,764
Yes.

758
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,516
And you?

759
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,062
He swung his golf club at me.

760
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,023
A golf club?

761
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,153
Are you good at basketball, Seung-jae?

762
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,368
PHONE RECORDS
IT'S YE-WON. PLEASE COME AND GET ME…

763
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,457
Two, eight, five, one.

764
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,086
Two, eight, five, one…

765
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,505
Where have I seen this?

766
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:26,140
MASTER POTTER
LEE SU-OK

767
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,856
CREATING TRADITIONAL POTTERY,
MASTER POTTER LEE SU-OK

768
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,191
"Baekok Pottery."

769
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,241
His father was there?

770
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,372
This is Shin Jun-ho.

771
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,290
It's a golf club.

772
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,500
Min Seung-jae was killed with a golf club.

773
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,588
There was no golf club at the scene.

774
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,507
And the carpet in his living room is gone.

775
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,427
-There was no golf bag?
-Wait a minute.

776
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,475
He said he was going on a golf trip,
but there was no golf bag.

777
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,060
Then they must have hidden everything.

778
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,148
After Ye-won escaped
and reported to the police,

779
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,609
it took 20 minutes
for the officers to get there.

780
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,945
They couldn't have taken the body
and the carpet far in just 20 minutes.

781
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,947
What if it wasn't Lee Tae-hyun,

782
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,241
but someone else who moved the body?

783
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,159
Who?

784
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,456
Someone who wants to protect him.

785
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,000
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

786
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,418
-Go, Il-yong!
-Go, Il-yong!

787
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,712
-Let's go, Seung-jae!
-Let's go, Il-yong!

788
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,217
-Last.
-Let's go, Seung-jae!

789
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,304
-Let's go, Seung-jae!
-Let's go, Seung-jae!

790
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,306
-Let's go, Il-yong!
-Let's go, Il-yong!

791
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,235
You do Captain Kang's errands from now on.

792
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,653
Rematch in one week.

793
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,490
Are you planning to stay here until then?

794
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,367
If not here, then where?

795
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,660
Is there somewhere else?

796
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,412
Let's go.

797
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,622
You need to wash up.

798
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,540
Okay.

799
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,209
Seung-jae, you're so good at basketball.

800
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,753
You were lucky today, Il-yong.

801
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,884
Let's go.

802
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,303
Let's go, kids.

803
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,223
Let's go.

804
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,934
-Mr. Jang!
-Yes.

805
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:34,893
Come close.

806
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,270
You have something to say?

807
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,147
I have a present for you.

808
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,482
Let's meet here.

809
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:44,027
It's only for you, so come by yourself.

810
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,112
Okay.

811
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,197
All right.

812
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,699
Hurry up, Ha-yun.

813
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,826
See you next time, Mr. Jang.

814
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,957
Min Seung-jae is dead.

815
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,670
Sir, where's the backup?

816
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,797
I'm bringing them with me last minute,

817
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,299
but who's going to be there?

818
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,092
Min Seung-jae.

819
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:12,264
Seung-jae went to Tae-hyun's home
to get Ye-won after receiving the text.

820
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,934
While Seung-jae was holding Tae-hyun,

821
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,185
Ye-won ran away.

822
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,022
Tae-hyun murdered Seung-jae
with a golf club.

823
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,659
The couple then hid the body
and the bloody carpet

824
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,077
along with the murder weapon.

825
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,664
They moved these far from the scene

826
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,833
in just 20 minutes
before the police arrived?

827
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,335
That's impossible.

828
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,175
He had help from a faithful assistant.

829
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,223
And…

830
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,269
all the evidence,
including Seung-jae's body,

831
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,356
is in the helper's hands right now.

832
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,261
I'm done.

833
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,056
Good job, Seung-jae.

834
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,558
You didn't have to do that.

835
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,936
I lost, so I have to keep my word.

836
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,021
I should go.

837
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,648
Okay. Here.

838
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,192
I packed you some snacks.

839
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,195
Eat them when you're hungry.

840
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,363
You didn't have to.

841
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:52,823
Thank you.

842
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,200
Good night.

843
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,326
You too. Go on now.

844
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,385
You must be Ye-won.

845
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,805
Seung-jae told me a lot about you.

846
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,100
Who are you?

847
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,187
Seung-jae's academy teacher.

848
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,190
My back.

849
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,235
What a crybaby.

850
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,487
One would think you washed
all the dishes in the village.

851
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,156
I was very sheltered.

852
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,532
I can tell.

853
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,409
You look rich.

854
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,411
And you look very hip.

855
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,495
Me?

856
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,999
I'm different from what I look like.

857
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,919
Me too.

858
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,011
My mom

859
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,597
passed away from cancer a few years ago.

860
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,270
I thought she threw this away.

861
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,647
But you still have it.

862
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,900
My mom gave this to my sister.

863
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,070
But Ye-won…

864
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:18,158
She resented Mom,
saying she abandoned her.

865
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,455
Other kids have moms
who come pick them up after school

866
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,625
and prepare birthday parties for them.

867
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,337
But I

868
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,757
have no mom at home.

869
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,426
You have your brother.

870
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,929
And you have your dad.

871
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:42,265
Dad's always off on a business trip.

872
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:43,683
And my brother…

873
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,814
He goes to school and the academy
as if nothing is wrong,

874
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,649
even though Mom's not here.

875
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,278
Going to college must be
more important to him than Mom.

876
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,282
That's why he's unfazed.

877
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,621
That's what I thought.

878
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,626
Ye-won would skip school,

879
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,755
and Dad always drank and cried.

880
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,260
If I also broke down,

881
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,389
that would make my mom sad.

882
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,891
It's not her fault that she got sick.

883
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,562
So I figured if I continued to do well,

884
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,232
Ye-won and Dad might go back
to the way they were.

885
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,318
That's why Seung-jae

886
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,863
suppressed his sadness

887
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,741
and wanted to be a good brother to you.

888
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,996
So he skipped his academy…

889
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,167
and came to get me.

890
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:52,836
Yes.

891
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:59,259
You were far more important to him
than college.

892
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:05,932
All this time,

893
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,686
I thought she hated Mom.

894
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:28,955
I knew then that Mom
was very important to Ye-won.

895
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,252
She was just hurt.

896
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,464
I was such an idiot.

897
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,675
I didn't know.

898
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,348
I was so angry she didn't attend
Mom's memorial service

899
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,351
I told her she wasn't family anymore.

900
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,353
He said

901
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,980
he was very sorry…

902
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,943
for saying that to you.

903
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,200
I'm the one who was wrong.

904
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,956
I should tell him

905
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,833
when I meet him later.

906
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,300
I can't even apologize to her now.
What do I do?

907
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,723
You protected her.

908
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,685
That's good enough.

909
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,272
You've had a hard life.

910
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,866
I had fun today though.

911
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,829
I didn't have to worry about my family
and enjoyed a homemade meal.

912
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,082
I also had fun
playing basketball with you.

913
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,295
Let's play again next week.

914
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,255
I won't go easy on you.

915
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,883
Come at me anytime.

916
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,933
There are so many stars here.

917
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,311
Right?

918
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,240
Police. Don't move.

919
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,577
Who are you?

920
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,371
Put out that fire.

921
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:16,790
Put it out!

922
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,592
Who are you?

923
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,533
-Damn it!
-Lee Tae-hyun.

924
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,827
You're under arrest for murder
and abandonment of Min Seung-jae's body.

925
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,245
Let go of me.

926
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:04,838
Over there somewhere

927
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,340
is my mom, I think.

928
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,761
I should tell her when I see her.

929
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,433
That Ye-won kept her bracelet safe.

930
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,520
And…

931
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,400
that I missed her so much.

932
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,592
I feel strange.

933
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,727
I guess we can't play next week.

934
00:58:58,993 --> 00:58:59,827
Mom.

935
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,330
I love you.

936
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,719
Day 10,881.

937
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,474
A boy named Seung-jae came

938
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,310
and left in just two days.

939
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,069
Seung-jae was such a good boy.

940
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,533
He safely moved on.

941
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,205
We found this.

942
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,491
But I'm worried again

943
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,785
about those who are left.

944
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,375
You can always feel the empty space.

945
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,170
I feel a bit lonely already.

946
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,089
But regardless of it all,

947
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,550
we'll take care of our own worries.

948
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,012
I just hope that Seung-jae
went to a good place

949
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,056
and that he will be happy forever.

950
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:55,693
MIN SEUNG-JAE

951
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,739
I've grown quite attached to him
in just two days.

952
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,789
Anyway…

953
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,583
it's good to have those alive helping us.

954
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,796
Even though I shamelessly
asked for their help…

955
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,258
they really found him in two days.

956
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,139
Il-yong brought us some lucky charms.

957
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,515
Goodbye, Seung-jae.

958
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,976
Seung-jae, our good boy.

959
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:12,186
He probably went to a good place, right?

960
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,396
I'm sure.

961
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,070
Goodness. You're so…

962
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,782
What now?

963
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:27,326
You said you were off to a new start,
yet here you are.

964
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,244
Damn it.

965
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,579
New start, my foot.

966
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:33,499
We haven't even gotten started
after making up our minds.

967
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,044
Don't smile. You're annoying.

968
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,507
By the way, why isn't Ms. Lee coming?

969
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,009
I thought she was coming today.

970
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,427
I don't know.

971
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,511
Where is she?

972
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:51,184
Speak of the devil.

973
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,394
Hey, Jong-a.

974
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,689
Wook, I got the face
of Jeong-ah's kidnapper.

975
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,109
-What?
-On a street near the bridal shop.

976
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,403
He was recorded
on the dashcam of a passing car.

977
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,572
Yes, I'll take it to the police.

978
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,074
I'll be home tomorrow.

979
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,870
My eyes hurt so much
from looking at a screen all day.

980
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,372
Okay, bye.

981
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,667
Guys, call the precinct
and tell them we're coming.

982
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,055
Save me!

983
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,807
Save me! I can't die here!

984
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,099
Be quiet and listen to me.

985
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,560
Please save me! Is anyone there?

986
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,522
Save me!

987
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:42,026
Please, let me see my daughter.

988
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:43,736
Please.

989
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,905
Let me see Bo-ra just once.

990
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,032
Let me see Bo-ra just once.

991
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,409
Is anyone there?

992
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,369
Please help me!

993
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,123
If you don't want to die,

994
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,668
stay quiet.

995
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,795
Please save me!

996
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:01,712
Is anyone--

997
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:12,640
Yesterday?

998
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,600
Yes.

999
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,687
I have a lot to tell you.
I'll tell you when you get here.

1000
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,729
Okay.

1001
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:19,897
Drive safely.

1002
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:21,440
Bye.

1003
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,115
Kid.

1004
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,324
What are you doing here?

1005
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,124
You're the one who received
the Brave Citizen's Award, right?

1006
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,250
That's right.

1007
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,634
Welcome. You're at the right place.

1008
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:52,263
It's not easy to catch a phone scammer.

1009
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:56,017
I can't do the interview here,
but there's a bread shop nearby. Let's go.

1010
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,019
Dad.

1011
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,146
I said "bread."

1012
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:10,740
Dad.

1013
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,620
Who?

1014
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:16,537
Me?

1015
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,664
Yes.

1016
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,582
Dad.

1017
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,695
Does Se-yeong, your mom, know you're here?

1018
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,364
May I stay here for a while?

1019
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,449
But you sent Hyeon-ji on her way.

1020
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,576
She's not here anymore.

1021
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,494
Hyeon-ji.

1022
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,165
-Bo-ra? This is Mom.
-Mun Se-yeong?

1023
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:04,335
She sounded anxious,
as if she was being chased.

1024
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,421
Then Mun Se-yeong was kidnapped?

1025
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,298
We may be able to save this woman.

1026
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,842
This is where Se-yeong was held?

1027
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,553
It's been two years, right?

1028
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,098
Approaching me was
part of your plan, right?

1029
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:18,891
Who are you?

1030
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:23,938
