Missing: The Other Side

2
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,390
Moochang Expressway Groundbreaking

3
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,726
There's a person here! A person!

4
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,136
There's a person!

5
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,436
Why is there a person here?

6
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,010
Come here! There's a person!

7
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,786
I'll explain everything, so...

8
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,590
Go away.

9
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,256
My wife killed me. All the
people in this village are dead.

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,586
A person died last night as well.

11
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,756
Where's Ha Neul?

12
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,360
If you're able to leave this village,
you should never return.

13
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,250
- No, that is...
- Don't come close to me!

14
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,040
Uncle, when are we going to see Mom?

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Ha Neul... are you...

16
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,050
dead?

17
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,530
Uncle?

18
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,410
Uncle...

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,606
That's not the case,
is it? You're not, are you?

20
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,590
Get up.

21
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,416
I said get up.

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,740
You were here!

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,940
Ha Neul and the hyung are both here.

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,480
Hey, who are you? Why do you
keep lingering around the kid?

25
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,850
Are you also... dead?

26
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,146
You've been walking around the neighborhood
without knowing that this whole time?

27
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,036
Why don't you try yelling at me
with your glaring eyes like earlier?

28
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,316
Jin Soo's mom,
stop that. He's not in his right mind.

29
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,085
Get up.

30
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:16,416
I don't care if he's
in his right mind or not.

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,106
You too,
Mr. Jang. You can't just protect anyone.

32
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,766
Do you know how worried I
was he would harm the child?

33
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,206
Nobody here died without a story.

34
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,216
Instead of causing a ruckus,
just disappear quietly.

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,370
Ha Neul, let's go.

36
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:44,380
It's crazy. You're all crazy!

37
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,836
Hyung,
I heard you found Ha Neul's kidnapper.

38
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,086
Listen to this.

39
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,136
This is the police station right?
I'm calling about a missing child.

40
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,456
A missing child? What's his name?

41
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,866
Ha Neul. Seo Ha Neul.

42
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,786
- And the location?
- What's the name of that village?

43
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,046
- Duon. - Duon village.
- Are you sure?

44
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,626
I'm certain. I was with him yesterday! Oh,
right.

45
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,147
He also has a stitch-like
scar on his left wrist.

46
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:23,916
We'll take your
report for now...

47
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,066
A navy-colored shirt, white sneakers,

48
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,930
a preschool backpack,
and a mole on his left hand. But a scar?

49
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,536
There wasn't any mention of a
scar before. Not even I knew about it.

50
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,306
Did you confirm with Ha Neul's mom?

51
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,616
Yes. She says he got it recently,

52
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,276
but she was so out of it
and she forgot about it.

53
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,176
If he knows about the scar, then we
can know for certain he was with the kid.

54
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,400
What about the reporter?

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,678
As soon as he got on the bus,

56
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:51,804
he borrowed the bus driver's phone to
make the report and got off right away.

57
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,310
Isn't that suspicious?

58
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,886
This is a village where such people live.

59
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,486
They're dead,
but they don't know where their bodies are.

60
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,160
Those poor people live here.

61
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,936
So all those people are dead,

62
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,660
but you and I are alive?

63
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,456
Are you crazy? You want me to believe that?

64
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,926
Yes. I'm crazy.

65
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,549
One crazy bastard would've been enough,
but

66
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,316
then you showed up
so I'm really going crazy.

67
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,636
If you're going to get crazy,
you should do it beautifully.

68
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,880
Is this some kind of cult?
I'm going to report all of you!

69
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,586
Why won't the police come? I made
my report on Ha Neul a few hours ago.

70
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,116
- It's no use because they can't see it.
- Pardon?

71
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,476
Those who are alive cannot see the dead.

72
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,160
Then what did I see earlier?

73
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,926
Can you stop scamming me? I've
already gone through all kinds of things.

74
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,876
If you can't believe it even after you've
seen it, do you think they'll believe it?

75
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,386
They can't even see it.

76
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,846
That's what I'm saying!
If they can't see it,

77
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,310
why can I?

78
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:57,330
Missing: The Other Side

79
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,526
Episode 2

80
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,646
Who is it?

81
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,530
Is Mr. Kang Myeong Jin home?

82
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,486
What's going on?

83
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,156
We're the police. By any chance,

84
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,700
can you recognize this woman?

85
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,436
Then... what about this?

86
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,516
Delivery Label
Receiver: Kang Myeong Jin

87
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,497
What about it?

88
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:22,846
I was also curious.

89
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,116
Why was this near a
freezer with a body in it?

90
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,710
Did you drop it there on accident?

91
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,400
So...

92
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,346
How could a delivery label be evidence?

93
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,206
It can't. But thanks to your name
and contact information written here,

94
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,629
we were able to check your
whereabouts from a year ago

95
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:48,936
Here's a search warrant,
if you care.

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,296
Okay. Let's go over the
specifics at the station.

97
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,166
I also have lots of
things I want to ask you.

98
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,381
Kang Myong Jin,
you are under arrest on charges of

99
00:07:57,405 --> 00:07:59,706
killing Kim Mi Ok and
abandoning her body. Take him.

100
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,558
Make sure you give him his Miranda
rights on the way to the police station

101
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,326
Otherwise we'll get complaints.

102
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,850
Okay.

103
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,226
It's quite cute, though he's a killer.

104
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,700
His tastes are quite... unique.

105
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,856
- Take him to the investigation room.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,546
Good work. Great work. Wow,
arresting the criminal within 5 days.

107
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,996
Goodness, I can finally
boast in front of the reporters.

108
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,256
Sin Joon Ho, this punk is so lucky.

109
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,696
How did he see the delivery label that
even the crime scene investigators missed?

110
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,386
That's skills, not luck.

111
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,703
The delivery label was just the start.

112
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:10,466
Going through the investigation
to find the culprit was all me.

113
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,936
You're right. Anyway,
since we caught the criminal,

114
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,866
- Detective Bok, finish it.
- What?

115
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,042
And Detective Sin,
go to the missing person's team

116
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,656
at the main office
and work with them.

117
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,738
Missing Persons Team?

118
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,586
He just caught a murderer,
but you're sending him where?

119
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,286
And he won't go to the
missing persons team.

120
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,386
He said the results were poor there
and it wouldn't help get him promoted.

121
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,850
You saw the news, right? They've found
a suspect for the kidnapping of a child.

122
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,976
It's urgent. It's an order from above.

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,790
I understand.

124
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,230
What a spiteful punk.

125
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,140
Human remains found at site of ground
breaking ceremony for Moochang Expressway

126
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,486
If only his bones were found, that means
it's been quite a while since he died.

127
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,696
Skeleton of person caught
on blade of fork crane.

128
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,805
I just said the construction on
the expressway was starting.

129
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:10,136
I didn't say your
wife had killed you.

130
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,016
I'm telling you it's true
the woman killed me!

131
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,924
They're dead,
but they don't know where their bodies are.

132
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,866
Those poor people live here.

133
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,600
Choi Mi Ja

134
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,396
No. There's no such a place.

135
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,430
Seo Ha Neul

136
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,231
This is the CCTV footage from the
bus. Since his face is shown here,

137
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:47,776
let's just hit him with
a fugitive warrant.

138
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,918
Hit him with what? We
can't know for certain

139
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,846
whether or not he's
the real kidnapper.

140
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,466
Right, we don't know.

141
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,134
Then why would be call
without identifying himself

142
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:56,696
from someone else's
phone before disappearing?

143
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,546
On top of that,
he knows of a scar only the parent knows.

144
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,656
I'm certain he was with Ha Neul.

145
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,691
I understand that,
but what if we publish a fugitive warrant

146
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:05,816
without any evidence and later
find out he isn't the criminal?

147
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,536
We can compensate him, or apologize.

148
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,258
We can figure that out later. But
right now, we need to find the kid

149
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:14,554
What's more important
than that right now?

150
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,646
Let's take a look at his face.

151
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,956
We can check his profile and see
if he has any previous convictions.

152
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,486
Hello?

153
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,246
Hello, I'm Detective Sin Joon Ho.

154
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,910
Welcome in!

155
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,956
I'm Team Leader Im Hwan
Sik. This is Detective Baek Il Doo.

156
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,036
I've heard a lot about you from Choi
sunbae. I heard you're quite good.

157
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,006
He's the detective we'll be working
together with for Ha Neul's case.

158
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,706
Working together? Who asked for that?

159
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,544
This punk doesn't
care about the victim.

160
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:54,286
He only cared about catching
the criminal to get a promotion.

161
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,841
I heard there's a suspect now.

162
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:58,824
If we catch the criminal,
won't we also find the victim?

163
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,806
That's true.

164
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,376
Use any means necessary
to just find the kid.

165
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,916
Oh, right. Kim Mi Ho, the lady that was
found in the freezer. He found her killer.

166
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,246
You caught him?

167
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,146
Is it him, Ha Neul's suspected kidnapper?

168
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,360
One moment please.

169
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,226
Hey, Mr. Kim Seok Ho. They're calling you.

170
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,640
- Me?
- Yes.

171
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,896
It's him.

172
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,506
Why, does he look familiar?
Does he have previous convictions?

173
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,016
A few days ago, this man jumped in
front of my car and caused an accident.

174
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,376
- When was that?
- The day Ha Neul went missing.

175
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,396
Give me that.

176
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,280
[Kim Seok Ho]

177
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,136
What the heck? The number doesn't exist.

178
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,536
What?

179
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,496
It really exists!

180
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,946
There are houses there and a
playground. Tons of pretty flowers, too!

181
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,716
Oh, Hawaii! The cafe! I saw Ha
Neul on the second floor there.

182
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,396
What cafe are you talking about?

183
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,906
Someone called yesterday saying
they saw Ha Neul in that neighborhood!

184
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,680
That was me! I just came from there.

185
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,736
I'm not crazy.

186
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,570
Can you please have a seat and wait a bit?

187
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,670
Duon Village

188
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,740
Hey. Where's Ha Neul?

189
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,496
- You hit me last ti-
- Who hit you?

190
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,896
You jumped in front of my car.

191
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,640
Where's Ha Neul, you bastard?

192
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,966
This is so tiring.

193
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,156
It's like I'm talking to a rock.

194
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,456
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

195
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,076
When I think of that day...

196
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,776
On that day,
I was kidnapped by some scary people,

197
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,256
fell off a cliff,
and gained consciousness in two days.

198
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,736
I went to the cafe there and met Ha Neul.

199
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,236
That's why I reported it!

200
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,266
The Duon Village you speak of? There
are no cafes there, it's just a forest.

201
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,796
There's one house there,
and I know the homeowner quite well.

202
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,136
That man lives alone, and he would
never do anything to harm a child.

203
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,336
Then do I look like someone who
would harm a child? With this face?

204
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,326
I'm telling you,
I saw more than 30 people there.

205
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,116
Goodness, hey! That's just a forest!
Why do you keep speaking nonsense?

206
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,054
If you think I'm speaking nonsense,
then you should just ignore me!

207
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,514
Why are you
arguing with me here?

208
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,186
How did you know about
the scar on Ha Neul's wrist?

209
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,386
Because I saw it!

210
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,566
Where did you see him?
Where is Ha Neul right now!

211
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,866
I'm telling you he's there!

212
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,396
At Du! On! Vill! Age!

213
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,086
- Dammit, this little bastard...
- Let's stop.

214
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,910
Let's go.

215
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,140
Just you wait.

216
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,826
I don't think he's lying.

217
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,566
Detective Sin, not you too.

218
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,496
He fell off a cliff, and Ha Neul just
happened to be there? You believe this?

219
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,406
I don't.

220
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,810
But I think that person does believe it.

221
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,560
This way.

222
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,746
Huh?

223
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,520
Right over there.

224
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,506
Where?

225
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,306
You mean the forest over there?

226
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,926
We've been searching since last night,
but found nothing.

227
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,460
No, not the trees. That village!

228
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,736
Don't you see the homes and the playground,
the people walking around?

229
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,930
Ha Neul is over there.

230
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,186
Ha Neul kept crying
about wanting to see his

231
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,426
mom so I promised
I'd take him to see her,

232
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,066
and that's when I saw
the scar on his wrist.

233
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,866
You said you saw the scar over there?

234
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,406
Yes, because Ha Neul was there,
I saw it there!

235
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,846
You bastard. If you're just acting crazy,
I'll kill you myself.

236
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,160
I'm not the only one that saw it.

237
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,300
What are you saying?
Who else saw it with you?

238
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,876
He must have been shocked to see
someone disappear right before your eyes.

239
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,506
It was extraordinary. He
said he was out of his mind,

240
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,336
and that we were a cult.

241
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,906
Did he really leave this time?

242
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,284
After seeing what he saw, would he return?

243
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,624
I called a taxi in the morning
and he never even looked back.

244
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,266
- What is it?
- What about Ha Neul?

245
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,056
He was so special that he
hid him in a bag to take him.

246
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,136
Was it easy to leave
pretending not to know?

247
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,906
Well, it's sad,
but what could he do? He's already dead.

248
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,166
Don't worry, he won't be back.

249
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,836
Eventually the car came back.

250
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,820
You too.

251
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,740
It was like seeing you ten years ago.

252
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,116
Where have you been?

253
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,036
Did something happen that
Detective Baek didn't contact me?

254
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,246
I didn't even see
his car on the road.

255
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,176
A patrol car took him.

256
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,126
Why did you come again?

257
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,606
Do you know him?

258
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,870
He had a fall on the mountain. I brought
him and took care of him for a few days.

259
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,676
- When was that?
- Was it three or four days?

260
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,230
Ahjushi, you must tell them.
That Ha Neul was in this vicinity.

261
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,830
Detective Baek, talk with me for a bit.

262
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,906
He's out of his mind.

263
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:32,286
For two days straight he just slept. As
soon as he work up he was talking nonsense.

264
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,246
The day before yesterday a suitcase was in
the yard and I wondered what was going on.

265
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,281
Did he want to take
the cabbages and dried

266
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:40,576
persimmons that the senile
grandmother gave me?

267
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,766
So I opened the bag
and it was full of rocks.

268
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,360
I feel sorry for the
young guy. He must have

269
00:18:47,384 --> 00:18:49,806
hurt his head when
he fell off the cliff.

270
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,806
When it tell him to go home, he comes back.

271
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,946
I told him to go to the hospital
and he comes right back.

272
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,566
What happened? Did he have
a accident as soon as he left?

273
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,596
He knew about the scar on Ha Neul,
who is missing. It's not publicized.

274
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,076
It's 100% proof that he saw him.

275
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,696
He could have seen him or he
could have been seeing things.

276
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,780
Jeez.

277
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,240
Even a dog's feels calm
when she's with her pups.

278
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,630
How bad Ha Neul's parents must feel.

279
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,840
Let's go.

280
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,950
Hey.

281
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,536
If your alibi is confirmed,
I will release you.

282
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,536
Look at these guys. These pups.

283
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,306
Where did you come from?

284
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,786
Why puppies?

285
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,214
I heard if puppies
are deprived of their

286
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:43,876
mother too early,
they have a lot of diseases.

287
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,300
Kids, are you okay? Are you okay?

288
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,220
- Where did your mom go?
- She is here. Here is the mom

289
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,256
Hey. Besides the two puppies,
is there another dog here?

290
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,606
This is her. Can't you see her here?

291
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,390
She is so big. Jeez.

292
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,766
I told you. You're going to be busy.

293
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,906
What do you mean?

294
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,636
Don't come back. Be
sure to go to a hospital.

295
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,436
What do you mean, a hospital?

296
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,646
Ahjussi. You're telling lies.

297
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,126
Call Police officer Kim and
tell him to come this way.

298
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,236
If he walks slowly, we will meet him.

299
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,486
Let's go.

300
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,046
- Go with us.
- We're going. We're going.

301
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,786
- Let go of me.

302
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,886
You know Ha Neul is here right now.

303
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,896
- All right, all right.
- I'm sayin I'm not crazy.

304
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,836
Quickly.

305
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,670
Let's go.

306
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,130
- Please drink this.
- Thank you.

307
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,786
We've confirmed his alibi.

308
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,542
At the time Ha Neul went missing,
we found

309
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,486
CCTV footage of him at
the Sangwondong market,

310
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,286
which corresponds with the most
recent records of his phone's GPS location.

311
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:19,716
So at the time that Ha Neul was kidnapped,
Kim Wook was at least 25 km away from him.

312
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,506
I heard a gangster kidnapped him?

313
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,636
Right,
that was near a rift valley in Sangwon

314
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,006
but there wasn't any footage of that
because it's a blind spot in CCTV coverage.

315
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,017
After that,
he lost consciousness for two days

316
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,506
and appeared from
Jang Pan Seok's home?

317
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,136
See? What would've happened if
we had released that fugitive warrant?

318
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,346
I mean, then we would've
ruled him out as a suspect.

319
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,526
You've removed the chariot and the canon,
when are we going to find the kid?

320
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,936
The reason why Kim Wook
knew about Ha Neul's scar

321
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,220
is still a mystery.

322
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,856
Korea's police sure are problematic,

323
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,526
trying to accuse an innocent
civilian as a kidnapper.

324
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,210
They still talk big after doing that.

325
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,796
You may not be the kidnapper,
but you're not just an innocent civilian.

326
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,776
Isn't that so, Mr. Fake Kim Seok Hoon?

327
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,476
Is your speciality insisting the
conclusions you draw are true, Detective?

328
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,766
As a public officer? You're
supposed to protect me.

329
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,156
Let go. Let go!

330
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,236
I'll let you go for now.

331
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,150
Let's meet again.

332
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,296
Are you threatening me right now?

333
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,006
I haven't even settled to the terms for the
car accident. I won't just let it slide!

334
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,490
I'm gonna get physical therapy
and endoscopies every day!

335
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,756
[Pawnshop]

336
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,736
Oppa!

337
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,206
What happened to you? Do
you know how worried I was?

338
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,926
I couldn't even contact you,
and your bracelet was left on the ground.

339
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,676
Are you hurt anywhere?

340
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,576
Are you okay?

341
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,300
Wait, wait,
let go of me. Then we can talk.

342
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,600
Here. It's a new one.

343
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,728
Have you been followed by anyone,
or receive any weird calls?

344
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:09,976
No.

345
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,676
If anything happens,

346
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,216
you have to call the police right away.

347
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,576
Okay.

348
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,306
I wonder what happened to that girl.

349
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,746
You said they forced her into the car.

350
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:27,266
I wouldn't know. They stole my phone,
so all my evidence is gone too.

351
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,616
Nam Gook, I'll sleep over again tonight.

352
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,846
I think they know where I live.
Let me create some debt to you.

353
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,466
- Where will you go tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

354
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,476
- I'll be here.
- Let's just go to my house.

355
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,326
I think my house is better than here.

356
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,866
No, I like it here. It's safe, too.

357
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,726
I'm gonna sleep now. I'm so tired.

358
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,760
Let's go, Jong Ah.

359
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,996
Have you two seen ghosts before?

360
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,256
What?

361
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,946
Ghosts? All of a sudden?

362
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,136
Hyung, you've become really
weak in the span of just a few days.

363
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,536
When you've been on the brink
of life and death, that's possible.

364
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,926
Oppa, do you see ghosts?

365
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,506
Should I ask my mom's
fortune teller for some talisman?

366
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,466
Talisman? No need, I was just curious.

367
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,916
Head home.

368
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,610
- Let's go.
- Okay.

369
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,936
- Sleep well.
- He'll be fine, come on.

370
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,956
Bye!

371
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,190
Shut the door tight behind you.

372
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,006
I don't want to go.

373
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,536
My mom said she would come!

374
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,526
Let's go.

375
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,130
My mom said she would come.

376
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,606
Are you really going to find my mom for me?

377
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,410
I promise.

378
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,860
How am I going to keep a
promise I made with a dead kid?

379
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,016
Where are you?

380
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,960
Find him.

381
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,646
Where are you?

382
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,770
Find him.

383
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,926
He's not here!

384
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,970
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

385
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,496
So you didn't see their faces?

386
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,756
No.

387
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,656
I just heard their voices, but I'm certain
they're the ones that kidnapped me.

388
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,206
Was anything taken?

389
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,826
No.

390
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,616
This is the footage from the CCTV.

391
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,466
It was so dark their
faces aren't very clear.

392
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,576
We'll report a case of burglary for now.

393
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,246
I'll also look into the
kidnapping case you mentioned.

394
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,066
Please catch them.

395
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,156
Let's leave.

396
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,456
Bye.

397
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,220
Take care.

398
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,506
Are you sure they're the
ones that kidnapped you?

399
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,456
What should I do, I feel so bad.

400
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,156
I've put you in a tight spot, too.

401
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,946
I didn't even lost anything.

402
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,686
Let's just go to my place tonight.

403
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,627
It's okay.

404
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:45,196
Why not? You almost died,

405
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,650
why don't we celebrate
your survival with drinks?

406
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,150
Shall we?

407
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,896
I said I would buy it! You
don't even have money.

408
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,676
I have lots of money.

409
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,496
Our Nam Goong has changed so much.

410
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,466
Remember when you used to pee the bed?

411
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,476
It seems like yesterday that
I changed the sheets for you.

412
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,090
I've never done that.

413
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,866
- You even pooped then, you punk.
- What are you talking about?

414
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,796
It smelled so bad,
you were about to poop in the sheets.

415
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,656
I yelled "No,
Nam Goong!" but you still did it.

416
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,336
- Why are you making up stories?
- I even have pictures!

417
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,436
- Let me see them.
- I'll show them to you.

418
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,476
I got in trouble though,
because the director thought I did it.

419
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,186
When I was young,
I did respect you, just a little bit.

420
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,266
Our Nam Goong has grown so much.

421
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,896
I have.

422
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,136
When I left the orphanage,
all I had was a box of ramen and a blanket.

423
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,176
Now I have a lease, a shop, and this watch-

424
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,080
Nam Goong.

425
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,550
What is he up to now?

426
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,156
What is it?

427
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,746
You should've come soon
after I called your name.

428
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,476
- What's the matter?
- It's them.

429
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,066
How did they know about my place?

430
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,416
Those awful bastards.

431
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,276
Hey,
you should hurry up and call the police.

432
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,086
Don't try to figure things out alone. 112,
okay.

433
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,846
Don't even go home for the time being.

434
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,406
Don't even call me.

435
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,450
Where will you go?

436
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,816
I have a place I can stay.

437
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,966
Is it safe?

438
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,486
I'm not sure if it's safe or not.

439
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,766
What the hell? Then just come with me?

440
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,316
That won't do.

441
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,646
If we stay together, you'll be in danger.

442
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:30,466
I think I'll just have to go.

443
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,186
I did feel like I left something behind.

444
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,020
Anyway,
I'm sorry about how things turned out.

445
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,860
Hey whiner, are you dead too?

446
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,826
Why are you back?

447
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,936
Is that whiner dead?

448
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,066
You came back here to ask me that?

449
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,640
Well, that amongst other reasons.

450
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,946
It must've been two months ago now.

451
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:16,036
I kept hearing some whining,

452
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,257
and I found that whiner
was carrying two pups

453
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:20,126
that hadn't even
opened their eyes yet.

454
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,196
I laid out a blanket for them,

455
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,706
and she started feeding her babies on it.

456
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,336
I thought I need to feed the mother too,

457
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,486
so I gave her some rice
gruel and she just gazed at me.

458
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,636
It must've found it
interesting that I could see her.

459
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,886
But it wasn't just me that
could see her. Her babies...

460
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,386
They can see her, too.

461
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,766
You and I,
and those pups. We must all be crazy.

462
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,766
I don't know what our deep resentment is,

463
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,200
but we can see the dead.

464
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,636
I have no deep-rooted resented.

465
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,086
Then maybe someone
harbors resentment towards you.

466
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,409
If not that,
then something must be wrong with you

467
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:07,120
because you hit your head
hard as you fell off that cliff.

468
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,566
Why didn't you tell them
earlier that Ha Neul was here?

469
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,166
When I was getting dragged away?

470
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,966
You want both of us to
be treated like we're crazy?

471
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,646
I mean, if what you're saying is true,
then Ha Neul is already dead.

472
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,896
You should tell them so
they can at least find the body.

473
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,196
There's nothing good
to come from interfering.

474
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,056
How do you know that?

475
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,206
You're just living in hiding like a coward.

476
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,116
You must harbor some resentment towards
me. Is that why you came crawling back?

477
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,756
Only you and I can see that.
Aren't you curious why we can see it?

478
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,536
I'm not curious,
so you should stop being curious as well.

479
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,796
All those people in the village
don't even know that we're alive.

480
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,066
Are we some kind of x-men, that nobody
is allowed to know our real identity?

481
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,606
What happens if they find out?

482
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,401
Don't you think all those dead
people will have unfulfilled wishes?

483
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:51,846
They'll ask us to
do this and that.

484
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,150
Do you think you could handle it?

485
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,270
Why do you live here then?

486
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,046
Since this is my house,

487
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,150
and I have nowhere else to go.

488
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,116
That's good then. I also
don't have a place to go.

489
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,680
Hey. Hey! Hey, you!

490
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,430
What? No cell service?

491
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,730
I can't believe this.

492
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,796
You even pay for it!

493
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,370
You've been paying monthly
right on time. You're so on top of it.

494
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,596
You're living the life of a spy.

495
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,716
Do you think it's an easy task,
maintaining the peace of a village?

496
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,686
Someone might think you're talking about
a nuclear bomb, not just a phone repeater.

497
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,336
What does this have to do with peace?

498
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,266
It all has something to do with peace,
you punk.

499
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,216
Why do you keep calling me punk?

500
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,690
Is my name punk?

501
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,336
What is your name?

502
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,816
Wook. It's Kim Wook.

503
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,566
Your name suits your temper.

504
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,486
Hey, hey, it's not "Wook" for temper,
but "Wook" for bright sun.

505
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,010
You don't even know, do you?

506
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,966
Don't cause trouble here.

507
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,585
The village people
already dislike you because

508
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:42,116
of the whole ruckus
you caused with Ha Neul.

509
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:48,120
Goodness, what did I do?

510
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,270
Oh, it works so well.

511
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,636
- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

512
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,896
Wait, wait. Hey, that's dirty.

513
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,670
Do you know how many germs are on rags-

514
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,610
Just sit wherever you'd like.
Ice americano with an extra shot.

515
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,230
What about your hand? Is it okay?

516
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,326
Why did you scream if you
knew it'd be fine? You scared me.

517
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,606
Would it not hurt to
get stabbed by a knife?

518
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,216
Though I won't die again because I'm
already dead, I still feel the same pain.

519
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,496
I wouldn't know that. It hasn't
been long since I've come here.

520
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,996
Let's just say all the people here
are dead. What even is this village?

521
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,096
Heaven? Hell?

522
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,346
That Jang really didn't tell you anything,
did he?

523
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,146
How disrespectful! You're so young,
Mr. Jang isn't your friend.

524
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,326
You're right, he's not my friend.

525
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,876
In both experience and age, I'm-

526
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,220
So what is this place?

527
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,936
I guess you could call it a guesthouse,
of sorts.

528
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,206
A guesthouse?

529
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,506
A place where dead ghosts meet?

530
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,236
Where wanderers stay.

531
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,776
A guesthouse, sure.

532
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,047
Those who are dead but
are missing their bodies.

533
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:59,156
The missing dead stay
here before departing.

534
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,940
Where do they go after their stay?

535
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,766
Does some grim reaper from
the sky come to take them?

536
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,860
We don't know.

537
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:18,660
They just quietly
disappear without a trace.

538
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,200
We just wait

539
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,560
until someone finds our body.

540
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,660
Then can't you go find it yourselves?

541
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,700
We can't. Only the living can do that.

542
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,900
How scared must you have been...

543
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,830
I'll take you out of there.

544
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,710
Have you been with them this whole time?

545
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,600
This bastard isn't even human. How
could they do such a horrific thing?

546
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,120
Goodbye. Rest well there.

547
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,806
Spend your days filled with laughter.

548
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,770
Yes,

549
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,410
Goodbye, Eun Ji.

550
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,696
So in other words,
this is the place for missing ghosts?

551
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,026
Goodness, I'm seeing all sorts of things.

552
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,626
- Where's Ha Neul?
- Why are you looking for him again?

553
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,826
What do you mean, why?

554
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:48,196
I miss the poor kid
who's life was cut short.

555
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,670
Who says that? That his life's over?

556
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,396
The sun rises and blows
us warm breezes here, too.

557
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,786
People gather to live together.

558
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,426
It's a very surprising place.

559
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,376
It is quite surprising

560
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,630
that the bodies of so
many children are missing.

561
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,560
It's not just children. We're innumerable.

562
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,486
How old were you when you came?

563
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,766
Twenty-two?

564
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,906
You probably haven't
even been to the military yet.

565
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,316
I couldn't go even if I wanted to.

566
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,600
Goodness,
there's an excuse for everyhing, huh?

567
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,340
Ha Neul, are you okay?

568
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,826
Why do only I keep getting unlucky?

569
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,006
Hyung, let's play one more time.

570
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,346
I want to do that too,

571
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:24,216
but I think it'll get dark soon.
Let's play again tomorrow.

572
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,816
If you don't take Ha Neul,
that lady will yell at me again.

573
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,286
Oh, Jun Soo's mom?

574
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,196
Where's Jun Soo? Does
he not like board games?

575
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,830
Jun Soo...

576
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,106
is scary.

577
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,056
Please take Ha Neul home.

578
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,716
I was about to do just that. Let's go,
Ha Neul.

579
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,690
- I'll take you home.
- Okay.

580
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:55,086
Please take a look at this. Hey.

581
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,416
What is it?

582
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,406
- Please hurry and take a look.
- What is it?

583
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,076
Ha Neul's charts.

584
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,996
I wondered why I missed the
scar that Kim Wook knew about.

585
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,296
We've already look at the charts.
We didn't know because it wasn't here.

586
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,626
Exactly. It was an injury
large enough to leave a scar,

587
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:17,480
but it wasn't on the
charts. Isn't that weird?

588
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,920
Why did you bring that?

589
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,046
You should have him. I promised you.

590
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,546
But you haven't met your mom yet.

591
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,156
You gave me a piggy-back ride last time.

592
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,660
Also,
you said you'd keep your promise anyway.

593
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,366
You're paying me in advance
so I can't even take it back.

594
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,846
Still, this is the one you like the most.

595
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,606
That's okay.

596
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,460
I have a lot of other toys.

597
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,476
Isn't this real gold?

598
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,920
Wow... This is silver!

599
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,780
Is this yours?

600
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,700
I did wrong.

601
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,936
What did you do wrong?

602
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,260
It was my bad for taking it out.

603
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,446
It's my stepdad's.

604
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:38,200
He got mad because I broke it.

605
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,306
Your stepdad?

606
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,610
I ran away because I was scared

607
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,420
but my stepdad...

608
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,296
Did he hurt you?

609
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,190
I don't remember.

610
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,520
It's okay.

611
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,296
I'll buy you an even better toy.

612
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,480
It's okay. Don't cry.

613
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,286
He fell on the stairs.

614
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:27,826
You can't see this scar when he
has clothes on, so I blanked on it.

615
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:33,136
How did you know? Did someone see Ha Neul?

616
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,630
About that...

617
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,246
There was a report-

618
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,636
Where is Ha Neul?

619
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,026
It wasn't a real one.

620
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,076
Is there anything else you've
forgotten to tell us? Please let us know.

621
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,326
We have no time. Please tell us everything.

622
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,560
Don't leave anything out.

623
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:17,686
Uhm Hyeon Seung, age 35; Died August 2005;
Unemployed; living with mother

624
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,950
Jeong Yi Hwang, 37 years old; Died
February 21, 2012; President of caffe box

625
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,106
Missing high school student found
after three months in own home

626
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,350
This man...

627
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,020
What's he up to?

628
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,446
"I have an appointment with a friend.
I'll be back." Not heard from in 11 days.

629
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,530
Police are investigating

630
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,986
Eun Ji was able to leave, thanks to you.

631
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,616
How could they do that? They dragged
that poor thing out into the woods.

632
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,306
Since the body has been found,
the criminal will be found soon.

633
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:02,436
You're the one struggling,
seeing such horrific sights all the time.

634
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,520
There's nothing good
to come from what I do.

635
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:06,720
It's not like I can bring
anyone back to life.

636
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,996
I'm not like before. I
don't have any firearms,

637
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,576
and my stamina is getting worse.

638
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,666
I wonder if I'm even of
any help here anymore.

639
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,296
Whether Eun Ji is dead
or is as good as dead,

640
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,820
thanks to her family, Ha Neul was released.

641
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,930
Why is it taking so long to load?

642
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,386
Where have you been?

643
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,976
Why do you care?

644
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,266
Can I get things delivered here?

645
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:49,006
Don't even think of getting more
stuff. It's already small enough as it is.

646
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,526
I want to buy a toy for Ha Neul.

647
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,050
Don't do anything useless.

648
00:44:54,710 --> 00:45:00,120
The things you buy are of this world,
but Ha Neul is a person of another world.

649
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,806
Jun Soo plays with his little tops.

650
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,826
Bum Soo plays board games.

651
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:12,826
Those probably all followed them here
since they used to play with it before.

652
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:16,176
Do the items you were with when
you died follow you into this village?

653
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,316
Yes.

654
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,176
When they first arrive,
they come exactly as they died.

655
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,546
As they live,

656
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:27,540
their clothes change and
their items change, too.

657
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:34,936
The moment you dies,
the items you had come with you.

658
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,806
So it's said.

659
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,450
Then Ha Neul brought something.

660
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,046
Seo Ha Neul

661
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,716
Yes, he had his kindergarten backpack.

662
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,280
Wait a sec.

663
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,176
If you can find it, then Ha Neul also...

664
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,310
it means Ha Neul can be found.

665
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,276
Customer,
isn't this the product you're looking for?

666
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,836
Yes, this is it.

667
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,456
This is the 35th anniversary
limited edition model.

668
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,496
Is it expensive?

669
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,062
The sale price was
about 20 million won.

670
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:17,166
Small and medium-sized
products will be more expensive.

671
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,916
It's such a unique model,
it's well worth the price.

672
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,766
It's a rare deal at an internet cafe.

673
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:25,056
Does it happen once or twice a year?

674
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,960
Which cafe?

675
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,410
Found it.

676
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,180
Let me see. Where is it?

677
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,128
I'm searching for the
commemorative piece for

678
00:46:44,152 --> 00:46:44,776
the 35th anniversary
of the Mobile Warrior.

679
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,370
Then should I enter using
the administrator's ID?

680
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,586
I sent a picture in the message.
How much are you willing to pay?

681
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:57,350
I made the buyer's deposit.
Why are you contacting me?

682
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,200
"The model is ruined." When
was that comment posted?

683
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,906
@megasarang I'm sorry. 2020.06.08.

684
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,290
Let me see his profile.

685
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,256
Someone invited me to lunch and
all of a sudden I'm into plastic models.

686
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,700
Please do it.

687
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,096
An Jin Ho

688
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,506
- Is the real name of this ID An Jin Ho?
- Yeah.

689
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,586
It's him, that bastard.

690
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,066
I sent the ID to his social medial account.

691
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:26,946
I'm looking for the 35th anniversary
limited edition of the Mobile Warrior.

692
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,600
A shield and two accessories.
The price is 50 million won.

693
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,620
At this price, we should catch him.

694
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,676
Yes. It wasn't a serious injury.

695
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,456
He came here with his guardian, An Jin Ho.

696
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,586
I heard he fell down the stairs.

697
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,990
From looking at the injury,
that could have happened.

698
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,400
- Do you have any other records?
- Just a moment.

699
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:58,246
He wasn't treated in our clinic.

700
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:02,660
He has a history of a dislocated
shoulder and a fracture of the femur.

701
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,400
- Then, those kinds of injuries—
Could they have been from child abuse?

702
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,400
I can't jump to such a conclusion.

703
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,900
What are you doing?

704
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,020
General, let's eat.

705
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,240
That's right.

706
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,476
Are you eating?

707
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,600
Director Nam. All right, Director Nam.

708
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,896
If Jing Jing disappears,

709
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,136
what will happen to General?

710
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,890
What else would be do? We
have to keep living, dog or human.

711
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,700
I have the accessories. It's possible
to deal directly near Jo Hyeon Station.

712
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:34,470
I want a direct deal.
When would it be possible.

713
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,220
It's possible this afternoon.

714
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,396
Yes. I caught you!

715
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,236
I found Ha Neul.

716
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,956
What's the matter with you?

717
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,990
I will drive.

718
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,836
An Jin Ho will come to
pick up the stuff today.

719
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,326
That is the murder weapon
which murdered Ha Neul.

720
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,776
Who? What stuff?

721
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,100
We needed to find that
person. We can find Ha Neul.

722
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,700
Here's the address. The car key.

723
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,856
When you find it, report it right away.

724
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,736
So why would I be the one to go?

725
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,776
It's your speciality. Did
you think I didn't know?

726
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,526
I looked through your drawer.

727
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,356
Well,
it seems you were searching for a body.

728
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,236
Even if that is so, is the perfectly
able-bodied you ordering me around?

729
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,586
I have some work to do here.

730
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,886
Quickly leave and don't think
about returning until you find Ha Neul.

731
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,830
Hey! This is my house. My house.

732
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,670
Don't let Jang Geun and
Mong Geun go hungry.

733
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,986
Was the search warrant
for An Jin Ho issued?

734
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,476
I've been waiting and
am on my way to court.

735
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,820
Call me when you have it.

736
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:18,290
The telephone is turned off.

737
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,196
Yes. It's Sin Jin Ho.

738
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:29,146
You know me,
right? Kim Wook. Let's meet for a while.

739
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:32,146
Why? What other nonsense
do you want to say?

740
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,960
I'll tell you who killed Ha Neul.

741
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,940
Where are you?

742
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,080
No.

743
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:46,126
I won again.

744
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:49,986
No. I won't do it. I always lose.

745
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:53,306
Let's play the top game.
I'm confident I can win.

746
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,336
Joon Soo has the top.

747
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,216
Then ask him to play with us.

748
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,236
Yes. I'll get him. Let's
meet on the playground.

749
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,020
Sure. Sure.

750
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,896
Let's go, the two of us.

751
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,580
Yes.

752
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,820
Upsy daisy.

753
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,200
The playground is that way.

754
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,610
Do you remember what I promised you?

755
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:07,526
I told you I'd bring you to your mom.

756
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,736
Are we on the way to see mom right now?

757
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,846
Yes.

758
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,490
Let's go, hurry!

759
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,350
It makes you this happy?

760
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,990
Detective Baek Il Doo.

761
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,570
Where is this place?

762
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:38,750
The place we agreed to meet
with the informant is around here.

763
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:46,110
We'll be able to find my Ha Neul, right?

764
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:54,376
Ha Neul. What do you want to
say when you see your mom?

765
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,010
I want to tell her about
the spinning-top game

766
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:59,556
and when I played the
pirates game with you.

767
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,666
I had so much fun.

768
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:04,950
I won three times, didn't I?

769
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:08,166
And what else?

770
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:13,910
I will tell her that even though I missed
her a lot, I held it in and didn't cry.

771
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,330
And what else?

772
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,710
Ha Neul is a small puppy.

773
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,706
What's that?

774
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:35,446
Mom always calls me "My small
puppy" when she praises me.

775
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,366
Even though I'm neither small nor a puppy.

776
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:44,220
But today,
it's fine even if she calls me baby puppy.

777
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,430
This rascal.

778
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,356
Is it that person?

779
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,110
Yes.

780
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:10,136
It's mom.

781
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,070
Uncle, it's my mom.

782
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:19,650
I told I'd bring you back to your mom.

783
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,366
I kept my promise.

784
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,260
Yes.

785
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,430
Mom! Mom!

786
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:39,990
Mom!

787
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,720
Excuse me, please stay here just a minute.

788
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:35,786
"Find the culprit who killed Ha Neul"?

789
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,430
You're saying Ha Neul died?

790
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,680
If you're just talking nonsense
this time again, I'll end you.

791
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,900
It's not nonsense.

792
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,090
What was that? Say it again.

793
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,860
Did you see my Ha Neul?

794
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,496
Yes.

795
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,946
Where is he?

796
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:22,280
Where is he now?

797
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,390
He said that in the past,

798
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:36,246
you praised him for
doing very well in a game,

799
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:44,270
and called him... "my small puppy".

800
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,420
Ha Neul...

801
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,590
Madam.

802
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:08,900
We... found Ha Neul.

803
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:36,306
The child who went missing on
the 8th of this month, Seo Ha Neul,

804
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:37,412
has been discovered as
a corpse ten days later.

805
01:00:37,436 --> 01:00:38,926
[Looking for a missing child.
Seo Ha Neul. 2020.06.08]

806
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:43,226
His body was found in a water tank
on the rooftop of his home building.

807
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,406
The culprit is the adoptive father, Mr. An.

808
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,966
Mr. An? The police is investigating
the exact motive behind the murder.

809
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:51,306
An Jin Ho?

810
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:52,746
What's going on?

811
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:56,256
Did Oppa Wook catch that man, then?

812
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,680
Amazing.

813
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:13,936
You've eaten more than one
kilogram of pork all by yourself.

814
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,820
What? You also ate some!

815
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,646
We finished everything?

816
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:26,330
It seemed like we had bought a lot earlier,
though.

817
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,330
Are you asleep?

818
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,530
Yes.

819
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:42,390
How did you find Ha Neul?

820
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,600
You told me.

821
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,026
I did?

822
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:54,020
You said they come with the stuff
they had close to them when they died.

823
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:57,660
That's how I found him.

824
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,450
I only told you that and
you caught the culprit.

825
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,960
Did you come back here because of Ha Neul?

826
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,966
No.

827
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:12,790
Then why did you look for Ha Neul?

828
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:20,210
Ouch, my stomach. Ouch.

829
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:24,420
That's why you should have eaten less.

830
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,970
Do you want me to prick your hand?

831
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,830
Bathroom, bathroom.

832
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:12,456
Ha Neul. What do you want to
say when you see your mom?

833
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,257
I want to tell her about
the spinning-top game

834
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:16,006
and when I played the
pirates game with you.

835
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,720
I had so much fun.

836
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,370
Me too.

837
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:05,990
An Jin Ho confessed to his crime.

838
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,936
And here I thought you'd tell me about
how you caught the guys who abducted me.

839
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,496
We also get the news in the country-side,
you know.

840
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,776
Why would you come all the
way here just to tell me that.

841
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,466
How did you know about Ha Neul's wound?

842
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:22,836
I told you. I saw it.

843
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:27,996
The aftereffects of a car accident are this
scary. I keep seeing and hearing things.

844
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,813
We found the online ID
of someone wanting to

845
01:04:29,837 --> 01:04:31,776
buy parts of plastic
model toys from An Jin Ho.

846
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,066
They exchanged messages using ghost IDs,

847
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:37,466
and on the day they had set for the trade,
you, Kim Wook,

848
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:41,926
called me here and said you had
found Ha Neul's body. At exactly that time,

849
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:44,096
Ha Neul's body was discovered.

850
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:49,476
That means you knew that An Jin Ho would
go to the place where he had left the body.

851
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:54,096
There's more. The reason why An Jin
Ho had no choice but to accept the deal.

852
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,896
He received a threatening message.

853
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,360
"I know that you are Ha Neul's murderer,
so you better get the money ready."

854
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,596
You're the one who did all that, right?

855
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:08,236
I told you it's not me. You're
accusing an innocent person.

856
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,972
Do the police have this
much free time on their hands?

857
01:05:10,997 --> 01:05:13,224
If you aren't here to get me,
I'll get going.

858
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,340
I've seen her somewhere for sure.

859
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,260
Is something wrong?

860
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,780
Do you know that man?

861
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,970
Oppa!

862
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,536
Save me!

863
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,156
Save me!

864
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,150
It's her.

865
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:17,750
Oppa!

866
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,610
Oppa, it's me!

867
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,330
Missing: The Other Side

868
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,376
I came here because of that girl.

869
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,566
Who is that girl you are talking about?

870
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:54,936
There's Yeo Na's number on Jang
Myeong Jae's phone call records.

871
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,266
You must have many
questions. I'll explain on the way.

872
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:59,486
But you said no one knows we are alive.

873
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,466
Do you think you can find the
survivors from back then in this picture?

874
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:03,936
I will leave this place.

875
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,376
That's also what I want to know: is Kim
Nam Gook a bad guy, or is he in danger?

876
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,120
It's an emergency! Can't you see?
