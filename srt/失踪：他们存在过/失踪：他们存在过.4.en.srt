We've had a hard time to find Kim Nam Gook.

There won't be any backfire from this,

Things at our end are already
getting wrapped up, so don't worry.

7
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,850
You'd better take care of your end.

8

9
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,805

I'm sorry for your loss.

11

Why those bastards killed Nam Gook...

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,570
What was the reason?

13
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,226
Who are "those bastards"?

14
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,736
The bastards who kidnapped me

15
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,110

Who those bastards are,

17

and why, why they did that....

18

19
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,986
I put a GPS tracker under their car.

20
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,446
Hurry up and trace it.

21
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,040
Send me its location link to me,
please. Right away, okay?

22

23

Slowly get out of the car and
let me see both of your hands up.

25
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,000
Y-Yes... I'm just a delivery guy...

26

I haven't seen his face.

27
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,516
When I went to the public parking
lot where we supposed to meet,

28
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,836
there was only the car parked.

29
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,416
But you still must have
contacted with this guy.

30
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,550
I only got text messages.

[The Late Oh Yoon Gyeong]

41
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,160
Something came up suddenly,

42
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,240
so I'm late to come here by a few days.

43
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,230
Sorry.

44
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,136
And... I came alone this year again.

45
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,830
Every year I've promised you that I
would come with our Hyeon Ji the next time,

46
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,356
so there are so many things
I have to apologize to you for.

47
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,680
Next year,
I will come here with our Hyeon Ji.

48
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,476
Today I even shaved and put
something on my hair too. How do I look?

49
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,730
I was pretty handsome at that time,

50
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,462
but these days,
I'm a country bumpkin.

51
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:15,894
I've gotten quite old,
haven't I?

I can't go to you yet.

54
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,720
I can't leave our Hyeon Ji behind,

55
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,670
You understand me, right?

56
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,046
Wook! I bought your favorite thing, meat!

57
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,400
Eat this up and cheer yourself up.

58
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,956
They say that an alive person is
better than a dead prime minister.

59
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,326
You should get back to your feet

60
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,476
so that you can catch the
bastards who killed your friend,

61
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,170
and also make the bastard
like Woo Il Seok leave too!

62
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,896
Well, I'm not scolding you here.

63
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,750
It's just because here are tons of people
who couldn't even have their own funerals.

64
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,826
He has been skipping meals.

65
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,980
Did he perhaps pass out?

66
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,480
Are you pooping?

67
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,946
Where did he go?

68
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,656
As I was so curious who killed Kim Mi Ok,
the person I've been searching for a year,

69
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,186
I came here to see your face.

70
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,120
You look great, eh?

71
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,510
You must have been brazen enough to enjoy
your meals and sleeps this whole time.

72
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,446
During this whole time, Kim Mi Ok's
family have been suffering so much.

73
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,546
Why did you do that?

74
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,420
What did this woman have
anything to do with you?

75
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,460
Are you laughing?

76
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,260
How could you laugh?

77
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,020
I'm asking you,
why did you bastard kill her?!

78
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,950
Because I absolutely couldn't quit.

79
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,390
I came here to find you.

80
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,756
Is it something urgent?

81
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,160
Yes, sir.

82
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,150
What is it? What made you
come all the way here to find me?

83
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,386
I'd like to file a report of disappearance.

84
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,216
A report of disappearance?

85
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,030
Please help me.

86
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,905
Choi Yeo Na, 29 years old,
worked as a curator

87
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,106
at a gallery but quit
a couple months ago.

88
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,776
She has neither criminal records
nor any medical conditions.

89
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,996
How about her family?

90
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,606
She has none.

91
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,866
She grew up at an orphanage.

92
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,466
Recently, while preparing our wedding,
we had a few quarrels,

93
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,686
so I assumed this time
was also the same case.

94
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,026
I was too busy with my cases too.

95
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,486
Have you visited her place?

96
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,836
There was no sign of forced entry, and the
food she was having remained on the table.

97
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,086
Her wallet and passport were all there, and
the only thing missing was her cell phone.

98
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,116
What about the CCTV?

99
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,596
Her going inside her apartment was filmed,
but no footage of her coming out of it.

100
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,096
About for 6 hours the next day,
the video footage record is missing,

101
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,276
and that's because its power was
turned off for regular maintenance.

102
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,966
I've also looked through all the
CCTVs around her apartment building,

103
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,496
but couldn't find anything.

104
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,246
You're thinking this is not a
simple missing case, aren't you?

105
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,856
Yes. There were two murder cases recently,

106
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,026
and the victims had
phone calls with each other.

107
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,596
There is also a record that Yeo Na
had a call with one of those victims.

108
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,166
It seems that this is a case
under Violent Crime unit.

109
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,536
But even those two cases are disguised as
a simple mugging case and a car accident,

110
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,436
so it's insufficient to tie
them as a serial murder.

111
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,070
However, I believe all these three
cases are connected to each other.

112
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,146
For murder cases, you Violent Crime
unit will take care of them anyway.

113
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,956
So let's do our own job for the other one.

114
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,596
It would be better if this
is just a runaway case,

115
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,445
but if this is connected to
the other cases as you said,

116
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:28,156

the culprits must have been on move.

117

- It is really nice.
- Right?

120
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,426
I'm thinking to change the musics too.

121
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,340

I could feel that

122
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:17,156

boss is so outdated.

I think so.

By any chance,
is there any specific time to come in?

131
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,336
No, there is no such thing. The
order of this town isn't up to our wills.

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,298
But you told me that your
parents were so happy to

174
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:07,496
throw a huge party when
you became a civil servant.

175
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,256
My mom and dad are healthy,
so I can be filial to them later.

176
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,860
But as for Oppa Nam Gook, he died unfairly.

177
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,340
We need to find those
bastards who killed him.

178
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:27,810
And this place, its every nook and
corner has the trace of Oppa Nam Gook.

179
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,670
It's the hangout place for
us the Three Musketeers too.

180
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,336
Alright. You quit that stable job,

181
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,616
so good luck, President Lee.

182
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,540
Ah, right.

183
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,766
I got the list of phone call records
from Oppa Nam Gook's phone.

184
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,626
[Calling History]

185
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,526
He did make a lot of phone calls.

186
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,956
[checked - Jang Myeong Gyoo]

187
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,626
What's this? Who is it?

188
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,556
The friend from his orphanage you
mentioned before, I think this is him.

189
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,096
He's a news reporter,
but died a few days ago.

190
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,156
He died?

191
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,766
Yes, by a mugging motorbike.

192
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,556
Please wait for a bit.

193
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,036
Other than Kim Nam Gook,
there are more victims,

194
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,256
and this is an important
case to me as well.

195
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,257
The orphanage,
where Nam Gook lived when he was

196
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:21,616
little, was burnt down and
he was moved to another one,

197
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,506
and that burnt orphanage
was closed after that fire.

198
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,616
Find out which orphanage that was, please.

199
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,430
Okay.

200
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,789
Gyeonggi Province's Blue
Sunshine Orphange - The Cause Of

201
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:35,966
Fire Was Short Circuit / 11
Children and 3 Teachers Died

202
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,586
Found it. I found it!

203
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,120
- Did you?
- Yup.

204
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,916
Blue Sunshine Orphanage.

205
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,516
How horrible... More than 10
kids died and only three survived.

206
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,706
Are there any names of survivors?

207
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,225
No, in this article,
it only mentioned their family

208
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:56,816
name, boys named Kim and
Jang and a girl named Choi.

209
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,116
Kim Nam Gook,
Jang Myeong Gyoo and Choi Yeo Na.

210
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,736
Choi Yeo Na?

211
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,418
Ah,
that Choi Yeo Na living in Mahyeon-dong,

212
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,766
whom you asked me
to look into before?

213
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,170
You said she was kidnapped though.

214
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,240
Oh, right.

215
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,470
A Woman at 20's
Missing At Mindong-gu,

216
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:15,296
Seoul - Police Is Running
An Open Criminal Investigation

217
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,260
Choi Yeo Na's missing
case is now even on news.

218
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,826
I'd better go now. Let's go,
I'll drop you off.

219
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,200
Why, what is it?

220
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,236
Welcome.

221
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,918
Where... Where is it here?

222
00:17:02,943 --> 00:17:07,226
I just jumped off the
bridge at Han River.

223
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,230
Shall we discuss in details
while having a cup of tea?

224
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,446
You must've rushed here.

225
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,010
I was patrolling with Detective
Park... I need to go back to him.

226
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,670
Another person comes again...

227
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,686
Weren't you supposed to
patrol with Joon Soo's dad?

228
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,796
I just stopped by for a moment during
the patrol, but I'm going back again.

229
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,186
By the way, what's up at this late hour,
with that bouquet of flowers?

230
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,626
This is for the cafe.

231
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,116
We came after seeing the light,
as we were curious who it is.

232
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,196
I see. When you go back,
ask Thomas to accompany you.

233
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,846
Okay.

234
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,726
- Thanks for your work.
- No problem.

235
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,780
Huh, what's this?

236
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,236
Wow, the atmosphere here is so good. See?

237
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,856
These days,
this kind of simple interior is the trend.

238
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,096
When I was alive back then,
flower patterns and laces were popular.

239
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,556
Like this, like this.

240
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,380
Seriously, Unnie, whenever you talk about
your "back then", it shocks me so much.

241
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,196
- Yeah, pretty.
- Forget it!

242
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,210
It's pretty!

243
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,060
In this place,
I'm really not glad to see a newcomer.

244
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,396
Wook, it's been a while.

245
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,060
I haven't seen you for a while,
so I thought you escaped.

246
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,040
I have something to ask you.

247
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,900
You jumped off the bridge at Han River?

248
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,356
Did you commit suicide?

249
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,486
Recently we use the term, "extreme choice".

250
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,666
Extreme choice, my ass!

251
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,486
Suicide is a sin, a sin!

252
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,366
He must have had a good reason, I'm sure.

253
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,076
What reason? Doesn't
he think about his family?

254
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,255
Didn't you think about your
parents whose hearts would

255
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,340
be torn to pieces when
they read your suicide note?

256
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,856
By now, they probably would cry with blood.

257
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,320
They wouldn't, I'm sure.

258
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,730
Because I'm a loser.

259
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,996
Both of my parents are renowned judges and
my older brother is a famous lawyer too.

260
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,316
But I'm terrible at studying

261
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,970
and good at nothing, so my parents
were always embarrassed by me.

262
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,250
I was a shame to my family.

263
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,136
Why are you doing that to me?

264
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,106
You're too immature, seriously.

265
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,286
How could you not understand
your parents' hearts so little?

266
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,986
You don't know my parents.

267
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,896
I'm also a parent raising a child.

268
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,379
Just like everyone
has a different face,

269
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,066
everyone has a different
way to express love,

270
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,936
but their hearts wishing for their
children's well being are all the same.

271
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,326
At such parents' heart,
did you just drive in a huge nail?

272
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:07,750
Throwing away your own
life for such a reason is foolish.

273
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,220
A guy like me is better gone.

274
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,360
Drink it up before it gets
cold. It will warm your inside.

275
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,720
It's okay to come here,
right? This is the only quiet place.

276
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,726
Welcome, Kim.

277
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,040
You came again, Yeo Na.

278
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,236
He just called me Kim, right?

279
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,806
I think so.

280
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,441
Seriously,
I've been easy on you because you're the

281
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:42,150
chief of this town, but come on,
I'm older than you.

282
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,610
There are quite many people
here. Let's take a walk outside.

283
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,906
Are those two dating?

284
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,526
Well, I don't think they're
in such a relationship.

285
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,720
Mr. Jang and my Joon Soo's
dad are patrolling outside,

286
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,620
but he's really clueless.

287
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,450
Where did I see her...?

288
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,966
Your relationship with that
lady isn't good, am I right?

289
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,456
There's nothing good or bad about it.

290
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,406
She champs at the bit to grab my throat
whenever she sees me, so I'm avoiding her.

291
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,736
How can she shield the
child this vehemently?

292
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,460
It makes those without a mom feel sad.

293
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,936
My mother ran away
when I was in kindergarten.

294
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,796
I lived at the orphanage
all my life after that.

295
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,596
I also grew up in an orphanage.

296
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,476
You did?

297
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,116
Yes.

298
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,426
I heard I was abandoned in front
of a church as soon as I was born.

299
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,326
I moved from one orphanage to the other,

300
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,770
then I started living on my own
after graduating from high school.

301
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,055
It's surprising.

302
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,496
I never met someone from an orphanage
again after I stepped into the world.

303
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,916
You went from one
orphanage to the other? Why?

304
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,656
The first orphanage I was in took on fire.

305
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,536
When I think of it now,
it feels so terrible I feel shaky,

306
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,996
but at the time I just thought "Oh,
that is what is happening."

307
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,036
Many children died.

308
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,720
I was really lucky.

309
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,106
- Do you remember the orphanage name?
- Yes.

310
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,640
It was "Blue Sunlight Orphanage".

311
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,556
Why do you ask?

312
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,726
Blue Sunlight Orphanage. Over ten kids died

313
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,436
and only three of them came out alive.

314
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,676
Did something happened at that orphanage?

315
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,557
Sorry?

316
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:53,116
One of the children who survived the fire

317
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,506
is my close friend. His
name is Kim Nam Gook.

318
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,856
Kim Nam Gook?

319
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,086
I'm not sure, I don't really remember.

320
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,076
Do you remember Jang Myeong Gyoo?

321
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,396
Yes. I got a call from him not long ago.

322
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,526
I didn't know who he was at first,

323
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,660
but he talked about Blue Sunlight
Orphanage and said we should meet sometime.

324
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,970
Jang Myeong Gyoo... died.

325
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:28,056
Nam Gook also died after getting
a call from Jang Myeong Gyoo.

326
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,076
Sorry?

327
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,176
I think those three people are
connected to the same thing.

328
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,950
Then the ones who
killed those two people...

329
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,246
are the men who came looking for me?

330
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,210
It might be.

331
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,746
You usually go crazy over meat,
but why aren't you eating?

332
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,680
I'll go crazy even if I don't eat it.

333
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,996
That's right. You would be going crazy.

334
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,850
Why wouldn't you,
after what happened to you?

335
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,176
Still,

336
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,630
the living must keep on living.

337
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,490
You said that, didn't you?

338
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:26,330
That I see those people because
there is something deep-rooted in me.

339
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,930
I think it's all because of Nam Gook.

340
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:38,826
That it's because the key to catching
the ones who killed Nam Gook is here.

341
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,070
So that's why you didn't go.

342
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,286
Go where?

343
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,737
Well,
you used to sleep like the dead all

344
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:46,316
the time,
and then you suddenly disappeared.

345
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,291
So I thought you'd left for
good. You had come out of

346
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:50,216
the blue,
so you must have left in the same manner.

347
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,756
Since you're inconsiderate like that.

348
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,650
But you actually didn't leave.

349
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,396
Why would I leave? I've already
paid for this month's rent in advance.

350
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,966
I'm not leaving!

351
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,746
I can't leave.

352
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,276
Sure. If you really think this way,

353
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,541
then I'll take only half
the rent for the time being.

354
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:26,054
Nothing can be done about
what you paid in advance, though.

355
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,176
Seriously, you're so cheap!

356
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,856
You were criticizing me for doing
things for money, but I see now!

357
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,366
You're quite the money-grubber.

358
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,206
And these! You're gathering these to
exchange them for money, aren't you?

359
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,776
Have you ever seen someone who hates money?

360
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,446
And finish eating before
you speak! So dirty.

361
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,486
Then don't eat, if it's dirty!

362
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,200
I'll eat this all. It's delicious.

363
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,470

for you regarding the case.

to live at the orphanage you were at.

will you do that for me?

her last known whereabouts

390

are when she went home on June 7th,
afternoon.

We had a few reports and checked them,
but it was all in vain.

392
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,356
Shouldn't we also consider the
possibility of a crime or a kidnapping?

393
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,426
It's too early to be discouraged.
Let's search a bit more.

Have you ever seen this
woman? She lives next door.

please call this number.

Yes, I will.

I heard they are looking
for Miss Yeo Na outside.

399
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,936
That's all they talk about on
the news and in newspapers.

400
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,666
What does it change?
Yeo Na is already dead,

401
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,136
and those guys have already fled to China.

402

Interpol has issued a Red
Notice. (worldwide request)

pictures of their faces in China.

405
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,236

no one will be able to find them.

406
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,296

ones who took Yeo Na away, for sure.

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,856
Nam Gook also said he
doesn't know who these guys are.

409
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,466
Yeo Na said the same thing as well.

410
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,026
Anyway, it definitely isn't something
that happened out of personal grudge.

411
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,726
There is someone behind for sure.

412
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,566
Someone who told them
to kill those three people?

413
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,756
- Someone ordered it.
- Murder by contract.

414
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,346
And contract kidnapping.
These are the most likely.

415
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,840
But who ordered them, then?

416
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,556

What a lousy swine!

419
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,926
And you stayed put even
after you suffered through that?

420
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,336
I defied him vehemently, of course!

421
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,926
But what use was that? That jerk
has money and strength over me.

living the grand life now!

- What about her?
- That person's name is Choi Yeo Na, right?

430
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,172
I knew she looked familiar!

431
00:29:57,196 --> 00:30:00,186

before I jumped into the Han river.

432

433
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,956

coincidence. Are you that glad to see her?

comfort anyone? Let go of my hand.

everything just because you died.

must have searched for him all night.

681
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,240
No thanks. Eat up.

682
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,546
Did you tell them what you
wanted to with your smoke?

683
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:26,526
I'm not sure. They need to see the smoke.

684
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,796
Should I go call the people instead?

685
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,330
The people I'm talking about
aren't the ones in this village.

686
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,590
Okay.

687
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:47,890
I clean out the room inside,
so put your stuff there.

688
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:52,698
Huh? You haven't been
talkin the entire time

689
00:47:52,722 --> 00:47:55,466
we came,
and your expression is weird too.

690
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:58,320
Where did you go with Jong Ah?

691
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,866
Did you fight with her?

692
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,262
Do you think I would fight
with a young lady at my age?

693
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:08,196
I'm going to sleep before
I go on patrol tonight.

694
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,816
So you did, huh? She probably got you good.

695
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,210
Jjong Ah is a scary one, so you
better be careful if you can help it.

696
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,080
Hyung!

697
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,486
Noona, I brought him.

698
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,386
You should play with her now.

699
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,496
I'm going to play with Jun Soo.

700
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,580
Sweet potatoes...

701
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,386
What are you doing here?

702
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,956
As you can see,

703
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,930
I tried using a very classic
method but nobody is coming.

704
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,236
Are you trying to call people using a fire?

705
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,746
That's such an old fashioned way,
not even using lanterns or anything.

706
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:59,456
You're trying to use smoke?

707
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,650
Oh, lanterns!

708
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,226
You're not thinking of actually
using lanterns now, are you?

709
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,570
What are you doing tonight?

710
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,586
Is Detective Sin Joon Ho your fiance?

711
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,876
Yes.

712
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,726
He's such a good detective
that he's always busy.

713
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:31,746
That's why I prepared for
the wedding all by myself.

714
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:34,866
We haven't even taken
our wedding photos yet.

715
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:39,166
Still, when he sees this,
he'll come find me.

716
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,066
Even without this, he'll come find you.

717
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:48,090
He's probably looking for you as we speak.

718
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:53,696
Did someone say Joon Ho is looking for me?

719
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,916
Did Bong An say that?

720
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,686
No,
I'm just thinking that must be the case.

721
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,260
You said he's a good detective.

722
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:11,670
Of course he would he looking for you,
his fiance, who went missing.

723
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,606
Please fly far, far away and reach someone.

724
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:36,006
Please tell that person I'm here.

725
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,560
Please.

726
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,866
It's like we're at some
festival. Isn't it pretty?

727
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,440
Oh, yes.

728
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,736
It is pretty.

729
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,950
♫ I pray ♫

730
00:50:55,220 --> 00:51:00,390
♫ To that beautiful star ♫

731
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,136
That one is the prettiest!

732
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,286
No, that one is prettier!

733
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,926
No, over there!

734
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,406
No, I'm saying that one is beautiful.

735
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,506
Let's go in kids.

736
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,076
Mom, can't we play a bit more?

737
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,296
It's still sparkling!

738
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,930
Let's go inside before the
scary man comes again.

739
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:27,430
♫ I approach like a deep echo ♫

740
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:34,090
♫ I will wake up sleeping you ♫

741
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:41,960
♫ so that you can feel you aren't alone ♫

742
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,266
What is that?

743
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,306
Isn't it obvious?

744
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,726
It's someone's sincerity.

745
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,686
Their earnest sincerity.

746
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,100
It must be mine.

747
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:04,530
♫ To that beautiful star ♫

748
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:13,376
♫ May the end of your day be brilliant ♫

749
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,700
♫ so that you won't be lost ♫

750
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,256
I'll rip off the moldy wallpaper

751
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,586
and refurnish it, so use that room.

752
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:30,296
No need.

753
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,250
I'm not going to live here forever.

754
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:41,886
Earlier, the skies were really something.

755
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,216
Don't even mention it.

756
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,556
It was truly a spectacle.

757
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:52,246
Yeo Na has such an open hand.

758
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,646
I think we must've made a hundred of them.

759
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:59,496
How must she have felt that
she wanted to make so many?

760
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,290
She's hoping to find anything she can.

761
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:08,876
- Do you think she's still alive?
- I believe it.

762
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,330
I have to find anything I can.

763
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,640
Ahjussi,

764
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:23,546
do you believe in miracles?

765
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:29,130
I mean, I guess it's a miracle
we can even see those people.

766
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,620
I have something I want to ask you-

767
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:40,350
How can you start snoring mid-conversation?

768
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:45,960
That's a miracle.

769
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:05,906
Hyung, where you get that balloon?

770
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:09,266
Over there and there! There's a ton.

771
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,470
Who's is it?

772
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,426
Yeo Na Noona and Sin Joon Ho.

773
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:19,156
There's a ton of them,
so you can play with it too.

774
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,236
Really? I want one too!

775
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,996
- Shall we go look for balloons together?
- Mmhm.

776
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,060
Let's go.

777
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,390
I don't have an anklet
but it's still so frustrating.

778
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,110
It's all because of that punk.

779
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,466
Did you find something there?

780
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,220
No.

781
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,996
Where are they?

782
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,106
Over there!

783
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,680
Where? OH!

784
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,566
Hyung,
look at this. It isn't ripped at all.

785
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,586
I want a new one too...

786
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,220
- Do you want to switch with me?
- No.

787
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,266
They were fallen all over the place.

788
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,506
It's not like anyone will
come looking for her.

789
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,416
Whether you start a fire or scream,

790
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,576
it seems she can't accept the outside
world can't be reached from here.

791
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,680
But... Who is Sin Joon Ho?

792
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,217
A detective.

793
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:04,763
The one who came looking
for you yesterday, right?

794
00:56:04,787 --> 00:56:05,636
Yes.

795
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,846
- Are you close to him?
- No.

796
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:12,126
Then why did you even write his name on it?

797
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,320
Oh, Yeo Na used to know him.

798
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,750
How?

799
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,306
I wouldn't know that!

800
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,956
Why are you so interested
in the private lives of others?

801
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,426
If you're curious,
you should go ask her yourself.

802
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,326
Why are you so irritated?

803
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,830
Mr.Kim, I like everything about you, except
for your tendency to lose your temper.

804
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,550
You guys are so funny.

805
00:56:35,575 --> 00:56:37,956
When was I annoyed
or lose my temper?

806
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,926
Also,
until when are you gonna call me Mr. Kim?

807
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,566
If you keep doing that,
you'll end up dead or something.

808
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,086
I've already died.

809
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,346
I'm saying I won't let you be.

810
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,072
I'm calling you Mr. Kim
since your name is Mr. Kim.

811
00:56:48,096 --> 00:56:48,997
What else should I call you?

812
00:56:49,021 --> 00:56:50,856
You can call me Hyungnim, or brother.

813
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,291
There are titles a bit more
friendly than just Mr. Kim.

814
00:56:53,315 --> 00:56:54,126
Hey!

815
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,650
Why do you keep pestering Thomas?

816
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,526
Let's be brothers.

817
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,490
Okay, brother.

818
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,870
Bring that kid.

819
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:12,836
Let the kid go, and talk with me.

820
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,566
Hurry up and bring him here!

821
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,866
I have nothing to say to you.

822
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,130
Jun Soo.

823
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:22,826
Yea, you.

824
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,226
Him?

825
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,546
Okay, since the person you want is here,

826
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:29,186
let our kid go.

827
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,326
Do something about this!

828
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,366
Jun Soo...

829
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,686
This is all because of you.

830
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,586
You made me like this.

831
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:41,296
Stop spouting nonsense and let the kid go!

832
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,880
Tell me you'll help me
escape. Then I'll let the kid go.

833
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:50,026
- What?
- I don't care if its hell,

834
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:55,446
just let me disappear from here, please.

835
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,736
You guys know this, too.

836
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,796
This punk is different from us.

837
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,016
What kind of nonsense is that?

838
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,366
He doesn't get stabbed even if you
stab him, and he knows all about my past.

839
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:11,886
A few days ago, he made some man disappear.

840
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:12,976
I saw it myself!

841
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,536
Bong Ah disappeared
because they found his body!

842
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,936
Yes, yes, that isn't the doing of him.

843
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,936
Shut up! I know what I saw.

844
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,296
This bastard held his hand,
and he disappeared.

845
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,700
This punk is a grim reaper.

846
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:38,780
You're not really believing what
that crazy man is saying, are you?

847
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,556
Send you to hell?

848
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,116
Says who?

849
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,986
This crazy bastard!

850
00:58:56,010 --> 00:59:01,090
You dare to threaten
a kid and hurt my wife?

851
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,096
I won't let you be.

852
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:08,430
From now on,
every moment for you will be like hell.

853
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,106
Go.

854
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,336
Send me.

855
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,436
Please send me.

856
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,206
Go! What is there to watch here.

857
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:20,300
Go in!

858
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,796
This is my picture, so it's mine.

859
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:58,186
No! This is mom's.

860
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,806
It's my picture, so why is it yours?

861
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,726
Since Wook is mine,

862
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,916
this is mine.

863
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,266
Stop that!

864
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:09,376
You're Mom's.

865
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,520
You're mine.

866
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,840
This is me...

867
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:53,240
Missing: The Other Side

868
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,036
If you met her,
do you think you'd recognize her?

869
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,666
Of course! Right at once!

870
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,176
I'm looking for my bloodline.

871
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,446
Chairman Han has a grandson?

872
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:14,776
I mean, how can their name
exists without any records?

873
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,846
Who's Hyun Ji?

874
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:18,226
Eat up.

875
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,626
They disappeared here.
There isn't much time left.

876
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,616
I'm sure they're waiting...

877
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,933
How come bastards like you...

878
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:27,236
even when the years change,
the seed's don't dry up?

879
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,556
Do you think the world will become
a better place after I disappear?

880
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:33,250
Just tell me who killed you.
