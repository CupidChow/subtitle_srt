1
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:13,644
It's hard to explain, but...

2
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:15,746
I've got a long way to go.

3
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:17,781
Experiencing it first-hand is different.

4
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:19,216
The real deal was something else.

5
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:25,822
I think the important thing
is your mindset going into it.

6
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:30,327
The kind of cooking
where the person making it is happy...

7
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:37,300
and the person eating it is happy too.

8
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,049
That's what I wanted to do.

9
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,483
(Ryu Su Young's new adventure
Culinary Study Abroad)

10
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:54,484
I have no reason not to go.

11
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:55,786
Because...

12
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:58,121
I need to build it from scratch.

13
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:59,556
I've never had a restaurant...

14
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:01,725
or graduated from a culinary school.

15
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:04,428
But for Mr. Eo's Food World Tour,

16
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:06,830
I have a desire
that there should be something more.

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,432
There's so much to know.

18
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:10,867
Food is like language.

19
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:14,271
You need to go to that country
to truly understand that language.

20
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:17,874
I'm still not sure how much
I'll be able to learn.

21
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,978
(Ryu Su Young leaves
for culinary study abroad.)

22
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:28,852
(The distance traveled
in pursuit of learning around the world)

23
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:33,323
(A hands-on culinary study
in search of flavors)

24
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:34,624
Why is there a restaurant here?

25
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:39,830
(Eat)

26
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,069
(Those who haven't tasted
shouldn't talk of flavor.)

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,540
(A flavor relay
that awakens every sleeping cell)

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,708
Why is this so delicious?

29
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:53,944
This is crazy.

30
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:57,280
(Tasted more than 100 dishes
across 3 countries)

31
00:01:57,914 --> 00:01:59,650
(Learn)

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,917
Can I go in?

33
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:06,256
(Immersive learning
from everyday life around the world)

34
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:10,727
(Time devoted to learning,
from planning to filming)

35
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:14,364
(A total of 2,160 hours)

36
00:02:14,898 --> 00:02:17,067

37
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:21,538
(Every night,
a new Ryu-cipe is created.)

38
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:23,840
I can't believe this is actually working.

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,609
(Taste beyond imaginable)

40
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:26,977
Delicious.

41
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:28,245
Simply delicious.

42
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:30,847
I'm only thinking about what to add
to make it taste good.

43
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:32,883
I want to do it my way.

44
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:34,051
I want it to be a dish...

45
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,620
that's easy to make but also delicious.

46
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:39,456
The best thing...

47
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:40,991
is tasting good for the person eating it.

48
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:42,492
Absolutely nothing can beat that.

49
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:43,960
That's what I hope for when cooking.

50
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:48,098
(Introducing new Ryu-cipes)

51
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:49,666
Eat.

52
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,168

- Yoon Kyung Ho.
- Kihyun.

57
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:02,612
Eo Nam Seon.

58
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:04,247
Join us.

59
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:05,382
Hurry.

60
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:07,351
(It's starting now.)

61
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:11,521
(Seoul, March 2025)

62
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:15,726
(Home cook master Ryu Su Young
is writing something.)

63
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:20,263
Application for studying abroad...

64
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:22,799
I'm a study-abroad student Eo Nam Seon...

65
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,868
I've never had to do this before.

66
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:27,804
Name, Eo Nam Seon.

67
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:30,874
Gosh, this...

68
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:33,410
This is the first time
using my real name on TV.

69
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,045
A first since my debut 26 years ago.

70
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:37,881
You're giving me a chance
to use my real name.

71
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:41,818
I'm not going alone, though.

72
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:43,687
Why is no one here yet?

73
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:47,391
They should be here soon.
It's almost time.

74
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:49,292
I'm not afraid of cooking.

75
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,195
If it really doesn't taste good,
I can just eat it all.

76
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:54,898
I'd say I'm pretty good at seasoning.

77
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:56,466
I'm going to be professional about it.

78
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:02,939
(Bold moves)

79
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:07,844
(Professional gestures)

80
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,480
They're here.

81
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:13,984
Hello.

82
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:15,218
- Hello.
- No way.

83
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:17,087
It's nice to meet you.

84
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:19,756
- I didn't know you'd be here.
- Of course, I'm here.

85
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:20,791
Come on in.

86
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,159
I thought I'd be the first.

87
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,160
No, no.

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,561
- Hello.
- Hello.

89
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:26,163
- Come on in.
- It's nice to meet you.

90
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:28,498
It feels unreal to meet you in person.

91
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:29,933
You did your makeup.

92
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,601
Just a little.

93
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:33,704
- Please sit.
- Yes, okay.

94
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:35,105
So good to see you.

95
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:36,606
Am I older?

96
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:38,875
- I was born in 1980.
- You are?

97
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,078
- I'm a year older.
- Yes.

98
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:43,780
Would it be okay to just speak casually?

99
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,182
Shall we?

100
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:48,285
We're going to be living together
when we go abroad anyway.

101
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:50,020
All right. Hey, let's have fun.

102
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,556
- Su Young.
- Thanks for coming.

103
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:54,291
I've been looking forward to this moment.

104
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,692
When I hug you,

105
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:57,961
I love how you give me that comfort,
like hugging a sturdy tree.

106
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:59,796
Like hugging a sturdy tree.

107
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:03,600
Your embrace feels infinite,
like it feels like I can't touch my hands.

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,535
- I love your expressions like that.
- Really?

109
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:07,871
Saying that I'm like a sturdy tree.

110
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:10,374
Whenever you'd explain a recipe,

111
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:13,176
you'd use those elegant expressions
and I'd love it.

112
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:16,179
- Thanks, my sturdy tree, Yoon Kyung Ho.
- A sturdy tree, gosh. Thank you.

113
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,281
I think that was
when you totally won me over.

114
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,886
I actually really adore Su Young.

115
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:26,490
He has that warmth every time he talks.

116
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:29,660
It's admirable,
and he's totally captivated me.

117
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:34,398
I often cook using Su Young's recipes.

118
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:37,000
I've tried the fried egg without oil,

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,769
the fried rice...

120
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:42,472
I'm so thankful for him
and every man should be too.

121
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:46,443
You're able to cook some good food
with just what you have in your fridge.

122
00:05:46,443 --> 00:05:47,978
To me, he's like a savior.

123
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:49,946
I've become a total fan.

124
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:51,415
Was the too much?

125
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:54,818
This is so exciting, Su Young.

126
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:55,986
(Ryu's No. 2 fan)

127
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:57,921
Should we have some coffee?

128
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:59,723
- I should greet people by hugging.
- You should.

129
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:01,425
Everyone, young and old.

130
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:04,494
(They calm their excitement
over a cup of coffee.)

131
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:05,962
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

132
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,964
- Good to have you.
- Thanks for having me.

133
00:06:07,964 --> 00:06:09,666
(A precious moment alone
with Su Young)

134
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,934
Someone's here.

135
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:12,936
Who is it?

136
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:15,939
Welcome. Welcome, Kihyun.

137
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,207
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

138
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:19,776
Welcome.

139
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:21,445
- Hello, sir.
- Nice to meet you.

140
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:22,879
(Who is this polite young man?)

141
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,548
I know when I hug people.

142
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:33,557
(In his 11th year,
MONSTA X's main vocal)

143
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:37,260
(MONSTA X Kihyun,
the youngest study-abroad student)

144
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:39,997
- Have a seat.
- Should I sit here? Thank you.

145
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:41,365
(The three study-abroad students
are together for the first time.)

146
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,235
- This is awkward.
- Right?

147
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:46,937
Oh, right.
You've been discharged not too long ago.

148
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:50,340
Yes, it's just been over two weeks.

149
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:53,343
Your hair is still...
It's still short.

150
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:55,379
It hasn't grown out yet.

151
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,449
- No wonder his eyes are full of spirit.
- It is full of spirit.

152
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,518
I heard you were an elite soldier

153
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:02,686
when you were in the army.

154
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:04,154
Yes, I was given that title.

155
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:06,056
- And you were given an award.
- Yes.

156
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,658
Because cooking
is physically demanding...

157
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,063
(I'm an elite soldier!)

158
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,631
No, you don't have to do that.

159
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:17,267
Three, four, five, six...

160
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:18,301
My back muscles too...

161
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:19,636
Hey, your back muscles...

162
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:21,104
Your muscles are crazy.

163
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:22,706
I can feel his muscles.

164
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:25,108
This is...
Why are you so ripped?

165
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,778
Why is he so ripped?

166
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:28,945
What the heck?

167
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:32,449
(Jealous...)

168
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,351
This is insanity right here.

169
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:36,320
(Insane elite muscles)

170
00:07:36,553 --> 00:07:37,754
Did you fill in the application?

171
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:39,022
Yes, I did.

172
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:40,424
I was told to complete it.

173
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:41,892
- I also filled mine in.
- Did you?

174
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:44,227
It's the same for me.
Who do we give this to now?

175
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:46,830
(The three brothers have filled in
their applications for studying abroad.)

176
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:49,599
Strength.

177
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,034
For me,

178
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:53,236
I'm not afraid of cooking.

179
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,672
I'm good at seasoning.

180
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:58,275
I'm pretty good
at getting it just right.

181
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:00,677
So, I'm confident
with my choices when cooking.

182
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:01,778
That's really important.

183
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:03,413
Because seasoning
is everything when tasting.

184
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:04,548
Right.

185
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:05,916
Are you good at seasoning?

186
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,885
Here, I wrote my weakness as...

187
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:11,054
"a little unsure about seasoning."

188
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,957
Don't worry about that.
I got you.

189
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:18,628
My strength is easy,
no-frill, simple cooking.

190
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:21,131
I think that's my strength.

191
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:25,702
Your recipes
are so easy to follow at home.

192
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:29,272
I know I can make it
with just what I have in my fridge.

193
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:31,174
When I go check my fridge
for ingredients,

194
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:33,744
they're things
I usually always have in my fridge.

195
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,545
Let's check the fridge.
If there's nothing, oh well.

196
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:36,780
Let's try to cook something.

197
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:40,884
There's pork belly and what else?

198
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:42,586
(Which simple dish will Su Young make?)

199
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:45,589
I can tell from the fridge that they cook,
so there's probably lots of ingredients.

200
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,557
I saw that they had pollock roe.

201
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:50,427
I have an easy pollock roe pasta recipe.

202
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:52,329
That sounds good.

203
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:53,463
Sounds delicious.

204
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:56,133
(Home cook master Eo Nam Seon)

205
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:58,368
(Viral recipe)

206
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:03,507
(The recipe used by so many people)

207
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:07,911
(Mr. Eo's recipe revealed)

208
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:09,079
I'll start.

209
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,714
This is going to be good.

210
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,950
(A simple dish you can whip up
with ingredients at home)

211
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:15,352
(Preparing pasta water)

212
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:17,421
Having a screen like this is convenient.

213
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:21,124
I've never seen a filter system like this,
but this is cool.

214
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:25,796
This is touch screen.

215
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:30,100
You can customize and save different modes
to your liking.

216
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:34,938
I see. I can control it
with my finger like this.

217
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:36,606
One liter.

218
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:38,742
One liter at 100 degrees Celsius.

219
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:40,644
This is tankless?

220
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:42,145
That's more hygienic, so nice.

221
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,248
It'll take no time.

222
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:48,852
(Save time by starting with boiling water
for the pasta.)

223
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,858
(The pasta water is ready,
so we just need few more ingredients.)

224
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:56,493
I'll just make a little.

225
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:57,694
I'm excited.

226
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:00,130
(Impressed)

227
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,631
This is so that it doesn't stick.

228
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:06,436
(A flower blooms inside the pan.)

229
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:09,973
If you put it on one side,
the pasta will stick to one another.

230
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:12,976
Just twist it like this,
and it'll opens up.

231
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,779
A little twist, then let it go
for the pasta to bloom.

232
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:20,150
It's just a simple trick,
but it feels like a performance of sort.

233
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,453
I can't believe I get to see
what I've only seen on TV.

234
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:25,389
It's mesmerizing.

235
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:32,195
How is he able to cook at that level?

236
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:36,166
He sure is amazing.

237
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:41,371
Once the pasta cooks,
we'll start cooking.

238
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:43,106
Ingredients are super simple.

239
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:47,577
I feel like they'd have butter.

240
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:49,012
- Found it.
- I saw it earlier.

241
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,917
(First key ingredient is butter.)

242
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:56,787
We're only making a little,
so let's just use 30g.

243
00:10:56,787 --> 00:11:00,057
(Add 30g of butter into a bowl.)

244
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:03,327
Turn the heat off, then...

245
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:05,862
It goes directly into the bowl?

246
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:07,097
Yes.

247
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:09,666
(Add the cooked pasta
into the bowl with butter?)

248
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,902
Yeah, add it directly. That's it.

249
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:15,906
Then, you just mix it like this.

250
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:17,341
That's cool.

251
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,675
(Mix the pasts with butter.)

252
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:20,544
This is what mantecare is.

253
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:23,413
When fat, starch,
and water are mixed well,

254
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:25,182
it becomes a sauce.

255
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:28,986
It melts quickly
because the pasta is hot.

256
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:31,121
I smell the butter.

257
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:32,622
Of course, you can smell it.

258
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:33,790
(The buttery smell hits your nose.)

259
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:39,529
(Smelling it from here)

260
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:40,998
(Smelling it from here too)

261
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:42,666
The smell.

262
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,501
You're right.
It has that margarine smell.

263
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:45,936
If it seems a little dry...

264
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,106
(If the pasta looks a little dry...)

265
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:50,907
Add the pasta water.

266
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:53,343
(If it seems dry, add 2T of pasta water.)

267
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:54,878
You can do it on the pan,

268
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,747
but the pasta is hot,
so there's no need.

269
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,950
This will come together
and become the sauce.

270
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,320
(Mix well until the butter melts.)

271
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:06,023
(Second key ingredient)

272
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:09,860
(White pollock roe)

273
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,928
You could use regular pollock roe,

274
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,797
but the white pollock roe
is more clean tasting.

275
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:15,932
White pollock roe.

276
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,367
(Removing the skin to only use the roe)

277
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:21,571
- That's interesting.
- It really is.

278
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:24,074
(Easily separate the roe from the skin
by pushing with chopsticks)

279
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:31,882
Two tablespoons of pollock roe
should be enough.

280
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:34,384
It'll be too salty
if you add too much at once.

281
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,086
Add just the right amount.

282
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:38,188
This is meant to be enjoyed
for its slightly salty flavor.

283
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:41,124
Now, to this,

284
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:42,693
add a little bit of tuna extract

285
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:45,062
to take it to another level.

286
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,032
(The umami flavor is enhanced
by the tuna extract.)

287
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:52,969
(We just mix this, and we're done?)

288
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:57,174
Last but not least,

289
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,611
drizzle the mayo around once or twice.

290
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:04,881
That's going to be super buttery and rich.

291
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:07,818
The mayo is the kick.

292
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:09,252
This is perfect with beer.

293
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,221
(Mayo is the kick
for this butter and pollock roe pasta.)

294
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,423
It becomes like a cream sauce.

295
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:18,562
So actual ingredients
are just pasta and pollock roe.

296
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:22,466
(Pasta made with just 3 ingredients:
Butter, pollock roe, mayo)

297
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,170
(It's time to plate it nicely.)

298
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:29,172
(The egg yolk is the cherry on top.)

299
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:30,741
How did you whip this up like...

300
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:33,176
Make sure it doesn't fall.

301
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,780
- What just happened?
- You're adding the rest of the roe.

302
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,649
Yeah, just a little.

303
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:40,384
Just lay it on like this.

304
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:45,022
(Some black pepper to finish it off)

305
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:46,156
It's done.

306
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:49,126
This is classy.

307
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:53,030
My mouth is watering.

308
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,297
(Super simple pasta
that anyone can make)

309
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:58,802
(An incredible dish
made with just a few ingredients)

310
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:00,837
(Mr. Eo's Butter and Pollock Roe Pasta)

311
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:01,496
(1. Boil pasta for 8 minutes.)

312
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,073
(2. Add the cooked pasta into a
bowl with 30g of butter and mix well.)

313
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:04,507
(3. Add 2T of skin-removed
pollock roe, 1T of tuna extract)

314
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:05,342
(Drizzle the mayo, and mix well.)

315
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:06,610
Shall we taste it?

316
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,678
Let's eat this first.

317
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:08,945
I'll pop it.

318
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:11,782
You should pop the yolk.

319
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:14,017
(Pop the yolk for an effect.)

320
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:18,221
(How does it taste?)

321
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:23,760
Su Young, what is this?

322
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,928
Pretty good, right?

323
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,699
(Excited)

324
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,535
This is so delicious.

325
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:34,805
(A perfect combination of butter,
pollock roe, and mayonnaise)

326
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,540
It's soft, sophisticated...

327
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:38,675
It's salty,

328
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:41,345
but then the butter kicks in
and you have little bursts from the roe.

329
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,747
I can't even tell what the kick is.

330
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:46,383
This itself is just a kick.

331
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:52,322
(This taste is insane.)

332
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,257
Kihyun knows how to eat pasta.

333
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:55,359
With such sophistication.

334
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,463
The ground pepper at the end...

335
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:01,565
really goes well with the pasta.

336
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:03,033
Any dish that uses butter...

337
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,501
must have some ground pepper.

338
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:07,070
- Could I finish this off?
- Sure.

339
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:09,406
(Don't leave any on the plate.)

340
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,210
(Slurp)

341
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:18,148
We killed that. Look at that.

342
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:20,717
Were we all starving?

343
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:23,854
(Su Young's pasta is full of flavor,
but it's made with simple ingredients.)

344
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:27,257
Now, I get why people say,
"Ryu Su Young's recipe always works."

345
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:28,558
"It's always good."

346
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:31,194
When I'm using his recipe,
I know it's going to taste good.

347
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:34,464
But when you make it,
it always tastes

348
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:37,367
way better than what you imagined.

349
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:39,236
A guide to studying abroad.

350
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:40,671
- A guide.
- Let's take a look.

351
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:43,507
A guide to studying abroad.

352
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,676
(Eat! Learn! Execute!
A Guide to Studying Abroad)

353
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:48,979
Eat a local meal at least once
in each location.

354
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,347
A local meal.

355
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:53,016
Learn to cook
at least 1 iconic dish

356
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:55,018
for each location.

357
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:58,255
Three, each person should execute
at least 1 recipe.

358
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:00,691
If you don't, you can't return home.

359
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,195
I think we could all do it.

360
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:06,229
There's a condition.

361
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,565
Use the recipe and flavor
you've learned abroad

362
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:11,301
and create your own, unique recipe.

363
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,602
Your own.

364
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:14,338
"Your own" is important.

365
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:17,274
Instead of just having fun,

366
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:21,178
it'd be better if we could learn
and bring something back.

367
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:24,881
I feel a little pressure,
some excitement...

368
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,249
I want to go home.

369
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:30,320
(So, Kyung Ho is back at home.)

370
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,888
Butter and pollock roe pasta.

371
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:36,460
(As soon as he's back,
he reviews the pasta recipe.)

372
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:41,598
(Ryu's No. 2 fan follows along
just like he was taught.)

373
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:44,868
- Dad.
- Hey there.

374
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:46,870
(Kyung Ho's daughter is here.)

375
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,105
Hold this like this.

376
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:49,906
I hope I do well when I go.

377
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:51,041
You don't need to do well.

378
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,143
- Why?
- That's also a charming part of you.

379
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:54,711
No, I want to do well.

380
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,546
- You'll do well.
- Right?

381
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:00,017
This has to taste good.

382
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:04,388
(It does look like
the one Su Young made earlier.)

383
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:07,257
(Kyung Ho's daughter takes a slurp.)

384
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:10,427
It taste like something from a restaurant.

385
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:11,828
From a restaurant?

386
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:14,898
But it's not my style.

387
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:19,403
(Kyung Ho's daughter
is firm on her preferences.)

388
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,405
(Elite youngest Kihyun
is also practicing.)

389
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:22,939
Tomato puree.

390
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,108
Onion, potato, paprika.

391
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,312
(Practicing knife skills)

392
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:32,749
(Practicing using a wok)

393
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,655
(Even practicing different languages)

394
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,224
(All the preparations are done.)

395
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:42,726
My gosh.

396
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:43,894
(All the preparations are done.)

397
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:47,297
(The first location
of the culinary study is?)

398
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,767
It's Porto in Portugal, right?

399
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:54,371
(Porto, the heart of northern Portugal)

400
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,240
(A picturesque scenery
you can't take your eyes off of)

401
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,709
This is so beautiful.

402
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:03,613
I can't believe this. This is unreal.

403
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:07,117
(A city of unreal beauty)

404
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,586
(The reason why we're in Porto)

405
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,488
It's been around since Roman times,

406
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:12,923
so it's a 2,000-year-old city.

407
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,491
With the sea by their side,

408
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:16,827
countless dishes must've come and gone.

409
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,563
And what we get to eat now
has survived through that,

410
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:20,731
so imagine how delicious it must be.

411
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:26,336
(A harmony of flavors
that encapsulates the rich history)

412
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:31,742
This country is famous for desserts,

413
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:33,377
so I should try making a dessert.

414
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:36,980
Now, let's go learn.

415
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,215
I'm going to work really hard.

416
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:39,816
We'll work hard.

417
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:45,989
(A morning in Porto
is filled with anticipation.)

418
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:48,725
(What will the three brothers experience
on their first day?)

419
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:50,060
Good morning.

420
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:53,296
It's 6:20 a.m. right now.

421
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:59,636
(It’s the first day, and Kihyun
is up early for their busy itinerary.)

422
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:01,338
I just woke up.

423
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:06,143
I think everyone else is already up,

424
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:09,146
so I'll hurry up and go say hi.

425
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,187
(Haha)

426
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:20,390
(Clearly, he's just woken up.)

427
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,659
(Bedhead in full glory)

428
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:25,362
(The early-bird brothers are already up.)

429
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:26,797
The houses are so pretty.

430
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:28,298
(The early-bird brothers are already up.)

431
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:35,772
(A view from the house
you can only enjoy early in the morning)

432
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:39,609
Since we're surrounded
by these old buildings,

433
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,946
it's really starting to feel like
we're in a foreign country.

434
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:45,682
We're in a completely different culture.

435
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:46,650
It suddenly hit me.

436
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,585
We're in a total foreign place right now.

437
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,121
Good morning.

438
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:52,522
Did you sleep well?

439
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,627
Kihyun, lean out the window from there.

440
00:19:57,627 --> 00:19:58,795
Like an actor.

441
00:19:58,795 --> 00:19:59,997
Look cool. There you go.

442
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:01,131
Nice.

443
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:02,532
Handsome.

444
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:09,272
(Relax with a cup of coffee, Model Kihyun)

445
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:12,142
Are you shooting a commercial?

446
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:14,077
Be more natural.

447
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:15,412
(The three brothers
are already having fun.)

448
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:17,481
That "Korea Army" on your shirt
looks so out of place.

449
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:19,950
You still wear that?

450
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,485
I wanted to wear it as pajama.

451
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:23,120
Yeah, I guess you've gotten used to it.

452
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,088
This is fun.

453
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,256
Why are you suddenly coming
with a camera?

454
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:27,324
You're scaring me.

455
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:28,792
Wait. You want to fight?

456
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:30,560
You want to fight me? Wait.

457
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,562
You looked hilarious trying to record.

458
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:35,198
I'll lean out from here,

459
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:36,566
so record me.

460
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:37,401
Okay.

461
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:42,673
Porto!

462
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:46,877
(Haha)

463
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:55,285
(The first morning of study abroad
for the three brothers)

464
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,690
(Kicking off their study abroad,
they've come to a residential area.)

465
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,026
We're going to eat a local meal.

466
00:21:03,026 --> 00:21:04,761
A real home-cooked meal.

467
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:07,397
Are we going to a restaurant?

468
00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:08,498
We're going to a grandma's place.

469
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:10,133
To her house? Okay.

470
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:13,203
It's like "Porto Cuisine and Dining."

471
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,272
What an incredible experience.

472
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:16,340
(They turn into an alleyway
for a local meal.)

473
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,407
Hey, what's that?

474
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:18,976
Look at that stained glass.

475
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,310
I see stained glasses,

476
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:24,481
and tiles are famous here.
I also see lots of pretty tiles.

477
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:27,584
It says 1972.

478
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:29,086
I guess it's minimum 100 years.

479
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:31,421
These buildings are over 100 years old.

480
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:33,824
The buildings are all very narrow,

481
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,126
and they're all lined up so neatly.

482
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:40,697
It's like "Harry Potter."

483
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:42,432
This is magical. Where are we?

484
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:44,234
This alley came out of nowhere.

485
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:46,703
This is beautiful.

486
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:48,338
Isn't this great?

487
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:50,574
- It's great.
- This is great.

488
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:54,711
Where will this alley take us?

489
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,182
I smell something delicious.

490
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:07,324
- It's cute.
- Hello.

491
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:09,493
Hello.

492
00:22:12,462 --> 00:22:13,730
Is this her?

493
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:15,465
Hola.

494
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:21,204
(They meet the local meal master
in the middle of the alley.)

495
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:27,110
(Elena, a Porto local meal master)

496
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,784
(Elena has preserved Porto's local meals
with traditional recipes.)

497
00:22:36,953 --> 00:22:40,824
(Porto's local meal
crafted by the hands of a master)

498
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:43,126
(Porto)

499
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:43,860
(Traditional)

500
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,628
(Local meal)

501
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:47,331
(Porto's traditional local meal)

502
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:49,866
Let me take you to my cozy house.

503
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:55,572
Let's go.

504
00:22:55,772 --> 00:22:57,808
Thank you.

505
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:05,082
It was built a long time ago.
It's an old house.

506
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:06,683
It smells like a house.

507
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:10,454
(When you walk up the stairs
filled with the home-cooked memories)

508
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:15,859
(You'll reach Elena's house
where you'll taste Porto's local meal.)

509
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,429
Come sit here.

510
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:21,999
- Welcome to my house.
- It's so pretty.

511
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:29,006
We're going to enjoy some Porto dishes
that were made in my house.

512
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:37,414
Thank you for inviting us to your house.

513
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:39,449
The pleasure in mine.

514
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:40,984
Isn't she so lovely?

515
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,386
Yeah.

516
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,955
You are beautiful.

517
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:46,957
Thank you.

518
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:48,959
So pretty.

519
00:23:49,526 --> 00:23:51,228
She's glowing.

520
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:54,164
Should I bring the food?

521
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:55,699
That'd be great.

522
00:23:58,502 --> 00:24:02,339
She's invited us to her actual house.

523
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,808
It's like a cozy little hideaway.

524
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:08,078
(In the master's warm and cozy home)

525
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:11,615
(What kind of local Porto meal
will they get to taste?)

526
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,883
I wonder what it'll be.

527
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:15,218
(Anticipating)

528
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:20,557
(Finally, a local Porto meal)

529
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:23,727
- This is...
- It smells so good.

530
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:27,531
It smells delicious.

531
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:31,368
The smell hits the spot for Koreans.

532
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:34,171
So there's this kind of dish
in Porto, huh?

533
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:38,742
It's seafood rice.

534
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:40,010
Seafood rice?

535
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:42,045
It smells so food.

536
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,847
It is literally seafood rice.

537
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:46,616
What's in here?

538
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:51,121
Seafood and rice.

539
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:52,823
(Simple)

540
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,224
Seafood and rice.

541
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,529
(A traditional Porto dish, seafood rice)

542
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,767
(In the 15th century,
fishing was a main source of livelihood.)

543
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:08,905
(They started to add rice
to the fresh seafood for an easy meal.)

544
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:13,110
(Flavorful seafood rice
that holds Portugal's history)

545
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:16,513
(In a mussel broth with tomato paste)

546
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,751
(An array of Porto's fresh seafood
is added.)

547
00:25:21,284 --> 00:25:24,655
(Then comes the white rice,
a staple for every Korean.)

548
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:36,867
(Wait until the soupy broth to reduce)

549
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:45,542
(And you've got a hearty seafood rice
full of ocean aroma.)

550
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:50,280
(Seafood Rice
Dish full of various seafood and rice)

551
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:57,054
It's local food made at home.

552
00:25:57,054 --> 00:26:01,091
Please enjoy it as if you were at home.

553
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:02,192
Thank you.

554
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:10,400
(Their first taste
of the local Porto dish.)

555
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:16,173
It's delicious.

556
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:20,777
(Impressed)

557
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:22,245
This is so good.

558
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:24,214
The aroma is unbelievable.

559
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:27,951
There's only seafood in it.

560
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,188
Just seafood?

561
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:32,589
The soup is incredibly rich.

562
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,393
The soup is really rich.
It's so delicious.

563
00:26:36,593 --> 00:26:38,195
The umami flavor in this...

564
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:39,229
The umami flavor is insane.

565
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:40,864
It's as if she's added tons of MSG.

566
00:26:40,864 --> 00:26:43,433
The shrimp head hold all the flavor.

567
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,102
Shrimp's gut, not head.

568
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:46,970
Umami from shrimp's gut and clams...

569
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,839
These clams are like short-neck clams.

570
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,273
Plus, there's mussels.

571
00:26:50,273 --> 00:26:53,543
Mussels are like an umami bomb.
It's packed in there.

572
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:54,911
It has that deep flavor.

573
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,913
The umami is insane.

574
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:58,649
It's no joke.

575
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:01,251
It has that texture
like a kimchi porridge.

576
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:03,887
It's soft and creamy.

577
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:05,122
It's really delicious.

578
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:08,592
(The ultimate flavor of Porto's ocean)

579
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,928
It taste similar to kkotgaetang
(spicy blue crab stew)

580
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:12,062
or haemultang (seafood stew).

581
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:15,799
A super delicious spicy blue crab stew.

582
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,535
It's really rich.

583
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:21,271
I can't believe a taste like this
exists on the other side of the world.

584
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,639
It tastes so familiar.

585
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:23,740
How could this be?

586
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,875
It's so good.

587
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:26,343
Thank you.

588
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:28,078
It tastes like a Korean dish.

589
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:29,546
Seriously.

590
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:32,182
I need a word that's more than delicious,
but it's so delicious.

591
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:35,585
There's still lots of dishes left.

592
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:43,794
Do Koreans enjoy
having many dishes served at once?

593
00:27:43,794 --> 00:27:47,064
There's no order.
We just enjoy everything all at once.

594
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:48,899
We put everything on the table.

595
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,336
She understood you
without the translation.

596
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:53,804
Really?

597
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:56,807
Grandmas know everything.

598
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:58,275
- She's good.
- She is.

599
00:27:58,275 --> 00:27:59,843
That's the...

600
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,013
- This is that.
- What is it?

601
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:05,849
Cataplana.

602
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:09,586
This is the innards.

603
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:10,988
It looks like tripe.

604
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:12,789
They eat innards here?

605
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:13,890
I guess so.

606
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,292
(Salivating)

607
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:18,762
(Crispy and moist grilled sardines)

608
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:25,202
(Even before they get a chance to look,
the table quickly fills with dishes.)

609
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:29,506
It really feels like a home-cooked meal
since the table is full.

610
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:30,907
It does.

611
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:34,578
- This is Portugal's ttukbegi (stone pot).
- What is this?

612
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:36,279
There meat.

613
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:39,983
- Cataplana.
- Cataplana.

614
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,919
(Let us tell you about cataplana.)

615
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:46,123
(Cataplana is a name of a pot,
not a dish.)

616
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:51,228
(Cataplana / Name of a pot
that opens and closes like a clam)

617
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:53,597
(Steam, stew, noodles, rice)

618
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:57,100
(It can be used for all kinds of dishes.)

619
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:01,271
(The main ingredients for today's dish
are pork and clams.)

620
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:05,909
(The pork was cooked and fried
in the cataplana.)

621
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:09,079
(Then, clams are added.)

622
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,483
(The lid gets closed and that allows
the steam to cook everything inside.)

623
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:18,555
(A steam massage to top it all off)

624
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:20,690
(Alentejo-style
Stir-Fried Pork and Clam Cataplana)

625
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:23,060
(Pork and clams are stir-fried together,
then gently steamed)

626
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:26,063
It smells like
she's used some sort of a spice.

627
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:28,699
- So this is pork?
- It kind of smells like lamb.

628
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,501
- I smell cumin.
- You're right.

629
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:33,170
Was cumin used for this dish?

630
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,072
That's right.

631
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,842
It's what you have with lamb skewers.

632
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:41,244
There's cumin in here.

633
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:48,518
It's like jangjorim (soy-braised beef).

634
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:50,354
- Jangjorim?
- Yeah, this is jangjorim.

635
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:53,690
It's in between jangjorim
and sanjuk (beef skewer).

636
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,258
That's what it taste like.

637
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:57,361
(You can almost see it
from the way it’s described.)

638
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:59,830
You can kill a bowl of rice
with just this.

639
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:02,933
(Pleased)

640
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:08,071
That's it.

641
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:09,573
Now that I see the bottom of the pot,

642
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:13,043
she's made a gambas al ajillo
with pork and clam.

643
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:14,745
She cooked it in oil.

644
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:18,448
When you're cooking gambas al ajillo,
you cook the garlic in oil,

645
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:20,017
add some chicken powder,

646
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:21,551
add shrimp,
then turn off the heat.

647
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:23,954
Then the shrimp cooks just right.

648
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:25,789
This is good.

649
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:28,025
The combination of meat broth
and clam broth is fantastic.

650
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:29,159
So delicious.

651
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,630
(Only delicious things here
for stir-fried pork and clam cataplana)

652
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:37,034
She's made a gambas al ajillo
with pork and clam.

653
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:38,835
Gambas al ajillo
with pork and clam.

654
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:40,771
(We're missing something.)

655
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:51,415
Is there some bread?

656
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,884
Dip the bread in this.

657
00:30:53,884 --> 00:30:55,986
You need to have bread with this dish.

658
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:57,954
I really needed bread.

659
00:30:57,954 --> 00:30:59,356
(Su Young is just built differently.)

660
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:00,557
With clams...

661
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,928
(For the happiness of this moment)

662
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:14,604
(No words are needed.)

663
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:16,306
Perfect.

664
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,743
(You know how to eat, huh?)

665
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:21,611
We need to try this too.

666
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:23,347
- Right.
- We should try this.

667
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:25,949
Older men like us love
naejangtang (innards stew).

668
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:27,184
I'm so curious.

669
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:33,023
(Made with beef innards,
white beans, chorizo, and more)

670
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:39,162
(A rich beef innards stew
made by slowly cooking for a long time.)

671
00:31:39,162 --> 00:31:43,700
("Tripeiros" / There's even a word
for those who enjoy Tripas.)

672
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:47,738
(What does tripas,
Portugal's soul food, taste like?)

673
00:31:50,774 --> 00:31:51,908
Goodness.

674
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:00,917
(Why?)

675
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:06,289
Hey, this...

676
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:09,292
It'll taste like budaejjigae (army stew)
if you just add gochujang.

677
00:32:09,793 --> 00:32:11,995
- There is that taste.
- Budaejjigae.

678
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:13,864
You're right. It's totally budaejjigae.

679
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:17,601
(Kkotgaetang, jangjorim, and now,
budaejjigae? A parallel universe?)

680
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,603
I think it's because of the beans.

681
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:23,273
It's kind of similar
to us adding baked beans.

682
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:24,775
You're right.

683
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:27,210
And there's some meat.
It's not ham though.

684
00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:30,213
This kind of smells like ham.

685
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:32,349
Salsichão.

686
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:34,217
It's salsichão.

687
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:36,586
(What's salsichão?)

688
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:39,289
Pepperoni has paprika powder in it,

689
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:40,724
so it's red and a bit spicy.

690
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:43,527
Salsichão is that without the paprika.

691
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:44,895
(Salsichão / Pork sausage
that's added to boost the flavor)

692
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:46,263
It taste different from chorizo.

693
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:47,731
It's much for flavorful.

694
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:48,965
(A traditional recipe that enhances
the flavor and adds a meaty aroma)

695
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:51,234
That's why it taste like budaejjigae.

696
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:55,972
Feels like a real grandma-style cooking.

697
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:57,240
That's so true.

698
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,642
(As expected from a local meal master.)

699
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:03,347
(Mesmerized by the master's skills,
they begin a mukbang.)

700
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,882
(They use their left hand.)

701
00:33:05,882 --> 00:33:08,185
(Also their right)

702
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,120
(Wipe some sweat off)

703
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,323
(Then, go back into never-ending mukbang.)

704
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,229
Ah!

705
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:24,287
When you're eating,
you need to take your time...

706
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:26,770
and really enjoy the flavors.

707
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,373
(Embarrassed)

708
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:31,908
Slowly, while enjoying.

709
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:34,911
When I see Koreans at a restaurant,

710
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:40,250
they always eat so fast then leave.
Why is that?

711
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:42,519
(For Elena, it's hard to understand
why Koreans eat so fast.)

712
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,921
We’re just so used to
the fast-paced life in Korea.

713
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:46,890
You need to do everything fast in Korea.

714
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,693
You should be enjoying your time
while eating,

715
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:51,728
but Koreans are always eager to move on.

716
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:53,230
We try to hit another attraction.

717
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,098
In Portugal,
how long does a typical meal last?

718
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:56,366
It seems like you take your time.

719
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:02,706
Usually, three to four hours.

720
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:05,609
(That's unimaginable in Korea.)

721
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:08,979
(This is just standard.)

722
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:11,148
Shall we also slow down
and enjoy this time?

723
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:12,916
May I ask for her age?

724
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,551
I'm 68.

725
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:17,187
(Now that the mukbang has stopped,
it's time to talk.)

726
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:23,360
Kihyun looks like he's in his early 20s.

727
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:25,862
Early 20s?

728
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:29,132
Please tell her I'm 32.

729
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,837
(What? 32? No way)

730
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:36,340
(You look so young.)

731
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,075
Thank you.

732
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:40,243
Lucky you.

733
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,014
How old is Kyung Ho?

734
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:47,517
What do you think?
Try guessing my age.

735
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:51,722
You're really beautiful.

736
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:55,859
(Anticipating)

737
00:35:01,698 --> 00:35:02,933
50 years old.

738
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:05,869
50 years old.

739
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:07,971
(Her humor makes everyone laugh.)

740
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:09,172
Poor Kyung Ho.

741
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:10,941
It's just my hair right now.

742
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:12,643
I'm five years younger than that.

743
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,845
(It was a joke.)

744
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:18,281
Did you cook everything here for us?

745
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:20,150
Of course.

746
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:32,629
I tried to cook the dishes
you probably haven't tried before.

747
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:35,799
She's so generous with portions
just like my grandma.

748
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:39,670
It's like she's saying, "Eat lots."
There's so much food.

749
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,071
I enjoy cooking.

750
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:46,009
When I see people enjoying my cooking,

751
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:49,313
it's very rewarding,
so I don't think it's tiring.

752
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,649
We also like to cook.

753
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:58,488
A long time ago in the countryside,
girls had to start working at a young age.

754
00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:03,794
Men couldn't learn how to cook back then.

755
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:06,563
It's the same as Korea.

756
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:08,365
Korea was like that too.

757
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:12,369
These days, men cook as well,
but that's what it was like back then.

758
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,105
"Only the hen should cluck in the kitchen,
and the rooster should stay silent."

759
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:17,507
So, we'd have a doll of a hen
in the kitchen.

760
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,609
Like "This is my territory."

761
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:22,713
It's so interesting to learn
about a similar culture.

762
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:25,449
Taking our time to eat is nice.
We get to talk,

763
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,417
get the food digested...

764
00:36:28,151 --> 00:36:29,386
It was seriously delicious.

765
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:31,321
Every dish had her heart in it.

766
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:33,457
Beyond borders,

767
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:37,561
every mom's heart
that goes into cooking is the same.

768
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:40,797
I could feel her love and care.

769
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:42,733
That little nervousness
and awkwardness I had...

770
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,670
totally melted once I started eating,
and it was as if we were close.

771
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,239
Just imagine how many meals
she’s cooked over the years.

772
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,574
Imagine how many meals she cooked...

773
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:52,175
to take care of her children.

774
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:53,577
Every single dish...

775
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,779
felt like a part of her life.

776
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:58,782
Each recipe helped build...

777
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:00,250
the foundation of her life.

778
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:02,919
So, if we had the time,
I really wanted to learn.

779
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:08,325
I don't have much skills
compare to you,

780
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:10,193
but if it's possible,

781
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:14,598
I'd love to make some side dishes
with things in your fridge.

782
00:37:15,332 --> 00:37:17,934
(A Ryu-cipe dish for the master?)

783
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:19,836
Would that be okay for you?

784
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,005
(Sure. That'd be great.)

785
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:27,344
(Finally enters the kitchen)

786
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:29,246
(The first Ryu-cipe will be born
from this kitchen.)

787
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,914
Let's see what she has.

788
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:35,485
These are all frozen.

789
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:36,953
(After receiving her permission,
he checks her fridge.)

790
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:38,855
There's paprika powder.

791
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,658
Garlic.

792
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,195
Could you peel these?

793
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:47,197
(Asking the brothers to help with garlic)

794
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,800
There's meat. There are two kinds of meat.

795
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,668
There's one leek.

796
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,004
There's some pork.

797
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:56,606
(The main ingredient will be pork.)

798
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,342
There are some clams left.

799
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:00,978
Nice.

800
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,447
Okay. Some leftover wine from earlier.

801
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:07,417
(Pork, clams, leek, onion,
garlic, white wine, vinegar)

802
00:38:07,784 --> 00:38:10,921
(What will Ryu Su Young...)

803
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:14,791
(No, culinary student Eo Nam Seon
showcase as his first Ryu-cipe?)

804
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:18,462
Ah...

805
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:19,963
(Instead of the sound of chopping,
Su Young lets out a single gasp.)

806
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:22,499
What are you looking for?

807
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:24,101
(Instead of the sound of chopping,
Su Young lets out a single gasp.)

808
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,537
(Rummaging)

809
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:36,113
(He doesn't start cooking,
but begins to search the kitchen.)

810
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,650
I thought she'd have soy sauce,
but I was wrong.

811
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,919
It feels like grandmas would surely have
soy sauce or doenjang.

812
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:44,221
There's none of that.

813
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:48,425
It felt so comfortable here,
I just thought...

814
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,693
Do you just need soy sauce?

815
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:51,495
If there's soy sauce,
I can make something work.

816
00:38:53,163 --> 00:38:55,265
It was stupid of me

817
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:57,401
to think that she'd have soy sauce.

818
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,636
You just need soy sauce?

819
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:00,737
Even just a soy sauce...

820
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:02,072
You're going to go get it?

821
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:03,373
Is there an Asian mart nearby?

822
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:05,309
I mean, I brought some with me...

823
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,743
just in case I wanted to use it...

824
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:08,745
in my recipe, but...

825
00:39:08,745 --> 00:39:10,314
You have that?

826
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,082
- Now?
- I packed it with me.

827
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:13,583
- Now?
- Yeah.

828
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:15,085
Is this a magic bag?

829
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:17,120
It's a magic bag.
You have it now?

830
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,489
Wait, I need to see
if I've also packed soy sauce.

831
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:21,658
Don't hide it and let me see.

832
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:23,627
What? What is this?

833
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,495
I need to develop recipes, so...

834
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:27,497
This is what people bring for camping.

835
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,066
That's right. It's here.

836
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,501
A seasoning kit.

837
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:34,438
(Everything you need
for basic seasoning is right here.)

838
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:38,742
(Soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, salt,
sesame seed oil, and more)

839
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:43,113
(Kyung Ho has brought this seasoning kit
from home.)

840
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,248
Lend me some.

841
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:46,817
Of course. We're family.

842
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:48,585
Even doenjang and gochujang.

843
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:50,554
(He even has doenjang and gochujang,
the ultimate duo of Korean condiments.)

844
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,256
She can't eat spicy things,
so I'll just use doenjang.

845
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:58,462
- You need to leave some for me.
- Thank you, Mary Poppins.

846
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,030
You're my dream.

847
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,131
I'm your biggest fan now.

848
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:03,867
So close to disaster.

849
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,869
There's was only salt.

850
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,273
Thank you.

851
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:11,441
(All the ingredients are ready now.)

852
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,043
(What's Mr. Eo's first Ryu-cipe?)

853
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,778
There were some clams.

854
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:17,314
There were some clams leftover
from cooking for us.

855
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,983
Clams go well with doenjang,

856
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,652
and I'm going to add pork too,

857
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,253
so it'll taste good.

858
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:26,723
She feels like my mother,
so I wanted her to try some jang (paste).

859
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:31,094
I'm going to make some gangdoenjang
(thick soybean paste stew) using pork.

860
00:40:33,296 --> 00:40:34,564
This is bone-in.

861
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,634
Technically, pork belly
is part of the rib section,

862
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:39,903
so they've prepared it like LA galbi
(braised short rib).

863
00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:41,571
So it's bone-in.

864
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:45,509
Every country had their own way
of preparing meat.

865
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:46,576
It's so interesting.

866
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:48,245
(Bite-sized pork is ready.)

867
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:53,417
(Add the pork to a heated pan.)

868
00:40:57,954 --> 00:41:01,792
(Basic seasoning / 1T pepper, 0.5T salt)

869
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:11,635
(Using leftover white wine
to get rid of the smell.)

870
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:24,548
(Add vinegar for smell and juice.)

871
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:35,792
(1 finely chopped onion,
6 garlic cloves or as much as you want)

872
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:40,464
(Stir-fry the onion and garlic.)

873
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,035
(Add the clams.)

874
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,937
Clams bring an umami flavor,

875
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,339
so I decided to use it for a new dish.

876
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,746
(Cook over high heat
until the clams open.)

877
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,582
(Clams have opened up.)

878
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:08,091
(Doenjang, one of the ultimate duo)

879
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:13,830
(For the first Ryu-cipe,
doenjang is the kick.)

880
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,902
(Using doenjang,
a Korean condiment, as a kick)

881
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:24,007
(Coat the pork and clams evenly
with doenjang.)

882
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:34,117
(What did he take out from the fridge?)

883
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,691
(Paprika powder to add a little spice
instead of red pepper powder)

884
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:45,495
(Adding a little spice
with 2T of paprika powder)

885
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:52,169
(Checking the spice level
for the master.)

886
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,871
The powder isn't really spicy.
Let's add more.

887
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,775
(Additional 1T paprika powder)

888
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:03,013
(3T paprika powder for a little spice
instead of red pepper powder)

889
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,985
(1T sugar)

890
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:13,523
(Add 250ml of water
so that it soaks up the flavor.)

891
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,863
(Reduce until it has soaked up
the seasoning.)

892
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,203
Do you need help?

893
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,371
I'm done.

894
00:43:27,637 --> 00:43:28,939
That smell...

895
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,407
It's Korea.

896
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,409
We're totally in Korea.

897
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:37,981
Portugal dishes
are often eaten with bread.

898
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:40,417
So, I think
they like things a little salty.

899
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,786
It might be a bit strong, but taste some.

900
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,922
(Eyes fixed)

901
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:47,024
I might be salty.

902
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:50,427
(Kihyun tastes the first Ryu-cipe.)

903
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,529
(How is it?)

904
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:57,801
(It makes you dance even without music.)

905
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,503
- It's making me dance.
- Yeah?

906
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,439
If it's making you crave soju,
I've succeeded.

907
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,676
- Su Young.
- Yeah?

908
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:06,877
It's already game over.

909
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,478
- It's good?
- Yes, it taste good.

910
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:13,350
(A taste you cannot escape from,
thick doenjang stew with pork and clam)

911
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,754
Could I taste test?

912
00:44:17,754 --> 00:44:18,855
This is unbelievable.

913
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:20,857
I just finished making a dish.
Do you want to try it?

914
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:27,664
(What does Kyung Ho,
the seasoning expert, have to say?)

915
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:30,901
- I think she'll really like it.
- Should I season it more?

916
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,303
- She might like that.
- Yeah.

917
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:35,806
This much reducing in enough.

918
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,174
The texture of the meat is so nice.

919
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,608
- Tender, right?
- Yeah.

920
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:41,178
It's delicious.
It's an emergency situation inside.

921
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:45,382
- It's good?
- Very good.

922
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:48,151
I think it taste so good,

923
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:51,054
but I'm not sure what you'll think.

924
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:52,456
I hope you like it.

925
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,560
If you thought it was delicious,
I think I'll enjoy it too.

926
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,829
She thinks I'm cute.

927
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,832
I was in the Korean army
until two weeks ago.

928
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,905
(To get a "t'as bon," finish it off
with chopped leek and 1T sesame seed oil.)

929
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:10,140
Sesame seed oil.

930
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:16,313
(A simple and easy dish
with ingredients at home)

931
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:20,117
(The first Ryu-cipe has been executed.)

932
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,754
(Gangdoenjang
with pork and clam)

933
00:45:22,778 --> 00:45:26,056
(Dish made by stir-frying pork and clams,
then reduced)

934
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,526
(It's time for the local meal master
to taste it.)

935
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,162
(The master's eyes
are also fixed on the dish.)

936
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,571
(The two brothers are also nervous.)

937
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,808
I don't taste the soy sauce.

938
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,110
I didn't use soy sauce.
I added doenjang.

939
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:51,415
Earlier, you cooked pork and clams in oil.

940
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,517
Your dish inspired me to cook this.

941
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,285
I remembered your dish,

942
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,354
and made pork gangdoenjang.

943
00:45:57,854 --> 00:46:02,926
(A new Ryu-cipe is born
with doenjang as a kick.)

944
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,294
It might taste unfamiliar.

945
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,629
It's good.

946
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,097
- She says it's good.
- Yeah?

947
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,298
She's eating it so well.

948
00:46:08,598 --> 00:46:09,900
Obrigado.

949
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,705
The sauce is delicious.

950
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:21,278
I think it's tastier than my dish.

951
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,747
It's called doenjang.
It's a paste made from fermented beans.

952
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,950
If you wrap it like this, it's better.

953
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,887
(What did Kihyun just suggest?)

954
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,358
There's a small radish.

955
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,126
It smells like kohlrabi.

956
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:37,861
Good.

957
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,764
(Ryu-cipe's hidden kick!
Kohlrabi pickle)

958
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:44,601
4T of vinegar and 2T of sugar.

959
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,837
Also, add some salt and let it sit...

960
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:47,804
for quick pickling.

961
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:51,341
It only need 20 minutes to pickle,

962
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,676
so now, you've also made some pickles.

963
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:57,514
(Super simple kohlrabi pickle
has been executed)

964
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,519
(That is good together.)

965
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,256
I usually pair my dishes with potatoes,

966
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:09,426
but I like that this dish goes well
with pickles.)

967
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,696
(First Ryu-cipe
at the first study abroad location)

968
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,297
(Gangdoenjang with pork
and clams feat. kohlrabi pickle)

969
00:47:14,297 --> 00:47:16,233
That dish Su Young made...

970
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:19,202
As soon as it entered my mouth,
I was like, "This is so good."

971
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:23,440
Grab any Korean on the street
and ask to taste this dish.

972
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,008
They'd say it's delicious.

973
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,410
He's admirable.

974
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,612
He just pulls off everything so easily.

975
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,213
(He's an incredible person.)

976
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:38,755
How you cooked it
makes it so delicious.

977
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,825
Thank you.

978
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,295
Obrigado.

979
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:49,933
I should take this
to my family to share.

980
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,235
Thank you.

981
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:55,839
They've never had Korean food,
so I think they'll like it.

982
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:02,012
Thank you for this incredible dish.

983
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,749
We're tasting it with some Vinho Verde,
and it's delicious.

984
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,384
Thank you.

985
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,785
(Mr. Eo's Gangdoenjang
with Pork and Clams)

986
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,754
(1. Cut the pork into cubes and stir-fry.
2. Season with 1T pepper, 0.5 salt)

987
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,289
(3. Drizzle vinegar around 2 times.
4. Add garlic, onion, clams and stir-fry.)

988
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,324
(5. When clams open, add doenjang,
paprika, sugar. / 6. Add water.)

989
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,559
(7. Once reduced, add chopped leeks
and 1T sesame seed oil.)

990
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,429
(If you've come
on a culinary study abroad)

991
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,132
(Experience)

992
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:24,701
(And taste many dishes)

993
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,203
This is good.

994
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:31,875
(If you've eaten, it's time to learn.)

995
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:34,378
(Execute a recipe.)

996
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:38,181
(Every night, a new Ryu-cipe is born.)

997
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:43,053
(Together with the three brothers' kick)

998
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,755
Isn't this genius?

999
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,191
(A new Ryu-cipe will be revealed.)

1000
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,162
(The three brothers
head to the next location.)

1001
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,399
I'm so full, it's making me happy.

1002
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,466
It's nice.

1003
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,371
When people see us,
they might think we're just having fun.

1004
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,040
But we're working really hard right now.

1005
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,174
We are working hard.

1006
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,575
- Right?
- Yes.

1007
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,344
How much harder are you planning to work?

1008
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,813
We had a meal here today.

1009
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,381
So, we need to develop something
from that, right?

1010
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,916
That's probably right.

1011
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,285
I hear fado.

1012
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,154
We need to listen to fado.

1013
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:20,924
It's traditional Portuguese music
known for its deep emotions,

1014
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,393
and I heard that we need to hear it.

1015
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,795
(Fado / A traditional Portuguese music
with themes of longing and sorrow)

1016
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,029
Let's listen to it tonight.

1017
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:27,230
Sure.

1018
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,199
<i>A rocky island</i>

1019
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,036
<i>Where waves crash and break</i>

1020
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,104
("Rocky Island" by Kim Won Joong, 1984)

1021
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,706
Kihyun doesn't know this.

1022
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,975
What song is that?

1023
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,043
<i>A rocky island</i>

1024
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,145
- You don't know this song?
- I don't.

1025
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,313
It's called "Rocky Island."

1026
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,450
If you're singing a song
with "pado" in it like waves, I know UN...

1027
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,217
I know that song.

1028
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:53,323
<i>A stunning beach
that sparkles in the sunlight</i>

1029
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,625
It's fado, not pado.

1030
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,961
- You're fado, Su Young.
- Fado?

1031
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,665
You're such a fabo-lous person.

1032
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,799
What is that?

1033
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,534
What?

1034
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,103
What is that?

1035
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,705
There are people gathered over there.

1036
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,141
They must be doing acrobatics.

1037
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,577
- Should we go look?
- That's cool.

1038
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,012
(Acrobatics unfolding
in the middle of a crowd)

1039
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,847
This is also part of the study, right?

1040
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,981
Of course.

1041
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,651
(Seeing is also studying!
The three brothers take the chance.)

1042
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,254
This is cool.

1043
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,325
(Spectacular moves
you can't take your eyes off of)

1044
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,626
That's amazing.

1045
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,561
How could they do that in the air...

1046
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,699
(In awe of the advanced acrobatic moves)

1047
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,801
Kyung Ho likes yoga.

1048
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,574
(Stunned by the aerial flip)

1049
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,411
That's insane.

1050
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,117
It was a great performance.

1051
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,420
How long have you been performing for?

1052
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,557
We also love bringing people to try it.

1053
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,893
Would you like to try it?

1054
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,996
I'm so...

1055
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:08,965
(Scratching his head
as a way of saying no)

1056
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,802
I'm so big.

1057
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:17,541
(Then, the next target is Kihyun,
the youngest.)

1058
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,178
Really?

1059
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,180
- Should I do it?
- Do it.

1060
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,481
You want me to do it?

1061
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,450
I can do this? Really?

1062
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,584
I mean, we can't.

1063
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,086
- I thought it was a joke.
- Only you can do it.

1064
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:31,955
(The brave youngest
goes for the challenge.)

1065
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:34,157
They're really going to do it?

1066
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:39,763
(The goofy brothers are loving
this sudden turn of events.)

1067
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,064
I was just joking.

1068
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,800
I dance.

1069
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,203
Kihyun, are you okay?

1070
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,105
I'm not okay.

1071
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,007
(Even though he's an idol,
nervous for the acrobatic moves)

1072
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,541
Be careful.

1073
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,016
Look up and open the hands.

1074
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:04,921
(Success in first try)

1075
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,891
I'm so scared.

1076
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,826
- You're good.
- So scared.

1077
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,664
(Who cares? The brothers are having fun.)

1078
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:14,731
This works?

1079
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:21,505
(His fear goes away
and he's relaxed enough to ask questions.)

1080
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,248
Kihyun, you're good.

1081
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,485
(That's our youngest for you.)

1082
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:36,920
(You go, Kihyun)

1083
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,355
He's good.

1084
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,956
That's crazy.

1085
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,526
(Everyone is pleased at the sight.)

1086
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,328
Now, put your knees on my hands.

1087
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,029
Okay.

1088
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,465
Up.

1089
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:53,704
(How is he doing this?
He's moving like they're a team.)

1090
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,307
Now, stand.

1091
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,880
(Even succeeds an advanced move
on his first try)

1092
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,417
He looks like he's been practicing this
for three nights and four days.

1093
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,986
To show that this wasn't planned,

1094
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:10,587
how about you go and try?

1095
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:11,688
It's be dangerous for me.

1096
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:18,662
(Perfect teamwork)

1097
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,802
(What a true idol!
Finishing with a bow)

1098
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,140
Now it's your turn.

1099
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,375
No.

1100
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,077
(Su Young pushes Kyung Ho to it.)

1101
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,779
I can't do it.

1102
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,681
- Kyung Ho, try.
- I'm too heavy.

1103
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:38,915
I'm also heavy.

1104
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,050
We’re about the same weight.

1105
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,385
Rock, paper, scissors then.

1106
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,654
- It's not a top-down hierarchy.
- I can't do it.

1107
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,155
I have bad knees.

1108
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:49,426
(At that moment,
the performer approaches them.)

1109
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,163
(Nervous)

1110
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:57,167
(Who will get to fly the skies of Porto?)

1111
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,404
(It's Yoon Kyung Ho.)

1112
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:01,471
I'm so heavy.

1113
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,308
I weigh too much.

1114
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:07,144
Really?

1115
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:09,913
Seriously?

1116
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:10,914
(Korean slips out in a moment of panic.)

1117
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,616
Here.

1118
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,721
(Searching for help)

1119
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,022
I'm too big.

1120
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:20,824
So big.

1121
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,160
(Tries to get away until the end)

1122
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:29,032
(Frantically looking for a religion.)

1123
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:32,869
Will it work?

1124
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,671
Take off my shoes?

1125
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,373
(You can keep your shoes on, so relax.)

1126
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:43,213
(Kyung Ho is tense with nervousness.)

1127
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,552
(Kyung Ho flies.)

1128
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:58,996
(Is this happening?)

1129
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:01,865
I can fly.

1130
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:06,370
(gasp)

1131
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,878
Gosh.

1132
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,416
(Flapping)

1133
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,987
I'm scared.

1134
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:25,922
That works?

1135
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,258
He's so strong.

1136
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,993
Goodness!

1137
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,265
(Tough day for Kyung Ho)

1138
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,502
I’m so embarrassed. I’m mortified.

1139
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:40,671
I came here to cook.

1140
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,240
I didn't think
I'd be up in the air like that.

1141
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,343
Acrobatics...
He spun me 180 degrees in the air.

1142
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,446
The performer who did that
was quite something.

1143
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,549
I’m so embarrassed. I’m mortified.

1144
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:57,587
(But it goes on
despite him feeling embarrassed.)

1145
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,724
(Embarrassed)

1146
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:02,526
(Everyone is having fun
except for Kyung Ho.)

1147
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:03,994
(I can't look.)

1148
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,595
This is so funny.

1149
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,497
- This is crazy.
- This is too funny.

1150
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,567
Goodness.

1151
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:13,837
(Wobbling body)

1152
00:56:14,638 --> 00:56:17,274
(Quick to help)

1153
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:20,677
(That's not it.)

1154
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:25,282
(A tough day for the performer as well)

1155
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:28,385
(You can do it.)

1156
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,056
(A bit awkward,
but Kyung Ho made it all the way.)

1157
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:43,800
(It was a quick taste of heaven.)

1158
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,072
Was it okay?

1159
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,741
I seriously didn't think he'd lift me.

1160
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:52,309
He lifted me.

1161
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,677
You're amazing too.

1162
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:55,078
You made me do it.

1163
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,446
How did you do it?

1164
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,448
(Amazing brothers
who can even pull off acrobatics.)

1165
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,017
- I see you differently now.
- We're here anyway.

1166
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,818
You made everyone happy.

1167
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:03,220
I was really scared though.

1168
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,588
Starting from you making a cross.

1169
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,923
No, I was actually scared.

1170
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,196
What are we going to eat?

1171
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,965
What they eat the most here...

1172
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,133
We've heard about it a lot.

1173
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:19,036
(Their second itinerary in Porto
is to find the region's specialty.)

1174
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,237
We're here.

1175
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,674
Baca... bacalho...

1176
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:28,011
(This ingredient is hard to pronounce.)

1177
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,314
How many bacalhau are here?

1178
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:31,481
Everything's bacalhau.

1179
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,483
It all says bacalhau.

1180
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,619
It's a cod restaurant.

1181
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:42,559
(Bacalhau is a salted cod.)

1182
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,197
(Porto's specialty ingredient, bacalhau)

1183
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:57,874
(Cod freshly caught
from the Atlantic Ocean)

1184
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:06,350
(Salted)

1185
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:12,489
(Dried for 3 weeks)

1186
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:18,895
(Bacalhau is made by salting and drying.)

1187
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,064
It's after the Age of Discovery,

1188
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,767
so they started eating this
since the 15th and 16th centuries.

1189
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,303
There weren't fridges back then,

1190
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,772
so fresh cod was heavily salted
to preserve it before bringing it by ship.

1191
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:35,612
(An ingredient loved by the Portuguese
for more than five centuries)

1192
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:39,182
(Portuguese eat dreams to live)

1193
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:44,121
(And eat bacalhau to survive)

1194
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:48,592
There are lots of different ways
of cooking bacalhau in Portugal.

1195
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,427
There are more than a thousand recipes

1196
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:52,095
that uses bacalhau.

1197
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:56,667
(A specialty ingredient
you can find easily across Portugal)

1198
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:03,974
(Various recipes using bacalhau)

1199
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:09,546
(An array of captivating bacalhau dishes)

1200
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:15,686
(Cooked by steaming, grilling, and frying)

1201
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:20,424
(Bacalhau,
a signature ingredient of Porto)

1202
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,359
I feel like they've done
everything they can with cod.

1203
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:23,393
You're right.

1204
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,962
They really eat cod in so many ways here.

1205
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,831
So, I heard about bacalhau...

1206
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:32,336
when I told some people
that I'd be going to Porto.

1207
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:33,970
They said I was probably going to eat it.

1208
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,306
And they added that...

1209
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:39,810
because so many things are salted here,

1210
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,712
it was too salty for them to eat it.

1211
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:43,013
They said it was way too salty.

1212
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,848
(How salty could it be?)

1213
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:46,216
It's here?

1214
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:48,752
It's here.

1215
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,387
(Time to finally taste the bacalhau
we've only heard about.)

1216
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,756
(Tartare?)

1217
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,958
(Carpaccio?)

1218
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,526
These are appetizers?

1219
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,462
(Bacalhau appetizers,
tartare and carpaccio)

1220
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:01,765
They made it with salted bacalhau.

1221
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,500
They used it to make these.

1222
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:10,807
(Thin slices of bacalhau)

1223
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,877
(Topped with fresh salad)

1224
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:19,750
Bacalhau carpaccio.

1225
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:26,990
(They finally get to try bacalhau.)

1226
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:31,194
The scent of truffle...

1227
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,698
I can't even tell if this is cod.

1228
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:38,468
They said these
were salted for a long time,

1229
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,337
so I was expecting
a fermented ammonia smell.

1230
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:41,872
Kind of like fermented skate.

1231
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:43,774
When I first put it in my mouth,

1232
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:46,510
it felt like I was going to smell
that fermented scent, but...

1233
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,412
- It's nothing like that.
- Nope.

1234
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:51,548
It's been salted,
so it's not like fermented skate.

1235
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:53,083
It doesn't have that ammonia smell.

1236
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:56,453
You start to feel that saltiness
when the truffle oil steps in.

1237
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:58,655
The truffle oil...

1238
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,123
goes so well with it.

1239
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,591
(A perfect combination
of salted bacalhau and truffle oil)

1240
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:02,826
Interesting.

1241
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,228
The meat sort of breaks.

1242
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,965
It kind of feels like
semi-dried fish jerky.

1243
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:13,503
I'm familiar
with semi-dried squid or octopus...

1244
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,871
since I've tasted it,

1245
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,640
but I've never had anything like that
with a fish.

1246
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,141
Let's try it.

1247
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,411
(Second appetizer)

1248
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:27,284
(Thick cuts of bacalhau
paired with sweet and tangy sauce)

1249
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:31,688
(Bacalhau Tartare)

1250
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,365
The texture is way better.

1251
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,736
(Thick cuts of meat
make the texture different)

1252
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:50,340
(Totally different
from thinly-sliced carpaccio)

1253
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,010
It's kind of like a Cobb salad.

1254
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,144
(Diced salad
reminds them of a Cobb salad.)

1255
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:56,346
They only used vinegar and olive oil,
so it's light and refreshing.

1256
01:01:56,747 --> 01:01:58,649
(Refreshing to the max,
thanks to vinegar and olive oil)

1257
01:01:58,649 --> 01:01:59,883
It goes well with mango.

1258
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,919
This is mango, but it's different
from the soft mango we know.

1259
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,688
Unripe mango.

1260
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:08,225
That's why
there's that sweet and sour taste.

1261
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:11,094
It's not familiar to us,
but unripe mango is often used in cooking.

1262
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,362
It taste tangy.

1263
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:13,930
(The tangy flavor
from the unripe mango is the kick.)

1264
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,832
- Tasty.
- It's delicious. Nice.

1265
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:20,937
Appetizer, carpaccio.

1266
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,440
(A true study-abroad student
makes notes even when eating.)

1267
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,741
Later, if I can't remember,

1268
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,643
- can I look at your notes?
- Yes.

1269
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:32,616
Then the description will be the same.

1270
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,551
- No, just what we've had.
- No.

1271
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:36,687
- No cheating.
- Then I should write this down too.

1272
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:39,489
Writing notes is important.
You forget if you don't.

1273
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:42,359
Now that’s the spirit
of a study abroad student.

1274
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:45,729
A bite, and write a note.

1275
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:49,199
(The main dish is here.)

1276
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:50,934
Look at this.

1277
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,504
(It's not just one!
Endless dishes of bacalhau)

1278
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:59,576
(A variety of dishes
with bacalhau cooked in different ways)

1279
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,146
For this one,
I think we'll be able...

1280
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,949
to properly taste the bacalhau.

1281
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:07,417
This one has to taste good.

1282
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,419
This will be good, no doubt.

1283
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,255
(The most common way
of cooking bacalhau in Porto)

1284
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:15,392
(Grilled thick cuts of bacalhau)

1285
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:19,429
(Are eaten with potatoes
and radish greens)

1286
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:23,934
(Bacalhau steak)

1287
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:33,944
(Can't hide the smile)

1288
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:35,512
Do these...

1289
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,749
have this texture
because they were salted?

1290
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:39,816
I think so.

1291
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,518
I think the texture comes from salting it.

1292
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:43,220
The texture is great,

1293
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,688
so even just chewing the meat...

1294
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:48,091
It's chewy and firm.

1295
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:49,960
It's very chewy.

1296
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,361
How is the texture this good?

1297
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:52,696
It's super chewy.

1298
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:56,366
(The gourmet makes a bite with bacalhau,
radish greens and the sauce.)

1299
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,237
(A big bite)

1300
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:05,008
(A nod of approval)

1301
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:06,877
This is perfect.

1302
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:08,278
This is seriously...

1303
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:10,514
The balance is really nice.

1304
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:11,615
The seasoning is quite strong.

1305
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:15,152
Have it with potatoes.

1306
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:16,453
(The combination of salty bacalhau
and soft potato)

1307
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,525
The potato cuts the saltiness...

1308
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:22,592
Why is the potato so sweet?

1309
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:23,660
The potatoes are super sweet.

1310
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,995
The potatoes are sweet.

1311
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,731
The potatoes alone are really sweet.

1312
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:30,667
These taste like baked potatoes
we can get at rest stops.

1313
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:33,070
There's butter and stuff here too.

1314
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,238
The radish greens too.

1315
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,507
Keep eating it and it grows on you.

1316
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:41,278
It's like kimchi. I keep reaching for it.

1317
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:43,080
It's nice that it adds another texture.

1318
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,214
- You're right.
- It's good.

1319
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,016
- And tangy.
- Yes.

1320
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:47,517
They're delicious together.

1321
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:49,586
This dish already looks interesting.

1322
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:52,990
The color...

1323
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,160
(The color alone
sets this bacalhau apart from the usual.)

1324
01:04:58,095 --> 01:05:00,864
(The bacalhau is dark red
because it was braised in port wine.)

1325
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:04,768
(Port wine bacalhau)

1326
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:09,773
(It's the same bacalhau
with a totally different color.)

1327
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:14,411
(The inside is still white)

1328
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:17,748
The wine made it this color.

1329
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:25,122
It has that smell of dried pollack soup.

1330
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:27,257
- It really does.
- You're right.

1331
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,793
It smells like dried pollock soup,

1332
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:32,696
but this is a foreign dish,
which makes it interesting.

1333
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:34,231
It's familiar.

1334
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:36,967
- This is very familiar.
- Right?

1335
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:38,368
It's...

1336
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:41,171
It’s not spicy, but the flavor
is actually pretty similar.

1337
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,875
- When you order grilled dried pollock...
- That's right.

1338
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:46,810
It's that minus the spiciness.

1339
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,011
It really is.

1340
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:49,479
- Grilled dried pollock.
- Yes.

1341
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:50,914
The taste is familiar.

1342
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,250
If they were to sell this dish in Korea,

1343
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,986
it would be dried pollock braised in wine.

1344
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:57,788
There's a sweetness,

1345
01:05:57,788 --> 01:06:00,657
The port wine sauce must be sweet.

1346
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:04,061
Korean dishes are usually salty and spicy,

1347
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:06,630
but this is salty and sweet.

1348
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,932
- The sauce tastes super sweet.
- Right?

1349
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:10,367
Just the sauce by itself is very sweet.

1350
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:13,437
It hits that saltiness at the end.

1351
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:17,240
This is so interesting
to be able to taste each dish.

1352
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,042
This seems like something
you could eat lots of without getting fat.

1353
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:20,677
- Yeah.
- I was thinking that too.

1354
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:21,979
So delicious.

1355
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:23,747
Potato...

1356
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,615
What's this?

1357
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:27,751
What did they say this was again?

1358
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:29,553
Brás.

1359
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:34,992
(A dish made by stir-frying bacalhau
with julienned potatoes)

1360
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:39,029
(You can find pieces of bacalhau
in between the potatoes.)

1361
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:43,100
(Bacalhau à Brás)

1362
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,002
Smell it first.

1363
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:46,670
(Smelling the dish first)

1364
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,340
(It smells like...)

1365
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,075
I know exactly what this smells like.

1366
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:53,477
- What is it?
- It smells like,

1367
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:55,579
you know, Lotteria?

1368
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:58,882
That smell that hits you
when you enter Lotteria.

1369
01:06:58,882 --> 01:06:59,950
It's a good smell, right?

1370
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,419
Yes, that delicious smell.

1371
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:06,590
A smell of fries, pepper, oil...

1372
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:13,130
(Will it taste similar as well?)

1373
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,831
The combination is out of this world.

1374
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:19,536
(In love)

1375
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:21,204
You have to eat it all at once.

1376
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:25,742
(Kyung Ho also takes a big bite)

1377
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:30,280
The taste of the baked potato is strong.

1378
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,050
The cod really stands out here.

1379
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,151
To put it simply,

1380
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:37,087
it's salty and nutty.

1381
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:42,192
I think it's salty
plus that nutty, clean taste.

1382
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:43,760
There's one more left.

1383
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:47,731
I had something similar to this
on the plane.

1384
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:48,832
Really?

1385
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,541
(Looks unfamiliar)

1386
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:00,544
(Is this also bacalhau?)

1387
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:04,781
(What is this?)

1388
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:05,983
This seems like butter.

1389
01:08:05,983 --> 01:08:07,384
It's definitely butter.

1390
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,026
Try it.

1391
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:18,762
(It shocks you?)

1392
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,030
This is what it tastes like?

1393
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,166
Hey, this is...

1394
01:08:23,734 --> 01:08:25,435
It makes your eyes pop.

1395
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:29,406
(Like this?)

1396
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,609
With just that piece of fish I just had,

1397
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,845
I could finish a bowl of rice.

1398
01:08:35,212 --> 01:08:37,347
- It has that briny taste like oysters.
- Yes.

1399
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:39,316
Especially in this dish.

1400
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,519
Why does it taste like oysters?

1401
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:43,987
For this,

1402
01:08:43,987 --> 01:08:45,622
I think it was cooked differently.

1403
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,492
I think they cooked it
without removing the salt.

1404
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:49,526
This dish feels kind of bold and rugged.

1405
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:50,861
I think this is a traditional recipe.

1406
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,562
This must be the belly part.

1407
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:54,531
Something had a different texture.

1408
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,833
It was a bit slippery.

1409
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:57,968
There's skin here.

1410
01:08:57,968 --> 01:08:59,870
It must've been the skin.

1411
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,138
Their skin must taste like that.

1412
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:03,607
(Is this bacalhau's skin?)

1413
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:05,809
(A curious mind
is a classic study abroad attitude.)

1414
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:07,944
Is this the skin of the cod?

1415
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:12,082
(What will it be?)

1416
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:14,718
(Tongue)

1417
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:19,289
This was a tongue dish.

1418
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:21,591
I kissed with a cod.

1419
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:24,361
(Never imagined I'd kiss a cod)

1420
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:27,364
(The tongue of a bacalhau)

1421
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:32,369
(This is a bacalhau's tongue,
the ingredient for the dish)

1422
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:36,173
(Traditional Porto-style dish
that's different from Korea)

1423
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:39,543
(Popular among the foodies
for its rich and soft flavor)

1424
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:45,983
(8 tongues per dish, 8 bacalhaus)

1425
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,309
(It's like the nose of a skate.)

1426
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:51,021
(You haven't had bacalhau
until you've had its tongue.)

1427
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:53,223
- That's why this is hardcore.
- Right.

1428
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:54,558
The texture is different too.

1429
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:56,259
Looks different now.

1430
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:57,561
This is tongue?

1431
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:58,695
(Still can't believe it)

1432
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,430
The tongue is big though.

1433
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,168
Cod's tongues are really salty.

1434
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:08,372
I can't believe I ate a cod's tongue.

1435
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:12,643
It seems like salted cod
is the standard way they eat it here.

1436
01:10:12,643 --> 01:10:14,011
They don't use fresh cod.

1437
01:10:14,011 --> 01:10:15,412
There's no spiciness.

1438
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:16,680
Right.

1439
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,914
There's none of that spicy flavor.

1440
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:19,516
It lacks that.

1441
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,852
I feel like
I've eaten the entire cod today.

1442
01:10:21,852 --> 01:10:24,354
From its tongue
to its back to its belly...

1443
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:26,957
Braised cod, fried cod...

1444
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:35,732
(Fully conquered bacalhau)

1445
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:38,135
We've come here to eat,

1446
01:10:38,135 --> 01:10:39,670
but we're also here to learn.

1447
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:43,006
If I Were to learn,
I want to learn this the most.

1448
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:45,575
If it's not too hard,
I want to learn this one.

1449
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:48,512
I want to learn this dish.

1450
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:52,316
(Those who have enjoyed the food,
now go and learn!)

1451
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,851
This is also a dish
I've never cooked in my life.

1452
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:56,119
(A new dish even for Eo Nam Seon?)

1453
01:10:58,488 --> 01:10:59,890
I think he'll be better than me.

1454
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:02,125
(The three brothers
even learned hidden tips and tricks.)

1455
01:11:04,061 --> 01:11:05,696
The first night has come,

1456
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:07,664
I can't even do this one this properly,

1457
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:08,732
but I'm using three stoves at once.

1458
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:10,133
This is unbelievable.

1459
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,235
(That's unexpected.)

1460
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:14,604
(Is this how he becomes a cooking fairy?)

1461
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,840
I should try making the sauce first.

1462
01:11:17,207 --> 01:11:20,744
(The elite youngest
is busy making the sauce.)

1463
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:24,181
(Huh? It tastes weird.)

1464
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:26,850
(No such thing as giving up
for the elite youngest)

1465
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,019
Please don't fall.

1466
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:31,188
Did I succeed?

1467
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:33,290
(Will the elite youngest's recipe
end up as a failure?)

1468
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,725
- Su Young!
- Is it falling?

1469
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:36,193
(It's Ryu Su Young time now.)

1470
01:11:36,193 --> 01:11:37,561
What do people like the most?

1471
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:39,296
It’s one of the best-selling food
in the world.

1472
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:40,831
- Rose spicy chicken.
- Rose.

1473
01:11:40,998 --> 01:11:42,165
The smell is...

1474
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:44,334
(Don't miss the reveal
of Ryu Su Young's spicy sauce.)

1475
01:11:44,568 --> 01:11:46,103
I've never seen someone do it like this.

1476
01:11:46,103 --> 01:11:48,605
(Ryu Su Young's crazy kick)

1477
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:53,110
(A new recipe to captivate every taste)

1478
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:55,912
(Crunch)

1479
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,648
(Crunch)

1480
01:11:58,749 --> 01:12:00,651
Why is this so good?

1481
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:03,887
This must be why
people can't stop talking about you.

1482
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:06,323
This is on another level.
