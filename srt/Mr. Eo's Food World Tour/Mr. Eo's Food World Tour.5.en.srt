1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,969
We're in Brunei!

2
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,939
(The three members
have arrived in Brunei.)

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,610
(Brunei, the land of halal food)

4
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:23,580
(With pork excluded, the local cuisine
focuses on beef and chicken.)

5
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:27,684
(Brunei, a gastronomic nation
where tradition lives and breathes.)

6
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:29,987
I'm here to make you breakfast.

7
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:31,388
Really?

8
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:32,990
(They met Brunei's local meal master.)

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,494
(Brunei's representative meal, nasi lemak)

10
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:40,497
This is some high-level fried chicken.

11
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:41,999
This chicken is the kick.

12
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:46,270
(The boys got a proper taste
of the local Bruneian meal.)

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,978
("Nutty and familiar flavor
that reminds you of Korea" - The students)

14
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:57,447
(I really want to try the sauce.)

15
00:00:57,514 --> 00:00:59,783
This is gochujang (red pepper paste).
This is totally stir-fried gochujang.

16
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:01,518
It's sambal.

17
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:05,489
(Sambal / Brunei's gochujang)

18
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:10,227
(The ultimate spiciness made with
chili peppers as the main ingredient)

19
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:14,598
(Recipes vary widely by region,
ingredients, and the person making it.)

20
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:19,369
(There are
over 300 different kinds of sambal.)

21
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:22,337
(From stir-fries to
soups and grilled foods)

22
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:26,076
(Sambal is a versatile sauce
that adds bold flavor to any dish.)

23
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:28,512
You could finish a bowl of rice with this.

24
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,614
(Sambal sauce hits the spot
for Korean taste buds.)

25
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:32,649
- This is like jang (fermented sauce).
- It is?

26
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,551
Yeah, this is delicious.

27
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:35,719
It's good.

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,292
("We found the taste of Korea in Brunei"
- The students)

29
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:44,695
I seriously want to learn that though.

30
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:45,862
How to make sambal.

31
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:46,997
We need to learn
how to make this.

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,269
(Now that you've tasted it,
learn how to make sambal.)

33
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:57,507
We have our own way
of making it more delicious.

34
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:59,876
I will share with you the secret recipe.

35
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:02,946
(The secret recipe?)

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,583
(A very special recipe
you can't get anywhere else)

37
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:09,653
(The local meal master's
secret sambal recipe revealed)

38
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:10,587
This is amazing.

39
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:13,824
They're sharing
their secret recipe with us.

40
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:15,359
Even if you're family,

41
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:16,660
they don't share this.

42
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,828
I'm curious.

43
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:21,365
When you're learning foreign recipes,
your eyes glow with passion.

44
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:22,532
Me? You too.

45
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:25,802
You can find this kind of style
throughout Southeast Asia.

46
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:27,170
But they're all totally different.

47
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,505
I really wanted to learn the recipe.

48
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:30,140
They usually never share
their secret recipe.

49
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,643
I've asked before,
and they didn't share it with me.

50
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:33,944
This is super rare.

51
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:35,445
This is so interesting.

52
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:36,947
But they're going to teach us.

53
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:40,684
Which sambal recipe do you want to learn?

54
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:43,287
The basic one.

55
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,789
(Basic Sambal / A rich sauce that combines
spicy, sweet, salty, and sour flavors.)

56
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:48,592
(For an irresistibly addictive taste)

57
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:52,095
Do I just put everything in the bowl?

58
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:55,999
We have an expression in our cuisine
called "agak-agak."

59
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,802
(Agak-agak means
to just follow your intuition.)

60
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:00,938
There's that concept in Korea too.
How interesting.

61
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:02,973
No precise measurements,
just do it by feel.

62
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:06,910
(Starts to add the ingredients by feel)

63
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:08,545
(Spicy chili)

64
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:11,048
(Su Young grabs
a handful of spicy chilies.)

65
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:12,816
I like spicy chilies.

66
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:14,685
No, that's too much.

67
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:17,688
(I thought we were going by feel.)

68
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:21,425
(2 spicy chilies)

69
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:23,060
Now, we blend this.

70
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:28,999
No, no, add a little bit of belacan.

71
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,434
Try it.

72
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:32,402
It's very salty.

73
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:35,238
(What is this?)

74
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:40,644
This is pink shrimp.

75
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:42,746
This is commonly caught in Southeast Asia.

76
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:46,249
(Belacan / A fermented shrimp paste)

77
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,686
(Used widely in Southeast Asian cuisine)

78
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:52,122
They just added salt and sugar,

79
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:54,324
dried it a little, then ground it.

80
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:56,693
It's a paste.
It's basically a shrimp paste.

81
00:03:56,693 --> 00:04:03,667
(Known for explosive flavors)

82
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:07,671
It's less salty
compared to the Korean one.

83
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:08,739
You're right.

84
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,507
It's less salty
but more intense in flavor.

85
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:11,908
It's concentrated.

86
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:14,645
Is there shrimp paste in Korea?

87
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,514
We have saewoo jeot
(salted fermented shrimp).

88
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:23,253
- Saewoo jeot.
- Ssaehoo jeot...

89
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:24,554
Okay.

90
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:26,223
The Korean one is more salty,

91
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,392
but the flavor is similar,

92
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:29,960
so we could just use the shrimp bits.

93
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,962
We'd just have to add some sugar.

94
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:33,497
(Saewoo jeot mixed with sugar
will work as a substitute.)

95
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,967
(Secret Recipe - Basic Sambal)

96
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,210
(1. Add onions, red onions,
shallot, garlic, ginger...)

97
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,970
(Red chilies, spicy chilies, water,
shrimp paste into a mixer and blend.)

98
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,574
It's similar to the seasoning
we use for kimchi.

99
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:47,945
The seasoning we use in the beginning
where we use a mixer, right?

100
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:49,880
Now mix this with salted napa cabbage,
and you've got kimchi.

101
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,515
It's very similar. Totally similar.

102
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,216
(Sambal and kimchi seasoning
use similar ingredients.)

103
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:57,587
(Is this it for sambal?)

104
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:00,991
We're going to fry the sauce in oil.

105
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:04,861
(They're going to fry the sauce in oil?)

106
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:10,033
(The key is frying the sauce in oil.)

107
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,935
This is so interesting.

108
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:13,270
This is amazing.

109
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:16,406
Have you ever used this much oil
when making a sauce?

110
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:17,874
Not this much.

111
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:19,910
This is like chili oil.

112
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,378
A super delicious chili oil.

113
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,583
(6T of chili paste)

114
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,452
(A strong chili oil aroma hits
as soon as it starts boiling.)

115
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:29,853
I'm so curious about the taste.

116
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,922
(A strong chili oil aroma hits
as soon as it starts boiling.)

117
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:35,359
It smells like jjageuli (thick stew).

118
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,793
It smells like
a really delicious jjageuli.

119
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:38,161
That aroma is hitting me.

120
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,764
If we could get some pork belly,
with that...

121
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:42,065
That'd be so good.

122
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:45,102
We'd have to start with two bowls of rice.

123
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:50,107
- My big eater mode is officially on.
- It turned on?

124
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:52,509
(Big eater mode is on.)

125
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:55,412
We could marinate some chicken in this...

126
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,247
then grill it over an open flame.

127
00:05:58,048 --> 00:05:59,850
- Dakgalbi (spicy chicken) would be nice.
- It'd be so good.

128
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,418
It'd be good with some fire.

129
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:03,053
Grilled on an open fire or something.

130
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,222
Or how about this?

131
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:07,557
Like the Jeonju bibim triangle gimbap,

132
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:10,627
you could mix it with rice
then make it into a triangle gimbap.

133
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:13,096
- That'd be good too.
- Mix it in.

134
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:14,564
This is truly an all-purpose sauce.

135
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:16,033
A sauce for everything.

136
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:19,870
The three of you
can open a restaurant back in Korea.

137
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,971
Okay.

138
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:25,175
(Let's be partners.
We'll share the restaurant 50:50.)

139
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:28,412
(At this point, she's not a meal master,
she's a master talker.)

140
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:30,647
I can't believe I'm learning this.

141
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,683
My wife is going to love it
if I make it for her.

142
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,733
Just top it with a fried egg.

143
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:35,319
You'll finish a bowl
even with no appetite.

144
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:38,722
I'm so curious about the taste.

145
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:40,524
(Sambal hits the spot for Koreans.)

146
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:43,026
What's this?

147
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:49,132
Tamarind.

148
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,303
(The first kick of Sambal)

149
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:59,076
(A tropical fruit grown in Southeast Asia)

150
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:04,648
(Known for its subtle sweetness
and strong sourness)

151
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,955
(Used in a variety of dishes,
from grilled and stir-fried to soups.)

152
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:14,191
- I wonder what it tastes like.
- Curious, right?

153
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:16,226
We have tamarind in Korea too,
but nothing as fresh as this.

154
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,530
(Electrifying)

155
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,332
It's very sour.

156
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:27,704
(Substitute tamarind with vinegar.)

157
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,775
(Here comes another kick.)

158
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:36,580
(The second kick of Sambal, palm sugar)

159
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,516
Palm sugar is unrefined sugar.

160
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:42,819
Since it's unrefined,
it still contains what's called molasses.

161
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:46,757
So because it has more molasses,
it's closer to sugar in its original form.

162
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,760
These are better for you too
because it breaks down slower in our body.

163
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:51,328
It tastes interesting.

164
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,963
Think of brown sugar, and you'll get it.

165
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:55,666
Brown sugar tastes like that
because it has molasses in it.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,435
You'll know once you taste it.
It tastes different.

167
00:07:58,435 --> 00:07:59,436
It's good.

168
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:01,571
It smells like brown sugar.

169
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:04,741
Do I add all of it?

170
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:08,979
(1T of palm sugar)

171
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:14,284
So we add all the ingredients
and boil the oil mixture several times.

172
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:21,625
(Add water 2 to 3 times
and reduce it for an explosive flavor.)

173
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:25,729
It's boiling, which means
there's moisture forming inside.

174
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,532
If that stops boiling, that means
we've gotten rid of all the moisture.

175
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:30,400
How interesting.
This is very fascinating.

176
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,768
(Reduce it
until there's no more moisture.)

177
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:34,404
It smells so good.

178
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:37,074
It looks so tasty.

179
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:38,442
We can make it in Korea.

180
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,443
Wait, we shouldn't.

181
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:41,011
We could gain all that weight back.

182
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:42,479
We'll have to retire.

183
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,882
We'll gain so much weight
and have to retire.

184
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:47,484
It looks so delicious.

185
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:51,622
So every single ingredient
needs to be prepared with care like this.

186
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:54,191
It's starting to smell like that smell.

187
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:58,095
- The oil is...
- This is insane.

188
00:08:58,095 --> 00:08:59,496
It looks so good.

189
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:02,666
(Basic Sambal)

190
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,495
(1. Add onion, red onion,
shallot, garlic, ginger...)

191
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,468
(Shrimp paste, spicy chili,
water to the mixer and blend.)

192
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:06,103
(2. Add the mixture to a pan with oil,
and slowly fry them until they separate.)

193
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:07,871
(Add tamarind, palm sugar, salt
and reduce while adding water 2, 3 times.)

194
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:10,674
For the second sambal,
we're not going to use red chilies.

195
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:12,209
We're only using green chilies.

196
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,511
(Green Chili Sambal)

197
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,515
(Known for its green
color from green chilies...)

198
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:18,081
(And its spicy and
refreshing taste)

199
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:20,484
It's probably
the same boiling method, right?

200
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:21,918
Yes, it's similar.

201
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:24,021
But the difference is,

202
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,956
before we blend it in a mixer,

203
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:28,792
we fry the ingredients in oil.

204
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:30,861
So it's different.
That makes me curious.

205
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:37,567
(Super simple green chili sambal
without even using a knife)

206
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:41,605
(Green chili sambal
1. Fry the ingredients)

207
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:44,174
For this green sambal,

208
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:47,110
we add tomatoes.

209
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:51,315
But when we had it earlier,

210
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:53,550
I never thought
it would have tomatoes in it.

211
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,651
- Me neither.
- Same.

212
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,053
That's fascinating.

213
00:09:56,053 --> 00:10:00,724
Once the oil is hot,
we're going to fry everything.

214
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:03,560
- It's really different.
- It's interesting, yes.

215
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,562
(A way to deepen the natural flavors
and bring out rich savoriness)

216
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:12,102
It smells incredible. It's amazing.

217
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:14,671
It smells so good.

218
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:17,274
(Fry the vegetables
until they become soft.)

219
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:20,744
Now, we put it
in the food processor and blend.

220
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:23,580
So they blend it at this stage.

221
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,715
They blend it.

222
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:27,317
(Green chili sambal
2. Blend)

223
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:31,688
(The key is to roughly blend it
for texture.)

224
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:33,056
They didn't blend it until
it became smooth like juice.

225
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:34,758
So that there's texture.

226
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,227
- I think it's easy to learn.
- Yeah.

227
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:38,295
It looks way more simple.

228
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:40,430
Less ingredients too,
and we have everything in Korea.

229
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,265
It seems like Korean food.

230
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:47,313
After you blend it,
add it to the hot oil.

231
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:51,008
(Green chili sambal
3. Fry again)

232
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:53,243
It smells so nice.

233
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,882
(A sharp, spicy aroma tingles your nose.)

234
00:10:58,882 --> 00:10:59,916
It must taste different, right?

235
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,286
They didn't blend it first
like the one earlier.

236
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:06,456
I think it's to preserve that texture.

237
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,592
There's a reason old recipes stick around.

238
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:10,427
There's a reason for everything.

239
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:11,775
It won't taste the same
if you change the order.

240
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,829
Right, it won't
taste the same.

241
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:14,564
There's a reason you must do it like this.

242
00:11:14,564 --> 00:11:16,366
I'm looking forward to the taste.

243
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,402
I can't wait to try it.

244
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:22,606
(Green Chili Sambal
Simple, 3-step recipe)

245
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:25,876
(Just remember three things
for the green chili sambal.)

246
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:33,083
(Fry the ingredients,
blend, then fry again.)

247
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,888
(Easy, no-knife recipe
that's perfect for cooking beginners)

248
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:39,656
(Green Chili Sambal)

249
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:41,591
(1. Add green chili, spicy green chili,
garlic, tomato in a pan and fry.)

250
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:44,027
(2. Add the fried ingredients
into the mixer and roughly chop.)

251
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:46,296
(3. Pour the mixture
into hot oil and fry.)

252
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:48,498
The smell is insane right now.

253
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:51,034
We already had so much to eat,
but I'm salivating.

254
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:53,003
Don't you feel something here?
I'm salivating.

255
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,738
It tingles.

256
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:57,641
I'd be so good with freshly cooked rice.

257
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,610
(Makes me happy just thinking about it)

258
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,412
Have rice with an omelet or eggs,

259
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:04,815
top it with some sambal,
then it's perfect.

260
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:07,551
It'd be so good with some runny yolk.

261
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,585
Do we not have eggs?

262
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:09,753
We don't have any eggs.

263
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:11,021
Su Young, there are no eggs.

264
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,991
I saw lots of chickens outside.

265
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,294
Should I go get one?

266
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:19,863
No, you can't kill it.
We just want their eggs.

267
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:22,566
Try some cucumbers dipped in sambal.

268
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:26,536
(Cucumber will balance out
the bold flavor of the sambal.)

269
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,904
(Trying the basic sambal first)

270
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:29,072
Should we try this first?

271
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,874
The red one?

272
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:34,144
(Loaded with sambal
and right into the mouth)

273
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,281
Oh my gosh. It's so good.

274
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:38,448
Why is this so good?

275
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,787
I think it's better since it's cooled.

276
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:48,492
I've only tried cucumber with gochujang
or deonjang (soy bean paste).

277
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:51,828
So it's interesting to dip it in a sauce
with so much oil like this.

278
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,497
- It goes well with it.
- It does.

279
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,565
It's spicy and a bit sour.

280
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,467
This one's the lightest.
It's not that salty.

281
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:58,769
It's not as salty as you'd think.

282
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,772
Mixing it with noodles would be nice too.

283
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:03,707
You could mix it with anything
and it'd be tasty.

284
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:07,844
(A spicy, versatile basic sambal
that goes with everything.)

285
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:13,817
(Next, let's try the green chili sambal.)

286
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:15,519
This time,
the green chili sambal is better.

287
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,820
- Yeah?
- Right?

288
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,725
It's similar.

289
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:23,727
Give it a day to rest,
and it'll taste more like it.

290
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:26,196
(Copying Su Young)

291
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,432
It's similar.

292
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,833
- Good?
- Yeah.

293
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,435
You can't copy my flavor descriptions.

294
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,703
No, I didn't copy you.

295
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:34,304
It was so tasty,
I just expressed it in Korean style.

296
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,273
(Ctrl+C
Ctrl+V)

297
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,342
- It's similar.
- It's similar.

298
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:40,877
Which one is better?

299
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:42,779
- That's a hard choice.
- They're both good.

300
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,182
Personally,
I liked the green chili one more.

301
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,685
It has a nice savory saltiness.
It's nutty and salty.

302
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:50,120
(Pleasantly salty and spicy,
a familiar taste for Koreans)

303
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,822
Both are good.

304
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:53,724
(Satisfied)

305
00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:59,830
(Remember 50:50, okay?
Open a restaurant when you go back.)

306
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,532
We want to call you Fifty Mom.

to Korean taste, learned and done!)

00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:20,684
(Melodies echoing through the house.)

(Kyung Ho is completely glued
to the sofa.)

312
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:30,160
(He looks comfortable
as if he's become one with the sofa.)

313
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:37,034
(What are you doing, sir?)

314
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:42,773
(Watching a cooking show on nasi lemak)

315
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,011
(The original chicken and rice,
he was reviewing the nasi lemak recipe.)

316
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,648
(Sway)

317
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:56,186
What were you doing?

318
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,321
I was watching...

319
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,657
a nasi lemak cooking show on TV.

320
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:02,025
A nasi lemak cooking show?

321
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,927
- It's over?
- Yeah.

322
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:07,297
They used much more ingredients.

323
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:09,700
It was like Korea's jjigae (stew).

324
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,734
(The nasi lemak
looked like Korea's jjigae.)

325
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:13,570
It'd be nice to add some sambal
to kimchi jjigae.

326
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,172
- Yeah.
- I think it'll be good.

327
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,773
When I'm making kimchi jjigae,

328
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:20,744
I make the chili oil
and season it with saewoo jeot,

329
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:24,314
but sambal is basically
saewoo jeot added to chili oil.

330
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,583
That's why...

331
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:31,288
Yeah, so I think we can make it
with just kimchi and sambal.

332
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,959
(If you just have sambal,
you can easily make kimchi jjigae.)

333
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,563
Let's go eat
something delicious for lunch.

334
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:45,235
Gosh, it's hot.

335
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,436
It's hot.

336
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:49,773
You look very luxurious.

337
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:52,175
When you're in Brunei,

338
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:54,378
you've got to dress in Bruneian style.

339
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:56,380
I love it. Brunei Bourgeois?

340
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,381
That's right.

341
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:58,749
(Brunei Bourgeois style)

342
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,585
The sky is so pretty.
It's like a painting.

343
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,355
- It's beautiful.
- So nice.

344
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,724
Very pretty.

345
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:09,726
How nice is this?

346
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:11,795
Look at that.
That must be that.

347
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:14,331
- It must be the water taxi.
- Yeah, this must be it.

348
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,133
It's the water taxi.

349
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:22,673
(In Brunei, water taxis
are a primary means of transportation.)

350
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:28,078
(Beyond simple transportation,
it's part of everyday life on the water.)

351
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:31,448
So this is a bus stop and a taxi stop.

352
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,849
This is like a road.

353
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:34,051
Interesting.

354
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:35,852
Taxi.

355
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:37,988
- So cool.
- There it is.

356
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:40,324
The taxi's coming.

357
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:42,659
It's actually coming.

358
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:43,694
Whoever comes first gets the customer?

359
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:45,595
Yeah. There are two here.

360
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:47,497
Thank you.

361
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:50,200
This is so interesting.

362
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,736
(Wobble)

363
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:58,241
(It's their first time
riding a water taxi.)

364
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,010
It sure is hot.

365
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,312
It's very hot.

366
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,947
I'm sweating like crazy.

367
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:05,282
All right. We're in a sauna.

368
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,217
Nice. Eat, then sauna.

369
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,852
Eat, drink, and sauna.

370
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,755
Let's go.

371
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:14,725
- Once we start moving, it'll be better.
- Yeah.

372
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:15,926
We're going.

373
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:17,661
Here we go. We're moving.

374
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,363
So nice.

375
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:23,200
(It speeds off,
slicing through the water.)

376
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:25,802
What an interesting sight.

377
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:28,505
- A little bit of splash is nice.
- Yeah, it feels nice.

378
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,806
Very cool.

379
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,076
The wake is crazy right now.

380
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:36,546
There are lots of floating houses there.

381
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:39,416
Floating houses
are really common here, huh?

382
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,686
They say the king built all these houses.

383
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,621
- Really?
- Yeah, that's why...

384
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:46,390
there are stone paths...

385
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,425
and even asphalt roads.

386
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:51,194
(A well-planned, contemporary
water village provided by the king)

387
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,430
That's a more traditional style.

388
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:56,833
- That's the original...
- It's different.

389
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,468
Those are built with wood.

390
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:01,805
(Kampong Ayer, a traditional
water village with a long history)

391
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:05,042
So everything happens within these waters.

392
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,310
You're right.

393
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:09,479
(As they enter the water village,
a massive building comes into view.)

394
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,615
What do you think that is?

395
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:14,651
Doesn't it look like a school?

396
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:16,486
Is it a school?

397
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,889
Kids must come here to learn.

398
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,224
- It's a floating school.
- Even their school is on the water.

399
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:23,126
Even their school
is floating on the water.

400
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:24,294
That's amazing.

401
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:25,796
They built a school on water?

402
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,065
You're right, even a school.

403
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,034
Float-ucation!

404
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,037
(Awkward)

405
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,007
- It's a place for float-ucation.
- Float-ucation.

406
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:39,209
That's a tropical rainforest.

407
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,945
(Broom)

408
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:44,448
(Surprised)

409
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:49,119
(The water taxi cuts
swiftly across the sparkling blue.)

410
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,520
(Relaxed)

411
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,790
(The water is going crazy here.)

412
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:57,694
(The water taxi
speeds through the crisp, blue ripples.)

413
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,431
Don't.

414
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,002
Don't.

415
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:08,705
(A sudden attack of water)

416
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:12,576
(Right into his mouth)

417
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,111
Are you okay?

418
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,513
It's not a river.
It's the ocean, so it's salty.

419
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:18,482
It's salty. It's the ocean.

420
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,484
Why is it salty?

421
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:21,585
The water is salty.

422
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:23,387
(Correct!)

423
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,689
(Lick)

424
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:27,524
The water's a bit salty.

425
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:29,259
Why is it salty?

426
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,895
I think it's connected to the ocean.

427
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:36,900
(Where the river flows into the sea,
creating salty waters.)

428
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,070
Faster!

429
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,738
(Speed up)

430
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:43,006
Nice, yes!

431
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,742
(Chasing the wind)

432
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:49,046
(Here comes Eo Nam Seon)

433
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,715
It's great that there are no obstacles.

434
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:54,785
This is Brunei's Olympic Highway!

435
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,620
It's Brunei's Gangbyeon Expressway.

436
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,326
(The three boys charge ahead.)

437
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,430
This is so fascinating.

438
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,597
This is the dock.

439
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,900
This is a dock and a platform.

440
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,234
- A stop.
- Yes.

441
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:12,669
Look at this.

442
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,738
(So fun)

443
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:17,140
(46-year-old Mr. Eo Nam Seon
is excited to see the bridge.)

444
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,742
It's a wooden bridge.

445
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,179
- Is it shaky?
- Not at all.

446
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,147
- There are no guard rails.
- Is it shaking?

447
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:26,116
What an amazing view.
You two look amazing.

448
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:27,351
Let me take a photo of you.

449
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:28,952
I like this spot.

450
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:31,288
There's a Crocodile Area sign behind you.

451
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:33,156
- Crocodile Area.
- Scary.

452
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:35,092
Wait a minute.

453
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:36,126
What's this?

454
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:38,261
(There are crocodiles in the water?)

455
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,497
Kawasan...

456
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:42,099
So there are crocodiles.

457
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:44,735
No, don't. You scared me.

458
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:46,903
First, the crocodile sign scared me,

459
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,238
then it was Yoon Kyung Ho.

460
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:50,574
- Goodness. Walk in the middle.
- I'm going to walk where the beams are.

461
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:52,776
It keeps you on your toes.

462
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,244
It must be that.

463
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:55,912
I think this is the restaurant.

464
00:20:57,514 --> 00:20:58,749
Incredible.

465
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:01,084
There's a restaurant here?

466
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:02,319
The building is pretty too.

467
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,954
This place is so nice.

468
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,157
This must be a popular place.

469
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:10,994
Everywhere I look, it's picture-perfect.

470
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:13,096
It's very nice.

471
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:15,299
(Today's restaurant
is nestled in a scenic landscape.)

472
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,634
- Something already smells good.
- I like it.

473
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:19,369
I already caught a whiff.

474
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:20,437
It smells so good.

475
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:23,573
What is this smell?
It sort of smells like pho, but...

476
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,808
Give me your bags.

477
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:26,209
I love the smell of pho.

478
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,778
Right? I mean,

479
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:30,547
I don't know
where this smell is coming from, but...

480
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:32,115
I just want to devour a bowl of pho.

481
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:34,551
(United by pho)

482
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:35,819
Yes, get some pho in me.

483
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:37,521
I just want to...

484
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:39,256
Our appetites have grown.

485
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,425
We're all in our big eater mode.

486
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,459
You're right.

487
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,394
Totally. My big eater mode is on.

488
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,463
It's here.

489
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,266
(Su Young, look over there.)

490
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,300
It's here.

491
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,036
(They welcome the food in a sacred pose.)

492
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,873
(It's not pho?)

493
00:21:56,873 --> 00:21:59,443
(What is this?)

494
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:01,144
(One by one, the dishes pile up.)

495
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:03,547
- This is so much fun, right?
- Isn't this gochujang?

496
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,016
What's this?

497
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:10,687
(Full of new dishes)

498
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:13,857
- They have banchan (side dishes).
- Right? These are all...

499
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:15,425
We have more.

500
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:17,461
It looks so good.

501
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:21,598
(There are 14 kinds of side dishes alone.)

502
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:22,933
This is incredible.

503
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,535
This is like their hanjeongsik
(traditional Korean meal).

504
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,748
It's like how we get
jeyuk (spicy pork),

505
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,873
dotori muk (acorn jelly),
and jogi (croaker).

506
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:31,975
It's like a full-course meal.

507
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,278
It's a Bruneian full-course meal.

508
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:35,579
(Bruneian full-course meal)

509
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,817
(It's a full-course meal,
but there's no rice?)

510
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:43,387
(Where's the rice?)

511
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:45,856
(Another dish arrives just in time.)

512
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:48,492
(Is this rice?)

513
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,560
(What is this?)

514
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,629
(Confused by this unfamiliar dish)

515
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:55,332
- A huge slime...
- It's a slime.

516
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:57,868
It's slime you can eat.

517
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:00,604
(Ambuyat)

518
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:06,910
(Ambuyat, a traditional Bruneian dish)

519
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:11,949
(A sticky, stretchy texture like slime.)

520
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,053
(They began extracting it
from the trunk of the sago palm.)

521
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:21,725
(The trunk is ground and mixed
with water to extract the starch.)

522
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:25,329
(Dry the starch
and it turns into a white powder)

523
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,067
(Ambuyat's main ingredient, sago flour)

524
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:33,670
(Add hot water to the sago flour.)

525
00:23:34,504 --> 00:23:36,873
(Mix for 1 minute.)

526
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:41,011
(You can easily make Ambuyat like this.)

527
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:44,414
(During the poverty of World War II,
it was eaten as a rice substitute.)

528
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:48,418
(Nowadays, it's served
alongside various side dishes.)

529
00:23:48,952 --> 00:23:52,356
(Ambuyat / Brunei's rice)

530
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,591
Do you know how to eat this?

531
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,927
Please teach us.

532
00:23:56,927 --> 00:23:58,595
You swirl it like this.

533
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:01,198
(Swirl)

534
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:03,700
So you swirl it like that.

535
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,237
(Interesting)

536
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:10,674
(Ambuyat is swirled
and eaten with bamboo sticks.)

537
00:24:10,674 --> 00:24:11,875
Interesting.

538
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,878
They eat ambuyat instead of rice.
How fun is this?

539
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:18,282
(Swirl)

540
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:19,616
This is hard.

541
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:21,251
Let's try it.

542
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:24,354
(Chewy)

543
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,729
(What is this taste?)

544
00:24:33,563 --> 00:24:36,233
(Time to explore this unfamiliar food)

545
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,802
(Careful bite)

546
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:41,004
It smells sour,

547
00:24:41,004 --> 00:24:43,106
but it doesn't taste like anything.

548
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,475
(Sour smell but no taste?)

549
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:49,880
I'm sure this looks unfamiliar,
but it's super clear and...

550
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,515
Doesn't it look like starch?

551
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:54,651
It has no taste.
It doesn't taste like anything.

552
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,354
It's sort of like cheongpo muk
(mung bean jelly).

553
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:59,389
Cheongpo muk doesn't really
have a taste, you know?

554
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:00,757
You eat it for the sesame oil sauce.

555
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:03,860
It's basically cheongpo muk,
but the texture is like a thick sauce.

556
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,229
You can think of it like that.

557
00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:07,698
I can't get over this texture.

558
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:09,199
Yeah, it's a bit hard.

559
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,267
(Ambuyat's texture takes getting used to.)

560
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:16,340
We eat ambuyat with various side dishes.

561
00:25:16,573 --> 00:25:18,208
This is rice and banchan. All right.

562
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,243
So use ambuyat like rice...

563
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:21,645
and have it with these sides.

564
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,347
Hey, this is something else.

565
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:24,548
Very interesting.

566
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,221
(You can pick and choose
what to have with ambuyat.)

567
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:34,758
(Plain ambuyat turns special
when paired with flavorful sides.)

568
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,260
Try this. It's cassava leaf soup.

569
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:39,529
(Cassava leaf soup?)

570
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,300
(Ambuyat's friends
1. Cassava leaf soup)

571
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:48,171
(Highly recommended by the ambuyat master)

572
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:52,909
(First flavor combo with ambuyat.)

573
00:26:02,953 --> 00:26:04,121
This is good.

574
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:05,255
What are these leaves?

575
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:06,723
What's this?

576
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,027
These are cassava leaves.

577
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:15,065
(Cassava Leaf / A slightly bitter,
grassy leaf eaten in tropical regions)

578
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:17,868
It also kind of looks like
ugeoji (cabbage greens).

579
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,803
It sort of tastes like that too.

580
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:23,473
This is really good.

581
00:26:23,473 --> 00:26:25,609
It reminds me of...

582
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,579
It's like spinach curry.
It's familiar yet unfamiliar.

583
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:33,283
It's like a smooth soup curry.

584
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,407
The turmeric blends
with the coconut so well.

585
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:38,055
It tastes really refined.

586
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:41,091
- This tastes like curry?
- Yeah, like coconut curry.

587
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,492
(Hmm...)

588
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:44,361
It has that sort of...

589
00:26:44,361 --> 00:26:47,531
It's clean, bold...
How should I say it?

590
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:50,133
It's like haejangguk (hangover soup).

591
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:51,301
It's clean and refreshing.

592
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:52,703
Plus, there's a little bit of heat.

593
00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:54,638
It's a little spicy.
I saw some chilies in it.

594
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:56,640
This is nice and salty,
so Koreans would love this.

595
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,442
I think I can have this with rice.

596
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:02,379
This alone.

597
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:05,048
- It does taste like curry.
- It does.

598
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:07,351
The soft leaves go well with ambuyat.

599
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:11,188
They work well together.
It wraps everything together nicely.

600
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:15,659
(Of course, you need to drink
the haejangguk from the bowl.)

601
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,061
Everyone should definitely try this.

602
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:19,329
Those leaves taste like meat.

603
00:27:20,297 --> 00:27:22,099
(The leaves taste like meat?)

604
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,700
It tastes like meat.

605
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:26,737
That dish we always order
when we go to Southeast Asia.

606
00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:27,871
Water spinach.

607
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:34,378
(Ambuyat's friends
2. Water spinach)

608
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,813
You're supposed to eat this
with ambuyat too, right?

609
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:38,048
I should try some.

610
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:40,751
(Swirl it around...)

611
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:43,520
(Then into your mouth)

612
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,828
This is good.

613
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:54,898
(Water spinach is delicious)

614
00:27:54,898 --> 00:27:57,601
The smoky flavor is strong.

615
00:27:57,601 --> 00:27:59,102
It has a fire-grilled aroma.

616
00:27:59,603 --> 00:28:01,305
- This is good.
- Yeah, it is.

617
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,839
(The water spinach is wok-fired,
full of smoky aroma)

618
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,275
If you're on a diet...

619
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:06,410
but want some smoked meat,

620
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,111
you can have this instead.

621
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:10,614
I've never had smoky vegetables before.

622
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:13,717
Compared to other
water spinach dishes I've had,

623
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:16,053
the seasoning on this one is immaculate.

624
00:28:16,386 --> 00:28:17,921
This is the spot for water spinach.

625
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:19,756
You can just order this with rice
and that'd be enough.

626
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:20,857
It's really delicious.

627
00:28:20,857 --> 00:28:22,025
I thought the banchan culture
was a Korean thing,

628
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:24,061
- but they have it too.
- Yeah.

629
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:26,697
They enjoy a full spread
with ambuyat and all the sides.

630
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:28,699
This is a fun combination
to enjoy together.

631
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,069
It's not just tasty,
it's really delicious.

632
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:38,475
(Expressing the taste with his face)

633
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:41,278
This one's good. Try this one.

634
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:42,412
What's this?

635
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:45,449
It's beef tendon.

636
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:47,184
And they boiled it...

637
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,419
with some sauce that's similar to sambal.

638
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:53,857
(The ultimate pairing
of ambuyat and beef tendon)

639
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,259
(That looks good.)

640
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:06,937
The combination of these two...

641
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:08,105
reminds me of something.

642
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:09,539
- This is good, right?
- Yeah.

643
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,310
No one else thinks go?
It tastes like something.

644
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,379
There's a little bit of tom yum goong.

645
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,980
There's lemongrass in this.

646
00:29:18,148 --> 00:29:19,650
Right, I know now.

647
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,518
When I dipped this into this,

648
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:23,353
it reminded me of malatang.

649
00:29:23,353 --> 00:29:24,855
It is similar to malatang.

650
00:29:24,855 --> 00:29:26,623
It's like malatang with lemongrass.

651
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:30,560
It tastes like I'm dipping
the flat glass noodles in the malatang.

652
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:33,697
It easily goes down your throat.

653
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:35,565
(Totally looks like flat glass noodles
after dipping it)

654
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,737
This is like the canned hot pepper tuna.

655
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:43,540
- You're right.
- It's hot pepper tuna.

656
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,342
This totally tastes like hot pepper tuna.

657
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:47,210
This would be amazing with ramyeon.

658
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,980
(A bite of ambuyat,
a bite of fried shrimp)

659
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,051
Together with the texture of the meat
and ambuyat...

660
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:55,285
tastes like tangsuyuk
(sweet and sour pork).

661
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:56,920
This is galbi jjim (braised ribs).

662
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,655
Su Young, this is pho.

663
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:06,063
(He's definitely in big eater mode.)

664
00:30:06,063 --> 00:30:07,631
You like this, huh?

665
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:09,766
I mean, I sort of...

666
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,736
want to use this for my Ryu-cipe tonight.

667
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,171
Won't it be too hard?

668
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,739
How do you plan on cooking it?

669
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,608
I think that's going to be hard.

670
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:18,842
No, but...

671
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:22,679
I want to make a dish
you can enjoy in the summer.

672
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,814
In the summer?

673
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:25,182
Is today the day you fail?

674
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:26,249
No.

675
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,885
Why would you think that?

676
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:30,354
This is too hard.

677
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:33,023
Is tonight going to be like
the first night in Portugal?

678
00:30:33,023 --> 00:30:34,257
Shut up.

679
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,661
(The bacalhau egg soup
was Kyung Ho's first Ryu-cipe.)

680
00:30:41,832 --> 00:30:44,601
The cod has swam through the soup.

681
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,570
(On that night,
Kyung Ho invented that fishy flavor.)

682
00:30:47,537 --> 00:30:50,274
(His Ryu-cipe failed
from not understanding the ingredient.)

683
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:53,810
(Will he succeed this time?)

684
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:56,613
(I won't make the same mistake again.)

685
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:58,982
(Determined)

686
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:04,421
(The important thing
is understanding the ingredients.)

687
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:10,427
I'm curious if this will become bouncier
if we put this...

688
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:12,529
in something like ice water.

689
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:13,664
Do you want to try?

690
00:31:14,364 --> 00:31:16,833
(Here's the ice water.)

691
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,869
(Dunk)

692
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,671
If I dip it in just a bit...

693
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,339
I think it'll become
like ongshimi (potato ball).

694
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,975
- Right, ongshimi.
- Or like saealsim (glutinous rice ball).

695
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:28,512
It's totally like saealsim.
It's sago saealsim.

696
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,880
Try it.

697
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:32,716
(Analyzing)

698
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,718
(How is it?)

699
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:38,322
- It's not that much different.
- No?

700
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:40,424
It hasn't shrunk drastically.

701
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:42,125
- It's not surprising or anything?
- No.

702
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,293
It seems a bit bouncier.

703
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:44,661
Just a little.

704
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:46,797
But it does get bouncier
the more you leave it in the ice water.

705
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:49,099
- Yeah?
- This texture is more familiar to us.

706
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:50,734
It's so fascinating.

707
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:53,070
- That was good.
- Yeah, we can do it.

708
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,672
- We can do it.
- It was really delicious.

709
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,008
Kyung Ho,
are you really going to use ambuyat?

710
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:00,944
Yeah, why?
I feel like I need to give this a try.

711
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:06,917
(Quietly approaches the ambuyat master)

712
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:10,621
How do you make ambuyat?

713
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:13,357
Do you want to see?

714
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,927
(A special lesson on ambuyat for Kyung Ho)

715
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:20,998
This is hot water.

716
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:24,534
(The kick to making ambuyat is hot water.)

717
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:26,803
(Ambuyat is done in an instant.)

718
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:33,577
(Straight to practice)

719
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:38,282
(That's a wrap
on the special ambuyat-making class.)

720
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,488
- Eat.
- Learn.

721
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:46,256
Go to the hospital?

722
00:32:46,957 --> 00:32:49,593
- Second time and we're already slacking?
- We can't be slacking off.

723
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,328
- Eat.
- Learn.

724
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:52,796
Execute.

725
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:54,865
Let's work hard until 9:30.

726
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:55,899
(It's time to prepare
the first Ryu-cipe in Brunei.)

727
00:32:55,899 --> 00:33:00,037
There's a cookbook for Indian cuisine.

728
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:02,472
- Look at that cookbook.
- There's a cookbook.

729
00:33:02,472 --> 00:33:05,309
Kihyun went straight for the cookbook
out of all these books.

730
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:07,744
It's an actual cookbook.

731
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:09,880
It is.

732
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,782
It's an Indian cookbook.

733
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,784
All these terms sound familiar.

734
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,620
Looks like Kihyun's really set
on following in Su Young's footsteps.

735
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,921
Right?

736
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:19,623
Out of all these books,
he picked a cookbook.

737
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,259
So, since I can't match his skills,
I wanted to at least match his gear.

738
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:23,994
I bought a knife.

739
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:25,996
- A knife? Did you bring it?
- Where is it? Let me see.

740
00:33:25,996 --> 00:33:27,898
- It's still being delivered.
- Is it?

741
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:29,366
Jealous. A new knife, huh?

742
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,135
I've got to start with the gear, right?

743
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:34,438
Should I buy one too?

744
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:37,007
Shall we get started?

745
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,742
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

746
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:42,713
(Looking around)

747
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:45,949
(What's Kyung Ho looking for?)

748
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:47,684
I guess I needed to bring my own knife.

749
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:49,920
Use this if you don't have one.
I'll use mine.

750
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,021
No, it's okay.

751
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,089
I think there's only this.

752
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:53,690
- Really?
- You can use it.

753
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,992
Thank you, Su Young.

754
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,194
- The color doesn't matter.
- Okay.

755
00:33:57,728 --> 00:33:59,930
- Are you going to open it?
- I should.

756
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,299
No one's seen his new knife yet, right?

757
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:05,669
- I was tempted to get this too.
- Really?

758
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,271
But it felt like
it was out of my league.

759
00:34:07,271 --> 00:34:09,906
It's out of my league as well,
but I plan to use it for a long time.

760
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,109
The knife is...

761
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:14,211
Hey, this knife is nice.

762
00:34:15,145 --> 00:34:16,179
Is it amazing?

763
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,547
It is pretty amazing.

764
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,017
I want to see it.

765
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,385
(What is this?)

766
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:23,153
It just goes in.

767
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:25,055
Whatever I slice, it just goes in.

768
00:34:25,055 --> 00:34:26,390
(Flexing his gear)

769
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,724
Isn't it super pretty?

770
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:29,860
(Only I don't have a knife...)

771
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,962
That's awesome. It suits you.

772
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:33,597
What are you going to do?

773
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:36,667
I'm going to start making ambuyat.

774
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:39,269
I got to try ambuyat for the first time,

775
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,238
and that interesting texture...

776
00:34:41,238 --> 00:34:44,441
I really liked
how chewy and bouncy it was.

777
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:47,144
I thought I could come up
with an interesting dish...

778
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:48,912
if I combine it well with Korean cuisine.

779
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:51,615
A cold and refreshing dish
like naengguk, naengchae, naeng mukbap...

780
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:56,119
I usually just eat them at restaurants,
so I really wanted to try making it.

781
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,155
And I did using ambuyat.

782
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:01,591
It's a nerve-wracking moment.

783
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,361
(First, prepare the sago flour.)

784
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:07,631
The sago flour is really fine.

785
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:13,036
(You can easily find sago flour
in local grocery stores.)

786
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:17,708
(You can substitute it with dotori
or cheongpo muk powder in Korea.)

787
00:35:21,712 --> 00:35:25,782
(While making ambuyat,
Kyung Ho starts to slice cucumbers.)

788
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,720
I wanted to slice some cucumbers first
and add it...

789
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,421
to the ambuyat powder.

790
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,591
I wanted the cucumbers
inside the ambuyat.

791
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,593
That's what I was going for.

792
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,329
(Cucumber for interesting texture)

793
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:44,801
(Could the cucumber be the secret weapon?)

794
00:35:45,168 --> 00:35:49,239
It instantly feels thick
as soon as I add the water.

795
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,108
That's it? This fast?

796
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,609
(Because of the starch, it becomes thick
as soon as you add water.)

797
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,345
How interesting.

798
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:01,952
(It's time for the kick, hot water.)

799
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:08,292
(It's super easy!
Now you just have to mix it well.)

800
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:12,963
Why isn't this...

801
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:15,065
Why isn't this coming together
like it did at the restaurant?

802
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,767
(Smirk)

803
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,672
They said it was magic,
and it came together right away.

804
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,509
(Cold sweat from panic)

805
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:27,644
- Su Young, I have a problem.
- Why?

806
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,514
This isn't working
like it did at the restaurant.

807
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:31,415
You haven't added the hot water yet.

808
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:32,582
This is hot water.

809
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,919
When they were teaching me earlier,

810
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,854
- the water they used wasn't really hot.
- Really?

811
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:39,923
It was sort of lukewarm.

812
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:41,491
But how did it come together so easily?

813
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,893
The water needs to boil
for it to come together...

814
00:36:42,893 --> 00:36:45,696
because the starch needs to cook
to turn clear and come together.

815
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,596
(Maybe the water wasn't hot enough
for the starch to cook.)

816
00:36:46,797 --> 00:36:48,398
Try it again. You can do it.

817
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,467
I can't put this in the microwave, can I?

818
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:51,868
Yeah, no.

819
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:54,972
(Let go of the failed ambuyat.)

820
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:57,975
I'll try it again.

821
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:02,045
(Giving it another shot
with renewed determination)

822
00:37:03,113 --> 00:37:05,082
(Empty)

823
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:09,886
This is it for the powder, so...

824
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:15,192
(This is his last chance.)

825
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:18,495
This was a very complicated ingredient.

826
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:23,033
The water is boiling.

827
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:25,335
Do you want help?

828
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:26,703
Could you help me?

829
00:37:27,638 --> 00:37:28,939
The water needs to boil properly.

830
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:30,841
Keep stirring it.

831
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:33,143
- I'll bring this over.
- Okay.

832
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:34,444
- Any second now.
- Okay.

833
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:36,280
- I'm going now.
- Okay, come.

834
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,516
This is your last chance.

835
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:41,018
Stir it.

836
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:42,886
Slowly, they added a little bit at a time.

837
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:43,920
Little by little.

838
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,889
No, stop. Please, yes.

839
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,057
No, I mean...

840
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,725
Now, this has to slowly come together...

841
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:49,860
No, listen to me.

842
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,662
This needs to be hot. Keep stirring.

843
00:37:51,662 --> 00:37:53,563
- Here goes nothing.
- This is the last chance.

844
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,165
Wasn't that too much?

845
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:56,900
It's okay. It needs to be hot.

846
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,736
It'll come together, wait for it.
It has to if it's this much starch.

847
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:02,172
(What are you guys doing?)

848
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:05,575
(Instead of coming together,
it's staying watery again.)

849
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,477
Boil it.

850
00:38:07,477 --> 00:38:09,546
(We've got an emergency situation.)

851
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:11,248
- What do I do?
- Boil it.

852
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,951
- It's over.
- No, it's not.

853
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:15,118
(Will Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe fail like this?)

854
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,388
(Decided to heat the ambuyat mixture)

855
00:38:18,388 --> 00:38:19,489
Boil it.

856
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:20,691
There's no time.

857
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,359
It's coming together.

858
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:23,593
We need to stir it now.

859
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,995
- I'll do it.
- Yes, stir it.

860
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:26,330
No, not like that.

861
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,765
- Get to the bottom like this.
- Okay.

862
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,801
Hurry so that it doesn't create lumps.

863
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:33,804
Stir it, hurry up.

864
00:38:33,804 --> 00:38:37,307
- My forearm is dying.
- Keep stirring.

865
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:38,275
It'll soon turn clear.

866
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,811
- It has to turn clear.
- Lower the heat.

867
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:42,212
Turn it off.

868
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:45,382
(Hollow laugh)

869
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:47,884
(A situation that only brings out
a helpless chuckle)

870
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:50,320
I should've known better than to do this.
I always do this.

871
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,688
I always end up regretting it.

872
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:52,789
Why did I do it?

873
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,692
(As the mixture heats up,
it starts to turn clear.)

874
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:58,328
It goes clear, then white,
clear, then white...

875
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:02,099
- If it's white, it means it's not done.
- Really?

876
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:04,635
Starch turns clear if it's cooked.

877
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:06,970
Who knows?
Maybe it'll actually taste good.

878
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,238
It's turning clear.

879
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:13,443
(The ambuyat was too watery.)

880
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,346
(Now, it has become totally clear.)

881
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:17,714
There, I think it's done.

882
00:39:17,714 --> 00:39:19,082
Yeah, it's done.

883
00:39:19,082 --> 00:39:21,618
- It worked.
- Okay.

884
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:23,020
Thanks, Su Young.

885
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,788
- It's good, right?
- Yeah, thank you.

886
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,723
- It worked? Nice.
- It's all thanks to you.

887
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:29,226
It needs to cool now.

888
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:31,695
You okay there, genius?

889
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:33,730
(Tension's gone,
and so are the brain cells?)

890
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,798
Are you okay, sir?

891
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:37,100
I've come back from hell.

892
00:39:37,634 --> 00:39:38,902
Thanks to you, Su Young.

893
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:41,305
- You seemed a little flustered earlier.
- I did?

894
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,472
Yes, very flustered.

895
00:39:42,472 --> 00:39:45,042
But I swear I saw them making it.

896
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:46,677
(Not sure seeing it helped much.)

897
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:49,579
I shouldn't have jumped in
without understanding...

898
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:51,748
the ingredients better.

899
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:54,885
I'll put this here and...

900
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:56,153
(The ambuyat is ready now.)

901
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:58,622
My forearm is dead.

902
00:39:58,622 --> 00:40:00,123
I can't even open this plastic wrap.

903
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:02,993
It's a sign that I need to work out, huh?

904
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,461
Sesame oil.

905
00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:06,229
(Bruneian-Style Naeng Mukbap)

906
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:09,058
(To prevent sticking, apply sesame oil
to the plastic-wrapped mold.)

907
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:10,534
(Then spread the
ambuyat evenly.)

908
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,739
It looks like a giant snot.

909
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,207
Seriously? Again?

910
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:20,744
I'm being reminded of the cod.

911
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:24,147
This isn't the texture I wanted.

912
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:26,383
It needs to spread easily.

913
00:40:27,084 --> 00:40:29,786
(Kyung Ho can't afford
to let his guard down.)

914
00:40:29,786 --> 00:40:31,388
Why are you getting mad?

915
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,657
Just shut up.

916
00:40:35,092 --> 00:40:36,893
It definitely looks like a giant snot.

917
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,563
From start to finish,
nothing feels right to me right now.

918
00:40:40,764 --> 00:40:42,299
- Sprinkling some dried seaweed?
- Yes.

919
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:47,237
The fan, could you turn off the fan?

920
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,972
It's all flying away.

921
00:40:48,972 --> 00:40:50,307
The dried seaweed is flying away.

922
00:40:50,307 --> 00:40:51,775
Please help me.

923
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:54,278
Here goes the cucumbers.

924
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:56,046
I'm also going to add the cucumbers...

925
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:57,581
for texture, like this.

926
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:00,917
It sort of looks similar, though.

927
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,388
It sort of feels like I'm making muk.

928
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:05,589
I'm making muk.

929
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,227
(After all the hard work,
ambuyat is complete.)

930
00:41:10,227 --> 00:41:12,262
It's okay, though. It's okay.

931
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:14,464
Now, I'll put the ambuyat in the freezer.

932
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,968
(Let the ambuyat harden in the freezer.)

933
00:41:19,303 --> 00:41:21,471
It's burning.

934
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:22,773
I might fail here.

935
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:23,707
- Huh?
- I messed up.

936
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:25,475
No, you can't.

937
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:26,810
We're still...

938
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,844
Not tonight.

939
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:30,247
(Changes the pot
without getting flustered)

940
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:32,049
It sticks to that pot.

941
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:36,987
(Thankfully, the sauce is fine.)

942
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:38,889
It smells pretty similar...

943
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:40,757
to the sauce the local meal master made.

944
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:42,392
It does.

945
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:44,594
- Right? It's that smell.
- Yeah.

946
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:48,198
(What sauce is Su Young making?)

947
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:49,800
Sambal.

948
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,702
It was so much better than I expected.

949
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:53,103
It was a great sauce.

950
00:41:53,103 --> 00:41:56,306
Instead of making it special
and adding kicks,

951
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:58,408
I focused on making sure
this could be done...

952
00:41:58,408 --> 00:41:59,810
back home in Korea.

953
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,678
So, I made a Korean-style sambal.

954
00:42:01,678 --> 00:42:04,014
I squeezed the water out
from the saewoo jeot,

955
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:06,049
and I think that made it
suit my taste better.

956
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:10,520
To a sambal made with saewoo jeot...

957
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,990
(Another kick to boost Korean flavor)

958
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:15,425
(The signature Korean spice,
red pepper powder)

959
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:17,027
It's going to be really spicy.

960
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:20,030
(Upgraded with Korean heat)

961
00:42:20,864 --> 00:42:24,635
(How will this spicy sauce taste?)

962
00:42:24,635 --> 00:42:25,802
It's good.

963
00:42:25,802 --> 00:42:28,205
- Hey, it's good. Taste it.
- Is it good?

964
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:29,506
I made it not as salty.

965
00:42:30,274 --> 00:42:31,742
- Goodness.
- It's good, right?

966
00:42:32,943 --> 00:42:34,311
It's spicy though.

967
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:35,979
(Tears incoming, thanks to Korean heat?)

968
00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:38,715
- It's good.
- It is.

969
00:42:38,715 --> 00:42:41,485
You got the flavor right so quickly.

970
00:42:41,985 --> 00:42:43,887
I made it not as salty,
so I think it's better.

971
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:48,091
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
Spicy Sauce)

972
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,595
All right. The sauce turned out great.

973
00:42:51,595 --> 00:42:52,863
Now, I just need to do a good job
with the chicken.

974
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:54,998
This country is famous for chicken,

975
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:57,234
and the nasi lemak
we had in the morning was perfect.

976
00:42:57,234 --> 00:42:59,202
The chili sauce.

977
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,605
I knew it. Brining is important.

978
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:03,106
Brining is everything in chicken dishes.

979
00:43:03,106 --> 00:43:04,241
(The local master used the chili sauce
to brine her Bruneian chicken.)

980
00:43:07,744 --> 00:43:09,846
The chicken is really good.

981
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,381
One chicken leg,

982
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:14,251
and we were given a sauce like ssamjang.

983
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:15,585
And that was good.

984
00:43:16,286 --> 00:43:20,357
I knew it'd be impossible for me
to make something better in just a day.

985
00:43:20,357 --> 00:43:22,926
So I thought maybe I should make something
to go with bread.

986
00:43:22,926 --> 00:43:24,895
That meant that I needed to fry it.

987
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:27,764
That's why I made a chicken burger.

988
00:43:29,967 --> 00:43:31,281
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe)

989
00:43:31,305 --> 00:43:34,071

with Spicy Sauce)

990
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:39,309
(Fry the chili sauce marinated
chicken thighs in oil.)

991
00:43:41,111 --> 00:43:45,549
(Added heat to the chicken
with the chili sauce)

992
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:47,117
The chicken looks almost done.

993
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:51,355
It may look a little burnt, but...

994
00:43:51,888 --> 00:43:53,890
It did get burnt.

995
00:43:56,393 --> 00:43:58,829
No, it's not burnt. It looks good.

996
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:00,998
Gosh, Su Young.

997
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:03,166
That looks insane. I just saw it.

998
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,102
It smells like the fried chicken...

999
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:07,304
The fried chicken they sell at pubs.

1000
00:44:07,304 --> 00:44:08,939
I tried it out.

1001
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:10,474
These were fried without any batter.

1002
00:44:10,474 --> 00:44:12,242
(Basic fried chicken
with a reddish hue from the chili sauce)

1003
00:44:12,576 --> 00:44:14,211
Today, I'm going to use rice flour.

1004
00:44:15,045 --> 00:44:17,247
I'm going to try them again
using rice flour.

1005

(Rice flour, coconut milk)

1006
00:44:19,483 --> 00:44:24,121
(Fry the rest of the chicken thighs
using rice flour.)

(Finished making 2 types of fried chicken,
basic and rice flour)

1009
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:34,364
Nice.

1010
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:38,335
(All the ingredients are ready.)

1011
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:40,938
First and foremost,
burgers will be good on Instagram, right?

1012
00:44:40,938 --> 00:44:43,140
That's what's important
about a homemade burger.

1013
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,474
It needs to tell a story.

1014
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:47,344
It needs to look like a burger
I'd want to share with everyone.

1015
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:49,579
How can I make it look pretty?

1016
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:53,884

(3T of mayonnaise for nuttiness)

1020
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:09,666
You could use a lemon instead,
and it won't make much of a difference.

1021
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,401
We don't have honey, so...

1022
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:15,372
(The white sauce forms a protective layer
to stop the buns from going soggy.)

1023
00:45:15,372 --> 00:45:16,873
I hope it's good.

1024
00:45:16,873 --> 00:45:18,809
(The white sauce forms a protective layer
to stop the buns from going soggy.)

1025
00:45:19,142 --> 00:45:22,346
(Coat the inside of the buns
with the sweet mayo sauce.)

1026
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:26,183
(Add a fried chicken for that crispiness.)

1027
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:27,184
Let's go.

1028
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:28,518
Eye-catching.

1029
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:29,686
What is that?

1030
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:31,254
I bought some mozzarella.

1031
00:45:31,888 --> 00:45:33,790
- That looks good.
- It already tastes good.

1032
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,192
I thought it'd be nice
to make a hamburger.

1033
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:36,393
I actually wanted it.

1034
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:37,761
That looks too good.

1035
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:41,398
Too much spicy sauce
will make it too intense.

1036
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:46,870
Sambal, mozzarella,
and the chicken burger.

1037
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,672
You cannot fail with that combination.

1038
00:45:48,672 --> 00:45:51,241
The cheese is melting,
and the fiery red oil is melting with it.

1039
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:54,645
It's been 5 years since I started
doing food shows, and I've only learned...

1040
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:56,313
to say things like sizzling,
bubbling, fiery red...

1041
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:57,481
The cheese is melting...

1042
00:45:57,848 --> 00:45:59,983
It's my everything.

1043
00:45:59,983 --> 00:46:03,353
It showcases all the tricks
I've learned in broadcasting.

1044
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:07,591
But Su Young, that burger looks insane.

1045
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:09,559
Nothing can beat that.

As always, on a whole different level.

1048
00:46:13,463 --> 00:46:14,831
(Mozzarella Chicken Burger
with Spicy Sauce)

1049
00:46:14,831 --> 00:46:15,495
(1. Blend 1 onion, 4 red chilies,
8 spicy chilies, 1 clove garlic...)

1050
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:16,066
(5cm turmeric, 10cm ginger,
1/2T saewoo jeot liquid.)

1051
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:17,634
(2. Marinate chicken thigh
for 20 minutes, fry.)

1052
00:46:17,634 --> 00:46:18,669
(3. Mix 3T mayo, 2T sugar, calamansi juice
for sweet mayo sauce.)

1053
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:19,615
(4. Build the burger in order
of bun with mayo sauce...)

1054
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:20,437
(Cucumber, chicken,
mozzarella, spicy sauce.)

1055
00:46:21,204 --> 00:46:22,739
Everything okay, Kihyun?

1056
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:23,807
It's going well.

1057
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:27,678
(What's Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
that's cruising along smoothly?)

1058
00:46:27,678 --> 00:46:29,212
I thought I should make a dessert.

1059
00:46:29,212 --> 00:46:32,249
I heard Brunei has lots of desserts too.

1060
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,454
(Brunei's traditional dessert culture
is well-developed.)

1061
00:46:39,823 --> 00:46:43,226
(The origin of trendy desserts
like sago pearl and pandan latte)

1062
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,356
(Specialty Coffee "Pandan coconut latte")

1063
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,529
(Four exotic coffees
with Southeast Asia's vanilla, pandan)

1064
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:47,030
("Pandan coffee craze"
50,000 cups sold in a week)

1065
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:51,568
(Brunei, the dessert kingdom)

1066
00:46:51,568 --> 00:46:53,804
We should try their dessert
when visiting a new country.

1067
00:46:53,804 --> 00:46:54,938
(Visited a café to study their desserts)

1068
00:46:55,238 --> 00:46:57,207
Like traditional sweets.

1069
00:46:57,641 --> 00:46:59,209
That's what it's like.

1070
00:46:59,209 --> 00:47:00,611
These are traditional local sweets.

1071
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:03,580
The texture is very chewy.

1072
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,449
(Intrigued by the traditional cake)

1073
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:07,618
How is it, Kihyun?

1074
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:09,252
As the dessert king...

1075
00:47:09,252 --> 00:47:11,121
Should I try it?

1076
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:13,156
- This time, beyond bread...
- Beyond bread?

1077
00:47:13,156 --> 00:47:14,925
- I'm going for tteok (rice cake).
- To tteok?

1078
00:47:14,925 --> 00:47:16,159
- I'm going to make tteok.
- Dessert?

1079
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:19,763
- You're going all in with dessert.
- Right.

1080
00:47:19,763 --> 00:47:21,465
- D-King.
- D-King.

1081
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:24,301
D-King's pandan honey seolgi (rice cake).

1082
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:25,636
Pandan honey seolgi.

1083
00:47:26,036 --> 00:47:29,273
(Try it. You can make it at home too.)

1084
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:32,976
(450g of wet-milled rice flour)

1085
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,880
(Measure it precisely.)

1086
00:47:37,547 --> 00:47:42,519
("Precision is everything in desserts."
- Measurement Guru Yoo)

1087
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:43,654
Perfect.

1088
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,491
(Then he adds a green liquid?)

1089
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:49,059
Now that I'm in Brunei,

1090
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:51,261
I got to taste and experience
lots of different dishes.

1091
00:47:51,261 --> 00:47:55,532
And I found a key ingredient
called pandan.

1092
00:47:55,532 --> 00:47:57,701
It's somewhere in between
a coconut and nurungji (scorched rice).

1093
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:01,004
Its flavor is subtle with some sweetness.

1094
00:48:01,371 --> 00:48:03,974
Usually, baekseolgi is white, right?

1095
00:48:03,974 --> 00:48:07,277
So, I thought the color would be nice
if I used pandan.

1096
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:09,279
That's why I decided to use pandan.

1097
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:10,480
(Pandan leaves' nutty and sweet flavor
makes them popular in desserts.)

1098
00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:14,217
(The world has fallen in love
with the sweet kaya jam.)

1099
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:20,123
(The main ingredient
for the kaya jam is pandan leaf)

1100
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:23,760
(Pandan leaves are used
in various kinds of desserts.)

1101
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:27,030
I blended the pandan leaves
with milk in a mixer.

1102
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,732
Then I strained it several times...

1103
00:48:28,732 --> 00:48:32,703
to get rid of the bigger lumps and fiber.

1104
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:36,473
Then you're left with this liquid
that's the color of a honeydew.

1105
00:48:36,473 --> 00:48:37,741
That's what you're left with.

1106
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:42,212
(Pandan leaves are used
like mugwort in mugwort tteok.)

1107
00:48:42,412 --> 00:48:45,582
(Concentrating)

1108
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:51,221
(Mix in 1T of pandan milk at a time.)

1109
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:53,957
(7T)

1110
00:48:53,957 --> 00:48:55,959
(8T)

1111
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:57,427
(9T)

1112
00:48:57,694 --> 00:49:01,198
(Add 10T of the pandan milk and mix.)

1113
00:49:01,198 --> 00:49:04,401
When you press it together...

1114
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,471
and it breaks apart after forming
a large lump, then it's done.

1115
00:49:07,938 --> 00:49:09,106
I got the color.

1116
00:49:09,106 --> 00:49:11,708
(The rice cake dough has a dreamy glow.)

1117
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,677
It just somehow works out.
That's what's amazing.

1118
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:16,647
Such a pretty color.

1119
00:49:16,647 --> 00:49:18,749
It looks like an emerald tteok.

1120
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:20,317
Everyone has succeeded.

1121
00:49:20,317 --> 00:49:22,019
I can't believe you're making tteok now.

1122
00:49:22,352 --> 00:49:23,854
- Right?
- Amazing, right?

1123
00:49:24,288 --> 00:49:26,356
Tteok isn't an easy thing to tackle.

1124
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:27,624
(Here's an idol making tteok at home.)

1125
00:49:27,824 --> 00:49:29,893
- Are you sifting it to make it finer?
- Yeah.

1126
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,328
(Why use a sieve?)

1127
00:49:31,328 --> 00:49:33,730
(It makes the texture finer and adds air,
improving the overall mouth feel)

1128
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:38,435
Ouch.

1129
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:39,970
Are you okay?

1130
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:41,738
Are you okay?

1131
00:49:41,738 --> 00:49:43,106
What happened? Toes?

1132
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:44,374
I stubbed my toe on the fridge.

1133
00:49:44,374 --> 00:49:46,043
I know that pain. It hurts the most.

1134
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:48,111
I can feel the pain too. Goodness.

1135
00:49:48,412 --> 00:49:49,646
Are you sure you're okay?

1136
00:49:49,646 --> 00:49:51,381
I'm fine.

1137
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:53,650
Just thinking about it...

1138
00:49:54,184 --> 00:49:58,255
(What was Kihyun so desparate to find,
even stubbing his foot?)

1139
00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:00,157
Palm sugar.

1140
00:50:00,657 --> 00:50:02,125
Pandan seolgi's kick is...

1141
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:07,698
I'm going to use palm sugar,
like the one the chef showed us...

1142
00:50:07,698 --> 00:50:11,935
that was all wrapped up.

1143
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:15,439
I'm going to sandwich this
in between the seolgi.

1144
00:50:15,939 --> 00:50:19,476
(Grating)

1145
00:50:19,776 --> 00:50:22,779
(Starts grating the palm sugar)

1146
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:27,217
(Stands up)

1147
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:30,387
(A little harder)

1148
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:35,892
It's now only 4... no, 3g.

1149
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:39,396
I need 50g of this, and I'm only at 3g.

1150
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,498
Are you going to melt it?

1151
00:50:42,032 --> 00:50:43,200
No.

1152
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:45,102
It's going to go in between the tteok.

1153
00:50:45,102 --> 00:50:46,403
In between?

1154
00:50:46,403 --> 00:50:48,005
Then there's no other way.

1155
00:50:48,005 --> 00:50:49,573
- I'll do it with you.
- No, it's okay.

1156
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,875
(All right, let's do it)

1157
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:54,578
(Grabbing it with more force)

1158
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:56,480
(Target detected)

1159
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:00,584
(Charge ahead
for the kick of the honey seolgi)

1160
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:02,886
(Elite arms)

1161
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,689
(Serious about sugar)

1162
00:51:06,523 --> 00:51:09,059
(Forearms getting pumped)

1163
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,432
(So much grating later...)

1164
00:51:15,832 --> 00:51:17,334
Something about this feels familiar.

1165
00:51:18,502 --> 00:51:19,636
What does?

1166
00:51:19,736 --> 00:51:22,973
I'm always stirring, mixing...

1167
00:51:22,973 --> 00:51:25,008
- Grating.
- Grating...

1168
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:27,911
Why are all our dishes always...

1169
00:51:28,578 --> 00:51:29,880
I guess everyone has their own fate.

1170
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,181
It really must be fate.

1171
00:51:31,181 --> 00:51:32,582
It's fate.

1172
00:51:32,582 --> 00:51:34,351
- I'm always frying.
- You're right.

1173
00:51:35,285 --> 00:51:37,187
We all have our own fate.

1174
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:39,356
I'm always rice or noodles.

1175
00:51:41,024 --> 00:51:43,160
It's so fascinating how
everyone has their own thing.

1176
00:51:43,694 --> 00:51:47,497
(50g of grated palm sugar like it's fate)

1177
00:51:47,497 --> 00:51:49,299
(Roasted soybean powder)

1178
00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:50,534
(Add 1T of nutty roasted soybean powder.)

1179
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:54,104
(Pandan honey seolgi's kick!
Sweet and nutty sugar filling is done.)

1180
00:52:00,277 --> 00:52:01,311
Yummy.

1181
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:04,114
(Sift it again and layer in the steamer.)

1182
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:07,217
(The point is to make the top even.)

1183
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:11,088
(Meticulous)

1184
00:52:11,221 --> 00:52:12,723
(Wet-milled rice flour,
sugar filling, wet-milled rice flour)

1185
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:14,091
I'm almost done.

1186
00:52:17,361 --> 00:52:21,465
(Even checking the level with precision.)

1187
00:52:21,465 --> 00:52:22,899
Okay.

1188
00:52:25,402 --> 00:52:27,104
It's thin, so I think 20 minutes is good.

1189
00:52:27,104 --> 00:52:28,672
It says to steam for 20 minutes
then rest for 5 minutes.

1190
00:52:28,672 --> 00:52:30,507
Right, letting it rest is important.

1191
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:33,777
It smells good.

1192
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:35,178
- Can you smell it?
- Yeah.

1193
00:52:35,178 --> 00:52:37,614
It smells like that first dessert
we had at the café.

1194
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:41,418
You know, the tteok,
the bread with pandan.

1195
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:43,553
It smells so good that I can't even speak.

1196
00:52:43,553 --> 00:52:44,821
I can't believe I'm making tteok.

1197
00:52:44,821 --> 00:52:46,089
So cool.

1198
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,825
I need to wait,

1199
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:50,093
but I keep checking it.

1200
00:52:52,896 --> 00:52:56,066
(He lingers around the tteok.)

1201
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,403
(Keeping checking it)

1202
00:52:59,736 --> 00:53:01,438
Gosh, tteok is made with such care.

1203
00:53:01,438 --> 00:53:02,906
I'm doing it happily.

1204
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,541
So pretty, right?

1205
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:08,512
(Hopefully, it becomes a perfect tteok.)

1206
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:12,215
(Forces himself to sit down,
leaving the tteok on the stove.)

1207
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:14,685
(Restless inside)

1208
00:53:14,685 --> 00:53:18,689
Wait, don't you need to lower the heat?

1209
00:53:18,689 --> 00:53:21,925
Director, one second.

1210
00:53:22,726 --> 00:53:23,760
I'm in a rush.

1211
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,963
Something I always did
when I'd be cooking with passion.

1212
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:27,531
There's still water, though.

1213
00:53:27,531 --> 00:53:28,565
(Shooting isn't what's important here.)

1214
00:53:28,765 --> 00:53:32,235
Shouting "One second" while shooting
shows just how passionate he is.

1215
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:34,371
I would also forget what I was doing
and just focus on cooking.

1216
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:35,706
I'd be like, "Move."

1217
00:53:35,706 --> 00:53:37,207
(Kihyun, channeling Eo Nam-seon
with his fiery cooking passion)

1218
00:53:37,374 --> 00:53:39,343
I just saw your passion for cooking.

1219
00:53:39,343 --> 00:53:40,811
I felt so rushed.

1220
00:53:40,811 --> 00:53:41,945
(Thankfully, the tteok is fine.)

1221
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:42,980
I'm sorry, Director.

1222
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,048
- (Director) It's fine.
- On his second study abroad...

1223
00:53:45,048 --> 00:53:47,217
He's already so into cooking.

1224
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:48,418
Asking the camera director to move...

1225
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:49,553
is the ultimate sign
of how passionate you are.

1226
00:53:49,553 --> 00:53:50,587
I felt so rushed.

1227
00:53:50,587 --> 00:53:51,788
I thought I smelled burning.

1228
00:53:51,788 --> 00:53:54,124
(The next Eo Nam Seon
has been approved by Su Young.)

1229
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:55,525
Now that I know
saying "move" is a good thing...

1230
00:53:55,525 --> 00:53:57,160
- It is.
- I will work hard at it too.

1231
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,261
Really?

1232
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:00,030
Please work hard until you shout, "Move."

1233
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,199
- Move.
- Move?

1234
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:05,002
Telling me to move isn't passion,
it's just being rebellious.

1235
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,305
I want to show you my passion.

1236
00:54:09,806 --> 00:54:12,409
(Time to show his passion
with his Ryu-cipe)

1237
00:54:13,343 --> 00:54:16,980
(Quick-frozen ambuyat from the freezer)

1238
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:18,882
Now, I will...

1239
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:21,818
(Ambuyat looks like muk.)

1240
00:54:21,818 --> 00:54:24,955
I will cut it into bite-sized pieces...

1241
00:54:26,523 --> 00:54:27,624
It's working.

1242
00:54:28,392 --> 00:54:32,796
(The texture of ambuyat is the key.)

1243
00:54:33,997 --> 00:54:35,966
Something is starting to feel off.

1244
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:38,335
Something is starting to feel off,

1245
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,536
but it's not over yet.

1246
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,572
(Where is Kyung Ho headed?)

1247
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:43,573
(To the staff?)

1248
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:45,309
Only tell me how it tastes.

1249
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:47,110
Is it good?

1250
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,478
- (Staff) It's cheongpo muk.
- It is?

1251
00:54:48,478 --> 00:54:50,013
Goodness.

1252
00:54:50,013 --> 00:54:52,916
This will have a better texture
than the cheongpo muk.

1253
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,117
It's "sago" muk.

1254
00:54:54,117 --> 00:54:55,218
"Sago" as in an accident in Korean?

1255
00:54:55,218 --> 00:54:56,920
- No, you used sago flour.
- True.

1256
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,921
Nice.

1257
00:54:57,921 --> 00:54:59,623
- Sago muk?
- Yeah.

1258
00:54:59,623 --> 00:55:00,757
Is it so good
that you might cause an accident?

1259
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:01,925
I'm a sago-maker, like a troublemaker.

1260
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,260
You're a sago-maker?

1261
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,428
(Did Kyung Ho
just pull off making ambuyat?)

1262
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,833
(Nailed the ambuyat!)

1263
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:14,404
(What did he take out from the fridge?)

1264
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:17,808
(Cold broth)

1265
00:55:17,808 --> 00:55:19,543
For the Bruneian-style naeng mukbap,

1266
00:55:19,543 --> 00:55:20,677
vinegar was the key.

1267
00:55:20,677 --> 00:55:22,379
I knew that ambuyat and vinegar
would work well.

1268
00:55:22,379 --> 00:55:25,716
It seems like the locals
eat ambuyat while it's hot.

1269
00:55:25,716 --> 00:55:28,852
And they eat it with hot things.

1270
00:55:28,852 --> 00:55:32,089
So, having it cold
would've been very new to them.

1271
00:55:32,923 --> 00:55:35,759
(Bruneian-style naeng mukbap's kick!
Vinegar)

1272
00:55:36,026 --> 00:55:40,464
(Kyung Ho drizzled it 3 times,
but you can customize it to your taste.)

1273
00:55:40,897 --> 00:55:42,199
I should taste it.

1274
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:48,238
(Bruneian naeng mukbap)

1275
00:55:48,238 --> 00:55:51,508
(Top with kimchi, cucumber, scallion,
and lots of ice.)

1276
00:55:51,508 --> 00:55:53,810
- All right, I'm done.
- You're done?

1277
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,412
Goodness.

1278
00:55:57,714 --> 00:56:00,517
Thinking about vinegar and kimchi...

1279
00:56:00,951 --> 00:56:02,152
Kyung Ho, it tingles right here.

1280
00:56:02,152 --> 00:56:05,155
- Yeah?
- Right here, yeah. My mouth is watering.

1281
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:08,458
Thanks for hyping it up for me, Kihyun.

1282
00:56:09,426 --> 00:56:13,230
It my first time making that today,
but I have confidence...

1283
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,398
in that combination.

1284
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:18,936
(A harmony of chewy texture
and refreshing vinegar)

1285
00:56:19,236 --> 00:56:23,040
(A new texture to chase away
the hot summer heat)

1286
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,474
(Bruneian-Style Naeng Mukbap)

1287
00:56:24,474 --> 00:56:25,642
(1. Put ambuyat in a mold with sesame oil,
top with dried seaweed and cucumber.)

1288
00:56:25,642 --> 00:56:27,110
(2. Cool the ambuyat in the freezer.)

1289
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,378
(3. Pour the cold broth
and top with veggies and vinegar.)

1290
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:29,813
That looks good.

1291
00:56:29,813 --> 00:56:30,914
Let's try it.

1292
00:56:30,914 --> 00:56:31,882
Half is too much, no?

1293
00:56:31,882 --> 00:56:32,950
You want half?

1294
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,284
It looks insane.

1295
00:56:34,284 --> 00:56:35,585
What are we going to do?

1296
00:56:36,253 --> 00:56:38,121
Look at that fried chicken.

1297
00:56:38,288 --> 00:56:40,157
It'll taste good.
The sauce turned out nicely.

1298
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:43,894
(Spotlight on)

1299
00:56:45,228 --> 00:56:46,730
Look at the inside.

1300
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:49,766
Look at the juice.

1301
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:51,134
Thank you, Su Young.

1302
00:56:52,269 --> 00:56:54,705
I mean, thank you,

1303
00:56:54,705 --> 00:56:55,939
but we have to be honest.

1304
00:56:56,907 --> 00:56:59,109
- Are you starting?
- Of course.

1305
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:09,386
(Big bite each)

1306
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,125
I'm going to speak honestly.

1307
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:17,027
Yes, you can speak honestly.

1308
00:57:17,027 --> 00:57:18,895
I need to be objective,

1309
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:20,163
so I'll try one more bite.

1310
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:28,639
(But that's a big bite
for someone trying to be objective.)

1311
00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:30,674
(Subtly paying attention)

1312
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:33,577
It's delicious.

1313
00:57:34,945 --> 00:57:36,213
It's delicious.

1314
00:57:37,981 --> 00:57:39,016
It's a bit upsetting.

1315
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:41,018
(Instead, only his appetite got hit.)

1316
00:57:41,018 --> 00:57:42,219
It's really good.

1317
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:43,720
Su Young, I sort of taste dakgalbi.

1318
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,735
It's in between dakgalbi...

1319
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:46,890
and yangnyeom chicken
(sweet and spicy chicken).

1320
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,625
I almost fried it.

1321
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:51,395
That fried chicken taste
goes so well with sambal.

1322
00:57:51,795 --> 00:57:55,465
It's like a cross between a budae jjigae
(army stew) and a hamburger.

1323
00:57:56,466 --> 00:57:59,903
(Devouring it)

1324
00:58:00,938 --> 00:58:02,105
I think you made good choices.

1325
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:04,308
(The crew's watching like hawks...)

1326
00:58:04,641 --> 00:58:05,742
This is the fried one.

1327
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:10,180
(Curious about their reaction)

1328
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,516
It's like a hamburger that costs $55.

1329
00:58:12,516 --> 00:58:13,417
Gosh, $55?

1330
00:58:13,417 --> 00:58:15,552
(Satisfied)

1331
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:17,554
This is incredible, Su Young.

1332
00:58:17,554 --> 00:58:18,889
It's insane.

1333
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:21,391
It does look like muk.

1334
00:58:21,892 --> 00:58:23,126
How did it become this clear?

1335
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:24,127
Right?

1336
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:27,264
(Kyung Ho's Bruneian-Style Naeng Mukbap)

1337
00:58:27,564 --> 00:58:28,832
This was exactly
what you wanted, right?

1338
00:58:28,832 --> 00:58:31,168
Right. It came out similar
to cheongpo muk.

1339
00:58:31,168 --> 00:58:32,235
Can I try it?

1340
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:33,537
I'm going to try it.

1341
00:58:33,804 --> 00:58:34,938
Be honest, please.

1342
00:58:34,938 --> 00:58:38,675
(Will the texture
and the taste be similar to muk?)

1343
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:41,945
- It's good.
- Please be honest.

1344
00:58:41,945 --> 00:58:44,281
It's good! The flavor hits you right away.
It's direct.

1345
00:58:45,482 --> 00:58:48,585
(Once Kyung Ho hears that,
he takes a bite.)

1346
00:58:51,555 --> 00:58:52,656
(Surprised)

1347
00:58:52,656 --> 00:58:53,957
Hey, why is this good?

1348
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:56,193
- It works, right?
- It tastes like something they sell.

1349
00:58:56,193 --> 00:58:57,628
(Eyes full of confidence
after tasting his own dish)

1350
00:58:57,628 --> 00:58:59,396
- It works, huh?
- Yeah, it's tasty.

1351
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:03,367
(Kihyun is quietly finishing his bowl.)

1352
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:06,270
It's so much better cold like this.

1353
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,071
The texture is different
from cheongpo muk.

1354
00:59:08,071 --> 00:59:09,673
- Right.
- It's different.

1355
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,577
It's also different from starch noodles.
The texture is very interesting.

1356
00:59:15,545 --> 00:59:18,949
It's bouncy, chewy,
and it goes down really smoothly.

1357
00:59:18,949 --> 00:59:21,785
It feels bouncy, but when I bite it,
it's chewy, then it just goes down.

1358
00:59:21,785 --> 00:59:22,953
It goes well with the broth.

1359
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:27,624
Kyung Ho, I don't usually hike,

1360
00:59:27,624 --> 00:59:30,560
but this would be fantastic after a hike.

1361
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,728
You're right.

1362
00:59:31,728 --> 00:59:33,664
It's time for dessert.

1363
00:59:33,664 --> 00:59:34,765
(Dessert time)

1364
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:38,535
(Kihyun's pandan honey seolgi
is revealed.)

1365
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:43,540
(Did it work?)

1366
00:59:44,107 --> 00:59:44,841
(Bounce)

1367
00:59:46,944 --> 00:59:48,512
(It sounds bouncy for a seolgi.)

1368
00:59:48,845 --> 00:59:50,347
It looks like
a bindaetteok (savory pancake).

1369
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,782
What do I do?

1370
00:59:52,683 --> 00:59:55,185
(Frozen at the unexpected sight)

1371
00:59:55,485 --> 00:59:57,287
(Pandan honey seolgi looks very different
from the fluffy seolgi we know.)

1372
00:59:57,287 --> 00:59:58,889
I didn't know,
but according to Su Young...

1373
00:59:58,889 --> 01:00:03,026
I also had to cover the lid
so that the moisture didn't drip down.

1374
01:00:03,026 --> 01:00:05,295
But I didn't, so...

1375
01:00:06,096 --> 01:00:07,898
I don't know what...

1376
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:11,535
It turned out like a soft tteok.

1377
01:00:12,035 --> 01:00:15,439
(It's not fluffy but chewy.)

1378
01:00:15,973 --> 01:00:19,977
(How does this fluffy...
No, this chewy honey seolgi taste?)

1379
01:00:21,044 --> 01:00:25,582
(Goes for it)

1380
01:00:25,582 --> 01:00:26,817
This sort of feels like...

1381
01:00:26,817 --> 01:00:28,785
hotteok (sweet pancake).

1382
01:00:28,785 --> 01:00:30,554
(Like a thin and chewy hotteok)

1383
01:00:30,554 --> 01:00:31,388
This hotteok...

1384
01:00:31,388 --> 01:00:34,157
and the sweetness from the pandan
goes so well together.

1385
01:00:34,157 --> 01:00:35,659
(The tteok works well
with pandan's sweetness.)

1386
01:00:35,659 --> 01:00:37,628
He did make tteok.

1387
01:00:37,628 --> 01:00:39,630
No doubt, this is tteok.

1388
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,399
Look, it's super chewy.

1389
01:00:48,438 --> 01:00:50,107
It's good.

1390
01:00:50,107 --> 01:00:51,275
Why is everything good?

1391
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,110
You thought to make tteok with this?

1392
01:00:53,944 --> 01:00:58,415
The palm sugar that's inside
is also very tasty.

1393
01:00:58,882 --> 01:01:01,818
I used brown sugar and soybean powder.

1394
01:01:01,818 --> 01:01:04,554
Those are what define this as tteok.

1395
01:01:04,554 --> 01:01:05,689
(The final kick that gave it
its true tteok identity.)

1396
01:01:06,123 --> 01:01:08,925
It tastes like this when you've just mixed
palm sugar with soybean powder?

1397
01:01:08,925 --> 01:01:10,360
The filling is really good.

1398
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,030
It's like hotteok
but without the oiliness.

1399
01:01:13,397 --> 01:01:14,731
Very clean hotteok.

1400
01:01:14,831 --> 01:01:16,099
(Pandan Honey Seolgi
1. Blend 150ml milk, handful of pandan.)

1401
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:16,591
(2. Use a sieve for smooth pandan milk.)

1402
01:01:16,615 --> 01:01:17,267
(3. Mix 10T pandan milk,
450g wet-milled rice flour.)

1403
01:01:17,267 --> 01:01:18,031
(4. Sift rice flour,
mix with 20g baek seolgi.)

1404
01:01:18,055 --> 01:01:18,802
(5. Mix 50g brown sugar,
1T soybean powder.)

1405
01:01:18,802 --> 01:01:19,946
(6. Layer steamer in order of rice flour,
filling, rice flour.)

1406
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:20,470
(7. Steam 20 minutes,
rest 5 minutes.)

1407
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,306
- It's good.
- It's so chewy. It's tasty.

1408
01:01:22,306 --> 01:01:24,374
- This is really good.
- It's super chewy.

1409
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:25,342
- Are you surprised?
- It's so good.

1410
01:01:25,342 --> 01:01:27,411
Satisfied, huh?
Yeah, I'd be satisfied too.

1411
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:28,478
Ambuyat really fills you up, right?

1412
01:01:28,478 --> 01:01:29,579
Su Young, look.

1413
01:01:30,414 --> 01:01:31,615
An empty bowl.

1414
01:01:32,049 --> 01:01:34,251
You want to taste more?

1415
01:01:34,785 --> 01:01:35,819
How is it?

1416
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:37,154
Yes, tell me.

1417
01:01:37,988 --> 01:01:39,156
(The crew is buzzing
while trying Ryu-cipe dishes.)

1418
01:01:39,156 --> 01:01:40,657
The tteok is good.

1419
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:44,027
- Thank you for the food.
- No problem.

1420
01:01:44,027 --> 01:01:45,495
- It was so good.
- It's delicious.

1421
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:47,631
- This is super chewy.
- I like how bright this is.

1422
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:50,000
- I'd want to have this in the summer.
- Right?

1423
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,401
Try some.

1424
01:01:51,401 --> 01:01:52,736
Have you tried it?

1425
01:01:52,736 --> 01:01:53,770
It's good, right?

1426
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:55,639
(Satisfied)

1427
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:57,040
That makes me happy.

1428
01:01:57,507 --> 01:01:58,942
I'm very proud of myself.

1429
01:01:58,942 --> 01:02:01,311
(A satisfying night, what kinds
of Ryu-cipes will we see tomorrow?)

1430
01:02:01,845 --> 01:02:03,814
(A journey to find fresh ingredients)

1431
01:02:05,115 --> 01:02:06,984
(Clearly no ordinary beehive)

1432
01:02:07,351 --> 01:02:09,653
(Is our elite boy also scared?)

1433
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,556
This is so good.

1434
01:02:13,056 --> 01:02:14,191
(All fears melt away when the food hits.)

1435
01:02:14,491 --> 01:02:16,093
(The taste of honey
makes you forget your fears.)

1436
01:02:16,226 --> 01:02:17,861
Today's easy and sweet like honey.

1437
01:02:19,096 --> 01:02:21,465
(But do the other boys have it
easier and sweeter?)

1438
01:02:22,933 --> 01:02:25,535
(Brief moment of sweetness)

1439
01:02:25,836 --> 01:02:27,671
(Then, right back
to gathering fresh ingredients)

1440
01:02:28,238 --> 01:02:29,673
(A variety of ingredients
that awaken the instinct to challenge)

1441
01:02:29,873 --> 01:02:32,276
(They're already in cooking mode.)

1442
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,911
(The ultimate recipe is about to be born.)

1443
01:02:35,812 --> 01:02:37,914
(More unique Ryu-cipes are underway.)

1444
01:02:38,415 --> 01:02:43,387
(Elite youngest Kihyun
goes for a honey dessert.)

1445
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,921
Look at this.

1446
01:02:45,589 --> 01:02:46,423
(Has become an expert)

1447
01:02:46,923 --> 01:02:48,191
(Dessert as sweet as honey)

1448
01:02:48,191 --> 01:02:49,126
(Reactions as sweet as honey)

1449
01:02:49,293 --> 01:02:53,130
(Su Young and Kyung Ho
go for that fiery aroma.)

1450
01:02:53,764 --> 01:02:55,098
(Cooking Fairy's first
fire-grilled dish is perfect.)

1451
01:02:55,098 --> 01:02:56,300
How is it always so good?

1452
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:57,868
What is that?

1453
01:02:58,268 --> 01:03:00,270
(As expected of Ryu Su Young,
his jaw-dropping dish)

1454
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,872
It looks crazy.

1455
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,775
You're making me upset, you know.

1456
01:03:07,311 --> 01:03:09,813
You wanted to taste the Ryu-cipes, right?

1457
01:03:09,813 --> 01:03:11,081
(If you want to taste...)

1458
01:03:11,081 --> 01:03:11,982
(Brunei's Ryu-cipes...)

1459
01:03:11,982 --> 01:03:14,184
The three boys will go to you.

1460
01:03:14,184 --> 01:03:16,353
(Go now!
The Brunei Ryu-cipe Pop-up)

1461
01:03:16,353 --> 01:03:19,923
A dash of uniqueness we learned
gets added to a familiar flavor.

1462
01:03:19,923 --> 01:03:21,058
A dash.

1463
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:24,461
Once you try it,
you'll keep making it at home.

1464
01:03:25,095 --> 01:03:27,097
(Where's the Brunei Ryu-cipe Pop-up?)

1465
01:03:27,097 --> 01:03:29,967
- Come to meet the three boys.
- Come.
