1
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:15,105
(During the three days of studying abroad,
the members experienced a lot of things.)

2
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:17,274
Portugal cuisine...

3
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:18,508
is like a survival game.

4
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:20,310
Only one survives.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,712
Only one flavor survives.

6
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:23,947
Portugal cuisine...

7
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:26,550
is about flavors that stay true
to the ingredients.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,286
In Portugal cuisine,
the ingredient is everything.

9
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:30,520
That's why it's amazing.

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:36,326
(With fresh ingredients from Portugal...)

11
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,098
It's about presenting the dish
with their own unique flair.

12
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:42,099
(The members added their unique kicks.)

13
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:44,801
I wanted to come up with a recipe...

14
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:46,103
that was easy but also delicious.

15
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,237
(Ryu-cipes were born.)

16
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:53,310
(The member's Ryu-cipes,
infused with the spirit of Porto)

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,578
The depth of flavor is insane.

18
00:00:55,912 --> 00:01:00,784
(They will invite guests to have a taste.)

19
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:04,321
The locals like pork, so...

20
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,857
(Three different meat dishes
that are catered to the locals)

21
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:11,561
(Taste of Korea, ssambap (lettuce wrap))

22
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:14,231
(Plus, a super simple dessert)

23
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:18,435
(What kind of Ryu-cipes will they create
for this grand finale feast?)

24
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:20,704
Someone should sing to hype up the mood.

25
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:21,939
Should we turn on some music?

26
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:23,173
Yes, please, while we cook.

27
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:24,908
- You need music when working.
- Yeah?

28
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:26,209
Just sing.

29
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:30,480
<i>No matter what I'm doing,
you're always on my mind</i>

30
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,350
Being in a foreign country
makes me miss my wife.

31
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,752
Mr. Yoon,
you're 54 years old, not 44, right?

32
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:42,559
(Doesn't care and continues singing)

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,597
(Somehow, the song
fits their situation perfectly.)

34
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:49,733
Sir, what about a song
that's more upbeat?

35
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:51,902
My child, then you should sing.

36
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,372
- Should I try singing?
- Yes, Nam Seon.

37
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:56,473
I'll sing one then.

38
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:58,308
- I don't really know any, though.
- Belt it out.

39
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,010
Then just listen.

40
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:07,050
(While the older boys are bickering,
Kihyun is laser-focused all alone.)

41
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:09,853
You should make the marinade first.

42
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:14,358
(He's not cooking, but watching YouTube?)

43
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,492
He's right there,

44
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:17,194
so it feels weird to be watching him
on YouTube.

45
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,496
Did you say something to me?

46
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:21,465
I know. You're watching his YouTube,
but he's right here,

47
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:22,599
so it feels weird, right?

48
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,434
- You're watching that?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:27,037
I want to be precise.

50
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:29,239
(Kihyun is watching
Su Young's jeyuk bokkeum recipe.)

51
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:32,743
(Home cook master Ryu Su Young's
foolproof recipe)

52
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:36,747
(Ryu Su Young's jeyuk bokkeum
(spicy stir-fried pork) recipe)

53
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:39,650
We're cooking for guests this time, so...

54
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,887
I was sort of inspired by bifana.

55
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:48,525
- This is jeyuk.
- It is.

56
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:52,062
With just a slight Korean touch,
I think this can become totally Korean.

57
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:56,300
(A taste of Korea you enjoy with bread)

58
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,370
(Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
Portuguese Jeyuk Bokkeum)

59
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:04,908
(Following Su Young's recipe
and starting by making the marinade)

60
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:09,579
(1. Adding sugar first helps the rest
dissolve and blend more smoothly.)

61
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:15,018
(2. Add the soy sauce and mix well
to deepen the flavor.)

62
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:20,023
(3. Adding gochujang, a thicker paste,
at the end helps it blend smoothly.)

63
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:24,194
(2T of garlic / 1T of sesame oil)

64
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,798
- Oh, man.
- Why?

65
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,233
It smells incredible.

66
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:32,736
Is it in here?

67
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,237
(Which ingredient is Kihyun looking for?)

68
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:38,675
(What's this?)

69
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:40,444
Do you know what this it?

70
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:42,245
(Is this Kihyun's secret weapon?)

71
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,214
I found a replacement
for Korean pear juice.

72
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:46,516
Did you try it
to see if it tastes similar?

73
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:48,118
Not yet. I'm going to try it.

74
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:49,453
Yeah, you should.

75
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:51,188
(You must taste new ingredients
before use.)

76
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,059
What is this?
Su Young, this isn't like the Korean one.

77
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,494
(It doesn't taste familiar.)

78
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:59,663
It's creamy.

79
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,465
(A taste that speaks for itself)

80
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:03,066
It's citrusy too.

81
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,335
This is nectar.

82
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:06,670
They added salt.

83
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,072
Like the juice inside a canned fruit.

84
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,540
It's that juice, blended.

85
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,709
They salted some pear and blended it.

86
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,345
Do we have any pears left?

87
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:18,048
We had bought some,
but we used them.

88
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,583
- We have some.
- We do?

89
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,487
Peel two of these and grate them.

90
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:25,188
These kinds of...

91
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,492
smell like green apples.

92
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,628
(Peel the rough skin
and add them to the marinade.)

93
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,563
Do you know where...

94
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:36,667
- the grater is?
- We don't have it?

95
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,468
(Spots something)

96
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:41,238
(Ryu-GPT has spotted a cheese grater.)

97
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:43,006
- I can use this, right?
- It won't be easy but try.

98
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:45,542
It won't take long
if you just go like this.

99
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,278
(Shake, shake)

100
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:52,582
(Grating pears like they're cheese)

101
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,685
It's working really well.

102
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:55,852
That's good.

103
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:01,258
(Taste checking the marinade
after adding some grated pear)

104
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:04,161
(Streams of wows)

105
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:05,495
It's good?

106
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:06,563
Su Young.

107
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,131
- It's done?
- It's really good.

108
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,200
If the marinade is this good...

109
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,768
It can't be too salty
because then the meat will be too salty.

110
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:13,236
- It's not too salty.
- Good.

111
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:18,408
(Add the prepped pork shoulders
to the marinade.)

112
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:23,080
(Massage gently
to help the seasoning absorb well.)

113
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:25,415
How does this look?

114
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:27,384
What? Yes, Kihyun.

115
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:28,652
That's definitely jeyuk.

116
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:30,754
That has to taste good.

117
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:34,157
(Let the meat rest in the marinade
in the fridge.)

118
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:38,061
(The master of spicy pork,
what's Su-young's Ryu-cipe?)

119
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,030
It's bone-in.

120
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,032
They gave us the bones like this.

121
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:43,200
(He's working with meat too.)

122
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:46,670
I should brine these.

123
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,871
(A whole slab of meat)

124
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:51,141
The locals from this region like pork,

125
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:52,509
so I wanted to cook some meat.

126
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:55,819
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
is half-and-half meat.)

127
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:58,415
(Half cooked with salt,
and half cooked with sauce)

128
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:05,389
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
Salt Grilled Pork Belly, Port Wine Ribs)

129
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,060
(And like that,
meat breakdown performance begins.)

130
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:13,030
(Scoring with a knife for slabs of meat)

131
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,531
Look at those bones.

132
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,267
Those are skin-on, right?

133
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:19,903
Yes, these are skin-on. You're right.

134
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,538
(Unlike regular pork belly,
these have skim on them.)

135
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:25,208
(How do you prepare pork belly
with skin-on?)

136
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,045
(What?)

137
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:35,252
(Tries scoring it,
but not even a scratch)

138
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,322
The skin is crazy.

139
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:42,326
I can't believe it's this tough.

140
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:45,896
(Is even Su Young struggling
with the Porto pork?)

141
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,998
I'll cut it first.

142
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:55,539
(Power up)

143
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:59,343
(Cutting with all his might)

144
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:05,182
(First, divide it
into three with all his strength.)

145
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:11,855
(He changes his plan to scoring them
after cutting them into smaller pieces.)

146
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:17,027
Be careful with salt
so that it's not too salty.

147
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:19,196
(Start brining the prepped pork belly
with 1T of salt.)

148
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,367
(Already tired from prepping some meat)

149
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:27,804
(Next, he starts cooking the ribs.)

150
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,175
(But he's pouring water?)

151
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:37,714
(When you cook the meat first,
it will absorb the sauce better.)

152
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:41,151
(It's time to glaze these boiled ribs.)

153
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:44,721
(The first step of making the rib sauce
is to start with basic Korean flavors.)

154
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:49,593
(1T of soy sauce,
1T of sesame oil, 1/2T of sugar)

155
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,762
(What goes in next?)

156
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,096
I should add some now.

157
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:56,700
(Port wine)

158
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:58,669
Pork wine.

159
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:03,607
(A touch of Portuguese flavor
to this basic Korean sauce)

160
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:09,379
(The kick to this sauce is the port wine
that will add flavor and soften the meat.)

161
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:11,882
The ribs need to go in.

162
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,886
(First, port wine ribs)

163
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,957
These bones...
When I was buying these,

164
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,425
they were all bone-in.

165
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:23,927
Are they like pork ribs?

166
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:26,129
Galbi (ribs) that looks like pork rib?

167
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,664
These are pork ribs.

168
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:33,203
(Evenly-coated port wine ribs
go on the bottom of the air fryer.)

169
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,541
(Next, the slabs of pork belly
he had brined)

170
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,278
(Before grilling, pat the skin
of the pork belly dry with a paper towel.)

171
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,813
I need to pat the skin dry.

172
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,815
(Pat the skin dry before grilling
for a crispier skin.)

173
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,284
It's not too important,
but pat the skin dry.

174
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:52,155
(After patting them dry,
the slabs of pork belly go on top.)

175
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,994
(Grill the pork belly and the ribs
for 45 minutes at 160 degrees.)

176
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,596
This air fryer is good.
It grills well too.

177
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:00,664
(While the pork belly cooks on top...)

178
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:03,133
(And the port wine ribs
cook on the bottom...)

179
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,372
(Kihyun starts cooking the jeyuk.)

180
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,377
(Even the sizzling sounds delicious)

181
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:17,481
Let's be bold.

182
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:20,350
(What did he add?)

183
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,153
It's already really good.
The marinade turned out great.

184
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:25,188
I'm serious. It's already perfect.

185
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:29,226
But we're cooking for guests this time.

186
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,864
(Kihyun's kick for his Ryu-cipe
is heavy cream.)

187
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:39,069
So, it depends on whether
this rose jeyuk succeeds.

188
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:46,109
(How will this rose jeyuk taste?)

189
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:51,882
It's unbelievably good.

190
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,517
(Eyes of confidence)

191
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,252
Do you want to try it?

192
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,354
It's a bit hot.

193
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:58,689
(Asking the staff for their opinion)

194
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:01,591
(Cooling it down)

195
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:06,096
(What will the staff think?)

196
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:08,198
It's good,

197
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:09,566
but it's not rose.

198
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,470
(taken aback)

199
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,640
Maybe I'll add more, little by little...

200
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,109
If you're going for rose,
make it really taste like one.

201
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,444
All right. Let's just try it.

202
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:23,847
(Adding heavy cream)

203
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:26,350
(Adding more heavy cream)

204
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,620
The color now looks more
like a rose sauce.

205
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:32,255
It's still too watery.

206
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:33,423
Is it?

207
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:37,027
It'll be better since the marinade
will really get in there.

208
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,296
(Mouth watering)

209
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,331
Can I... Are these cooked?

210
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,736
(How will the jeyuk taste
now that the cream has soaked in?)

211
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,505
Is there something I can cut with?

212
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:49,873
Why? What do you need?

213
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:50,941
I'm looking for scissors.

214
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,342
It's okay. I'll eat a big piece.

215
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:53,577
Sure, go ahead.

216
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:55,312
It's not even that big.

217
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:01,885
(Eyes widen)

218
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:02,919
It's good.

219
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,857
If you cook this for kids in Korea,
they'd love it.

220
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:08,625
(Wait...)

221
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,728
You will cut the bread in half
and add the meat...

222
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:13,630
- like bifana?
- Yes, exactly.

223
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:16,233
You need to test it then, right?

224
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,467
Yeah, I do.

225
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:19,770
I'll give you the pieces that look cooked.

226
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,138
So that you can just taste it.

227
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:23,840
I want two.

228
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,075
Two pieces.

229
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:27,611
Two pieces of meat
inside the bread like this, then...

230
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:34,284
(Definitely not because he wants to eat)

231
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:36,520
Okay...

232
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:38,622
Is it too creamy?

233
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:39,690
(No.)

234
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,892
It's good,

235
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:43,994
but it'd be better
if the flavor was stronger.

236
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:46,797
It tastes a bit bland
when I have it with bread.

237
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:48,899
Man, I get easily swayed, you know.

238
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,169
I'll add it to this.

239
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,637
(After getting Kyung Ho's feedback,
Kihyun adds something.)

240
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:57,708
(The heat behind Porto's flavor,
the piri-piri sauce)

241
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,644
(Careful)

242
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:03,547
It'll be fine.

243
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:04,615
Right?

244
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:11,421
(Adding the piri-piri marinade
into the rose jeyuk bokkeum)

245
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:16,360
(Stir-fry until the meat
soaks up the marinade.)

246
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:21,498
(Now that piri-piri's in the mix,
how will the jeyuk taste?)

247
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,168
The smell is insane.

248
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:26,970
Is it salty?

249
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,238
It's not salty at all.

250
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:29,239
You can cook it down more.

251
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,974
When you're eating it with bread,
it should be a bit salty.

252
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,542
It smells insane.

253
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:37,581
(His expression tells all)

254
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,616
- It's good, right?
- I need some rice.

255
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,152
It doesn't need any more seasoning.

256
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,155
I think...

257
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:47,024
you don't need to add more.
It's already good.

258
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:51,061
Be confident. It's really delicious.

259
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:53,130
So good.

260
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,333
(Su Young's meat dishes
have finished cooking as well.)

261
00:12:58,568 --> 00:12:59,970
That's crazy.

262
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,506
(Here comes
the perfectly grilled pork belly.)

263
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:05,142
It's making my stomach growl.

264
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:08,946
Success.

265
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:12,249
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
Grilled Whole Pork Belly)

266
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:17,120
(Golden brown, juicy grilled pork belly)

267
00:13:17,988 --> 00:13:21,792
(Next comes the port wine ribs.)

268
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:30,500
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
Port Wine Ribs)

269
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:32,235
(Port Wine Ribs)

270
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:34,171
(1. Prep the bones then boil in water.)

271
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:35,205
(2. Drain water, reduce with 1T soy sauce,
1T sesame oil, 1/2T sugar, 20ml port.)

272
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,974
(3. Cook for 45 minutes at 160 degrees
in the air fryer.)

273
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:42,079
(Following Su Young's dishes,
Kihyun's rose jeyuk is ready too.)

274
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:47,818
The dishes make them look tastier.

275
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,119
(Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
Rose Jeyuk Bokkeum)

276
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:50,887
They complement the food well.

277
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,022
(Rose Jeyuk Bokkeum)

278
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:53,123
(1. Mix 2T sugar, 3T soy sauce, 3T garlic,
1T sesame oil, 2 grated pears.)

279
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,691
(2. Mix with 1kg of pork shoulder, grill.
3. Add heavy cream to your liking.)

280
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,061
Su Young, was that mushroom
from yesterday giant shiitake?

281
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,162
Yeah.

282
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:03,100
- I was inspired by those mushrooms.
- Nice.

283
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,935
So, I'm going to use small shiitakes...

284
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:07,204
Mushrooms are a great idea.

285
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:08,972
And make shiitake rice.

286
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,042
The potato rice I made on the first day...

287
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:13,644
was pretty good, I think.

288
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:17,681
- The smell is unbelievable.
- It's insane.

289
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,150
The smell of it makes your mouth water.

290
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,121
(Added the turnip green sauce
to create his Ryu-cipe dish.)

291
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,493
I feel like my eyes are going to pop out.

292
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,761
(It was so good
that his eyes were about to pop out.)

293
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:33,363
How is this so delicious?

294
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:35,666
Hey, why is this so good?

295
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:40,070
The boys really enjoyed it,
so it made me super excited.

296
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,539
It brought back my confidence.

297
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:45,075
It might be a bit unfamiliar,
but I wanted to cook...

298
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,977
a healthy rice dish for the guests.

299
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,379
Mushrooms are a great idea.

300
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,315
Just adding the mushrooms
will be good too,

301
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:53,483
but mushrooms go really well with butter.

302
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:56,086
So, add a big chunk of butter, like 50g.

303
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:57,854
That's like three spoonfuls of butter.

304
00:14:57,854 --> 00:15:00,223
That'll make the rice fluffy and glossy.

305
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,527
(Prepping the main ingredient
of the shiitake rice, the shiitake.)

306
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:05,696
Su Young, is this size okay?

307
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,699
When I tried it,
thin slices were better for eating.

308
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,068
Instead of biting
into a chunk of mushroom,

309
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:13,403
it's more refined
when the mushroom comes through subtly.

310
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:15,439
- Thin slices are better.
- Okay, thank you.

311
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:17,929
(Shiitake rice)

312
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:22,245
(1. Add a generous amount
of the sliced shiitakes into the rice.)

313
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:28,018
(Staring)

314
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,188
Kihyun, is this butter?

315
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:34,324
It's butter.

316
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,293
It's unsalted though.

317
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,261
- Unsalted butter?
- Yeah.

318
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:40,897
(Adding butter to the rice
as its secret weapon.)

319
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:43,233
I wonder how the rice will turn out.

320
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:50,607
(Open the lid and stir
to make sure it doesn't burn.)

321
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,479
There's too much water.

322
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,783
(Unexpectedly,
the mushroom rice seems too watery.)

323
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:02,619
(Full of worries)

324
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:03,654
What is this?

325
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,289
- Rice.
- I see.

326
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:07,424
So you're trying to make
mushroom juk (rice porridge),

327
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,892
I mean mushroom rice.

328
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:12,629
I'm also worried it might turn into juk.

329
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:15,332
(I'm sorry.)

330
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,401
You just blurted out
what you were really thinking, didn't you?

331
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:18,435
I'm sorry, Kyung Ho.

332
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:21,605
(Hearing it confirmed
just made things feel worse.)

333
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,176
(It still looks like mushroom juk.)

334
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,982
(I cannot mess this up
since I'm serving it to guests.)

335
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,722
(Kyung Ho hasn't left the rice
for 30 minutes.)

336
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,896
(Pacing nervously)

337
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:48,765
Su Young,

338
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:52,636
- I think I messed up.
- Why? What's wrong with the rice?

339
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,740
Last time, the rice was a bit...
you know...

340
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,710
- You added more?
- I think I added too much.

341
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,378
So I've been cooking it for a while.

342
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:02,980
That would've turned it into a juk.

343
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,548
Yeah,

344
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,116
so I've been letting it just sit,

345
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:07,918
but now, I think it's undercooked.

346
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:09,086
Let me check.

347
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:10,320
(Kyung Ho thinks it's undercooked.)

348
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,289
I'm just letting it rest right now.

349
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:16,426
(What will Ryu-GPT think?)

350
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:17,561
This is fine.

351
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:19,129
The locals love this texture.

352
00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:21,198
- Really?
- Yeah. You're fine.

353
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:22,966
So I turn off the heat
and let it rest?

354
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:24,134
Yeah. Just let it rest now.

355
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,769
- You did well. It's good.
- Thank goodness.

356
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:28,138
- It still has a bite to it.
- Yeah, that worried me.

357
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:30,107
They love that here.
It's like risotto.

358
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:32,075
You just made risotto with rice.

359
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:37,881
(Risotto, where rice is sautéed
and slowly simmered in broth.)

360
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:42,552
(It looks similar to juk,
but it has a firm texture.)

361
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:47,658
Good thing you added butter.
The seasoning is perfect.

362
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:49,726
This is like when we have Italian food.

363
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:50,894
It's good.

364
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:52,596
So it turned out well.

365
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:53,730
Yeah, this is totally fine.

366
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,132
The flavor is incredible too.

367
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:58,115
(Perfect flavor, aroma,
and even texture)

368
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:00,103
(Rice man
Kyung Ho's shiitake rice is ready.)

369
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:01,538
Then on this...

370
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,973
(Time to take out
the boiled turnip greens.)

371
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,796
(Turnip Green Sauce)

372
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,612
(1. Place the boiled turnip greens
in an ice bath to enhance their texture.)

373
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,748
- Garlic? Smash it.
- I'll mince them.

374
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,617
Pretend like
you're trying to catch mosquitoes.

375
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:14,785
How would you catch mosquitoes?

376
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:16,219
(Mosquito)

377
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:17,821
That's it. It works, right?

378
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:18,956
(Mosquito)

379
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:20,724
- There you go.
- Got one.

380
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:23,961
- You're doing well.
- This is sort of stress relieving.

381
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,131
(Kyung Ho, hyped from catching a mosquito,
goes full garlic smash mode.)

382
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:29,232
Bam!

383
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:34,271
(Confidence boost)

384
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,807
(Instinctive response)

385
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:38,141
It sounds like music.

386
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:39,276
Right?

387
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,578
That's enough.

388
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,380
- Nice. Pass me the knife.
- Here.

389
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:46,116
(A taste of Korean spice,
minced garlic is ready.)

390
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,220
(Adding a spoonful of garlic
to the basic sauce from the first day)

391
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:53,023
(Season the turnip green with 3 pinches
of seasoned salt, and 1T of sesame oil.)

392
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:56,526
Right, since you have a separate sauce
for the rice.

393
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:58,428
(A seasoning that preserves the flavor
while balancing the entire dish.)

394
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,796
Su Young,

395
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:03,066
I made the sauce like this.

396
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:07,604
Last time, I cut these
into small pieces and added them here.

397
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,805
You added them to the sauce?

398
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:10,207
Yeah, I wanted to mix it
with the rice.

399
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,675
You want to do it differently this time?

400
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:14,177
I want to somehow use this, but...

401
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,113
(Ryu-GPT scans the turnip greens.)

402
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,314
How about spreading this out
and adding it?

403
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:19,516
Since these are soft now...

404
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:21,251
Should I just roll them up?

405
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:24,087
With cabbage and this and rice...

406
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:26,723
It might be better to just
make a rolled dish, right?

407
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:29,726
Like a cabbage ssam (wrap),
I'll roll the rice like this,

408
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:32,129
then they can have it with soy sauce.

409
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,064
I'll make it like that
so that it's easier to eat.

410
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:40,070
(Ingredients for the cabbage
and turnip green ssambap are ready.)

411
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:44,041
(Cut the cabbage
so that you can roll them.)

412
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,211
(Place a seasoned turnip green
on the cabbage.)

413
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:53,450
(Then add a generous amount
of the shiitake rice and the sauce.)

414
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:59,656
(Now, it's time to roll it up.)

415
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:05,028
Why can't I...

416
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,296
roll this up nicely?

417
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:07,798
(Cabbage ssams
aren't shaping up as planned.)

418
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,934
(Big sigh)

419
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,273
Come on. This has to work.

420
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:17,574
Nothing is impossible.

421
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,346
(Hesitating)

422
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:27,451
(Failed ssam goes into Kyung Ho's mouth.)

423
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:29,519
It tastes good.

424
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:33,890
But I'm trying to roll these,
and it's not working.

425
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,559
- Su Young.
- Yes?

426
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,628
- You know, this...
- Yes?

427
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:40,597
I can't quite get the shape right
when I try to roll it.

428
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:43,166
It doesn't really hold its shape.
What should I do?

429
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,203
Making ssambap isn't easy.
It's hard to make.

430
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:48,672
Use the plate...

431
00:20:50,107 --> 00:20:52,342
Should we try to roll it like a gimbap?

432
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:54,745
So I spread this and roll?

433
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:56,346
Yeah. Let's try that. Wait a second.

434
00:20:56,346 --> 00:20:58,382
You can't do it as is.
It won't roll with that.

435
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,183
(Brought a large cutting board)

436
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:02,319
There's 15 minutes left.

437
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,487
You can do it.

438
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:06,390
I knew I should've brought
a gimbap roller.

439
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:10,394
(They don't have a roller
that could help with the shape.)

440
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,097
(What's Ryu-GPT's solution?)

441
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:15,365
You have to have a mold,

442
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:16,700
and roll it thinly.

443
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,535
Don't make it thick like gimbap.

444
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:19,736
(The solution is using aluminum foil.)

445
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:23,473
(The plan is to use it
to shape the ssams instead of a roller.)

446
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:27,210
So, this is what I'm thinking.

447
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:29,179
I don't know if it'll work.

448
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,415
Just don't get too greedy, right?

449
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,617
This feels way too much like a struggle.

450
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:36,186
(Spread the seasoned turnip greens
on the rice.)

451
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:38,422
This is very wet, you know?

452
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:41,291
You need to mix this every time
since the oil will keep separating.

453
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,528
(Desperate)

454
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:50,701
Please.

455
00:21:55,572 --> 00:21:58,141
(Super focused)

456
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,948
(Use a foil instead of a roller
to press and roll.)

457
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:08,752
(Cutting while still wrapped in foil?)

458
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,554
You're cutting it wrapped like that?

459
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:12,222
Pretty.

460
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:14,224
(Ryu-GPT's solution to keep the shape)

461
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,126
Now, unwrap the foil like this.

462
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,160
You need to be gentle.

463
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,263
(Will it hold its shape
even after unwrapping?)

464
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:22,966
What if we ask them to unwrap it?

465
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,269
This isn't a convenience store.

466
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,478
(The first cabbage ssambap is ready.)

467
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:36,880
(Impressed)

468
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,351
(Exits like a hero)

469
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:45,555
He totally saved this almost-failed dish.

470
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:48,058
This is why
people can't stop talking about him.

471
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:52,195
(Kyung Ho, firmly and skillfully pressing
as he works.)

472
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:55,599
You were rolling gimbap in another show,
and now, you're rolling cabbage.

473
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:59,036
Nothing you learn ever goes to waste.

474
00:22:59,036 --> 00:23:00,737
(This is the skill of someone
who's rolled 300 gimbaps.)

475
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:09,913
(Satisfied)

476
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:14,051
(Fragrant shiitake rice
wrapped in turnip greens and cabbage)

477
00:23:14,985 --> 00:23:18,255
(It's an upgrade
in both flavor and presentation.)

478
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,123
(Cabbage and Turnip Green Ssambap /
Shiitake Rice)

479
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:21,758
(1. Soak 4 cups of rice for 30 minutes,
add to a pot with equal amount of water.)

480
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:23,160
(2. Add sliced shiitakes, 50g butter,
1T seasoned salt, and stir frequently.)

481
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,761
(3. Boil without lid for 15 minutes,
rest for 15 minutes with no heat.)

482
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:27,831
Apparently, no dessert is a crime here.

483
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:30,834
Portugal is serious about dessert.

484
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:35,672
(Ryu Su Young's super simple
dessert recipe)

485
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:38,742
(What's Su Young's first ingredient?)

486
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:42,913
(A ready-made product
bought from a bakery)

487
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,151
(Replace it with any type of bread,
like castella or white bread.)

488
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:52,322
They like eggs,

489
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:55,525
so I'm going to make an eggy dessert.

490
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,662
I think people from Portugal...

491
00:23:58,662 --> 00:24:01,498
Portuguese people have this special power
when it comes to using eggs.

492
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:04,635
Tarts and castella,
which are made with eggs,

493
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:06,637
have really developed a lot.

494
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:08,839
That's why I thought of using eggs.

495
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:10,807
(Su Young's dessert is a toast.)

496
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:13,143
One egg and a cup of milk.

497
00:24:13,143 --> 00:24:16,613
I mixed a few of these ingredients
and upgraded it.

498
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:25,622
(2. Once the mixture is creamy,
fully soak the bread in the mixture.)

499
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,761
(Melt some butter in the pan,
which will add that nuttiness.)

500
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:35,532
(Toast the bread
after it's soaked up the mixture.)

501
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:39,303
Where is this sweetness coming from?

502
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:40,604
It was this.

503
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:47,945
(When the golden egg-crusted bread
starts tempting Kihyun's nose...)

504
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,348
I forgot to make syrup.

505
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:55,652
(Step 2 for a flavor upgrade)

506
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:59,589
(8T of sugar)

507
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:05,462
(Adding port wine, a must in Porto.)

508
00:25:06,863 --> 00:25:08,298
I added 100ml.

509
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,968
(100ml of port wine)

510
00:25:12,402 --> 00:25:17,107
(A simple wine syrup combining
the wine's aroma and sugar's sweetness)

511
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:24,514
(Coat the toast in wine syrup
for an upgrade.)

512
00:25:24,514 --> 00:25:27,751
The stainless steel container is nice
because it's square-shaped.

513
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,321
We only have ten minutes left.

514
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,290
There's only ten minutes left?

515
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,491
We need to set the table.

516
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,961
(The kick for Su Young's dessert)

517
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:41,832
(Homemade strawberry jam
that can be ready in 10 minutes)

518
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:46,169
(1. Reduce the sliced strawberries,
being careful not to mash them.)

519
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,405
Gosh, the smell.

520
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,708
- Strawberries are foolproof.
- What is this smell?

521
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,543
Strawberries.

522
00:25:53,543 --> 00:25:54,878
You're making a jam?

523
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:55,979
Yes.

524
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:57,314
Just until it becomes a jam.

525
00:25:57,314 --> 00:25:58,949
So that it's not too jammy.

526
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:00,417
I want them to bite into
bits of fresh fruit.

527
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:02,819
You can only have this homemade.

528
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:04,021
It smells so good.

529
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,089
(Once the strawberries have reduced
but still hold their shape...)

530
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:15,432
(2. For a thick texture,
add 2 big spoonfuls of sugar and mix.)

531
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:20,037
(Add some lemon zest and lemon juice
for that brightness.)

532
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:31,548
(How will the finished
strawberry jam taste?)

533
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:33,250
It's electrifying.

534
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:35,953
What did you do?

535
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:39,323
Want to try some
electrifying hot strawberries?

536
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:41,458
It'll wake you up.

537
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:42,459
It's sweet. You're okay?

538
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:43,460
It's hot.

539
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:47,431
(Be careful not to get a burn
from the strawberries.)

540
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:49,399
(Electrifying)

541
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,034
That sugar rush hits hard.

542
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:52,936
Nice and citrusy, right?

543
00:26:52,936 --> 00:26:54,571
It's sweet and citrusy...

544
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,173
and hot.

545
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:57,941
It's got everything.

546
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,811
Hot strawberries are very interesting.

547
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:01,945
You must try it.

548
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:04,881
It sort of tastes like raspberries.

549
00:27:04,881 --> 00:27:06,450
- Like a berry, right?
- Yes.

550
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,619
I added some lemon and the zest.

551
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,420
- That's why it's so bright.
- That's why...

552
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,956
- Wakes you up, right?
- Yes, it's so good.

553
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,592
We need a strong finish.

554
00:27:16,793 --> 00:27:21,064
(Cool it in the fridge,
and your homemade strawberry jam is done.)

555
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:25,269
Now, I just have to top this
with ice cream and the strawberry compote.

556
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,503
That'll make it delicious.

557
00:27:26,903 --> 00:27:30,607
(Top it with homemade strawberry jam.)

558
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:37,014
(The locals will for sure love
this super simple dessert by Su Young.)

559
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,949
(Super Simple Port Wine Toast / Toast)

560
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,018
(1. Soak the ready-made bread with 6 eggs,
2T heavy cream, 1T milk.)

561
00:27:41,018 --> 00:27:42,586
(2. Melt the butter in a heated pan,
toast the soaked bread, then let it cook.)

562
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:44,154
(3. Make simple syrup with 8T sugar,
100ml port wine, coat the toast.)

563
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:47,112
(On their last day in Porto)

564
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:50,727
(They've filled the table
with Ryu-cipe dishes.)

565
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:52,262
- Kyung Ho.
- Yeah?

566
00:27:52,262 --> 00:27:53,630
What are you going to wear?

567
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,765
I'm not sure.

568
00:27:54,765 --> 00:27:56,566
Wearing workout clothes
is a bit weird, right?

569
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:57,801
Yeah, that's a bit...

570
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,403
Right, since we're having guests.

571
00:27:59,403 --> 00:28:02,139
- Good work.
- We all worked hard.

572
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,274
Should I wear glasses or no?

573
00:28:04,274 --> 00:28:05,342
Wear them.

574
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:06,343
- They're okay?
- Yeah.

575
00:28:06,343 --> 00:28:07,411
- Should I wear them?
- Yeah.

576
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:10,314
I mean, you still look nice
without them,

577
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,650
but wearing them
makes you look more formal.

578
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,252
Since we do have wine glassed and all...

579
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,121
Should I open a bottle of wine?

580
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:20,057
Should we open one? Maybe a white wine...

581
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,125
Sometimes, you can just pull it out.

582
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,328
(Destroying the cork)

583
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,429
No, use a knife.

584
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,097
I'll do it.

585
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:28,865
(In that moment...)

586
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:33,136
(No one noticed it.)

587
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:34,371
Hello.

588
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:36,540
(Surprised)

589
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:38,675
Hello, good evening.

590
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:42,112
(The first guest
to visit the Ryu-cipe students?)

591
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:46,917
(The local meal master
they met on their first day)

592
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,621
(It was their first taste
of Portuguese local meal.)

593
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,090
(The experience helped them tremendously
in creating Ryu-cipes.)

594
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,791
- Feels like a real grandma-style cooking.

595
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,228
(The first guest
is the Portuguese local meal master.)

596
00:28:58,228 --> 00:29:00,964
- Thank you for waiting.
- This is my daughter.

597
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:03,033
Nice to meet you.

598
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,201
Nice to meet you too.

599
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,335
(Nice manners)

600
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:07,638
Thank you.

601
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:11,875
The food smells so good.

602
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:13,744
Thank you.

603
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:15,412
We tried our best,

604
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:17,981
but she's such a master
when it comes to cooking.

605
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:19,683
No.

606
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:20,917
Why are you nervous?

607
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,953
Don't be nervous.

608
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:24,921
I'm nervous.

609
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:26,757
(How could we not be nervous?)

610
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:29,660
We prepared this all together
for three hours.

611
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:31,561
Talk to them.

612
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:34,431
I mean... It's...

613
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:36,433
They're too nervous.

614
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:39,236
You must be hungry, right?
I'm sure the wait felt long.

615
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:41,805
(Rambling nonsense)

616
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:47,177
We would love to start the dinner,

617
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:48,812
but we were thinking about...

618
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:52,182
having our coordinators also eat with us.

619
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:54,751
- That sounds great.
- Please come.

620
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,986
Yeah, having you guys there...

621
00:29:55,986 --> 00:29:57,854
is more uncomfortable
because we all keep looking that way.

622
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:02,592
In Portugal, everyone is a guest.

623
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,561
Please take a seat.

624
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:07,197
But Su Young...

625
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:09,266
are we only having four guests?

626
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,301
No, there's supposed to be one more guest,
but they're not here yet.

627
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:14,104
- The guy who helped me catch sea urchins.
- Right.

628
00:30:14,738 --> 00:30:17,941
(In front of the member's place)

629
00:30:20,143 --> 00:30:22,412
(Is it here?)

630
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,251
(Who's their last guest?)

631
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:29,286
Shall we cheers?

632
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,088
(I'm here.)

633
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,423
The guest is here.

634
00:30:35,192 --> 00:30:36,526
The sea urchin bro is here.

635
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:42,799
(The guest Su Young's been waiting for
is finally here.)

636
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:45,769
He caught sea urchins for me.

637
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,138
(A quick break by the beach
in front of their house)

638
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,007
So pretty under the water.

639
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,342
It's filled with sea urchins.

640
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:55,979
Whoa, it's a rock urchin!

641
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,785
Why are there so many sea urchins?

642
00:31:02,252 --> 00:31:03,353
Does no one eat these here?

643
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:04,688
Do you need this?

644
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,424
- Do you have a spoon?
- Yes.

645
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,194
(Ran into him by chance
and even got permission to film!)

646
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,830
(Wild Portuguese sea urchin)

647
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:15,365
(Opened the sea urchins
one by one for Su Young)

648
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:17,768
I get to eat a sea urchin
straight from the ocean?

649
00:31:21,405 --> 00:31:22,873
He's a chef.

650
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:26,810
He's on his vacation right now...

651
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,113
and is staying with his family.

652
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:31,648
Welcome.

653
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,084
You invited me to dinner
even though we've never met before.

654
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:37,554
What if I was a serial killer?

655
00:31:38,422 --> 00:31:39,489
That's true.

656
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:41,792
He did seem weird.

657
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:44,928
He had a plastic bag and a spoon on him.

658
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:47,230
As he was walking around,
he kept doing this...

659
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,532
and eating like this.

660
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,601
Were you having lunch?

661
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:57,074
I was collecting ingredients for dinner.

662
00:31:57,674 --> 00:32:00,243
Please, enjoy the food now.

663
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,479
We made lots.
We have lots of meat as well.

664
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:03,847
Please enjoy as much as you want.

665
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:05,048
(All the guests are here.)

666
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,416
Nice.

667
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:09,553
The food smells so good.

668
00:32:09,953 --> 00:32:13,991
(Su Young and Kihyun's perfectly aromatic
trio of meat dishes)

669
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:17,995
(Kyung Ho's ambitious creation,
upgraded cabbage and green turnip ssambap)

670
00:32:17,995 --> 00:32:21,031
Not the fanciest dishes,
but I hope it you like them.

671
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:22,366
I hope you enjoy.

672
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:23,767
Thank you.

673
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:27,537
If you want more, you just have to ask.

674
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:30,874
(What's this?)

675
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,211
(What's the chef observing?)

676
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:38,181
(He's not observing it
but taking it apart.)

677
00:32:38,181 --> 00:32:44,187
I would suggest you have it in one bite.

678
00:32:47,324 --> 00:32:50,260
(One bite)

679
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:54,031
(Pupils in panic mode)

680
00:32:58,735 --> 00:33:00,437
It's a suffocating silence.

681
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,440
I guess it wasn't that good.

682
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:06,576
No, no.

683
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:08,111
That's not true.

684
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,746
I liked everything about it.

685
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:11,748
The texture
of the turnip green was nice,

686
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:14,952
and the rice was cooked perfectly.

687
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,120
(Tastes like having rice
and banchan (side dish) together)

688
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,122
You know banchan?

689
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,192
It's easy to find in New York.

690
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,494
(Even the chef says it's delicious.)

691
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:26,730
It's a bit spicy though.

692
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,899
I taste the heat too.

693
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:31,969
(But I didn't add anything spicy.)

694
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,003
Koreans don't think it's spicy.

695
00:33:33,003 --> 00:33:34,871
It's garlic.

696
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:38,075
The heat from the garlic.

697
00:33:38,408 --> 00:33:42,312
Koreans eat
this much garlic every day, so...

698
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:48,819
We use a lot of garlic
in Portuguese cuisine as well.

699
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:52,122
Could garlic be the link
between Portuguese and Korean cuisine?

700
00:33:52,122 --> 00:33:54,157
I think that's why
a lot of Portuguese dishes...

701
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,560
tasted familiar to us.
Maybe it was the garlic.

702
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,695
Don't worry.
The garlic doesn't make it taste bad.

703
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,397
(It's delicious.)

704
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:01,565
Thank you.

705
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:03,500
Shall we try this too?

706
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,601
(Next dish to try
is Kihyun's rose jeyuk bokkeum.)

707
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:07,237
Original, Korean jeyuk bokkeum
is much spicier,

708
00:34:07,237 --> 00:34:08,505
but we cooked this for you,

709
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,275
so I tried not to add too much heat.

710
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:14,611
I wanted to make something
like a bifana.

711
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:17,381
It's a dish you can have
together with bread.

712
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,551
Is this Korean bifana?

713
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:22,819
Yes.

714
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:32,596
(Even how you eat it
is familiar to the locals.)

715
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,301
(Will they also enjoy the taste?)

716
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:38,802
(Nodding)

717
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:42,873
(Speaking in Portuguese)

718
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:43,907
(Surprised)

719
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,676
He says you should
open a restaurant with this.

720
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:47,477
Exactly. It's that good.

721
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:50,414
I'd be very happy if I could eat this
at a bifana place in Portugal.

722
00:34:50,414 --> 00:34:54,084
I make pretty good jeyuk too,
but now I'm feeling nervous. You're good!

723
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:57,087
That's high praise coming from a chef.

724
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:59,489
- It's good.
- It's delicious.

725
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:00,657
It's really good.

726
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:03,961
(Keeps eating)

727
00:35:03,961 --> 00:35:05,395
She's eating it so well.

728
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,397
I'm so happy right now.

729
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,933
It's really good.

730
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,134
It's delicious.

731
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:12,970
I've felt this before too,

732
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,606
but the local meal master looks at you
like you're her grandson.

733
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:17,574
(A grandson who's a bit old)

734
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:21,078
No, but I feel it too.

735
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,713
It's too obvious. I'm jealous.

736
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:25,749
She always looks at Kihyun
with a warm gaze.

737
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,651
I feel it because I'm right next to him.

738
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:31,355
(Found my grandma on the other side
of the world, in Portugal.)

739
00:35:31,855 --> 00:35:34,257
(Lastly, it's Su Young's time.)

740
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:39,963
(Today's climax)

741
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,999
(All eyes on Su Young's dish)

742
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,767
(Mouth watering)

743
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:46,270
(The epitome of crispy skin
and juicy meat)

744
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,471
It's going to be so good.

745
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:52,175
(Grilled pork belly bursting with juices)

746
00:35:53,343 --> 00:35:56,546
This is a traditional Korean sauce
called ssamjang.

747
00:35:56,546 --> 00:35:58,315
You can have it with this...

748
00:35:58,315 --> 00:36:00,317
and some napa cabbage.

749
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:01,551
This is the Korean way of eating it.

750
00:36:02,686 --> 00:36:06,189
(Napa cabbage, pork belly, and ssamjang)

751
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,427
(Make it into a ssam
and straight into your mouth)

752
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:19,937
It's so good,

753
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:22,706
The meat is good,
and the sauce goes so well with it.

754
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:23,974
The skin came out great.

755
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,342
Try it with the skin.

756
00:36:25,342 --> 00:36:26,910
It's good,

757
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,279
but I'm wondering if the crispy skin
is okay for her to eat.

758
00:36:30,347 --> 00:36:32,115
(No problem)

759
00:36:32,115 --> 00:36:33,483
She's really healthy.

760
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:37,154
It's nice and crispy.

761
00:36:41,725 --> 00:36:44,094
(Satisfied)

762
00:36:44,594 --> 00:36:47,164
(This isn't the end.)

763
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:50,500
(The last dish of the course,
the port wine toast)

764
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:55,606
(Straight into the mouth)

765
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,877
(The sea urchin chef loves it.)

766
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:02,746
Do you like coffee?
Would you like some now?

767
00:37:02,746 --> 00:37:04,815
- Sounds good.
- I knew it.

768
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,683
This is Korean-style coffee.

769
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,996
We had something sweet,

770
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,887
so I thought it'd be
nice to finish off with this.

771
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:13,790
(Finishing off with a cup of coffee
after a sweet dessert)

772
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:17,294
It smells very nice, right?

773
00:37:17,294 --> 00:37:18,462
It smells nice.

774
00:37:18,462 --> 00:37:21,198
The aroma is very nice.

775
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,935
If I had this coffee at home,
I'd drink some every day.

776
00:37:24,935 --> 00:37:27,571
Really? We have lots.
We'll give you some.

777
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:32,676
I mean it.

778
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:36,346
It means a lot to see them
enjoying the food.

779
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:37,414
How nice.

780
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:46,757
Portuguese coffee tends to be bitter,

781
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:47,791
but this is nice and smooth.

782
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,860
- It makes me happy that she likes it.
- Me too.

783
00:37:50,193 --> 00:37:55,365
Thank you so much
for this incredible meal today.

784
00:37:56,066 --> 00:38:00,170
("We really enjoyed the mix of Korean
and Portuguese cuisine" Ryu-cipes guests)

785
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:03,774
Thank you.

786
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:07,844
(It was a successful
grand finale feast in Porto.)

787
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:11,048
This looks exactly like that from before.

788
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:12,916
My mouth is suddenly watering.

789
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,851
What should we try first?

790
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,088
(These are the Porto Ryu-cipe dishes
selected by the three members.)

791
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,623
I can't believe these came out like this.

792
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:21,692
(These are the Porto Ryu-cipe dishes
selected by the three members.)

793
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:24,695
Your dish looks really good, Su Young.

794
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:29,766
It's bringing back memories.

795
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:32,035
It's an upgraded version.

796
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:33,804
(Same memories, even better taste)

797
00:38:33,804 --> 00:38:35,706
Using pasta to cook something
totally different...

798
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:36,940
was the most fun for me.

799
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,275
And a touch of chili oil.

800
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,377
I chose this because I wanted
to introduce a new way to enjoy pasta...

801
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:42,646
and let them know that this is
what happens with a touch of Korea.

802
00:38:42,646 --> 00:38:45,616
The recipe has been perfected even more.

803
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:47,417
(Kyung Ho's Pick
Burden-Breaking Bread)

804
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:48,919
This already looks good.

805
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:52,623
Hey, this is tasty.

806
00:38:54,524 --> 00:38:56,326
No one would say this is bad.

807
00:38:56,326 --> 00:38:59,096
It definitely feels familiar,
but the taste is still new, right?

808
00:38:59,096 --> 00:39:01,732
Budae jjigae (army stew), budae bokkeum,

809
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:04,234
and this cream sauce,
this rose cream sauce.

810
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:07,871
I'm sorry to francesinha,
but this is way better.

811
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:10,974
This was a secret weapon.

812
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,542
I added lots of sweet red bean paste...

813
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:13,877
on Kihyun's recipe.

814
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:15,512
(Kihyun's Pick
Kihyun's Sweet Red Bean Pie)

815
00:39:15,512 --> 00:39:17,648
This was a pie.

816
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:18,882
I made it like a pie.

817
00:39:18,882 --> 00:39:20,083
That was good too,

818
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,653
but it's interesting
to see it shaped like a tart.

819
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,522
I think all four of them
have different flavors.

820
00:39:25,522 --> 00:39:27,391
(You can pick and choose
out of 4 pies.)

821
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:30,727
(Very satisfied)

822
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:32,629
Hey, this one is really good.

823
00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:36,934
- It's very luxurious.
- Right?

824
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:39,403
- You study to benefit others, you know?
- Of course.

825
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:41,638
We worked hard to learn all this.

826
00:39:41,638 --> 00:39:43,307
Let's do our best today...

827
00:39:43,307 --> 00:39:44,341
so that the customers can enjoy these.

828
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,809
It's for a good cause too.

829
00:39:47,911 --> 00:39:49,513
What?

830
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,014
There are 400 people lined up?

831
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,950
What? 500 people?

832
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,584
(The first unveiling of Ryu-cipe dishes)

833
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:56,086
We should hurry up and get cooking then.

834
00:39:56,086 --> 00:39:57,354
I'm a bit startled.

835
00:39:59,957 --> 00:40:03,026
This beach somehow feels very cozy.

836
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,395
You're right.
It's stretched out in a straight line.

837
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:07,631
The water feels warm.

838
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:08,799
Yeah, it's warm.

839
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:10,467
The water is warm here.

840
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:13,203
(The three members have arrived
at a beautiful beach.)

841
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:16,573
But the water is warm.

842
00:40:16,573 --> 00:40:17,975
It's not cold at all.

843
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:19,943
I think we could swim in it.

844
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:23,747
(All of a sudden, Su Young starts
writing something on the sand.)

845
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,516
(What is he doing?)

846
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:33,290
- This is right, yes?
- Yes.

847
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,825
How cool.

848
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:35,926
(What did Su Young write on the sand?)

849
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:37,728
Brunei.

850
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:40,197
We're in Brunei now.

851
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:41,751
(Their second study abroad location)

852
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,867
(The Golden Kingdom of Southeast Asia,
Brunei)

853
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:45,836
The scenery is very interesting.

854
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:46,970
This is incredible.

855
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,806
(Found on the island of Borneo,
it's a kingdom ruled by a sultan.)

856
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:58,181
(The three boys have landed in Brunei.)

857
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:04,054
(A resource-rich nation, with 95%
of its exports from oil and natural gas)

858
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:09,059
(Excellent welfare, no taxes,
and medical fees of only $1 a year)

859
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:12,229
(Where Islamic tradition
and modern civilization coexist)

860
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:14,598
(Hello.)

861
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:20,904
(Halal culture has led to
a variety of beef and chicken dishes.)

862
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:27,778
(A journey through the taste of Brunei
that feels close to home, like Korea)

863
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:33,617
(A new culinary force,
Brunei's full of intriguing dishes.)

864
00:41:35,185 --> 00:41:38,188
Is Brunei calling for us in Brunei?

865
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,541
(For their second location
for studying abroad...)

866
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:44,695
(The three boys have come to Brunei.)

867
00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:46,830
(Incheon International Airport)

868
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:49,166
Our seat is C.

869
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,901
C is here.

870
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,570
This is nice and spacious.

871
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:55,339
I'm getting curious.

872
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:58,275
I'm curious about the food too,
but I'm just curious about the country.

873
00:41:58,275 --> 00:42:00,310
So, they don't eat pork there, right?

874
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,579
Right. They only serve Halal food.

875
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:03,981
- Even in-flight meals?
- Yeah.

876
00:42:04,348 --> 00:42:06,316
The capital of Brunei is...

877
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:09,152
(A quick Brunei crash course)

878
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:13,690
I memorized Brunei's capital back
in high school because it was so unique.

879
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,026
It was something like Peri Begawan.

880
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:17,294
Yeah, it was something like that.

881
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:19,529
Was it Samdar Pari Begawan?

882
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:20,964
I can't think of it all of a sudden.

883
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:22,599
It's Bandar Seri Begawan.

884
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,167
Bandar Seri Begawan.

885
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,503
But the population is only around 450,000.

886
00:42:27,137 --> 00:42:28,171
(The population is smaller than Jeju-do.)

887
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,741
I heard their happiness index
was really high, though.

888
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:34,611
Please choose your in-flight meal.

889
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:38,882
There's a gochujang chicken.

890
00:42:39,816 --> 00:42:41,451
That looks good.

891
00:42:42,085 --> 00:42:44,721
(Smell approved)

892
00:42:44,755 --> 00:42:46,323
It's gochujang sauce.

893
00:42:46,323 --> 00:42:48,292
It smells like
dakdoritang (braised chicken).

894
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:49,793
Or like tteokbokki (spicy rice cake).

895
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:51,728
(A chicken dish with familiar flavors)

896
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:54,765
Yum.

897
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:57,334
It tastes very familiar.

898
00:42:57,935 --> 00:43:00,237
It makes me look forward to their food.

899
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:01,705
It tastes similar to our cuisine.

900
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,907
We know how to do this.
We're familiar with it.

901
00:43:04,508 --> 00:43:07,411
I don't think
I'll miss Korean food in Brunei.

902
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:10,113
(They both take a bite.)

903
00:43:10,113 --> 00:43:12,249
I have a good feeling about Brunei.

904
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:14,952
The only direct flight from Korea.

905
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:16,887
I was surprised to learn that
there was a direct flight.

906
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,789
(They've arrived in Brunei!
This is their second study destination.)

907
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:20,023
It's very clean and spacious.

908
00:43:20,023 --> 00:43:21,458
It's surprisingly clean and spacious.

909
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:24,127
The neighborhood feels very unfamiliar.

910
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:25,495
This village is huge.

911
00:43:25,495 --> 00:43:26,763
It is very big.

912
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:30,133
It definitely feels different from Porto.

913
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:31,868
It's a very big village.

914
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:33,670
The scenery is very interesting.

915
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,686
I assumed there to be
just makeshift wooden structures...

916
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,742
because they live on the water,
but I was wrong.

917
00:43:39,142 --> 00:43:41,612
These are actual floating houses.

918
00:43:41,612 --> 00:43:43,280
It's pretty much a barge.

919
00:43:44,548 --> 00:43:46,283
It's really big.

920
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:49,086
How pretty.

921
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:56,927
(Fully equipped with essential facilities
like schools, shops, and hospitals.)

922
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:02,132
(A historic lifestyle preserved
for more than 1,300 years.)

923
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:04,067
I've only seen this in textbooks.

924
00:44:04,468 --> 00:44:05,869
Is it here?

925
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,138
It's that house over there.

926
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:13,610
(The floating house for the boys
at the end of the floating road)

927
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,811
Hello.

928
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:19,983
This is nice.

929
00:44:19,983 --> 00:44:21,118
This is too nice.

930
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:24,154
It's spacious.

931
00:44:24,154 --> 00:44:25,956
The house is really big.

932
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:27,124
Why is it so big?

933
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:30,227
Now that we're inside,
it doesn't seem like a floating house.

934
00:44:30,894 --> 00:44:33,096
I think it's bigger than my house.

935
00:44:33,096 --> 00:44:35,866
It's nice and big.
There's even an air conditioner.

936
00:44:35,866 --> 00:44:37,601
A big table too.

937
00:44:38,568 --> 00:44:40,637
Gosh, what a nice kitchen.

938
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:45,108
(A large kitchen at the end of the hall)

939
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:46,443
There's even a fridge.

940
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:48,745
I guess we'll be
cooking up a storm here, huh?

941
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:50,847
(And a unique space
you'll only find in a floating house.)

942
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:51,915
Does this lead outside?

943
00:44:51,915 --> 00:44:53,317
You can just go out from here?

944
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:56,253
The concept of living on the water
is very fascinating.

945
00:44:56,253 --> 00:44:58,055
It doesn't feel like a floating house.

946
00:44:58,555 --> 00:44:59,990
There's a washer too.

947
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:02,225
- I found it.
- What did you find?

948
00:45:02,225 --> 00:45:03,660
A fish trap.

949
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,695
I guess we can just throw it in from here.

950
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:06,363
Do we throw this from here?

951
00:45:06,763 --> 00:45:08,098
Have you used this?

952
00:45:08,098 --> 00:45:09,900
I have, in the countryside.

953
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,201
But don't we need to put bait inside?

954
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:13,537
Right, we need to put some bait inside.

955
00:45:13,537 --> 00:45:15,038
Let's think about what we can use.

956
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:19,176
Deonjang (soy bean paste)? Perilla leaf?
Should we make rice?

957
00:45:19,443 --> 00:45:21,345
I brought some deonjang.

958
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:22,879
- You brought some?
- Only a little.

959
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:23,981
Can we use some as bait?

960
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:25,315
No, I need to use it for cooking.

961
00:45:25,315 --> 00:45:26,883
Right, you need to use it to cook.

962
00:45:26,883 --> 00:45:29,720
(The only thing
on the cooking fairy's mind is cooking.)

963
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,421
- Let's work hard again.
- Starting from tomorrow...

964
00:45:31,421 --> 00:45:32,956
Eat, learn,

965
00:45:32,956 --> 00:45:34,625
then hospital?

966
00:45:36,627 --> 00:45:40,097
(The first morning
of studying abroad in Brunei)

967
00:45:40,931 --> 00:45:44,434
(How will the three boys
spend their morning?)

968
00:45:44,434 --> 00:45:46,236
I'm hungry.

969
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:47,671
(Early-riser Su Young is already up.)

970
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:49,673
I'm hungry.

971
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,076
What do we have that I can eat?

972
00:45:54,911 --> 00:45:57,047
(Su Young is hungry from waking up early.)

973
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,548
We only have rice.

974
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:04,721
(There's nothing to eat,
so he just fills up on water.)

975
00:46:15,098 --> 00:46:17,935
(Door opens)

976
00:46:18,502 --> 00:46:23,874
(It's early in the morning,
and two strangers enter the house.)

977
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,580
(They come in without any hesitation.)

978
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:37,587
(Confused)

979
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:42,025
(What is happening?)

980
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:45,195
(Who are you?)

981
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:47,864
I'm here to make you breakfast.

982
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:50,968
(Breakfast?)

983
00:46:50,968 --> 00:46:53,136
Then, is this your house?

984
00:46:53,136 --> 00:46:54,671
Yes.

985
00:46:54,671 --> 00:46:57,140
(Okay, got it.)

986
00:46:57,341 --> 00:47:01,478
(The three boys are staying
in a Brunei home stay.)

987
00:47:01,845 --> 00:47:04,848
(Kyung Ho comes out of his room
when he hears the commotion.)

988
00:47:04,848 --> 00:47:07,117
(Is someone here?)

989
00:47:09,886 --> 00:47:13,256
They're the owners.

990
00:47:13,256 --> 00:47:16,693
Welcome to our home stay.

991
00:47:17,694 --> 00:47:20,297
(Flustered rambling)

992
00:47:21,665 --> 00:47:23,166
We're here to make you breakfast.

993
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:29,072
(Something going on
this early in the morning?)

994
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:31,742
(Bustling)

995
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:35,012
Are we staring right away like this?

996
00:47:35,612 --> 00:47:38,415
(I'll quickly get ready.)

997
00:47:38,415 --> 00:47:41,551
I didn't think
the owners would actually come.

998
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:44,721
I think it's like bed and breakfast,

999
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:46,290
like Airbnb.

1000
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:48,325
(Looking forward to breakfast)

1001
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:50,627
They brought oil and snacks too.

1002
00:47:50,627 --> 00:47:54,298
He said he was going to make
pandan nasi lemak.

1003
00:47:54,564 --> 00:47:57,768
(What's on the breakfast menu
for the three boys?)

1004
00:47:58,802 --> 00:48:02,272
(Fatima, Brunei local meal master)

1005
00:48:02,472 --> 00:48:05,876
(Bruneian local meal)

1006
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:10,514
(Nasi lemak is a rich rice dish
cooked in coconut milk.)

1007
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:13,717
(Nasi means rice,
and lemak means creamy or fatty.)

1008
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:18,221
(With creamy and fatty rice)

1009
00:48:18,388 --> 00:48:22,125
(A meal you have with some creamy rice
and fried chicken or fish.)

1010
00:48:24,795 --> 00:48:26,930
(Nasi Lemak / A traditional dish
commonly eaten in Southeast Asia)

1011
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:29,266
(The rice is creamy and fatty
because coconut milk is used.)

1012
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,369
Do you use this in Korea?

1013
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:33,570
Yes, we do.

1014
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,607
(The master has whipped out
a Bruneian-style mortar and pestle.)

1015
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,175
It looks the same as the Korean one.

1016
00:48:38,742 --> 00:48:42,746
It's much better than using a mixer.

1017
00:48:42,746 --> 00:48:45,582
She's grinding onion, garlic, and ginger.

1018
00:48:45,582 --> 00:48:48,986
(Grind garlic, ginger,
and shallots in the motor.)

1019
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,088
Could I help?

1020
00:48:51,088 --> 00:48:52,756
I can do this much.

1021
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,157
Okay.

1022
00:48:54,591 --> 00:48:59,162
(Thank you, Kyung Ho.)

1023
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:02,432
(He's an assistant fairy today.)

1024
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,534
Very nice.

1025
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:07,237
It feels like I'm working with them.
This is nice.

1026
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:14,678
I'm going to grind the pandan leaves
to add color to the rice.

1027
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:17,180
The rice will be green.

1028
00:49:17,447 --> 00:49:18,882
I'm curious.

1029
00:49:19,783 --> 00:49:23,420
(Green rice for nasi lemak)

1030
00:49:23,787 --> 00:49:26,156
(Pandan leaves /
A common ingredient in Southeast Asia.)

1031
00:49:26,156 --> 00:49:29,293
(Helps calm the skin and fights oxidation)

1032
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:33,397
(Add pandan leaves and water
in the mixer.)

1033
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:40,137
(The blended pandan leaves are strained
to use only the juice.)

1034
00:49:40,837 --> 00:49:45,042
(2. Use the pandan juice
to add sweetness to the rice.)

1035
00:49:45,475 --> 00:49:49,813
(In Korea,
green tea powder can be used instead.)

1036
00:49:52,015 --> 00:49:54,318
(Add the grinded ingredients.)

1037
00:49:57,321 --> 00:49:59,389
(The key to nasi lemak, a Bruneian meal,
is the coconut milk.)

1038
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:06,096
(Fresh coconut is ideal,
but coconut milk works for convenience.)

1039
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:12,869
(Mix well so that everything combines.)

1040
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:21,378
(Cook on medium-low heat
until the rice cooks.)

1041
00:50:23,113 --> 00:50:26,083
(Sudden filming)

1042
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:28,552
(Puts up a V-sign
without knowing what's going on)

1043
00:50:28,986 --> 00:50:31,188
What's your name?

1044
00:50:31,188 --> 00:50:33,457
My name is Yoon Kyung Ho.

1045
00:50:33,457 --> 00:50:35,058
I'm Ryu Su Young.

1046
00:50:35,058 --> 00:50:36,960
Welcome to our home stay.

1047
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:40,964
I'm very happy to see you all.

1048
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:46,136
(Is it a sudden meet and greet?)

1049
00:50:47,437 --> 00:50:48,538
(Heart fairy)

1050
00:50:48,939 --> 00:50:50,974
I'm going to show my friend.

1051
00:50:50,974 --> 00:50:52,743
Mothers are similar wherever you are.

1052
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:59,383
(She makes a sauce for the chicken
while the rice cooks.)

1053
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,953
This is turmeric.

1054
00:51:02,953 --> 00:51:05,222
What do you call this in Korea?

1055
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:06,990
We call it ulgeum.

1056
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:10,927
(Master's tip for chicken sauce /
Use fresh turmeric for a deeper aroma.)

1057
00:51:10,927 --> 00:51:14,998
I'll grind it.

1058
00:51:15,565 --> 00:51:21,004
(Making spicy chicken /
1. Grind turmeric, garlic, ginger.)

1059
00:51:21,305 --> 00:51:23,840
(1T of ulgeum, garlic, ginger,
and 1T of chili sauce)

1060
00:51:24,308 --> 00:51:28,745
(A thick homemade chili sauce
made by grinding some chilies with it)

1061
00:51:28,745 --> 00:51:31,782
Do you also cook the chicken
like this in Korea?

1062
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:34,344
(Mr. Eo's brining method)

1063
00:51:34,368 --> 00:51:39,156
(Brine the chicken
with milk, ginger, curry powder.)

1064
00:51:39,323 --> 00:51:41,925
(Once the chicken is well coated
in the chili sauce...)

1065
00:51:42,459 --> 00:51:45,629
(Now, it's time to fry them.)

1066
00:51:46,129 --> 00:51:48,565
(But she's frying something else first?)

1067
00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:52,002
(Fry the garlic first
to infuse the oil with flavor and aroma.)

1068
00:51:55,372 --> 00:51:59,543
(Once the garlic turns dark brown,
add the chicken.)

1069
00:52:05,215 --> 00:52:10,087
(Flip the chicken only once.)

1070
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,957
(When you just flip it once,
it prevents the coat from going soggy.)

1071
00:52:13,957 --> 00:52:17,761
(And the chicken is
with crispy skin and juicy meat.)

1072
00:52:24,234 --> 00:52:27,604
(Crispy skin and bursting with
spicy chicken is born.)

1073
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:30,607
Thank you for this precious breakfast.

1074
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:34,645
(Here's green rice)

1075
00:52:34,645 --> 00:52:36,580
Let me try smelling it.

1076
00:52:41,051 --> 00:52:42,419
I'm so curious about the taste.

1077
00:52:42,419 --> 00:52:45,322
(Done! Brunei's fatty,
green-hued rice is ready.)

1078
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:46,390
Even the smell...

1079
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:49,159
That nutty smell is very familiar.

1080
00:52:50,093 --> 00:52:52,929
It smells so good.

1081
00:52:53,397 --> 00:52:54,631
I love it.

1082
00:52:56,433 --> 00:52:59,102
(I think Su Young will have two bowls.)

1083
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:01,405
(For the boys,
two bowls of breakfast is the norm.)

1084
00:53:01,972 --> 00:53:04,808
(He suddenly brings out a big leaf.)

1085
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:07,044
Do we wrap the rice in this?

1086
00:53:07,044 --> 00:53:08,512
I think it's the plate.

1087
00:53:08,512 --> 00:53:10,047
The plate?

1088
00:53:10,314 --> 00:53:14,818
(Dauan nirik / Used in Southeast Asia
to wrap the food like banana leaf)

1089
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:17,854
Kind of like how we use lotus leaves.

1090
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,759
(Place the pandan rice
on top of the leaf.)

1091
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,665
(Add the chicken and toppings
over the rice.)

1092
00:53:28,665 --> 00:53:29,833
Thank you.

1093
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,034
It's so pretty.

1094
00:53:31,301 --> 00:53:32,469
(Nasi lemak all wrapped up!)

1095
00:53:32,469 --> 00:53:33,937
I should take a photo of that.

1096
00:53:34,571 --> 00:53:36,139
It's like wrapping a hamburger.

1097
00:53:37,274 --> 00:53:38,875
Do I need to pack this in?

1098
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:40,944
Yes.

1099
00:53:40,944 --> 00:53:42,879
The smell is amazing right now.

1100
00:53:42,879 --> 00:53:44,581
It smells so nice.

1101
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:46,483
She cooked the rice perfectly.

1102
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:48,852
Goodness, the rice is perfect.

1103
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,922
(Now stop)

1104
00:53:51,922 --> 00:53:53,590
He said to pack it in, so...

1105
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:56,093
(Chicken, cucumber, and boiled egg,
plus the rest, added like a pro.)

1106
00:53:56,093 --> 00:53:57,894
Good job, Kyung Ho.

1107
00:53:58,128 --> 00:54:01,031
He's doing it like he's done this before.

1108
00:54:01,932 --> 00:54:04,501
He's going to sell this back in Korea.

1109
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:08,505
(Proud)

1110
00:54:08,972 --> 00:54:11,875
(Kihyun is all ready.)

1111
00:54:13,176 --> 00:54:17,714
(You've finished already?)

1112
00:54:18,081 --> 00:54:20,450
What's happening so early in the morning?

1113
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,386
They make you breakfast like this.

1114
00:54:22,386 --> 00:54:23,987
They cook for you like this
when you stay here.

1115
00:54:23,987 --> 00:54:25,289
He's the chef?

1116
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:26,923
She's the mother,

1117
00:54:26,923 --> 00:54:28,058
and he's her son.

1118
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:29,092
Hello.

1119
00:54:29,092 --> 00:54:30,494
This is Kihyun.

1120
00:54:31,762 --> 00:54:33,230
Did you make this?

1121
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,165
No, I'm just wrapping it.

1122
00:54:37,668 --> 00:54:38,635
(Kyung Ho's giant nasi lemak)

1123
00:54:38,635 --> 00:54:41,338
Of course, it's huge. I made it myself.

1124
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:45,142
Try selling nasi lemak back in Korea.

1125
00:54:45,142 --> 00:54:49,079
Lots of Southeast Asians
will go to your restaurant.

1126
00:54:49,947 --> 00:54:51,782
(Highly recommended to start
a nasi lemak business)

1127
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:53,450
Shall we work together?

1128
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,752
Of course.

1129
00:54:56,787 --> 00:54:59,589
(Should we do 50:50?)

1130
00:54:59,923 --> 00:55:01,325
No way.

1131
00:55:01,325 --> 00:55:04,227
How about 60:40?

1132
00:55:04,227 --> 00:55:08,298
Why am I 40 when this is my recipe?

1133
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:14,171
(Deal! 50:50, fair and square)

1134
00:55:14,404 --> 00:55:16,373
(Pandan rice)

1135
00:55:16,373 --> 00:55:18,642
(Meets chicken)

1136
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:22,879
(It's Bruneian chicken and rice.)

1137
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,948
(Nasi Lemak / A local Bruneian dish)

1138
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:26,783
How should we eat this?

1139
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:29,920
Let's just try the rice first.

1140
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,054
I wanted to just try the rice too.

1141
00:55:31,054 --> 00:55:32,289
Yeah, I was super curious too.

1142
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,324
I mean, the rice is green,

1143
00:55:34,324 --> 00:55:36,526
so it's visually so interesting.

1144
00:55:36,526 --> 00:55:37,794
You're right. It is.

1145
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,264
Let's try the rice first.

1146
00:55:42,432 --> 00:55:45,102
You know that soup
that comes in a small square box?

1147
00:55:45,102 --> 00:55:47,004
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1148
00:55:47,738 --> 00:55:49,439
- It smells like that.
- Really?

1149
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:50,641
(Smells just like that familiar,
toasty aroma from a big-name brand.)

1150
00:55:51,308 --> 00:55:55,112
(A careful bite)

1151
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,852
The coconut flavor isn't overpowering.

1152
00:56:02,486 --> 00:56:05,022
It tastes familiar
because it has garlic and ginger in it,

1153
00:56:05,022 --> 00:56:06,490
but it's covered
by a light scent of coconut.

1154
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:08,558
The ginger flavor is very nice.

1155
00:56:08,558 --> 00:56:10,661
At first, I thought the ginger...

1156
00:56:10,661 --> 00:56:12,796
was too spicy and not so nice,

1157
00:56:12,796 --> 00:56:15,899
but as I continue to eat this,
I can tell that it deepens the flavor.

1158
00:56:15,899 --> 00:56:17,935
It's like when you stir-fry some rice...

1159
00:56:17,935 --> 00:56:19,569
with margarine like this.

1160
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:22,272
- That's it.
- Before you make fried rice.

1161
00:56:22,272 --> 00:56:24,174
It's that rice before you add
your ingredients for the fried rice.

1162
00:56:24,174 --> 00:56:26,143
The aroma is much better.

1163
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:29,346
If you make kimchi fried rice with this,
it'd be so tasty.

1164
00:56:29,346 --> 00:56:30,380
I want to learn how to make this.

1165
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,616
If you top it with some curry,
you can't beat it.

1166
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,952
- The chicken is good.
- Is it good?

1167
00:56:37,321 --> 00:56:38,755
(Tasty food makes you smile.)

1168
00:56:38,755 --> 00:56:40,824
The chicken is so delicious.

1169
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:47,698
(The chicken is insane.)

1170
00:56:47,698 --> 00:56:50,834
It tastes like those familiar
brand-name chickens.

1171
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:52,936
Did they get the recipe from here?

1172
00:56:52,936 --> 00:56:54,338
It smells like that.

1173
00:56:54,805 --> 00:56:56,506
At home... They made this at home.

1174
00:56:56,506 --> 00:56:58,775
They just fried this right here.

1175
00:56:58,775 --> 00:57:00,043
How is this so good?

1176
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:02,012
They didn't even use that much oil.

1177
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,683
My fans know this about me,

1178
00:57:06,683 --> 00:57:08,552
but I'm basically a chicken expert.

1179
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:09,586
A chicken expert?

1180
00:57:09,586 --> 00:57:10,988
Even by the ocean,
I still choose chicken over seafood.

1181
00:57:10,988 --> 00:57:14,157
This is some high-level fried chicken.

1182
00:57:14,157 --> 00:57:15,626
The chicken I just had...

1183
00:57:15,626 --> 00:57:18,729
This chicken is the kick.

1184
00:57:19,363 --> 00:57:20,731
The seasoning is strong,

1185
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:22,165
but it's perfect with this rice.

1186
00:57:22,165 --> 00:57:23,900
It's so good.

1187
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,836
It's perfect with chicken.

1188
00:57:25,836 --> 00:57:27,804
It's a protein-filled meal. It's perfect.

1189
00:57:28,105 --> 00:57:30,007
This is so good. It's insane.

1190
00:57:30,007 --> 00:57:32,342
(Getting lost
in that familiar chicken flavor)

1191
00:57:32,342 --> 00:57:33,744
It totally smells like Korea.

1192
00:57:35,145 --> 00:57:37,414
I really want to try these sauces.

1193
00:57:37,814 --> 00:57:39,383
Su Young, you mentioned earlier...

1194
00:57:39,383 --> 00:57:41,652
that fermented sauce started from here.

1195
00:57:41,652 --> 00:57:43,186
Yes, that's right.

1196
00:57:43,186 --> 00:57:44,955
(Bruneian fermented sauce?)

1197
00:57:45,088 --> 00:57:46,890
I think you eat it with rice like this.

1198
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,325
I'll put this sauce...

1199
00:57:48,325 --> 00:57:51,194
(With some pandan rice)

1200
00:57:51,194 --> 00:57:52,429
This one's spicy.

1201
00:57:52,429 --> 00:57:53,730
It's spicy?

1202
00:57:53,897 --> 00:57:54,898
(Excited)

1203
00:57:54,898 --> 00:57:56,233
This sambal sauce?

1204
00:57:56,233 --> 00:57:57,401
How is it? Is it good?

1205
00:57:57,868 --> 00:58:01,605
- This is like jang (fermented sauce).
- It is?

1206
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:06,376
(Cannot have nasi lemak
without the sambal sauce)

1207
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:11,715
(Sambal is made
with chilies, garlic, and ginger.)

1208
00:58:12,349 --> 00:58:17,354
(Recipes vary widely by region,
ingredients, and the person making it.)

1209
00:58:18,355 --> 00:58:21,625
(There are
over 300 different kinds of sambal.)

1210
00:58:22,092 --> 00:58:26,430
(Learning to make sambal
from the local meal master)

1211
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:30,000
My big eater mode is officially turned on.

1212
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,568
This is the real all-purpose sauce.

1213
00:58:31,568 --> 00:58:32,803
It's really all-purpose.

1214
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:36,773
(The local meal master's
4 different sambal sauces)

1215
00:58:37,107 --> 00:58:38,699
(Sambal Hijau / Made with green chilies)

1216
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,178
(It has that sharp,
tingling heat unique to green chilies.)

1217
00:58:41,178 --> 00:58:42,879
This spicy kick is so nice.

1218
00:58:42,879 --> 00:58:45,148
You know what this reminds me of?

1219
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:46,850
Do you know gochujang mul
from Gyeongsang-do?

1220
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,219
You dice some Cheongyang peppers,

1221
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:52,289
mix it with some anchovies and soy sauce,
and have it with rice.

1222
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:53,390
It tastes like that.

1223
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,225
I think you're exactly right.

1224
00:58:55,225 --> 00:58:56,827
It is like that,

1225
00:58:56,827 --> 00:58:58,729
but the Korean one is raw.

1226
00:58:58,729 --> 00:59:00,697
They fried it in oil here.

1227
00:59:00,697 --> 00:59:02,199
How did they make this?

1228
00:59:02,199 --> 00:59:03,734
They're both have their own charms.

1229
00:59:03,734 --> 00:59:05,035
I haven't tried this one.

1230
00:59:05,035 --> 00:59:06,236
I just tried it.

1231
00:59:06,236 --> 00:59:11,074
It sort of tastes like tteokbokki sauce.

1232
00:59:11,074 --> 00:59:13,810
- This one?
- Don't you think?

1233
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,479
Yeah, this one's good.

1234
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:21,518
(Mix some spicy sauce with rice.)

1235
00:59:23,353 --> 00:59:24,655
This is good.

1236
00:59:25,355 --> 00:59:27,457
I have nothing else to say
other than it's delicious.

1237
00:59:28,692 --> 00:59:31,795
It tastes so familiar,
so why don't we have this in Korea?

1238
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,431
These are rice partners.

1239
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:36,400
(So delicious, doesn't know what to say)

1240
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,935
Insane, right? This one's insane.

1241
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:45,175
When I was a student
and had to eat something while in a rush,

1242
00:59:45,175 --> 00:59:48,545
I used to just mix some sesame oil
and gochujang with rice.

1243
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:49,980
(A simple meal of rice
with gochujang and sesame oil)

1244
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,982
Sesame oil doesn't have
an overpowering flavor,

1245
00:59:51,982 --> 00:59:53,417
but it tastes exactly like that.

1246
00:59:53,984 --> 00:59:57,487
It does have that taste
of gochujang and sesame oil,

1247
00:59:57,487 --> 00:59:59,222
but it's not as salty as you'd think.

1248
00:59:59,222 --> 01:00:01,658
I know we're closer to Korea
compared to when we were in Portugal,

1249
01:00:01,658 --> 01:00:05,362
- but the flavor is sticking to me.
- Totally stuck.

1250
01:00:05,362 --> 01:00:06,630
It's good.

1251
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:09,232
This would be perfect for dads...

1252
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:12,336
to take home and have with rice.

1253
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:16,707
- It's the gochujang you get in the army.
- You're right. It's stir-fried gochujang.

1254
01:00:16,707 --> 01:00:18,141
This heat...

1255
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:20,077
The most recent person to have eaten it.

1256
01:00:20,077 --> 01:00:21,178
You've had it until last month.

1257
01:00:21,178 --> 01:00:22,713
They sell that too.

1258
01:00:22,713 --> 01:00:26,049
Doesn't this seem like a Korean side dish?

1259
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:27,985
This has anchovies in it, right?

1260
01:00:28,919 --> 01:00:30,487
It smells like Korea.

1261
01:00:30,487 --> 01:00:32,756
(Sambal fucuk / Made with fried anchovies,
nuttier and saltier than regular sambal)

1262
01:00:33,023 --> 01:00:36,026
We really won't need to worry
about food here.

1263
01:00:36,493 --> 01:00:41,598
(Let me try as well.)

1264
01:00:43,233 --> 01:00:44,468
Tell me.

1265
01:00:45,168 --> 01:00:46,803
- It's this one.
- What do you mean?

1266
01:00:46,803 --> 01:00:48,071
This one is my top pick right now.

1267
01:00:48,071 --> 01:00:49,172
Yeah? Why?

1268
01:00:49,172 --> 01:00:53,010
This is a Korean side dish.

1269
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:54,678
These are anchovies.

1270
01:00:54,678 --> 01:00:56,980
The crispy texture of the anchovies are...

1271
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,682
We need to learn
how to make this sauce.

1272
01:00:58,682 --> 01:01:00,417
It's a little bit better than
the Korean anchovy side dish.

1273
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:02,619
This doesn't use gochujang?

1274
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:03,887
This is gochujang, though.

1275
01:01:03,887 --> 01:01:04,888
This is totally stir-fried gochujang.

1276
01:01:04,888 --> 01:01:06,323
It's sambal.

1277
01:01:06,523 --> 01:01:09,293
It's stir-fried gochujang with anchovies.

1278
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,528
This is seriously...

1279
01:01:12,262 --> 01:01:14,698
Now I get why she wanted 50:50.

1280
01:01:14,698 --> 01:01:15,999
She made all this.

1281
01:01:15,999 --> 01:01:18,235
Su Young, I think settling on 50:50
was a rushed move.

1282
01:01:18,235 --> 01:01:19,836
I think it should be 70:30...

1283
01:01:19,836 --> 01:01:21,538
because these will sell well.

1284
01:01:21,538 --> 01:01:23,640
But that's a bit cheap.
We settled on 50:50 earlier.

1285
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,709
I'll make a contract with her again.

1286
01:01:25,709 --> 01:01:27,377
I seriously want to learn that though.

1287
01:01:27,377 --> 01:01:29,813
How to make this rice,

1288
01:01:29,813 --> 01:01:31,949
and the sambal sauce too.

1289
01:01:31,949 --> 01:01:34,318
Should we her for some
to take back to Korea?

1290
01:01:34,785 --> 01:01:36,386
I really want to take some back.

1291
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:37,854
Could we learn the recipe
before we go back?

1292
01:01:37,854 --> 01:01:39,289
I want to learn how to make sambal.

1293
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:41,224
This is a real chili oil.

1294
01:01:41,224 --> 01:01:42,926
Super delicious chili oil.

1295
01:01:42,926 --> 01:01:46,630
So every single ingredient
needs to be prepared with care like this.

1296
01:01:47,397 --> 01:01:48,932
This isn't a recipe
you just share with everyone.

1297
01:01:48,932 --> 01:01:50,367
You wouldn't even share this
with your family.

1298
01:01:50,367 --> 01:01:53,704
- But this'll be shared with all of Korea.
- You're right.

1299
01:01:53,704 --> 01:01:56,640
(A real secret recipe)

1300
01:01:57,441 --> 01:01:58,709
(It's your loss if you miss out
since you can't get this anywhere else.)

1301
01:01:58,709 --> 01:02:01,178
Her natural instincts
when it comes to cooking are amazing.

1302
01:02:01,178 --> 01:02:02,779
I don't think
anyone can resist copying this.

1303
01:02:03,614 --> 01:02:07,618
(Everything about the traditional
sambal sauce recipe will be revealed.)

1304
01:02:07,618 --> 01:02:10,854
This is an all-purpose sauce. Seriously.

1305
01:02:11,388 --> 01:02:12,956
(The three boys have come to the pop-up.)

1306
01:02:12,956 --> 01:02:13,991
It's big.

1307
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:15,092
It's really big.

1308
01:02:15,092 --> 01:02:17,594
- That blue really stands out.
- You're right.

1309
01:02:18,428 --> 01:02:19,184
I did try my best,

1310
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:21,031
but I didn't think
it would look this good.

1311
01:02:22,099 --> 01:02:24,668
Your dish looks really good, Su Young.

1312
01:02:24,668 --> 01:02:27,170
I wonder how people will react
to these dishes.

1313
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:29,172
I've had a lot of part-time jobs,
so trust me.

1314
01:02:29,973 --> 01:02:31,475
I've done a lot of part-time work
in the past.

1315
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:32,676
I'm nervous.

1316
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:35,045
Ten minutes until open.

1317
01:02:35,045 --> 01:02:36,380
Ten minutes?

1318
01:02:38,448 --> 01:02:41,318
I feel rushed now after hearing that.

1319
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:42,686
Who's nervous?

1320
01:02:42,686 --> 01:02:43,954
What's there to be nervous about?

1321
01:02:44,154 --> 01:02:45,989
(Shaking)

1322
01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:48,125
We need to hurry.
There's no time for this.

1323
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,260
Hello, welcome.

1324
01:02:50,694 --> 01:02:52,029
Welcome.

1325
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:53,964
Thank you for coming
so early in the morning.

1326
01:02:53,964 --> 01:02:55,866
(People have started to gather
even before it opens.)

1327
01:02:57,134 --> 01:03:02,506
(A crowd rushes in all at once.)

1328
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:04,708
Goodness.

1329
01:03:05,542 --> 01:03:06,610
(Nervous to the max
with the people rushing in)

1330
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,412
I can't think all of a sudden.

1331
01:03:08,979 --> 01:03:11,181
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

1332
01:03:11,748 --> 01:03:13,250
Hello, welcome.

1333
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,351
You must be our first customer.

1334
01:03:14,351 --> 01:03:15,585
Yes.

1335
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:16,620
Thank you.

1336
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,655
- You're handsome.
- Thank you.

1337
01:03:18,655 --> 01:03:19,790
Should we take a photo?

1338
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:20,891
Yes, please.

1339
01:03:20,891 --> 01:03:22,025
(Responding to praise with a photo)

1340
01:03:22,025 --> 01:03:23,293
My hands are shaking.

1341
01:03:24,194 --> 01:03:25,762
Hello.

1342
01:03:25,762 --> 01:03:26,997
So nice to see you.

1343
01:03:27,264 --> 01:03:28,665
I really loved you in the show.

1344
01:03:28,665 --> 01:03:30,534
Thank you so much.

1345
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:32,703
("Yu-rim" is excited
to be receiving all the support.)

1346
01:03:32,703 --> 01:03:34,071
This is really good.

1347
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:36,139
You'll want to come back for more.

1348
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:38,075
When you come back,
you'll want the bread too.

1349
01:03:39,843 --> 01:03:41,144
Thank you.

1350
01:03:41,144 --> 01:03:43,013
I'm not good at socializing.

1351
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:45,716
I'll do this instead.

1352
01:03:45,716 --> 01:03:46,883
(But Ryu-GPT is good at cooking.)

1353
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,553
(The creamy cod rolled pasta cleared.)

1354
01:03:51,355 --> 01:03:52,823
- I'll do it.
- Sure.

1355
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:57,394
(The Burden-Breaking Bread cleared.)

1356
01:03:58,562 --> 01:04:03,100
(Ryu-GPT shows up in places he's needed.)

1357
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:05,602
Kihyun's stuck all the way inside.

1358
01:04:05,602 --> 01:04:07,304
No, I'm fine.

1359
01:04:08,705 --> 01:04:09,973
Kihyun! I'm cheering for you!

1360
01:04:09,973 --> 01:04:13,510
(He greets his fans
even while making his dessert.)

1361
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:15,612
You need to eat mine the very last.

1362
01:04:15,612 --> 01:04:17,147
It's a dessert,

1363
01:04:17,147 --> 01:04:19,483
so if you eat it first,
it'll be too sweet.

1364
01:04:19,483 --> 01:04:22,085
The one with the jam
and the sweet red bean paste,

1365
01:04:22,085 --> 01:04:24,521
and the one with chestnut
and pistachio are the best.

1366
01:04:24,521 --> 01:04:25,956
Those two are the best.

1367
01:04:25,956 --> 01:04:29,159
Which one did you order? The pie?
The sweet red bean paste pie?

1368
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:30,294
- One pie?
- One pie, please.

1369
01:04:30,294 --> 01:04:31,395
Sure.

1370
01:04:31,395 --> 01:04:32,729
How many pies? Five?

1371
01:04:32,729 --> 01:04:34,631
The pie's really on fire today.

1372
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:36,600
- What did you order?
- The Burden-Breaking Bread.

1373
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,168
- Really?
- Yes.

1374
01:04:38,835 --> 01:04:40,470
Thank you.

1375
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,105
The creamy cod rolled pasta was good.

1376
01:04:42,105 --> 01:04:44,041
Yeah? It was good?

1377
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,742
All of my family members
said that one was the best too.

1378
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:46,843
Really?

1379
01:04:46,843 --> 01:04:48,679
- That's why I came to taste it.
- Thank you.

1380
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:50,914
(Ecstatic)

1381
01:04:51,348 --> 01:04:53,283
- The creamy cod pasta.
- Really?

1382
01:04:53,283 --> 01:04:54,651
- I came back for more.
- You came back for more?

1383
01:04:55,552 --> 01:04:57,187
This has turned out better than I thought.

1384
01:04:57,187 --> 01:04:59,056
But the line isn't getting any shorter.

1385
01:05:00,223 --> 01:05:03,660
I was so curious about the taste
when I watched the show.

1386
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:07,264
So, I'm excited to come to the pop-up
to actually taste it.

1387
01:05:07,264 --> 01:05:09,599
The bread was on the show yesterday,

1388
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,969
so I'm super happy
to be able to try it today.

1389
01:05:11,969 --> 01:05:13,503
The Burden-Breaking Bread.

1390
01:05:13,503 --> 01:05:16,039
Su Young's dish was the best.

1391
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:19,176
I was most looking forward
to the creamy cod rolled pasta,

1392
01:05:19,176 --> 01:05:21,044
and that was the best one.

1393
01:05:21,044 --> 01:05:22,946
That was my top pick.

1394
01:05:22,946 --> 01:05:25,782
I'm not really good at cooking,

1395
01:05:25,782 --> 01:05:29,519
but when I watched the show yesterday,
it made me want to try cooking.

1396
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:31,421
(For those who weren't able...)

1397
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:32,889
(To make it to the pop-up)

1398
01:05:32,889 --> 01:05:34,992
(Here's the popular recipe.)

1399
01:05:34,992 --> 01:05:36,093
(From the Ryu-cipe meals)

1400
01:05:36,093 --> 01:05:38,028
Let's do a recap of the recipe
from Mr. Eo's World Food Tour.

1401
01:05:38,028 --> 01:05:39,296
Today,

1402
01:05:39,296 --> 01:05:40,931
we're going to make the dish...

1403
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:41,932
that was the most fun
and most delicious...

1404
01:05:41,932 --> 01:05:45,369
from Portugal,
the creamy cod rolled pasta.

1405
01:05:45,702 --> 01:05:47,004
Open the fridge door.

1406
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:50,841
(Opening)

1407
01:05:51,174 --> 01:05:53,744
This is actually quite nice
to have it open for you.

1408
01:05:54,778 --> 01:05:56,446
Garlic.

1409
01:05:56,446 --> 01:05:57,447
Cheese.

1410
01:05:57,447 --> 01:05:58,782
Close the door like this.

1411
01:05:58,782 --> 01:06:00,550
The nice thing about this is that...

1412
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:01,785
your fingers can't go in here.

1413
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:04,821
Usually, for regular fridges,
your fingers go in.

1414
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:07,291
Now, what are we going to make?

1415
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,592
(What's the first thing
we're going to make?)

1416
01:06:08,592 --> 01:06:09,860
We're going to make the cream sauce.

1417
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,128
It's not hard.

1418
01:06:11,728 --> 01:06:14,398
Cut the butter into the size
of premium crab sticks.

1419
01:06:14,398 --> 01:06:17,968
The butter melts quickly,
so add those in the pan.

1420
01:06:17,968 --> 01:06:19,303
We just cut like this.

1421
01:06:19,303 --> 01:06:20,871
(Use scallions instead
and stir-fry with butter.)

1422
01:06:20,871 --> 01:06:23,173
We're going to stir-fry the scallion.

1423
01:06:23,473 --> 01:06:25,475
And the butter burns easily,

1424
01:06:25,475 --> 01:06:27,044
so let's lower the heat.

1425
01:06:28,178 --> 01:06:31,048
It already smells crazy good.

1426
01:06:31,448 --> 01:06:34,584
Use about the same amount of flour
as butter.

1427
01:06:34,584 --> 01:06:36,486
Then, it'll start to smell like bread.

1428
01:06:37,788 --> 01:06:39,990
Let's do a 1:1 ratio.

1429
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:43,660
A half cup of milk
and a half cup of heavy cream.

1430
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:46,129
The flavor is definitely enhanced
when you add heavy cream.

1431
01:06:46,129 --> 01:06:48,665
It surprisingly becomes like a paste.

1432
01:06:48,665 --> 01:06:50,901
What are we going to add here?

1433
01:06:50,901 --> 01:06:53,203
We're going to add cod slices.
You can use these.

1434
01:06:53,203 --> 01:06:54,605
Get all the water out by squeezing it.

1435
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:57,307
Use your hands to tear them up.

1436
01:06:57,741 --> 01:07:00,644
If you use scissors,
you'll lose the texture.

1437
01:07:01,211 --> 01:07:05,816
(Mix the cod pieces
with the creamy paste.)

1438
01:07:05,816 --> 01:07:07,351
It'll start to smell interesting.

1439
01:07:09,252 --> 01:07:12,723
Add one spoonful of the tuna sauce.

1440
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:16,159
One spoonful of the oyster sauce.

1441
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,729
Let's add a pinch of salt.

1442
01:07:19,429 --> 01:07:21,264
Now, you pour in the starch water.

1443
01:07:21,698 --> 01:07:24,935
Two, three, four, add it all.

1444
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:27,371
We want this to come together.

1445
01:07:28,171 --> 01:07:30,140
We want this
to be as thick as Greek yogurt.

1446
01:07:30,607 --> 01:07:31,842
We're almost done.

1447
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:34,978
It became like this, right?

1448
01:07:35,312 --> 01:07:37,180
This is done.
If it comes together like this, it's done.

1449
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,349
The filling is done now.

1450
01:07:39,616 --> 01:07:42,119
You only thought of
boiling pasta in water, right?

1451
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:43,387
You didn't know that we'd fry them.

1452
01:07:44,588 --> 01:07:46,757
It's pasta
the size of a toilet paper core.

1453
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:49,059
This is cannelloni.

1454
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:50,661
Just put it in.

1455
01:07:51,328 --> 01:07:52,929
It's not hard. Just fry it...

1456
01:07:52,929 --> 01:07:54,298
until you get the color.

1457
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:57,134
You want to fry it past
the golden-brown point until it browns.

1458
01:07:57,134 --> 01:07:58,936
This is done.

1459
01:07:59,369 --> 01:08:00,504
This is all cooked.

1460
01:08:00,504 --> 01:08:01,872
You want this color.

1461
01:08:01,872 --> 01:08:03,907
We're going to make a sauce
to drizzle on these.

1462
01:08:03,907 --> 01:08:06,143
The sauce will be spicy.

1463
01:08:06,476 --> 01:08:08,178
Where's the Cheongyang pepper?

1464
01:08:08,178 --> 01:08:10,580
The side doors have a lot of storage.

1465
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,916
We use this part the most.

1466
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:14,651
It holds a lot, so it's very useful.

1467
01:08:14,651 --> 01:08:16,620
And even if you leave the doors open,

1468
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:18,055
it saves on your electric bills.

1469
01:08:19,022 --> 01:08:20,724
Here's the spicy Cheongyang pepper.

1470
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:23,593
It should be spicy.

1471
01:08:23,593 --> 01:08:25,195
(Use finely chopped Cheongyang pepper
instead of piri-piri.)

1472
01:08:25,195 --> 01:08:26,663
It has to be spicy.

1473
01:08:27,464 --> 01:08:28,732
One spoonful.

1474
01:08:28,732 --> 01:08:31,368
(Add and stir-fry the minced garlic
and the Cheongyang pepper.

1475
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:33,403
The smell is incredible already.

1476
01:08:33,403 --> 01:08:35,639
You want the spicy smell to go away...

1477
01:08:35,639 --> 01:08:37,074
and have it smell sweet.

1478
01:08:37,074 --> 01:08:38,775
It doesn't smell spicy anymore.

1479
01:08:38,775 --> 01:08:40,644
That's when you add the red pepper powder.

1480
01:08:40,644 --> 01:08:42,713
And a spoonful of tuna sauce.

1481
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:44,147
It already smells delicious.

1482
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:46,550
The color of this chili oil is crazy.

1483
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:50,287
It's done. We're done
cooking with the componenets.

1484
01:08:50,821 --> 01:08:52,089
Let's fill the pasta now.

1485
01:08:52,089 --> 01:08:53,156
Filling will be easy.

1486
01:08:53,156 --> 01:08:54,791
You can make a piping bag
and use that if you want.

1487
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,560
You can eat the cream sauce separately.

1488
01:08:56,927 --> 01:08:58,662
But it won't do much
if you eat it by itself.

1489
01:08:58,662 --> 01:08:59,796
Do you want to try it?

1490
01:08:59,796 --> 01:09:01,698
No, just eat the finished product.
We're almost done anyway.

1491
01:09:02,265 --> 01:09:03,767
Like this.

1492
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:05,869
(Tight formation,
plated with military precision!)

1493
01:09:05,869 --> 01:09:07,070
Like this.

1494
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:09,706
Then top it with scallions like this
and make a straight line.

1495
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,809
And you add some of this.

1496
01:09:14,478 --> 01:09:16,780
Let's drizzle the oil,

1497
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,148
the red oil.

1498
01:09:18,148 --> 01:09:20,350
(Adding the chili-seasoned oil)

1499
01:09:21,785 --> 01:09:24,154
Here's the creamy cod rolled pasta.

1500
01:09:24,154 --> 01:09:25,522
This is pasta.

1501
01:09:26,156 --> 01:09:27,224
(My goodness)

1502
01:09:27,524 --> 01:09:29,593
(Crossed the water by boat)

1503
01:09:29,893 --> 01:09:32,095
(Then over the bridge to get here)

1504
01:09:33,063 --> 01:09:34,164
This is something else.

1505
01:09:34,631 --> 01:09:37,167
(Endless dished of incredible food)

1506
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:39,036
(Local Bruneian meal)

1507
01:09:40,871 --> 01:09:42,072
(Su Young approved!)

1508
01:09:42,072 --> 01:09:43,106
This is tasty.

1509
01:09:43,106 --> 01:09:44,574
This is like the hot pepper tuna.

1510
01:09:44,574 --> 01:09:47,477
(Meet the taste of Korea in Brunei.)

1511
01:09:48,845 --> 01:09:50,213
It's slime you can eat.

1512
01:09:50,213 --> 01:09:51,114
This is so interesting.

1513
01:09:51,114 --> 01:09:52,382
I kind of want...

1514
01:09:52,382 --> 01:09:55,052
to use this for my Ryu-cipe tonight.

1515
01:09:55,052 --> 01:09:56,386
I think it'll be hard.

1516
01:09:56,386 --> 01:09:58,855
- That's a fail.
- Boil it.

1517
01:09:59,256 --> 01:10:01,892
(A total chaos)

1518
01:10:01,892 --> 01:10:04,528
(Even Su Young is making
one mistake after another?)

1519
01:10:04,528 --> 01:10:06,029
I've got my hands full, so just a second.

1520
01:10:06,029 --> 01:10:07,731
It'd be so funny
if we all failed today, right?

1521
01:10:08,465 --> 01:10:11,134
(Surrounded by wild boys,
the youngest stays calm.)

1522
01:10:11,268 --> 01:10:13,637
Beyond bread,
I'm going for tteok (rice cake) now.

1523
01:10:13,637 --> 01:10:15,772
(Moving on from baking to making tteok)

1524
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:17,240
It's the right color.

1525
01:10:17,808 --> 01:10:21,745
(Will he become the dessert prince?)

1526
01:10:21,745 --> 01:10:23,213
Can you believe
how well this tteok turned out?

1527
01:10:23,213 --> 01:10:25,916
- It's good.
- It's so chewy. It's good.

1528
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:28,819
You wanted to taste the Ryu-cipes, right?

1529
01:10:28,819 --> 01:10:31,521
The three boys will go to you.

1530
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:32,956
Not because we made it,

1531
01:10:32,956 --> 01:10:34,458
bit isn't it actually delicious?

1532
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:36,693
It tastes familiar yet unique.

1533
01:10:36,693 --> 01:10:37,628
Why?

1534
01:10:37,628 --> 01:10:41,999
Because we added our own kicks
to the Ryu-cipes.

1535
01:10:41,999 --> 01:10:44,768
Come meet us.

1536
01:10:44,768 --> 01:10:45,836
- Hurry.
- Come.

1537
01:10:45,836 --> 01:10:47,337
- Come.
- Come right now.

1538
01:10:48,171 --> 01:10:50,374
- The food's getting cold.
- No.
