1
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:15,125
(Mount Etna has erupted.)

2
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:16,194
You can see it best from here.

3
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:18,062
- Can you see it?
- I see it.

4
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:20,731
That's what it looks like, huh?

5
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,466
The volcano actually erupted.

6
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:24,002
That...

7
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:25,669
It's a bit scary.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,938
Yeah, it is.

9
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:30,040
I've never seen anything like it.

10
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,242
It's an actual volcano.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,146
(Mount Etna had suddenly erupted.)

12
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:39,484
(It hasn't stopped erupting,
even on their morning.)

13
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:44,022
(Despite the eruption,
the city of Catania remains calm.)

14
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:46,952
(Since 1998, it has
erupted nearly 200 times.)

15
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:49,326
(Volcanic activity has
become part of daily life.)

16
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:51,963
It's a lovely day,
and people seem to be enjoying it.

17
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:54,866
People are happy,
they're in a good mood...

18
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:59,536
(Feeling great,
the boys set out for the city.)

19
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:00,805
I'm hungry.

20
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,941
I'm starting to see some restaurants.

21
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:04,975
Yeah.

22
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:06,477
There's pizza...

23
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:11,381
(People are enjoying their meals
in the warm sunshine.)

24
00:01:11,382 --> 00:01:13,117
- Are we almost there?
- I think so.

25
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:18,255
This is the flower place.

26
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:19,456
It's the flower pasta place.

27
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:20,691
Look at this photo here.

28
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:22,060
This grandma...

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,995
I heard she has fun with cooking.

30
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:26,830
I can already tell
that she's an expert.

31
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:28,233
Why is the pasta so thick?

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,002
It looks like a long
tteokbokki (spicy rice cake) noodle.

33
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:32,669
Maybe they sell tteokbokki there.

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,770
I thought it was squid.

35
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:35,440
(Or maybe it's pasta with squid.)

36
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:37,108
Is it a tteokbokki place?

37
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:38,977
Let's go.

38
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:44,214
(Sicily, the birthplace of pasta)

39
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:46,083
Sicily is the birthplace of pasta.

40
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:48,218
Pasta was born here,
so we need to try it.

41
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:49,254
We should.

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,291
(From Sicily,
it spread across the entire country.)

43
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:58,830
(Pasta has taken on countless forms,
from shapes to sauces to ingredients.)

44
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:04,035
(Around 600 types of pasta alone)

45
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:09,207
(Sicilian pasta made with specialties
like pistachio, eggplant, and swordfish)

46
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,678
(A vibrant flavor profile that blends
acidity, saltiness, and rich aromas)

47
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:19,082
(The three boys learn pasta
at its birthplace.)

48
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,417
Should we sit here?
Perfect.

49
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:21,519
Very nice.

50
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:24,355
Even this tablecloth...

51
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:26,256
It's got that homey vibe.

52
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:27,725
It's pretty.

53
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:33,564
In her photo, she really seems like...

54
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:35,800
She reminds me of Granny Ma Bok Lim.

55
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:38,535
Yeah, because pasta
is like Italian tteokbokki.

56
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:40,437
It's Italian tteokbokki.

57
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:41,906
Even the noodles seem like tteokbokki.

58
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:44,442
(Every detail
reflects her pride in cooking)

59
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:45,809
Gosh!

60
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,611
Why?

61
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:47,778
Oliver.

62
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:49,112
Right, Oliver.

63
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:50,948
(Jamie Oliver has visited the restaurant.)

64
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,116
Jamie Oliver was here.

65
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,921
(A world-renowned star chef,
known for fresh and healthy cuisine)

66
00:02:57,288 --> 00:02:59,356
He's my favorite chef.

67
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:00,892
I watched his shows a lot
when I was young.

68
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:02,026
The program was called <i>The Naked Kitchen.</i>

69
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:04,628
It aired in the early 2000s.

70
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:05,963
I watched it from then.

71
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:07,064
It was simple.

72
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:10,334
He'd go buy some ingredients
and whip something up super quick.

73
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:13,137
Then, his friends would come over,
and they'd eat together. That was it.

74
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:14,705
It was so much fun. I watched it all.

75
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:18,075
That was the first time I thought,
"I want to do something like that too."

76
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:20,611
Jamie Oliver...
He's just a few years older than us.

77
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:21,713
We're similar in age, you know?

78
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,981
He's still going strong.

79
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:27,751
He must be like Korea's Ryu Su Young.

80
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:30,221
- Right.
- Oh, that's too kind.

81
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:32,924
He's England's Ryu Su Young,
and we have Korea's Jamie Oliver.

82
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,792
You're embarrassing me.

83
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:37,529
I'm honored,
but that's too generous.

84
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:38,996
Should we order?

85
00:03:38,997 --> 00:03:40,565
Yeah, I'm so hungry.

86
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,700
We finally get to try pasta.

87
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,068
- Finally.
- Yes.

88
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,137
I'm so excited.

89
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:49,606
They don't have cream pastas then, right?

90
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:52,242
They do.

91
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:54,611
It's with beef...

92
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,914
and béchamel sauce...
It's the sauce we made.

93
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:58,582
I want to try that.

94
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,285
- There's something I must try.
- Which one?

95
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:03,153
Aglio e olio.

96
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:04,955
- They have it here.
- Right. Me too.

97
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:06,056
After trying the carbonara,

98
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:08,726
I realized that I should also try
aglio e olio while in Italy.

99
00:04:09,561 --> 00:04:11,094
They also have vongole.

100
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:12,596
Goodness, vongole.

101
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:14,399
We should also try vongole
since we're in Sicily.

102
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,432
What do we do?

103
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:16,533
Let's all eat together.

104
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:18,136
I want to order like eight dishes.

105
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:21,205
With just the three of us,
five dishes is our limit.

106
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:23,174
- Okay.
- Yeah, let's share.

107
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,980
Ciao.

108
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,516
(They finally meet
the Sicilian pasta master.)

109
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:33,117
(A lively, joyful energy
that jumps straight out of the photo.)

110
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:34,819
Her energy is so nice.

111
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:40,458
(Rosanna, a pasta master)

112
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:44,596
(Running a restaurant in Sicily,
the home of pasta, for 55 years)

113
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,667
(Following the family's
100-year-old pasta tradition)

114
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:54,005
(Delivering a lasting,
unchanged flavor refined over time)

115
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,811
(Here come the pasta master's
100-year-old authentic pasta.)

116
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:02,146
Would you like to order?

117
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:06,985
(First, they order Kihyun's choice,
aglio e olio.)

118
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:08,953
Could you recommend a dish?

119
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,690
I recommend alla Norma.

120
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:19,130
I make it in the traditional way
my mom and grandma used to make.

121
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:21,065
The way her grandma
and mother used to make it?

122
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:22,799
Then this must be a family business.

123
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a local home-cooked meal.

124
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:27,505
(It's a dish you must have
when in Sicily.)

125
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:31,543
(Sicily's symbolic dish, alla Norma,
will be revealed soon.)

126
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:34,112
Thank you.

127
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,714
I'll make it delicious.

128
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:38,782
She's so fun.

129
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:40,318
She's like a character
straight out of a cartoon.

130
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:43,754
Right? I mean, look at her hat to start.

131
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:44,923
So cute.

132
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:47,491
It says <i>Norma</i> is the name of an opera.

133
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:50,027
The dish was so good
like an amazing opera,

134
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:51,395
so it was named "Norma."

135
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:52,596
In Korea, it would be like

136
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:54,565
<i>Chunhyangjeon</i> tteokbokki.

137
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,967
(<i>Norma</i> pasta is like
<i>Chunhyangjeon</i> tteokbokki)

138
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,735
- <i>Chunhyangjeon</i> tteokbokki.
- Sounds nice.

139
00:05:58,736 --> 00:05:59,871
I like the meaning behind it.

140
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,339
Or Bongyi Kim Seon Dal tteokbokki?
What else?

141
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,739
Bongyi Kim Seon Dal tteokbokki?

142
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,808
What are some of the other classics?

143
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:06,244
- Other than <i>Chunhyangjeon</i>.
- <i>Shimcheongjeon</i>?

144
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:07,945
Then it's like <i>Shimcheongjeon</i> tteokbokki.

145
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,479
<i>- Hong Gildongjeon.
- Hong Gildongjeon.</i>

146
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,014
It's that amazing.

147
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:12,449
But I'm kind of curious...

148
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,218
Don't you want to see her cooking?

149
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,954
- Yeah? Can we see it?
- Just a little bit.

150
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,921
It'd be great if we could see it.

151
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:19,390
(The three boys are curious
about the pasta master's cooking method.)

152
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,391
Since we're waiting anyway,

153
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,060
the three of us will go
and say hi to her.

154
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:25,487
(A special opportunity to witness
traditional pasta-making in its homeland)

155
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:27,866
(Hello.)

156
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,735
(The pasta master
happily welcomes the boys)

157
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:34,872
(Filming was conducted with permission.)

158
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:36,774
It smells so nice.

159
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,143
(Focused on cooking
even with three boys in the kitchen)

160
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:40,845
Amazing.

161
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:45,083
I've never seen this.

162
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:48,752
(A pasta even Su Young has never seen?)

163
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:50,688
I feel like it'll taste a bit like tteok.

164
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,323
It's like tteokbokki tteok.
How interesting.

165
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:54,559
What is that pasta?

166
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:58,195
What kind of pasta is this?

167
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:01,431
It's a traditional casarecce
I made myself.

168
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:03,534
She makes it right here.

169
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:05,002
She makes it herself.

170
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:06,871
(A pasta-making machine
in the corner of the kitchen)

171
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:09,606
(Casarecce / A traditional Sicilian pasta
meaning "made at home")

172
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:12,544
(It originated from handmade pasta
traditionally prepared at home.)

173
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:20,111
(Traditional pasta handed down
through generations of the family)

174
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:22,687
Even naengmyeon (cold noodles) places
make their own noodles too.

175
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:25,857
(Just like how naengmyeon places
make their own noodles)

176
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,759
(She makes her own pasta
in the restaurant.)

177
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,294
This pasta is so interesting.

178
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:32,329
Looking at it boil
totally reminds me of tteok.

179
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,799
It's noodles made with flour.
I say you could make tteokbokki with it.

180
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,034
- Wheat flour tteokbokki?
- Yeah.

181
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:38,869
Can we buy this pasta at a store?

182
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,571
No.

183
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:41,706
No?

184
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:43,941
They don't sell this.
You can only have it here.

185
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:46,043
Right. You can only have it here.

186
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:47,144
Can we buy some?

187
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:49,614
Probably. She probably sells the pasta.

188
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:52,716
I tried the uncooked pasta.

189
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:54,785
Tteokbokki tteok is made with rice flour.

190
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:56,187
But this is flour,
so it's different.

191
00:07:56,187 --> 00:07:58,156
(It's another kind of chewiness
compared to rice flour.)

192
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:05,156
(Authentic pasta made by a master,
using freshly made traditional noodles.)

193
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:08,332
- That looks good.
- It's here.

194
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,700
It's here.

195
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:11,302
(Time to try an authentic pasta dish)

196
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,605
(It's their first time trying
alla Norma.)

197
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:15,405
This is alla Norma.

198
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:17,174
This looks like it has to be good.

199
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,542
I'm so curious.

200
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:19,744
I'm super excited.

201
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:23,982
(Tomato sauce made from fresh tomatoes)

202
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:28,319
(You cannot forget eggplant in Sicily.)

203
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:32,189
(Cover the pasta
with large pieces of fried eggplant.)

204
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,460
(A generous amount of salted ricotta)

205
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:38,096
(Another scoop of the tomato sauce
to finish it off)

206
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:41,933
(Alla Norma,
inspired by Sicily's Mount Etna)

207
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,603
(The tomato sauce
represents flowing lava.)

208
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,140
(The white snow and green trees
are represented by cheese and basil.)

209
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,744
(Fried eggplant
symbolizes the dark volcanic ash.)

210
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:57,148
(First Authentic Pasta
Alla Norma)

211
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:58,716
Sicily in a bowl.

212
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,119
A volcanic eruption.

213
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:02,854
It's too pretty.
I feel bad about messing this up.

214
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,189
How should we eat this?

215
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:06,057
Like this...

216
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:08,659
I don't think you mix everything.

217
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,963
I think we should just get some pasta
and cheese and have it like this.

218
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:14,432
It really looks like tteokbokki.

219
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:17,468
Look at how bouncy the pasta is.

220
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,408
(They finally taste the alla Norma.)

221
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:27,312
Tomato.

222
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:30,582
Eggplant, tomato, and...

223
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:32,917
This is very salty.

224
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:37,155
(Su Young is taken aback
by the unexpected saltiness.)

225
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:38,422
I say we should be honest.

226
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,658
We have to be honest on a show.

227
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:44,328
I may not be an expert,

228
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:45,396
but this is very salty.

229
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:47,765
I think something's wrong with my tongue.

230
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,667
- Why? It's not salty?
- It's not.

231
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:53,003
While you two were taken aback,

232
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:54,405
I was like, "Is my tongue weird?"

233
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:57,008
Really?
Then does it taste just right to you?

234
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:58,576
Yeah.

235
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:03,513
(Mixed reviews for alla Norma)

236
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:06,183
Let's hold off on the reviewing
and try some more.

237
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,918
We should judge a dish with just one bite.

238
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,387
Let's get more familiar with the dish.

239
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:11,489
(Trying again with everything mixed)

240
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:15,993
Try mixing the eggplant first.

241
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:17,754
The inside is just a tomato sauce.
It's good.

242
00:10:18,196 --> 00:10:21,465
(Kyung Ho tries another bite.)

243
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:22,533
(Nodding)

244
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:23,668
How is it?

245
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:25,636
Mixed with the eggplant...

246
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:27,304
It's good mixed with the eggplant, right?

247
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:28,372
Yeah.

248
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:31,742
As someone with a Korean taste bud,
it doesn't have any sweetness, so...

249
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:33,277
I like the tangy and refreshing sauce,

250
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,179
but I was also expecting a sweetness.

251
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,081
This only has a savory,
tangy flavor though.

252
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:40,450
You normally use canned whole tomatoes...

253
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,419
since those are easier to use
when cooking.

254
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,587
But she didn't use that.

255
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:45,155
She just used fresh tomatoes.

256
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,324
Plus, I think she used smaller tomatoes.

257
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:48,892
Yeah, they taste different.

258
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:51,395
I mean, this is a real tomato sauce.

259
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:52,897
It's made with only tomatoes.

260
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,632
The pasta itself tastes good.

261
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,101
(Alla Norma)

262
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:58,770
This definitely tastes like Italy.

263
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:02,473
- Let's try this too.
- Let's try it.

264
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:07,077
Did we order this?

265
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:08,346
I guess so.

266
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:14,552
(The boys ordered aglio e olio.)

267
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:17,888
It weirdly looked like aglio e olio.

268
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,256
- It does, right?
- Yeah.

269
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:23,328
(This is pasta aglio e olio?)

270
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:24,795
This is aglio e olio?

271
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:26,263
Is this aglio e olio?

272
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:29,366
(No, it's not aglio e olio.)

273
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:32,236
Instead of aglio e olio, I wanted you
to taste a more traditional pasta.

274
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:34,706
So, instead of aglio e olio,
here's a pistachio pasta.

275
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:36,440
Really?

276
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:39,077
(The master wanted the boys
to try a more authentic pasta.)

277
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:41,879
She probably gave us this
because this tastes better.

278
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,181
She's like, "Just try this."

279
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:46,451
(Instead of garlic, scallion oil was used,
a taste Koreans know well.)

280
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:50,188
(Using milk to up the sweetness
and to get a creamy texture)

281
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:53,558
(Adding nuttiness and texture
with Sicily's specialty, pistachio)

282
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:57,962
(Second Authentic Pasta
Pistachio Pasta)

283
00:11:58,396 --> 00:11:59,596
This is definitely tteok.

284
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:01,232
- It's tteok.
- The texture?

285
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:08,072
Why does it actually taste like tteok?

286
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,742
It's like injeolmi
(rice cake with roasted soybean powder).

287
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:12,409
It tastes like injeolmi.

288
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,912
It's injeolmi.

289
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,648
Instead of some kind of a dish,
it really tastes like tteok.

290
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,715
It's just a thinner version.

291
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:22,586
You just have to salt it
and make it a bit savory.

292
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:25,623
Then, if you sprinkle some bean powder
or perilla seed powder, you get this.

293
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:28,859
- It weirdly tastes Korean.
- It does.

294
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,727
Honestly, it's a bit salty for us.

295
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:32,568
- The seasoning is strong.
- Yeah, it's strong.

296
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:34,665
- But it's good.
- It's good.

297
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,366
It's a very simple flavor.

298
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:39,503
There's always that saltiness
and savoriness here.

299
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,339
It makes you go back for more.

300
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:45,676
This is so interesting.

301
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:48,378
I feel like they'd sell this
at Nakwon Arcade.

302
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:50,615
There are a lot of tteok places
in Nakwon-dong.

303
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,916
It's very addictive.

304
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,351
I keep craving that nuttiness.

305
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:55,620
That salty and savory flavor...

306
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:57,755
- Good, right?
- Yes.

307
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:01,292
Another one is here.

308
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:05,262
(Another pasta has suddenly appeared.)

309
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:09,967
This is another signature pasta dish
from our family.

310
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:11,935
It's a cold fish pasta.

311
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:13,804
Then are there anchovies in here?

312
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:16,173
No, just shrimps.

313
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:18,008
Just shrimps? Okay.

314
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:20,311
(The third authentic pasta,
enriched with the flavor of shrimp)

315
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:24,115
(A generous amount of shrimp
from Sicily, the seafood heaven)

316
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:28,152
(More refreshing thanks to fresh tomatoes)

317
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:31,222
(The third authentic pasta,
simple in ingredients, bold in flavor)

318
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:35,593
(A Recipe Passed Down For 3 Generations
Shrimp Pasta)

319
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:45,169
This sort of tastes like jjajangmyeon
(black bean noodles). What?

320
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,203
Jjajangmyeon?

321
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:47,304
I get what you mean.

322
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:48,840
It sort of has that chunjang
(black bean paste) taste.

323
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,510
(Kihyun thinks the pasta's savory flavor
is similar to that of jjajangmyeon.)

324
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:54,711
It's like kaljebi
(noodles and dough soup).

325
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:55,914
It's sort of having sujebi (dough)
and kalguksu (noodles) together.

326
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:57,414
It's kaljebi.

327
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:59,383
- The seasoning for this...
- It's perfect?

328
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:00,984
Yeah, it's good.

329
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:02,186
It's not salty.

330
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:04,321
So the shrimp makes it taste like this?

331
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:05,790
It's a familiar taste.

332
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,269
The sauce is delicious.

333
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:20,438
It's good, but...

334
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:23,341
Doesn't this remind you of that?
Honestly...

335
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,948
I'm quite confused
because I feel like I'm not getting this.

336
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,017
Is this what pasta
is supposed to be like in Italy?

337
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,287
I think you should try some of this.

338
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:38,590
Producer, you should try some too.

339
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,824
Try some.
I'm just really not sure about this.

340
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,359
We just can't understand this.

341
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,560
We're confused.

342
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:49,499
(The three boys decide
to ask for the crew's opinion.)

343
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,835
I think this because it's like tteokbokki.

344
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:53,571
- Really?
- The texture?

345
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:57,441
All I can taste
is the sauce right now, so...

346
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:58,909
Tteokbokki...

347
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,945
If I think that this is tteokbokki
from Shindang-dong, then it's so good.

348
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:03,581
I need to have an open mind.

349
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:05,416
It tastes like chueotang (loach soup).

350
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,851
It does have that vibe.

351
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,987
Some kind of fish sauce was used here.

352
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:11,389
It does taste like that.

353
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:13,057
It has that fishy flavor to it.

354
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:14,959
Maybe sort of Southeast Asian flavors?

355
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,497
(Everyone felt differently
about the authentic pasta dishes.)

356
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:22,966
I was expecting...

357
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,102
I mean, Jamie Oliver was here too,

358
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:27,972
so I was super excited to try
this amazing pasta.

359
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:29,807
But how should I make sense of this?

360
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,708
Am I meant to say this is tasty?

361
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,243
It's not bad,

362
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:35,179
but it was so different
from what I expected.

363
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,315
Then I thought...

364
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,551
I'm not even a food critic,

365
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:43,420
but if the dish didn't fit my standard,

366
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:45,456
I critiqued it, saying it was good or bad.

367
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,659
I was so caught up...

368
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:52,297
in my own stereotypical assumptions.

369
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:55,133
Are we thinking too much
with our own palates?

370
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,366
Yes.

371
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,202
Then that's not studying.

372
00:15:58,203 --> 00:15:59,536
Right. You're right.

373
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:01,005
- Then that's not studying.
- It's not.

374
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,273
Then we're just here to critique.

375
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:04,208
You're right.
We should reflect on that.

376
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,343
She's been running this restaurant
since the 60s...

377
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:08,412
with her own pasta, using her own recipes.

378
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:09,980
That means there's a reason for that.

379
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:11,982
It can't be just luck.

380
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,818
Then, that means
we just haven't understood it yet.

381
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:15,286
There must be an interesting point.

382
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:17,222
This is what I think as I try more.

383
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:19,257
These dishes were made with her heart.

384
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:23,160
Now that you mention it,
it really does feel that way.

385
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,062
I'm going to miss these dishes.

386
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:27,197
(It's a taste
I'll remember for a long time.)

387
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:29,800
Now that I've had it,
it was really like a home-cooked meal.

388
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:31,101
Yes, totally.

389
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:33,104
- Nothing over the top.
- Nope.

390
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:38,008
Right, the daughters from yesterday
said they liked Korean food.

391
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:41,178
So, we asked them which Korean food
they wanted to eat.

392
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:42,847
Then shouldn't we at least
cook one Korean dish for them?

393
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:43,847
What should we make?

394
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:45,549
Where? Right, there they are.

395
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,318
- Hello.
- Hello.

396
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:51,823
(The daughters of the local meal master
greet the boys in Korean.)

397
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:55,093
(Plus, surprisingly...)

398
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:57,794
She was right.

399
00:16:57,795 --> 00:16:59,630
They have a tattoo representing Korea.

400
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:00,665
(These two Korea lovers
even got tattoos of Korea.)

401
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:02,066
We're thinking of inviting
those we've met.

402
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:04,435
Are you two free tomorrow night
by any chance?

403
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:08,239
(First guests! Korea-loving sisters)

404
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,341
(And another guest)

405
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:17,047
The guesthouse host we stayed with
for two nights while studying in Sicily.

406
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:20,785
(Second guest! The guesthouse host,
born and raised in Sicily for 53 years)

407
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:24,419
(Invited guests for today's Ryu-cipes!
Korea-loving sisters and a local Sicilian)

408
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:28,759
I think we could make this
into a tteokbokki.

409
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,563
If we use these flavors as a base
for tteokbokki,

410
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:35,567
then even Italians would feel familiar
with the tteokbokki, right?

411
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,268
Would this be too much?
How about gimbap?

412
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:40,470
Gimbap would be great.

413
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:42,674
(A little later)

414
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,808
Let's show them that Korean spice.

415
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:46,329
(Upgrades K-food prepared by the trio)

416
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:50,447
I went for a collaboration
between Italy and Korea.

417
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:52,528
(A collaboration between flavors
of Sicily and Korea)

418
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,986
You can't just stop.
It can't be done halfheartedly.

419
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:57,387
I was only thinking about the dish.

420
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:59,224
What should I add to make it tastier?

421
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,491
Great dishes don't just happen.

422
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:03,394
(Very special Ryu-cipe dishes
will be created today.)

423
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:07,165
(Four different Ryu-cipe dishes
will be revealed soon.)

424
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:11,134
(Time until guest arrival)

425
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:12,136
Let's go grocery shopping.

426
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:13,304
- Sounds good.
- Let's go.

427
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:16,574
Doing the groceries
feels very familiar to us now, right?

428
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,342
It's fun now.

429
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:19,510
It feels like a grocery store
in our neighborhood.

430
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,880
We know where everything is
at a local grocery store, right?

431
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:24,514
Like a banchan (side dish) place.

432
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:25,516
(Traditional Sicilian side dishes
stopped the boys on their trail.)

433
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:27,318
It's just like a banchan place in Korea.

434
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:31,054
These are sun-dried tomatoes.

435
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:33,091
(A familiar ingredient
found in the side dish store)

436
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,292
The tomatoes look nice.
They dried it well.

437
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:36,426
It looks nice and chewy.

438
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:39,162
You can just soak these in some olive oil,

439
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:41,499
then you get sun-dried tomatoes.

440
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:45,002
Bacalhau.

441
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:48,773
You pronounce it like this.

442
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:52,576
(Bacalhau is pronounced differently
depending on the country.)

443
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:54,512
It's called something different.

444
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,148
They also have squash blossoms here.

445
00:18:57,982 --> 00:18:59,249
You're right,

446
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,451
How much are they here?

447
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:03,354
They actually eat these blossoms.

448
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:08,158
(Su Young used squash blossoms
in his Ryu-cipe.)

449
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,594
It's much cheaper.

450
00:19:09,794 --> 00:19:11,295
Everything is so tasty.

451
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:13,965
How could that be? It's so good.

452
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:16,968
What's this?

453
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:19,837
Gosh, what is this?

454
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:23,173
(First time seeing this long thing
while studying abroad)

455
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:24,309
What is this?

456
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:28,246
It's zucchini.

457
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,250
- This is crazy.
- It feels weird.

458
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:34,184
It's so big.

459
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:35,253
(Kihyun also becomes curious
about these unfamiliar ingredients.)

460
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:36,587
He said this was zucchini.

461
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:37,654
This is a zucchini?

462
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:38,756
Yeah, but it looks like a snake.

463
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:40,123
(Even after hearing it… no way.)

464
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:41,426
Goodness.

465
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:43,026
This is insane.

466
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,229
How does a zucchini grow this big?

467
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:45,629
I don't know...

468
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,265
(Sicilian squash
that can grow up to 1 meter long.)

469
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:49,100
The zucchini is unbelievable.

470
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:53,296
("The world is big and is full of
ingredients I've yet to discover.")

471
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,372
(- The students)

472
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,206
Where did Kyung Ho go?

473
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:57,407
Let's go look for Kyung Ho.

474
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:59,376
- There he is.
- Let's go.

475
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:01,545
So they haven't started cooking yet?

476
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:03,114
No, I don't think they understood you.

477
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:06,116
Then, nothing is ready right now?

478
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:08,852
(Super upset after hearing about
the sold-out menus)

479
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:12,756
One of the dishes looked really tasty.

480
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:15,259
It sort of looked like they rolled...

481
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,961
some samgyeopsal (pork belly)
with cheese and vegetables inside.

482
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:22,199
And the cross section looked so pretty.

483
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,669
I thought it'd be a perfect dish
to make for the guests later.

484
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,374
Maybe I'll use some samgyeopsal,
kimchi, cheese,

485
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,809
and roll it all together.

486
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,779
Why do I always want to roll it up?

487
00:20:36,681 --> 00:20:39,918
(Time until guest arrival)

488
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,953
I may not look it,
but I'm actually freaking out right now.

489
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:43,888
Hahaha.

490
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:44,922
- Su Young.
- Yeah?

491
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:47,324
- What's so funny?
- It's funny.

492
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:49,494
We're all serious right now,
so why are you laughing?

493
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:52,462
Maybe a little vibe-check before filming?

494
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:54,698
I'm sorry. I'm so bad at reading the room.

495
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:58,368
It's already our third day here,
but you're still getting anxious?

496
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:00,271
I'm still trying to think
of a dish to make.

497
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:03,607
It's always got a beginning,
middle, and end.

498
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:07,244
Thinking of a dish to make
is the beginning,

499
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,013
and that's when you get stressed the most.

500
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:14,184
It builds up. You're coming up with ideas,
and you're still stressed and nervous.

501
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,353
Then, once you start cooking, it's fun.

502
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:18,289
That means the brainstorming is done,
so it doesn't matter anymore,

503
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,057
but right now, I'm trying to think.

504
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:22,326
You're in that beginning build-up stage.

505
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:23,795
I'm trying to imagine
the flavors in my head.

506
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:26,897
- The flavors we've learned...
- That's true.

507
00:21:26,898 --> 00:21:30,100
I was going to roll some samgyeopsal
and kimchi for my Ryu-cipe dish,

508
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:32,769
but that's just too Korean.

509
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,274
Going full Korean would make this
study abroad in Sicily feel pointless.

510
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,543
So, I'm thinking of using caponata...

511
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:40,644
Caponata sounds good.

512
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:42,846
Maybe stuff a bird with caponata
and grill it.

513
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:44,215
Stuff a chicken.

514
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:45,949
Don't you think it'll be good?

515
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,218
(Stuff a chicken with caponata?)

516
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:48,819
I've wanted to try stuffing a chicken.

517
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,521
Stuff a chicken with caponata.

518
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:53,257
- I think that's a good idea.
- Nice.

519
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:54,425
Will it be like a rotisserie chicken?

520
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:56,160
Yeah, make it like that.

521
00:21:57,562 --> 00:22:00,765
(Korean rotisserie chicken is stuffed
with sticky rice, garlic, dates, etc.)

522
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:04,568
Make the caponata like before
but make the pieces smaller.

523
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,770
Then you can stuff the chicken,
tie it up,

524
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:08,339
and put it in the oven.

525
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:12,443
I'm curious
about the sweet and tangy chicken.

526
00:22:13,678 --> 00:22:15,012
Let's see how many kilos this is.

527
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:17,282
(There's no time to lose.
They immediately go to buy a chicken.)

528
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:18,515
It's 3kg.

529
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:21,685
(A hefty chicken weighing a full 3kg)

530
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:23,120
I'm taking on a big challenge.

531
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:24,154
It is a big challenge.

532
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:26,224
Even I've never cooked
with a 3kg chicken before.

533
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:32,196
(Time until guest arrival)

534
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,965
There's no time. We only have
two hours until guests arrive.

535
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:39,504
- Oh no.
- We're short on time.

536
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,338
Kyung Ho, your chicken...

537
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:43,140
is going to take a long time.

538
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:44,409
The chicken needs to go in the oven.

539
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:45,609
In 40 minutes.

540
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,544
I should make the caponata first.

541
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:49,814
Yes, that stuffing
needs to be ready in 40 minutes.

542
00:22:50,448 --> 00:22:51,616
We can do it.

543
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,819
(Four Ryu-cipe dishes for the guests)

544
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,723
(First Ryu-cipe dish,
"Caponata Chicken")

545
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,227
(Starts preparing
the caponata as the filling)

546
00:23:02,493 --> 00:23:06,396
(Cut the vegetables
into similar-sized pieces.)

547
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:08,733
Last time,
Su Young stir-fried the vegetables.

548
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:14,973
(There's no time, so let's use
Su Young's one-pan recipe.)

549
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:19,244
(Add all the vegetables
to the pan and stir-fry them.)

550
00:23:21,713 --> 00:23:24,582
(Speeding up)

551
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,183
Show us your wok skills.

552
00:23:26,184 --> 00:23:27,285
Wok skills?

553
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:29,920
(Is it time to prove my wok skills?)

554
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,355
Don't throw it up.

555
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:32,490
Use a pulling motion.

556
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:33,690
My hand is slippery.

557
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:36,094
(Already nervous?
Wipes off the sweat from his hand.)

558
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:40,465
(I'll show you.)

559
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:47,338
(Putting is soul into filming)

560
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:51,943
(Perfect wok skills)

561
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:54,845
Good?

562
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:56,179
One more time.

563
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,816
(Encore)

564
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:06,291
("Not to brag, but… I think
I look cool right now." - Kyung Ho)

565
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:11,796
Kyung Ho,

566
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,900
it looks like the kettle is burning.

567
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,805
(Simmering vinegar, sugar, and water
for agrodolce sauce)

568
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:23,241
This kitchen doesn't like me.

569
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:26,244
It's scaring me.

570
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:31,282
Whenever I make that sauce,
it's trouble.

571
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,717
(Last night, while making his dish...)

572
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:34,886
Is the sauce okay? Did it burn?

573
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:36,086
It's burnt.

574
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:37,187
Oh, gosh.

575
00:24:37,188 --> 00:24:38,789
How did that happen so quickly?

576
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,823
No, this won't work.

577
00:24:39,824 --> 00:24:41,158
It smells like herbal medicine.

578
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,927
(Kyung Ho made an herbal medicine
instead of a sauce.)

579
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:44,295
I've failed.

580
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:50,133
(Running out of time,
and stressing over the sauce)

581
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:52,402
What do I do?
Su Young, this is the sauce, but...

582
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:53,471
Let's check the seasoning.

583
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:55,572
- Did you boil it?
- Yeah.

584
00:24:55,573 --> 00:24:57,373
(Ryu-GPT is assessing
the state of the sauce.)

585
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:58,843
(Cough)

586
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:00,837
The sourness
from the vinegar is still there.

587
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:03,381
If you start this, you'll be here all day.

588
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:05,450
Do we have a frying pan?

589
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:07,919
(Ryu-GPT: When making
the agrodolce sauce, use a frying pan.)

590
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,220
So this was how you boiled it yesterday.

591
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:12,101
Yeah, it won't take long
if you do it like this.

592
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:13,791
It gets to have
that slightly sticky flavor.

593
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:15,126
(Using a pan lets the vinegar's acidity
evaporate quickly, so it finishes fast.)

594
00:25:15,126 --> 00:25:16,260
(Mmph)

595
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:17,428
(Cough)

596
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:18,896
It's too sour.

597
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:20,430
- It's too sour?
- It's okay.

598
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:21,632
It'll be okay once it boils.

599
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:24,101
When it turns slightly brown,
let's put it in.

600
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:25,570
(Boil until the sauce
turns slightly brown.)

601
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,603
Taste it.

602
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:29,244
You need to remember the taste
so that you can make it again later.

603
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,078
(Cough)

604
00:25:34,712 --> 00:25:35,980
I think it's better now.

605
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:37,381
Are you sure?

606
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:39,049
Yeah, it's good.

607
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,084
I mean it.

608
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:41,485
I'm going to add it.

609
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:42,553
Yes, go ahead.

610
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:45,989
(Pour the sweet and tangy agrodolce
onto the vegetables.)

611
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,795
(Caponata is done
with a one-pan recipe.)

612
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:52,830
This is big.

613
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:56,333
(Star of the dish! A full 3kg chicken)

614
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:57,635
I don't think it'll cook in one hour.

615
00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:59,804
I think it needs at least two hours.

616
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:02,840
I don't think the chicken will cook.
An hour is too short.

617
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,842
(His Ryu-cipe dish might not
be finished before the guests arrive.)

618
00:26:05,843 --> 00:26:08,645
(Time until guests arrive)

619
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:11,126
Unfortunately, there's no way
this is going to be fully cooked.

620
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:15,552
I didn't know how to work this.

621
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:17,856
The oven hasn't been preheated?
It's going to be harder now.

622
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:18,923
Oh goodness.

623
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,358
This won't work.

624
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,393
Gosh.

625
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:25,896
(The absolute worst situation in Ryu-cipe)

626
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:27,599
Things like this happens, right?

627
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,868
What should we do?

628
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:32,136
Should we boil it?

629
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:34,872
Caponata is the key here,

630
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:36,808
so it's no use if we can't stuff the bird.

631
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:39,476
This just has to finish
before 8 o'clock, right?

632
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:40,744
- Yes.
- Right?

633
00:26:40,745 --> 00:26:43,181
We should all work on
all the dishes together.

634
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,016
Now's not the time
to worry about what's yours or mine.

635
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:46,416
We need to work on it all together.

636
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:50,655
(Time until guests arrive)

637
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:55,026
(Su Young takes charge
of prepping the bird.)

638
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,928
There's space
between the meat and the skin.

639
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:00,298
Just ease it open with your fingers
and spread the butter inside.

640
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:02,500
Then it'll enhance the flavor
as it melts inside.

641
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:06,503
Here you go, Chef.

642
00:27:06,504 --> 00:27:08,306
(Next, Kyung Ho is in charge
of stuffing the bird.)

643
00:27:08,306 --> 00:27:10,274
I feel like we need to add some garlic.

644
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:11,976
(Start with the punchy whole garlic.)

645
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,916
(Here's the main ingredient, caponata.)

646
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:22,987
(Totally stuff the chicken with caponata.)

647
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:28,426
(Last step before the chicken
goes into the oven)

648
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:32,597
(Kyung Ho and Su Young work together
and use a skewer to seal it.)

649
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:35,532
This is so nice to be cooking
right by your side like this.

650
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,969
Same here. It's nice to be cooking
with Mr. Kim like this.

651
00:27:38,703 --> 00:27:40,904
Mr. Kim? Kim Kyung Ho is a singer.

652
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:42,673
(Upset)

653
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:44,509
You want to do this?
Right here, right now?

654
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,244
No.

655
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:48,278
This is nice.

656
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,314
I feel like I've seen this scene
in a drama series.

657
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:51,955
What kind of a show
has a scene like this?

658
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:53,884
<i>The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call.</i>

659
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:57,055
Didn't you get to do
a lot of surgeries like this on that show?

660
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:58,956
Can you stick one in here?

661
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:00,225
Stick it in like this.

662
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,895
Wait a minute, seriously!

663
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:06,631
There you go.

664
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:07,965
Are you sure?

665
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,299
Are you satisfied with your work?

666
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,168
- This one went in for sure.
- Yeah?

667
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:13,137
- It's perfect?
- Yes.

668
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:18,509
I've done over 5,000 anal surgeries,
you know.

669
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:21,812
That looks crazy.

670
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,046
Amazing, right?

671
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:24,214
That's done now.

672
00:28:24,215 --> 00:28:25,415
Well done.

673
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:26,951
(Surgery complete!
What will happen to this chicken?)

674
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:29,019
The chicken is finally in the oven.

675
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,421
Yeah, it's out of our hands now.

676
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:31,890
Let's make tteokbokki now.

677
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:33,658
I'm hungry.

678
00:28:34,025 --> 00:28:37,595
(The icon of K-food, tteokbokki)

679
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:40,065
(K-tteokbokki is taking over the world!)

680
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,200
(The world is going wild
for K-Food! Tteokbokki!)

681
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,402
(Four Ryu-cipe dishes for the guests)

682
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:48,306
(Second Ryu-cipe dish,
"Brisket Tteokbokki Pasta")

683
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,641
Where's the pasta
that we got from the master?

684
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:51,676
This must be it.

685
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:53,410
(The master's pasta)

686
00:28:53,411 --> 00:28:54,412
Good.

687
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:56,114
I'll boil this.

688
00:28:57,348 --> 00:28:58,416
(They'll use the master's pasta
as the tteok.)

689
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,056
We're going to use this pasta like tteok.

690
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:04,755
I'm going to add some salt and sugar
for some basic seasoning.

691
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:06,390
Lots of popular places do this too.

692
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:09,093
When you're cooking pasta,
you normally just add salt.

693
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:11,862
- Right.
- But I'm also going to add sugar.

694
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:13,464
Is this done?

695
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,707
The pasta itself is delicious.

696
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:26,143
This by itself already tastes like tteok.
I really like it.

697
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,384
(Tteok like pasta will be perfect
for making tteokbokki.)

698
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:33,350
Let me rinse it in cold water
just like tteok.

699
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:36,521
(For those in Korea,
use wheat-flour tteok instead.)

700
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:41,860
(Next, time to make the tteokbokki sauce)

701
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:46,965
(The key ingredient
in the tteokbokki sauce! Beef briskets!)

702
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:51,069
(Su Young's super simple
brisket tteokbokki sauce)

703
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:54,973
(Brisket tteokbokki sauce /
1. Cook the brisket and get the oil.)

704
00:29:55,573 --> 00:30:00,445
(Mr. Eo's Tip / The oil from the brisket
will enhance the flavor.)

705
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:06,117
(2. Add and stir-fry red pepper powder,
gochujang, and oyster sauce.)

706
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:11,322
(Stir-fry quickly
to keep the pepper powder from burning.)

707
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:14,926
(3. Add water straight into the pan.)

708
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,727
In something red like this,

709
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:18,095
you need lots of scallions.

710
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:20,298
(4. Finish it off
by adding scallions and fish cakes.)

711
00:30:20,865 --> 00:30:26,571
(A rich tteokbokki sauce infused
with the deep flavor of beef brisket.)

712
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:31,776
(Adding pasta to Korea's spicy sauce)

713
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:35,679
(Mix the pasta with the brisket sauce.)

714
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,881
You cannot fail with this flavor combo.

715
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:39,417
It looks incredibly delicious.

716
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:45,256
(The ultimate fusion!
Italian pasta reborn as Korean tteokbokki)

717
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:51,129
(Second Ryu-cipe dish,
"Brisket Tteokbokki Pasta" cleared!)

718
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:53,398
(Brisket Tteokbokki Pasta / 1. Boil
the pasta with 1T salt and 1T sugar.)

719
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:54,641
(2. Get oil from brisket,
add 3T red pepper powder, 2T
gochujang, 1T oyster sauce)

720
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:55,400
(3. Add water
so that the powder doesn't burn.)

721
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:56,501
(4. Add scallions, fish cake.)
5. Add cooked pasta.)

722
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,834
What else are we making?

723
00:30:57,835 --> 00:30:59,237
(Starting on the next Ryu-cipe dish)

724
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:00,370
Gimbap...

725
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:02,173
Yeah, the rice for the gimbap
is cooking right now.

726
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:03,208
Let's just make three rolls.

727
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:04,208
I think it's like this.

728
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:06,176
When there's a celebration in Korea,

729
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:08,137
it's weird to not give
the guests any rice, right?

730
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:10,748
Would this be too much?
How about gimbap?

731
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:13,550
- Gimbap would be great.
- Not a bad idea.

732
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:14,785
You can't fail with gimbap.

733
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:15,886
Kyung Ho,

734
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:18,156
- you've made gimbap before.
- Of course.

735
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:19,823
It's a piece of cake for me.

736
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:21,091
Gimbap sounds good.

737
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,759
We could present gimbap...

738
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,963
as a representative dish of Korea.

739
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,999
(Four Ryu-cipe dishes for the guests)

740
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:31,870
(Third Ryu-cipe dish,
"Gimbap")

741
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:34,338
What should I do now Su Young?

742
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,740
This is what you're going to do
with the rice.

743
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,341
Some bits are burnt here,

744
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:38,543
so make sure you don't mix
those burnt bits.

745
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:41,880
Then, move some rice into a bowl
and drizzle lots of sesame oil.

746
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:43,514
That's hot.

747
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:49,153
(You only need the nutty sesame oil
and the flavorful seasoned salt.)

748
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:50,921
The smell...

749
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:51,989
What smell?

750
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,726
This smell of rice with sesame oil...

751
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:58,863
It has to be so good,
the rice alone tastes amazing.

752
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:02,433
(Su Young is in charge
of the gimbap fillings.)

753
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:05,703
(First gimbap ingredient, egg sheets)

754
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,237
Cover it.

755
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:09,039
(Cover it with a lid.)

756
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,441
You don't need to flip it.
That's how you mess up.

757
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:14,546
You just need to cover it with a lid.

758
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:16,080
Done.

759
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:17,448
Looks good.

760
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:20,350
(One egg sheet done.)

761
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:21,786
That's amazing.

762
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:25,689
It's a true innovation.

763
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,290
(A true innovation in making egg sheets)

764
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:32,063
(Don't try to flip it,
and just use a lid.)

765
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:35,299
Look at how thin...

766
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,770
(Slice the egg sheets into thin strips.)

767
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:42,574
(Cucumber, carrots,
danmuji (pickled radish))

768
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:46,777
(The key ingredient for gimbap)

769
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:49,847
(Anchovies)

770
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:53,851
I'm going to stir-fry some anchovies
to add inside the gimbap.

771
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:56,154
Sounds like a good idea.

772
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:59,624
(Soy sauce, sugar)

773
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:02,693
(Sweet and savory
stir-fried anchovies done!)

774
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:04,429
The anchovies are nice and crispy. Try it.

775
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:09,334
The anchovies are the highlight.

776
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:11,135
Having it light and crispy is key.

777
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:12,270
Anchovies are so good.

778
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:14,638
I think you just have to roll them, sir.

779
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:17,542
I can't believe I'm rolling gimbap again.

780
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:20,378
I guess when I go abroad,
it's always gimbap for me.

781
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:21,778
You need sesame oil, right?

782
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:22,914
I do, yes.

783
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:26,017
I need a little bowl with water...

784
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,818
I'll make one for you.

785
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,254
I know what it's for.
I'll use a soju glass.

786
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:30,388
Thank you.

787
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:32,657
(Kyung Ho, you just focus on the gimbap.)

788
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:33,791
Thank you.

789
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:39,397
(Starts on the gimbap)

790
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,733
Such delicate hands.

791
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:45,535
It's important
to have the rice even and thin.

792
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:51,743
(Thinly and evenly spread the rice.)

793
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:54,111
I should learn...

794
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:55,380
Stop it, Su Young.

795
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,947
Take it easy.

796
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:57,948
Looks good.

797
00:33:57,949 --> 00:34:02,053
(On top of sliced egg sheets,
add lots of crispy anchovies.)

798
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:03,954
Don't we also have crab sticks?

799
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:05,256
Yeah, I'll cook it for you. Just a second.

800
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:06,496
All right. We have crab sticks.

801
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:10,695
(Kyung Ho's taking charge
of today's gimbap!)

802
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:12,730
If you need it,
you can add these.

803
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,499
I thought it would add to the color,
so I cooked it.

804
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:15,967
It's hot.

805
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,071
I told you it was hot.

806
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:23,540
- It's hot.
- It's very hot.

807
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:26,377
(Time until guests arrive)

808
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,847
(Even in a rush,
don't skip a single filling!)

809
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:32,717
(Firm)

810
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:35,920
(Totally focused)

811
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:41,492
(Wipe the end with some water
so that it doesn't come undone.)

812
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:45,597
(Massage the gimbap with some sesame oil.)

813
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:49,167
(Finish off with whole sesame seeds.)

814
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:52,270
It's finished.
Let's try cutting it and have a taste.

815
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,543
Look at that cross section.

816
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:01,379
(Gimbap's cross section
looks insanely good.)

817
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:04,983
(Rolled with so much care!
How will the anchovy gimbap taste?)

818
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:05,983
Is it good?

819
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:09,821
(Rolled with so much care!
How will the anchovy gimbap taste?)

820
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:11,755
Hey, it's so good.

821
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:12,457
What should I add more of?

822
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,591
Add more of this and this too.

823
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:15,659
It's a luxurious gimbap.

824
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,061
It tastes like it's from
that gimbap place called Teacher Kim.

825
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,101
(Premium Korean gimbap
made with just 5 ingredients)

(Gimbap master Kyung Ho's shows
his pro-level skills.)

828
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:36,933
You always snack on gimbap
as you make them.

829
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:43,821
It's good. You're good.

830
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:54,299

all in one bite)

Dessert, dessert!
It's dessert again today.

841
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,593
I feel like the meal isn't complete
unless I make the dessert.

842

without dessert.)

Cacao powder and sugar powder.

858
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:09,874

00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:22,220
(Whipping meringue / Beating
egg whites with sugar until stiff peaks)

863
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,855
(A key step in building
the base of the cream)

864
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:24,855
(Goodness)

865
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:27,158
(Taking a moment to focus again)

866
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:32,597
(Super elite arm strength, power up!)

867
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:34,464
(Speed up!)

868
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:39,203
(Drained of energy)

869
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:40,205
Are you okay?

870
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:41,839
I'm okay.

871
00:37:42,207 --> 00:37:43,408
I'm just charging a little.

872
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:45,128
I'm letting my battery rest.

873
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,513
(Done recharging)

874
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,035
I feel like I'm working out.

875
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:55,286
(Drained of energy again)

876
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:57,555
(Smirk)

877
00:37:57,722 --> 00:37:58,789
- Kihyun.
- Yeah?

878
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,924
Isn't cooking fun?

879
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,792
It's so much fun.

880
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:02,994
Yeah, have fun.

881
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:10,501
(After some serious forearm action,
perfectly stiff meringue!)

882
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:14,138
(Amazing)

883
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,175
(Showing off the stiff peaks)

884
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:20,043
(Proud)

885
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:22,212
It's done. I did it.

886
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:23,280
- Kyung Ho.
- Yeah.

887
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:24,983
- Look at this.
- Good job.

888
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:26,684
- No, look at it.
- Huh? Okay.

889
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:29,620
(Kihyun's stiff meringue show)

890
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:31,555
- Good job.
- It's done.

891
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,892
I mean, if it stays in the bowl
even when I flip it, it's done, right?

892
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:34,925
Of course.

893
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:36,293
I need to whip more.

894
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:38,129
(The real deal for tiramisu cream
starts now.)

895
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:41,699
(8T of sugar)

896
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:43,768
I need to mix the whipped cream...

897
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:46,103
Whipped cream...

898
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:49,173
(A key ingredient you cannot miss
when making traditional tiramisu)

899
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:52,844
Mascarpone cheese.

900
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:57,415

for traditional Italian tiramisu)

901
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:00,651
(Mascarpone / Used
for traditional Italian tiramisu)

902
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:04,122
(Known for its rich, nutty sweetness
without any saltiness)

903
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:08,493
(Can be substituted
with cream cheese in Korea)

904
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:11,729
(Super elite arm strength at work again)

905
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:13,092
(Traditional tiramisu cream)

906
00:39:13,092 --> 00:39:15,932
(1. Add sugar, mascarpone, and cream
into a yolk then whip until thick.)

907
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:20,805
(2x speed)

908
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:26,010
(It's a long, long road
to becoming a Dessert Prince.)

909
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:31,349
(2. Mix meringue
with the thickened cream.)

910
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:34,652
(His super elite arm strength
has no time to rest.)

911
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:39,791
(The Dessert Prince
is just whipping all day long.)

912
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:43,127
(Checking the cream)

913
00:39:43,228 --> 00:39:45,196
(All worth it for this sweet flavor)

914
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,030
(The Dessert Prince's traditional
Italian tiramisu cream is done.)

915
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:51,669
(Second key ingredient
for traditional Italian tiramisu)

916
00:39:52,237 --> 00:39:54,938
(Ladyfingers / Long sponge cookies
made with eggs, sugar, and flour)

917
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,619
(A key ingredient that forms
the base layer of traditional tiramisu)

918
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:02,447
(Can be substituted with castella
or pound cake in Korea)

919
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:05,216

921
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,288

on the bottom of the dish.)

922
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:12,868

923
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:16,127

himself for the traditional tiramisu.)

924
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:18,262
(4T of coffee, 4T of sugar)

925
00:40:18,263 --> 00:40:19,497
It's a one to one ratio.

926
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:22,734
Su Young said
that it has to be really strong.

927
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,735
Enough to make you frown.

928
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:27,576
(Traditional tiramisu calls for coffee
strong enough to make you frown.)

929
00:40:29,374 --> 00:40:30,775
(Yuk)

930
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,444
It's perfect.

931
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:35,626
(Layering traditional tiramisu)

932
00:40:35,627 --> 00:40:38,483
(2. Pour the coffee
on the ladyfingers and let it soak.)

933
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:42,119
(Bold coffee seeps
deep into the ladyfingers.)

934
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,222
These soak up a lot of coffee.

935
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:47,959
(3. Layer the tiramisu cream on top
of the soaked ladyfingers.)

936
00:40:48,193 --> 00:40:52,764
(Even out the tiramisu cream.)

937
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:56,334
(4. Layer the soaked ladyfingers
on top of the cream.)

938
00:40:57,802 --> 00:41:00,171
(Slip)

939
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:02,340
No...

940
00:41:02,674 --> 00:41:05,243
(The ladyfinger crumbled.)

941
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:06,644
(Picks up the second ladyfinger carefully
so that it doesn't crumble)

942
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:08,379
(Fail)

943
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:11,282
(Keeps failing)

944
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:14,953
(We're short on time,
but I can't give up on the tiramisu.)

945
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,523
(Time until guest arrives)

946
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:20,725
I don't know anymore.

947
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:23,761
(Yoo-GPT resorts to emergency action.)

948
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:28,867
(Puts all the ladyfingers in the coffee)

949
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,605
(Breaks the soaked ladyfingers)

950
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:37,275
(Place the crumbled ladyfingers on top
to make a layer.)

951
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:40,178
(I'm Yoo-GPT of the dessert world.)

952
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:43,448
(A layer full of ladyfingers)

953
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:46,351
(On top, layer
the sweet tiramisu cream again.)

954
00:41:46,618 --> 00:41:49,187
Now, cacao powder
and sugar powder as well.

955
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:53,323
(A little kick prepared by a nut lover)

956
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,260
I was planning to add ground pistachios.

957
00:41:57,095 --> 00:41:59,296
As I was sprinkling some on top,

958
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:01,732
it felt like I was sprinkling
pistachio seeds or something.

959
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:03,066
Pistachio..

960
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:03,815
(Pistachio Tiramisu / 1. Whip egg whites,
sugar to make meringue.)

961
00:42:03,816 --> 00:42:04,702
(2. Mix egg yolks, 8T sugar, 3 mascarpone,
whipped cream, then add meringue.)

962

4. Layer soaked ladyfingers.)

963
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:06,917
(5. Make layers with cream
and soaked ladyfingers.)

964
00:42:06,918 --> 00:42:07,972
(6. Finish with cacao powder,
sugar powder, pistachio.)

965
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:11,409
(Ryu-cipe dessert "Tiramisu" cleared)

966
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:14,712
(Four Ryu-cipe dishes for the guests)

967
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:16,980
I went to change first.

968
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:19,484
Hey, that's charming. I like it.

969
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:24,055
(Final check before the guests)

970
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:26,824
(Nervous and excited)

971
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:32,063
(Korean cuisine in Sicily)

972
00:42:32,297 --> 00:42:34,999
(The Ryu-cipe spread is ready.)

973
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:39,370
Welcome. Come on.

974
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:42,272
- Hello.
- Hello.

975
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:43,941
(The first guest is fluent in Korean.)

976
00:42:43,942 --> 00:42:45,677
Welcome.

977
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:48,980
(The two daughters
of the Sicilian local meal master)

978
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:52,150
Bibimbap.

979
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:54,352
I like tteokbokki.

980
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,588
They really know their Korean food.

981
00:42:56,855 --> 00:42:59,824
(And surprisingly...)

982
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:05,329
(They even have a Korean
cultural heritage tattoo on their arms.)

983
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:08,466
We want to invite you.
Are you free tomorrow night?

984
00:43:09,133 --> 00:43:12,170
(First guests, Korea-loving sisters)

985
00:43:12,704 --> 00:43:14,571
(Welcome to the Ryu-cipe Night.)

986
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:16,107
Please take a seat. Thank you.

987
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:19,877
(Excited)

988
00:43:19,878 --> 00:43:22,045
We prepared all the dishes.

989
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:23,815
The three of you made all this?

990
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:25,183
- Of course.
- Yes.

991
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:29,087
The food looks delicious.

992
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:31,723
(In front of the boy's house)

993
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,560
(A man strides confidently
into the boy's place.)

994
00:43:40,465 --> 00:43:43,401
(Tonight's last guest)

995
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:48,206
(The first accommodation in Sicily
the boys stayed at)

996
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:51,876
(The owner of the accommodation
has been living in Sicily for 53 years.)

997
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:56,114
(Gave him a bowl
of Su Young's beef and radish soup)

998
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:58,916
Thank you. Is it for me?

999
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,651
Yes, it's for you.

1000
00:44:00,652 --> 00:44:04,322
(A Sicilian local got his first taste
of Korean cuisine thanks to the boys.)

1001
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:08,525
(Invited him to share
more Korean flavors with him.)

1002
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:09,660
Shall we eat?

1003
00:44:09,661 --> 00:44:11,563
(Time to dive into
the world of Korean cuisine)

1004
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:15,133
(Starting the meal with gimbap)

1005
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,969
(Starting with the best part,
the gimbap end slices)

1006
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:22,406
In Korea, we only give the end slices...

1007
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:23,875
to those we like.

1008
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:28,979
(Because we care,
one precious end piece each)

1009
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,717
It's quite nerve-racking,
but please feel free to comment.

1010
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:35,286
- Enjoy.
- Let's all dive in.

1011
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:39,224
It's my first time eating gimbap
with a fork.

1012
00:44:39,757 --> 00:44:41,326
We just use our hands in Korea.

1013
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,428
(Yes, gimbap
should be eaten with your hands.)

1014
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:46,030
Wow.

1015
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:55,472
(The first gimbap of his life)

1016
00:44:55,473 --> 00:44:58,376
Wow.

1017
00:44:59,944 --> 00:45:01,011
Is it good?

1018
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:04,749
It's delicious.

1019
00:45:04,816 --> 00:45:08,019
(So touched)

1020
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:12,757
The flavor is bursting inside my mouth.

1021
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:17,161
That's the charm of gimbap.

1022
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:18,962
I'm glad.

1023
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:22,733
(Korea-loving sisters
also try the gimbap.)

1024
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:26,237
It's more tasty because I get
different textures for each bite.

1025
00:45:27,105 --> 00:45:30,208
Thank you.

1026
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:33,677
The gimbap is perfect.

1027
00:45:33,678 --> 00:45:35,445
(In one bite)

1028
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:36,614
It's really good.

1029
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:38,683
Should we try the tteokbokki now?

1030
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,251
Yes, tteokbokki.

1031
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:42,753
It's tteokbokki,

1032
00:45:42,754 --> 00:45:46,924
but we couldn't find any tteok.

1033
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:49,793
So, this is actually pasta...

1034
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:53,263
made by a grandma
who makes pasta with her hands.

1035
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:57,834
I made this with the idea
of blending Korean and Italian flavors.

1036
00:45:57,835 --> 00:46:00,572
(A bold and fiery fusion
featuring K-spice)

1037
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,206
It's spicy.

1038
00:46:02,207 --> 00:46:04,374
Korean cuisine
tends to be on the spicier side.

1039
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,945
(K-spice presented
for the Sicilian guests)

1040
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:09,981
- This...
- This will be spicy.

1041
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:15,786
I think I can finish this no problem.

1042
00:46:15,787 --> 00:46:18,189
Really? Thank you.

1043
00:46:18,957 --> 00:46:22,993
I haven't tried every spicy dish in Korea,

1044
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:27,165
but I've tried some while I was in there,
so I think I'll be fine.

1045
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:29,200
Are you good with spice?

1046
00:46:29,901 --> 00:46:30,934
Really?

1047
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:32,569
I can handle spice.

1048
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:35,973
My wife loves to cook,

1049
00:46:35,974 --> 00:46:39,010
so I get to try a lot of spicy dishes.

1050
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:43,781
(He's a Sicilian local
but also a spice master?)

1051
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:51,022
(The sisters take on the K-spice
with confident.)

1052
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:54,859
(Are you really okay?)

1053
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:57,861
It's fine.

1054
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:59,496
- Really?
- Are you sure?

1055
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:01,466
- You're okay?
- Yes.

1056
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,001
I can handle this much spice.

1057
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:05,336
Really?

1058
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:10,808
It also has a sweet flavor,
so it's nice.

1059
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:13,478
(After proving their confidence,
the sisters enjoy the dish.)

1060
00:47:13,478 --> 00:47:14,879
(Cough)

1061
00:47:16,848 --> 00:47:17,982
(Cough)

1062
00:47:18,283 --> 00:47:21,352
(I'm a grown adult.)

1063
00:47:21,553 --> 00:47:23,153
Are you okay?

1064
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:24,254
It's spicy for me too.

1065
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:25,556
You don't have to eat it.

1066
00:47:25,557 --> 00:47:26,957
You've already finished your water.

1067
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:32,530
(One more bite)

1068
00:47:32,697 --> 00:47:33,697
(Phew)

1069
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:36,501
It's a bit spicy.

1070
00:47:36,901 --> 00:47:38,802
We have other dishes as well,
so take your time.

1071
00:47:38,803 --> 00:47:40,471
I'm okay.

1072
00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:44,676
(Sicilian tough guy? Exposed!)

1073
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:46,777
The main dish.

1074
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:47,898
It's time for the main dish.

1075
00:47:47,946 --> 00:47:49,714
(I hope this one's not spicy.)

1076
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:53,217
You want to put it on here?

1077
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:55,152
Yeah, here. Straight onto this?

1078
00:47:55,153 --> 00:47:56,153
Open it.

1079
00:47:56,154 --> 00:47:58,388
(It's finally time for Caponata Chicken.)

1080
00:47:58,389 --> 00:47:59,757
It's hot. Be careful.

1081
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:02,292
(Will the chicken be cooked?)

1082
00:48:02,293 --> 00:48:03,361
Be careful.

1083
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:09,000
(Looks amazing)

1084
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:10,301
(The highlight
of tonight's Ryu-cipe table)

1085
00:48:10,302 --> 00:48:11,869
Everyone,

1086
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:13,230
I present to you Caponata Chicken.

1087
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:16,307
(Rotisserie Chicken with Caponata
Caponata Chicken)

1088
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,509
It looks good.

1089
00:48:20,979 --> 00:48:24,048
(Perfectly cooked,
juicy and tender Caponata Chicken)

1090
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:27,919
It's so pretty.

1091
00:48:28,786 --> 00:48:29,853
Thank you.

1092
00:48:29,854 --> 00:48:32,856
Is caponata inside the chicken?

1093
00:48:32,857 --> 00:48:34,892
Yes, it was stuffed
inside the chicken,

1094
00:48:34,893 --> 00:48:37,561
so please enjoy them together.

1095
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:40,131
I contemplated on who to give
the drumsticks to since we only have two.

1096
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:41,232
Who should I give it to?

1097
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:44,034
(All in favor)

1098
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:46,170
(The first drumstick
goes to the first daughter.)

1099
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:48,306
(I want the drumstick, please.)

1100
00:48:49,474 --> 00:48:51,342
They like drumsticks here too, huh?

1101
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:56,480
I'll give you one each.

1102
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:58,348
(The drumsticks go to the ladies.)

1103
00:48:58,349 --> 00:48:59,450
It looks so good.

1104
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:07,659
(Don't forget the stuffed caponata.)

1105
00:49:08,993 --> 00:49:11,353
We're also super curious
because we haven't tried it either.

1106
00:49:11,796 --> 00:49:13,565
Is there a dish where you stuff
the chicken with caponata?

1107
00:49:13,565 --> 00:49:15,365
No.

1108
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:18,136
We only have it as a side dish.

1109
00:49:18,603 --> 00:49:21,638
Then he was the first one
to stuff the chicken...

1110
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,174
with caponata, right?

1111
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:25,042
Right.

1112
00:49:25,043 --> 00:49:26,110
If it's good, that's all that matters.

1113
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,478
It's the first time for all of us here.

1114
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:30,548
Let's go on a journey of new flavors.

1115
00:49:33,618 --> 00:49:34,886
It smells nice.

1116
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:38,323
It's very soft.

1117
00:49:38,356 --> 00:49:40,057
The meat is very soft.

1118
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:41,159
Nice.

1119
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:48,466
(Healthy and juicy oven-baked chicken
with none of that grease)

1120
00:49:49,801 --> 00:49:53,137
(Su Young also tries a bit
with caponata.)

1121
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:55,707
Why is it so good?

1122
00:49:56,574 --> 00:49:57,942
It's really good. Try it.

1123
00:49:58,943 --> 00:50:00,277
- Kyung Ho.
- Yeah?

1124
00:50:00,278 --> 00:50:01,412
How is it so soft?

1125
00:50:01,646 --> 00:50:03,982
The oven did all that.

1126
00:50:04,883 --> 00:50:06,283
It's very delicious.

1127
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:07,618
Kyung Ho, the meat is so tender.

1128
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:09,653
It's not easy, right?
I'll do it for you.

1129
00:50:09,654 --> 00:50:10,889
I think I'll bring out some beer.

1130
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:12,789
Yeah, let's all have a glass of beer.

1131
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,093
In Korea,
you always have beer with chicken.

1132
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:18,730
Lots of people have beer
when eating chicken.

1133
00:50:18,796 --> 00:50:19,963
- Want me to do it?
- Yeah.

1134
00:50:19,964 --> 00:50:21,404
Do you like ssomaek (soju and beer)?

1135
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:23,201
(Of course)

1136
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:34,946
Here you go.

1137
00:50:36,848 --> 00:50:39,750
We do say, "Cheers" too,

1138
00:50:39,751 --> 00:50:41,585
but we say, "For us!" more often.

1139
00:50:41,586 --> 00:50:44,355
- For us!
- For us!

1140
00:50:45,423 --> 00:50:47,090
For us!

1141
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:48,993
(For this Ryu-cipe Night!)

1142
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,296
It's delicious.

1143
00:50:54,832 --> 00:50:59,970
It goes so well with the food.

1144
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:02,106
Yeah.

1145
00:51:02,507 --> 00:51:04,942
How long were you in Korea for?

1146
00:51:04,943 --> 00:51:06,977
We were there for two weeks.

1147
00:51:06,978 --> 00:51:09,047
You were there for a while.

1148
00:51:10,048 --> 00:51:11,949
We visited many different places.

1149
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,250
Where did you go?

1150
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:15,219
Seoul.

1151
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,487
Suwon.

1152
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:19,790
Jeonju.

1153
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,491
Busan.

1154
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:23,093
Gyeongju.

1155
00:51:23,094 --> 00:51:24,728
You've been to it all.

1156
00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:26,598
(Sounds like a tour of Korea)

1157
00:51:27,031 --> 00:51:30,200
While you were in Korea for two weeks,

1158
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:33,370
which Korean dish was the most memorable?

1159
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:35,172
- Bibimbap.
- Yeah?

1160
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:36,173
And?

1161
00:51:36,174 --> 00:51:40,777
For me, gimbap and everything else I had.

1162
00:51:40,778 --> 00:51:43,448
Plus, chicken.

1163
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:45,483
Did you have the bibimbap in Jeonju?

1164
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:47,685
(Bibimbap is a must in Jeonju!
These sisters know how to eat.)

1165
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:49,920
- They did it properly.
- Yeah.

1166
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:53,490
We ate it
at a very traditional restaurant.

1167
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:56,060
Looks like you did your homework on Korea
before going to visit.

1168
00:51:56,494 --> 00:51:58,296
(Right, yes.)

1169
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:01,266
Are we getting a bit full?

1170
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:02,600
We're full.

1171
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:04,268
But...

1172
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:06,137
we always have room for dessert, right?

1173
00:52:06,404 --> 00:52:08,006
Of course.

1174
00:52:09,908 --> 00:52:13,710
(The finale of tonight!
Pistachio tiramisu)

1175
00:52:13,711 --> 00:52:14,946
They're loving it the most.

1176
00:52:15,146 --> 00:52:16,915
My favorite dessert is tiramisu.

1177
00:52:18,516 --> 00:52:20,317
Tiramisu.

1178
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:23,453
It's so pretty.
Look at the bottom too.

1179
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:24,589
Look how pretty.

1180
00:52:27,025 --> 00:52:30,094
(Oh, our silly Kihyun)

1181
00:52:31,429 --> 00:52:32,763
You must feel bad to cut into it.

1182
00:52:32,764 --> 00:52:33,831
Right?

1183
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:39,603
(A slice of handmade tiramisu,
filled with Kihyun's love)

1184
00:52:39,604 --> 00:52:41,372
Thank you.

1185
00:52:42,974 --> 00:52:46,911
It's amazing that you've sprinkled
Sicily's pistachio on top.

1186
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:50,148
(Kihyun tries it first.)

1187
00:52:53,418 --> 00:52:55,220
(Dig in)

1188
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,555
It's so delicious. Try it.

1189
00:52:58,189 --> 00:52:59,890
But you made it. You can't say that.

1190
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:01,693
Be humble.

1191
00:53:03,027 --> 00:53:07,532
(There's no need
to be humble for this one.)

1192
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:12,637
(Will it suit the taste of Italian guests
from the home of tiramisu?)

1193
00:53:15,707 --> 00:53:18,443
She says this means buonissimo.

1194
00:53:18,943 --> 00:53:21,980
(Buonissimo)

1195
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:24,048
I can finish this in one sitting.

1196
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:27,684
It's his first tiramisu,
so how good could it be?

1197
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:28,785
Shall I try it?

1198
00:53:28,786 --> 00:53:30,722
(It can't be that good.)

1199
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:34,658
(Fork drop)

1200
00:53:34,659 --> 00:53:36,260
- I'm so surprised.
- Good job.

1201
00:53:36,261 --> 00:53:37,729
I'm glad.

1202
00:53:38,196 --> 00:53:39,230
It's tasty.

1203
00:53:40,331 --> 00:53:43,000
Whipping the meringue was not easy.

1204
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:47,405
I whipped it until it stayed in the bowl
even when I flipped it.

1205
00:53:47,805 --> 00:53:51,309
It really didn't fall
even when you flipped it?

1206
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:53,343
He showed me with confidence.

1207
00:53:53,344 --> 00:53:54,979
He called me and did this.

1208
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,384
(Kihyun worked hard
to whip the meringue for the guests.)

1209
00:53:59,551 --> 00:54:00,685
Kyung Ho, look.

1210
00:54:01,152 --> 00:54:02,654
(Certified by Kyung Ho,
Kihyun's perfectly whipped meringue)

1211
00:54:02,654 --> 00:54:04,489
- Good job.
- It's done.

1212
00:54:05,023 --> 00:54:08,425
Most of the dishes we made today,
we made them for the first time,

1213
00:54:08,426 --> 00:54:10,327
but I think this one
was the most successful.

1214
00:54:10,328 --> 00:54:13,031
(Nailed the tiramisu!)

1215
00:54:13,231 --> 00:54:14,432
And I want to ask you something.

1216
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:17,402
What does pasta mean to Italians?

1217
00:54:18,036 --> 00:54:19,069
I was curious.

1218
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,805
Pasta?

1219
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,509
Pasta is like
the foundation of your house.

1220
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,344
Italian cuisine...

1221
00:54:27,345 --> 00:54:31,815
starts with pasta.

1222
00:54:31,816 --> 00:54:32,884
Foundation?

1223
00:54:33,017 --> 00:54:34,618
There's something I want to try.

1224
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:35,753
Should we try it right now?

1225
00:54:35,887 --> 00:54:37,120
I've been curious.

1226
00:54:37,121 --> 00:54:38,623
I've seen it a lot on the internet.

1227
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:40,090
(Confused)

1228
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:41,960
There's a video of it.

1229
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,660
Where is it? One second.

1230
00:54:43,661 --> 00:54:45,162
(Suddenly looking for something?)

1231
00:54:45,163 --> 00:54:46,997
- Where is it?
- This?

1232
00:54:46,998 --> 00:54:48,966
Here it is. I found it.

1233
00:54:48,967 --> 00:54:52,669
I saw this video on the internet,
and I was curious.

1234
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,138
I know I shouldn't do this, but...

1235
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:57,742
(Pasta?)

1236
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:03,981
How does it feel if I do this?

1237
00:55:03,982 --> 00:55:05,984
(No)

1238
00:55:08,453 --> 00:55:10,754
(Breaking pasta
is unacceptable for Italians.)

1239
00:55:10,755 --> 00:55:11,788
Really?

1240
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:13,892
(Never)

1241
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:16,293
There are things you do,
and things you just don't.

1242
00:55:16,294 --> 00:55:17,574
(Su Young has crossed the line.)

1243
00:55:17,629 --> 00:55:20,298
(I will never break pasta.)

1244
00:55:27,272 --> 00:55:30,942
"Our friendship almost ended."

1245
00:55:31,776 --> 00:55:33,443
It's really a no-no.

1246
00:55:33,444 --> 00:55:34,778
It was real.

1247
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:36,713
I'm sorry.

1248
00:55:36,714 --> 00:55:38,348
They're mad right now.

1249
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:39,850
(We'll let it slide this time.)

1250
00:55:39,851 --> 00:55:42,185
That's why Kihyun prepared
an Italian song...

1251
00:55:42,186 --> 00:55:44,388
despite having his own songs.

1252
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:45,622
- Me?
- Yes.

1253
00:55:45,623 --> 00:55:46,691
(Had no idea)

1254
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:51,696
(Applause started
before he could even process it.)

1255
00:55:53,398 --> 00:55:55,066
<i>Volare</i>

1256
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,337
(Kihyun the elite youngest
never says no.)

1257
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:03,575
(As if to celebrate the boy's successful
Ryu-cipe Night...)

1258
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:07,477
(Sicily's night slowly fills
with everyone's singing.)

1259
00:56:07,478 --> 00:56:08,880
That's all I know.

1260
00:56:10,982 --> 00:56:12,282
I really wanted to try this one.

1261
00:56:12,283 --> 00:56:15,719
This still smells amazing.

1262
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,921
It's insane.

1263
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:19,057
The smell is insane.

1264
00:56:19,357 --> 00:56:21,191
The aroma...

1265
00:56:21,192 --> 00:56:22,293
I'm hungry.

1266
00:56:23,061 --> 00:56:27,097
Batter it, fry it, then use the same sauce
and make the popcorn.

1267
00:56:27,098 --> 00:56:28,999
This is a generous portion.

1268
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,568
(Su Young's Pick
Popcorn Squid)

1269
00:56:31,035 --> 00:56:34,105
(A bite of juicy squid)

1270
00:56:38,676 --> 00:56:40,712
(Yes, this is it.)

1271
00:56:41,546 --> 00:56:43,281
It's that same shock all over again.

1272
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:44,915
I'm getting upset.

1273
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:46,383
This is it.

1274
00:56:46,384 --> 00:56:47,451
It's delicious.

1275
00:56:47,452 --> 00:56:49,486
The sauce is key here.

1276
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:50,521
I feel like you could...

1277
00:56:50,522 --> 00:56:53,023
use this sauce for anything
like chicken or...

1278
00:56:53,024 --> 00:56:54,392
(Popcorn squid's kick 2. Popcorn coating)

1279
00:56:54,392 --> 00:56:56,527
- You must drizzle some lemon juice.
- That's a must.

1280
00:56:56,528 --> 00:56:58,829
That acidity from the lemon juice
is really nice.

1281
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,632
You always want popcorn
when you're at a theater.

1282
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:02,065
This flavor would really sell well.

1283
00:57:02,066 --> 00:57:04,168
Megabox, CGV, please call me.

1284
00:57:05,036 --> 00:57:06,170
We're ready.

1285
00:57:06,638 --> 00:57:08,839
Caponata chicken.

1286
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,775
It has eggplants in it,
so it's eggplant caponata chicken.

1287
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:13,277
Half of a chicken.

1288
00:57:13,278 --> 00:57:14,278
It smells insane.

1289
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,149
(Must use your hand for chicken)

1290
00:57:19,784 --> 00:57:21,085
- Hey.
- Yeah?

1291
00:57:21,386 --> 00:57:23,821
Sir, this is very delicious.

1292
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:25,789
- It's good.
- It's really good.

1293
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:26,925
What is this?

1294
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:29,393
This is totally Italian.

1295
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:31,028
This is the taste I wanted.

1296
00:57:31,029 --> 00:57:33,463
- That subtle spiciness is so nice.
- Right?

1297
00:57:33,464 --> 00:57:35,098
The chicken's cooked to perfection too.

1298
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:36,466
Was this cooked sous vide?

1299
00:57:36,467 --> 00:57:37,735
It goes really well with the caponata.

1300
00:57:37,735 --> 00:57:39,170
They complements each other so well.

1301
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:40,738
It's exactly like the caponata
we had in Italy.

1302
00:57:40,738 --> 00:57:42,206
While eating this,

1303
00:57:42,207 --> 00:57:44,242
have pieces of this in between.
It's like you're eating pickles.

1304
00:57:44,242 --> 00:57:47,744
There's nothing similar in Korea.

1305
00:57:47,745 --> 00:57:49,146
I don't know what to say.

1306
00:57:49,147 --> 00:57:50,180
There's nothing similar.

1307
00:57:50,181 --> 00:57:52,482
For us Koreans who love chicken,

1308
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:54,123
this is a new flavor everyone would love.

1309
00:57:54,185 --> 00:57:56,553
- We need to try Kihyun's dish too.
- Dessert.

1310
00:57:56,554 --> 00:57:58,822
Tiramisu with pistachio.

1311
00:57:58,823 --> 00:58:02,092
But the pistachio on top
was caramelized.

1312
00:58:02,093 --> 00:58:03,228
(Pistachio coated in caramel)

1313
00:58:03,228 --> 00:58:05,562
This is incredible.

1314
00:58:05,563 --> 00:58:07,165
(Kihyun's Pick
Caramel Pistachio Tramisu)

1315
00:58:07,232 --> 00:58:09,967
As soon as I put my spoon in,
my mouth is watering.

1316
00:58:09,968 --> 00:58:11,869
(Watch out mukbang creators!)

1317
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,270
You've got to enjoy this
with your eyes too while tasting it.

1318
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:16,713
You have to get all the layers.

1319
00:58:19,344 --> 00:58:20,644
- It's rich.
- Yes.

1320
00:58:20,645 --> 00:58:21,713
(An irresistible sweetness
that melts the boy's hearts)

1321
00:58:21,713 --> 00:58:22,780
It's delicious.

1322
00:58:23,181 --> 00:58:24,948
Eating tiramisu really makes you happy.

1323
00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:26,316
Yeah, it brings you up.

1324
00:58:26,317 --> 00:58:28,619
(The tiramisu makes you happy.)

1325
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,420
When it gets too sweet...

1326
00:58:30,421 --> 00:58:31,588
(A special dish from Sicily)

1327
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:33,224
Take sips of this granita.

1328
00:58:38,229 --> 00:58:39,130
(A special dessert to fight the heat)

1329
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:40,531
It's perfect today.

1330
00:58:40,532 --> 00:58:41,832
Sicily's specialty.

1331
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:44,067
Blood orange granita.

1332
00:58:44,068 --> 00:58:45,469
Cheers.

1333
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:48,273
(For Sicily pop-up!)

1334
00:58:51,442 --> 00:58:53,043
(Electrifying)

1335
00:58:53,044 --> 00:58:54,712
The one we had
on Mount Etna was different.

1336
00:58:54,712 --> 00:58:55,879
It didn't taste like this.

1337
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,281
This tastes much better.

1338
00:58:57,282 --> 00:58:59,283
This is pure vitamin C.

1339
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:00,718
- It's good, though.
- It's delicious.

1340
00:59:00,718 --> 00:59:03,620
Is there only orange in here?
Orange? Grapefruit?

1341
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:05,657
- Blood orange.
- Blood orange.

1342
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:09,294
From now on,
my favorite fruit is blood orange.

1343
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:12,430
I'm excited to see
how people will react to this today.

1344
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:14,566
It will be worth coming to taste these.

1345
00:59:14,566 --> 00:59:17,168
(Let's go spread the flavors of Sicily.)

1346
00:59:17,569 --> 00:59:19,102
We're five minutes from opening.

1347
00:59:19,103 --> 00:59:20,743
(It's 5 minutes until the Sicily pop-up.)

1348
00:59:20,805 --> 00:59:22,105
Shall we pick up the pace?

1349
00:59:22,106 --> 00:59:24,175
(Opening time is just around the corner.)

1350
00:59:24,242 --> 00:59:25,609
I did two scoops.

1351
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,312
Two scoops were too much
when I had it earlier.

1352
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:30,013
(For their third pop-up,
the boys are smooth and skillful.)

1353
00:59:30,014 --> 00:59:31,816
- Two scoops each, right?
- Yes.

1354
00:59:33,084 --> 00:59:35,319
There are more than 1,000 people
here today, so...

1355
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,655
- Crazy.
- That's insane.

1356
00:59:38,323 --> 00:59:40,057
That's a lot of people.

1357
00:59:40,058 --> 00:59:41,292
(1,000 people are waiting right now?)

1358
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:44,229
(Porto pop-up had 400 people.)

1359
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:47,232
(Brunei pop-up had 600 people.)

1360
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:52,637
After Kihyun's concert,
it going to be 10,000 people waiting.

1361
00:59:55,173 --> 00:59:56,674
That line is unbelievable.

1362
00:59:57,542 --> 01:00:01,346
(The pop-up is open.)

1363
01:00:02,013 --> 01:00:03,280
Hello.

1364
01:00:03,281 --> 01:00:05,617
(Amid the biggest crowd yet,
they still take time to say hello.)

1365
01:00:05,617 --> 01:00:08,653
(Nice to meet you.)

1366
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,221
What's up?

1367
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:13,057
I got here early in the morning today.

1368
01:00:13,324 --> 01:00:15,293
You came at 1:30 in the morning? Really?

1369
01:00:16,361 --> 01:00:17,594
I came from Jeju-do!

1370
01:00:17,595 --> 01:00:19,397
You're from Jeju? Thank you.

1371
01:00:19,764 --> 01:00:21,665
- I'm from China.
- Really?

1372
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:22,933
Indonesia?

1373
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:24,501
Malaysia?

1374
01:00:24,502 --> 01:00:26,104
Canada? Welcome.

1375
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:29,006
You came again.

1376
01:00:29,007 --> 01:00:30,708
- You remember me?
- Of course.

1377
01:00:31,776 --> 01:00:33,610
- Let's take a selfie together.
- Sure.

1378
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:34,945
It's your second time, so two.

1379
01:00:34,946 --> 01:00:36,047
(Kyung Ho remembers the fans
who came back for another visit.)

1380
01:00:36,047 --> 01:00:37,214
Thank you.

1381
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:39,283
- I'm here again.
- Thanks for coming.

1382
01:00:39,284 --> 01:00:41,451
- From 7 a.m.
- I was waiting for you.

1383
01:00:41,452 --> 01:00:43,854
- That's why I came.
- I'm glad.

1384
01:00:43,855 --> 01:00:44,922
Welcome.

1385
01:00:44,923 --> 01:00:46,324
(Another day, another round of promotions)

1386
01:00:46,324 --> 01:00:49,027
You came from so far.
So early in the morning.

1387
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,494
What are you going to get?

1388
01:00:50,495 --> 01:00:51,863
Could you recommend me one?

1389
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:55,699
We have put our souls
into this last pop-up.

1390
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,569
The popcorn is really good.

1391
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,337
The popcorn squid is insane.

1392
01:01:00,338 --> 01:01:03,874
For the caponata chicken, the sauce
will be something you've never had.

1393
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:08,111
Then, for the finale, have the tiramisu
with the granita.

1394
01:01:08,112 --> 01:01:09,947
You must try the granita.

1395
01:01:09,948 --> 01:01:11,748
So, everyone,

1396
01:01:11,749 --> 01:01:14,252
I seriously recommend
all the dishes today.

1397
01:01:14,886 --> 01:01:16,321
Popcorn squid? Nice.

1398
01:01:18,556 --> 01:01:20,023
Is this working right now?

1399
01:01:20,024 --> 01:01:21,091
Yes, it's working.

1400
01:01:21,092 --> 01:01:22,593
There's no lemon in this.

1401
01:01:22,594 --> 01:01:23,862
(Ryu-GPT is checking the inventory.)

1402
01:01:23,862 --> 01:01:25,096
I'll pick up the pace.

1403
01:01:25,763 --> 01:01:30,001
(All the Ryu-cipe dishes need
to go through Su Young to be finished.)

1404
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:32,569
Everything's selling well today.

1405
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:33,872
We have the most people today.

1406
01:01:35,506 --> 01:01:38,810
(Fans are calling Kihyun from everywhere.)

1407
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:40,210
Kihyun.

1408
01:01:40,211 --> 01:01:42,614
(Welcome, everyone.)

1409
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:45,984
(Elite youngest's elite dancing
to welcome the fans)

1410
01:01:47,118 --> 01:01:50,454
(Professional idol moment)

1411
01:01:50,455 --> 01:01:52,756
Let's start moving.

1412
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:54,025
Let's move, everyone.

1413
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:59,030
(With 1,000 people waiting in line,
the order keeps coming in.)

1414
01:01:59,397 --> 01:02:00,731
There's no more popcorn squid.

1415
01:02:00,732 --> 01:02:02,834
I want the squid.

1416
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:05,168
Is the squid sold out?

1417
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:06,738
(Popcorn squid is sold out?)

1418
01:02:06,938 --> 01:02:08,839
We can't keep up with the orders.

1419
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,240
Guys,

1420
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:12,577
there are people who can't get the squid
because we don't have any.

1421
01:02:12,577 --> 01:02:14,579
(Out of inventory)

1422
01:02:14,946 --> 01:02:16,380
We'll be quick with the squid.

1423
01:02:16,381 --> 01:02:18,816
- We're doing it.
- It's sold out. Wait. I'm sorry.

1424
01:02:19,117 --> 01:02:21,184
- One moment.
- Yeah, we'll be quick.

1425
01:02:21,185 --> 01:02:23,121
- Put it in here quickly.
- We need to be quick.

1426
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:25,422
The chicken's sold out too?

1427
01:02:25,423 --> 01:02:26,424
(Each dish gone in seconds,
thanks to the record-breaking turnout.)

1428
01:02:26,424 --> 01:02:28,264
We keep making them,
and they keep selling out.

1429
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,994
(Lots of fans
are going back with empty hands.)

1430
01:02:29,994 --> 01:02:31,795
- This was sold out.
- I'm sorry.

1431
01:02:31,796 --> 01:02:33,764
- Okay.
- Today's dishes are the tastiest.

1432
01:02:33,765 --> 01:02:35,866
(Maybe just this...)

1433
01:02:35,867 --> 01:02:37,901
- Since it was sold out.
- Just have a taste of it.

1434
01:02:37,902 --> 01:02:39,502
They can't have it even if they want to.

1435
01:02:39,904 --> 01:02:43,041
(Super viral pop-up store)

1436
01:02:43,374 --> 01:02:46,411
(What was people's top pick?)

1437
01:02:46,578 --> 01:02:49,980
I tried the Ryu-cipe dishes
during the last pop-up,

1438
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:51,515
and it was so good.

1439
01:02:51,516 --> 01:02:54,219
I was the most curious about the tiramisu
and the popcorn squid.

1440
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:56,587
I'm most excited about the tiramisu
Kihyun made.

1441
01:02:56,588 --> 01:02:58,522
I was craving something tangy,

1442
01:02:58,523 --> 01:03:01,025
so I want to cry the caponata chicken.

1443
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:03,760
The squid, the popcorn squid.

1444
01:03:03,761 --> 01:03:07,064
It's so good.
It's too good to swallow it.

1445
01:03:07,065 --> 01:03:12,503
It's sweet, savory, and tangy.
It has all the flavors.

1446
01:03:13,004 --> 01:03:15,372
Let's review
Mr. Eo's Food World Tour recipes.

1447
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:16,640
For today, it's really simple.

1448
01:03:16,641 --> 01:03:17,808
It's not even really cooking.

1449
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:18,910
You're just putting things together.

1450
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:21,211
It's popcorn squid from Sicily.

1451
01:03:21,212 --> 01:03:23,146
It's super simple and easy.

1452
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:24,315
Plus, it tastes amazing.

1453
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,617
You just need popcorn and squid.

1454
01:03:26,618 --> 01:03:28,252
Corn kernels for popcorn.

1455
01:03:28,253 --> 01:03:29,287
It's really cheap.

1456
01:03:29,587 --> 01:03:32,756
This amount of kernel will probably
give you a crazy amount of popcorn.

1457
01:03:32,757 --> 01:03:34,092
Maybe about this much.

1458
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:37,128
Hi, Bixby, do we have squid in the fridge?

1459
01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:40,297
Yes, we do.

1460
01:03:40,298 --> 01:03:41,618
(Mr. E goes to catch some squid.)

1461
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:44,269
Use the ones
that have been cleaned already.

1462
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:45,769
Mayonnaise.

1463
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:47,704
And some tuna sauce
will make it stick more.

1464
01:03:47,705 --> 01:03:49,574
That's it for ingredients.

1465
01:03:50,775 --> 01:03:53,644
Just clean the squid with some water.

1466
01:03:53,645 --> 01:03:55,045
Just slice the squid.

1467
01:03:55,046 --> 01:03:56,246
Straight, like this.

1468
01:03:56,247 --> 01:03:59,484
(2. Slice the squid into longer pieces.)

1469
01:03:59,584 --> 01:04:00,685
Frying powder.

1470
01:04:01,553 --> 01:04:05,056
Mix it with some starch
to make it crispier.

1471
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,858
Add some black pepper if you have some.

1472
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:10,395
(4. Add some black pepper and mix well.)

1473
01:04:10,628 --> 01:04:12,397
Add it in here.

1474
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:14,432
In it goes.

1475
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:16,667
So that it's evenly coated.

1476
01:04:16,668 --> 01:04:18,403
(5. Evenly coat the squid
with the batter.)

1477
01:04:19,537 --> 01:04:20,872
Let's make the popcorn first.

1478
01:04:20,939 --> 01:04:22,073
(Add just enough
to lightly cover the bottom of the pan.)

1479
01:04:22,073 --> 01:04:23,841
Don't get greedy from the start.

1480
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,644
Time to add some salt.

1481
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:30,380
One, two, three pinches.

1482
01:04:30,381 --> 01:04:31,682
Add some oil.

1483
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:32,916
So that it covers the bottom.

1484
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:34,585
Now, time for it to pop.

1485
01:04:34,586 --> 01:04:35,620
(Pop)

1486
01:04:36,487 --> 01:04:37,487
(Nomnom)

1487
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:40,658
(This sound is coming from the oil
and every mom's stress popping.)

1488
01:04:40,658 --> 01:04:44,062
(For dads, it's a joyful festival
of pops and crackles.)

1489
01:04:45,263 --> 01:04:46,331
I caught one.

1490
01:04:46,598 --> 01:04:48,333
(Hurried)

1491
01:04:48,766 --> 01:04:50,435
You'll get in lots of trouble.

1492
01:04:51,202 --> 01:04:52,437
It's going crazy.

1493
01:04:54,405 --> 01:04:57,008
(Thinking about popcorn
is making Mr. Eo excited.)

1494
01:04:57,242 --> 01:04:58,408
Hi, Bixby,

1495
01:04:58,409 --> 01:05:00,545
play a fun song for me.

1496
01:05:02,847 --> 01:05:05,583
"80 Dance Hits
to Keep You Moving All Day."

1497
01:05:07,385 --> 01:05:08,853
What song is this?

1498
01:05:09,854 --> 01:05:11,656
It's like an old song.

1499
01:05:12,624 --> 01:05:14,125
This song is too old.

1500
01:05:14,859 --> 01:05:15,894
What song is this?

1501
01:05:17,228 --> 01:05:18,729
Country Kkokko's <i>Kiss</i>?

1502
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:19,764
Hey, this...

1503
01:05:23,401 --> 01:05:24,836
No, this is...

1504
01:05:25,136 --> 01:05:26,437
(My brain says no,
but my body keeps moving.)

1505
01:05:26,437 --> 01:05:27,938
Why is my body moving?

1506
01:05:27,939 --> 01:05:29,439
Your body just moves.

1507
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,741
Wait… what am I even doing?

1508
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:31,743
Turn it off.

1509
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:35,146
(After a dance session, popcorn is done.)

1510
01:05:35,313 --> 01:05:36,981
It's all popped.

1511
01:05:37,382 --> 01:05:38,415
All the kernels.

1512
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:39,449
It makes you feel good.

1513
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,252
(Back to making popcorn squid.

1514
01:05:41,352 --> 01:05:44,155
(6. Blend the popcorn in the mixer.)

1515
01:05:44,322 --> 01:05:45,422
Don't make it too fine.

1516
01:05:45,423 --> 01:05:46,524
It needs to be rough.

1517
01:05:46,925 --> 01:05:49,127
Now, we just need to fry the squid.

1518
01:05:49,427 --> 01:05:51,562
(7. Fry the battered squid in oil.)

1519
01:05:51,563 --> 01:05:53,665
Fried squid is always good.

1520
01:05:54,065 --> 01:05:55,199
Squid cooks really fast.

1521
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,501
Just the batter needs to cook.

1522
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,241
It's become crispy.

1523
01:06:03,741 --> 01:06:06,477
(Mr. Eo takes out the fried squid.)

1524
01:06:06,744 --> 01:06:09,280
When you add mayo and tuna sauce,
it feels like a proper dish.

1525
01:06:09,914 --> 01:06:10,914
Mix it.

1526
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:13,251
(Mixing)

1527
01:06:13,618 --> 01:06:15,386
It's a dish no one has imagined before.

1528
01:06:16,187 --> 01:06:18,823
If you've only had fried squid,
this will open new doors for you.

1529
01:06:19,257 --> 01:06:20,691
It's at another level.

1530
01:06:20,692 --> 01:06:22,594
(When popcorn meets squid,
magic happens.)

1531
01:06:22,927 --> 01:06:24,229
Hey, look at this.

1532
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:26,598
I can't believe there's no beer.

1533
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:30,602
(The signature frown
that only appears when it's really good.)

1534
01:06:30,602 --> 01:06:31,703
This is really delicious.

1535
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:33,403
Easy, right?

1536
01:06:33,404 --> 01:06:35,340
Try making this at home. It's good.

1537
01:06:36,207 --> 01:06:37,207
Eat.

1538
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:38,275
Learn.

1539
01:06:38,276 --> 01:06:39,476
Execute.

1540
01:06:39,477 --> 01:06:41,779
(The study abroad notebook
they've kept since day one.)

1541
01:06:42,213 --> 01:06:46,417
(Whenever, whereever,
the boys always took notes.)

1542
01:06:47,118 --> 01:06:52,090
(Over 100 pages of study abroad notes,
written by the three boys)

1543
01:06:52,857 --> 01:06:55,927
(35 Ryu-cipes made every night)

1544
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:59,530
(Q. Do you remember "A message
to myself after studying abroad"?)

1545
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:01,499
What did I say?

1546
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:02,900
"Good work."

1547
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:04,102
That was arrogant.

1548
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:06,169
I've still got a long way to go.

1549
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,472
I'm nowhere near...

1550
01:07:07,805 --> 01:07:11,141
(You did more than just the dishes, right?
I'm rooting for you!)

1551
01:07:11,142 --> 01:07:13,511
I've turned everything upside down.

1552
01:07:14,112 --> 01:07:16,032
- It was successful?
- Totally. Super successful.

1553
01:07:16,548 --> 01:07:18,383
Good work. You've improved a lot.

1554
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:20,817
I really worked hard.

1555
01:07:20,818 --> 01:07:21,986
(Good work on creating new recipes.
Hope the three of us keep in touch!)

1556
01:07:21,986 --> 01:07:24,756
I'm thankful to my old self.

1557
01:07:26,057 --> 01:07:28,926
I started with a mindset of,
"Let's be a confident dad!"

1558
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:32,563
But when I opened that fridge,
memories sucked me in,

1559
01:07:32,564 --> 01:07:34,265
and I was reminded of the past.

1560
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:37,669
Give me a minute.
I might get emotional here.

1561
01:07:38,036 --> 01:07:39,403
But this...

1562
01:07:39,404 --> 01:07:41,172
I don't think I'll ever forget this.

1563
01:07:41,906 --> 01:07:45,909
When would I be able to go
to a restaurant, try their food,

1564
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:49,647
and be able to talk to the master
or listen to their stories?

1565
01:07:50,148 --> 01:07:51,849
That was a priceless experience.

1566
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:55,052
In the end, only the photos remain.

1567
01:07:55,053 --> 01:07:56,888
(And the moments of their study abroad,
captured by the three boys.)

1568
01:07:56,888 --> 01:07:59,389
(Happy because they were together)

1569
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:02,026
(Precious memories of studying abroad)

1570
01:08:02,293 --> 01:08:06,163
I knew I would be relying
on Su Young a lot,

1571
01:08:06,164 --> 01:08:10,534
but he was way sturdier
and more reliable than I thought.

1572
01:08:10,535 --> 01:08:13,704
Even Kyung Ho was a dark horse.

1573
01:08:13,705 --> 01:08:17,041
I want to say thank you
to Su Young and Kyung Ho.

1574
01:08:17,909 --> 01:08:20,845
(Reliable Su Young
and dark horse Kyung Ho)

1575
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:23,247
It was enjoyable.

1576
01:08:23,248 --> 01:08:24,848
I leaned on them a lot.

1577
01:08:24,849 --> 01:08:29,353
I feel like Kihyun had the hardest time...

1578
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:31,756
because he had to take care of
me and Su Young.

1579
01:08:32,991 --> 01:08:36,661
(We may look silly,
but we're nice friends.)

1580
01:08:37,228 --> 01:08:40,330
(The boys made me do it,
acrobatics, elite youngest)

1581
01:08:40,331 --> 01:08:42,633
I want to pat everyone on their back.

1582
01:08:42,634 --> 01:08:45,203
And that they were the ones
who kept me going.

1583
01:08:46,104 --> 01:08:49,506
(It wasn't always easy, but having
each other made it all worthwhile.)

1584
01:08:49,507 --> 01:08:51,675
I've never seen anyone work this hard.

1585
01:08:51,676 --> 01:08:53,677
I've cooked with them and all,

1586
01:08:53,678 --> 01:08:55,480
but I've never seen anyone work this hard.

1587
01:08:56,681 --> 01:08:58,682
(Hardworking boys)

1588
01:08:58,683 --> 01:09:01,552
Cooking is hard
when you're starting with no knowledge.

1589
01:09:01,553 --> 01:09:03,987
What's important is that
they're more passionate now.

1590
01:09:03,988 --> 01:09:05,222
That means...

1591
01:09:05,223 --> 01:09:07,424
It means there's now much more room
for growth.

1592
01:09:07,425 --> 01:09:10,194
Did they get to love cooking?

1593
01:09:10,195 --> 01:09:11,362
Do they like it now?

1594
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,330
That's what I thought about.

1595
01:09:13,331 --> 01:09:14,699
(The boys who grew to love cooking)

1596
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:16,601
Su Young, aren't we having too much fun?

1597
01:09:16,901 --> 01:09:18,169
It's the first day.

1598
01:09:18,736 --> 01:09:21,673
Eat, learn, and execute.

1599
01:09:21,973 --> 01:09:24,609
(Our motto from the moment we first met)

1600
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:30,748
(The boys always shouted the motto
every time they moved to a new location.)

1601
01:09:31,182 --> 01:09:33,817
When you're feeling good,
it tastes good.

1602
01:09:33,818 --> 01:09:36,987
It'll be really delicious,
no matter what we make or learn.

1603
01:09:36,988 --> 01:09:38,068
(Eat, learn, execute!
The trio's passion for cooking lives on.)
