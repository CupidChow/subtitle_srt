1
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:12,492
(The three boys have arrived in Rome.)

2
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:14,895
The most renowned city
for over a thousand years.

3
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:20,034
(Kihyun arrives first and starts exploring
heritage sites from his bucket list.)

4
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:22,570
(A selfie is a must.)

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,708
(Su Young and Kyung Ho visit
Rome's sacred St. Peter's Basilica.)

6
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:30,194
(St. Peter's Basilica)

7
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:33,346
(The largest basilica in the world,
and a UNESCO World Heritage site)

8
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:39,920
(Designed by legendary architects
like Raphael and Michelangelo)

9
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:43,390
(A breathtaking sight
you can’t look away from)

10
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,194
(The essence of Italy, pizza)

11
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:50,331
(The authentic taste of Italy)

12
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:57,171
(Their big eater mode is on
with authentic pizzas in front of them.)

13
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:58,905
It's different compare
to the pizzas I've had.

14
00:00:58,906 --> 00:00:59,939
It's so delicious.

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,242
Yeah, it's so good.

16
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:07,915
("Pizza is Italy's gukbap (rice soup)."
- The students)

17
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:10,584
(The trio soaked in the charm of Rome.)

18
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,686
Where are we going tomorrow?

19
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:14,420
- Sicily.
- Sicily.

20
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:15,823
- By train.
- Yes, by train.

21
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:22,229
(Planning to get to Sicily from Rome
by an 11-hour train ride)

22
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:25,499
(Termini Station,
Italy’s largest transportation hub)

23
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,033
It's been a while
since I've been on a train.

24
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:28,902
Yeah, same. It's been so long.

25
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:32,573
(The three boys arrive to catch
the 11 p.m. night train to Sicily.)

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,842
We can do groceries...
No, that's not it.

27
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,143
There's nothing to eat
because it's so late.

28
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:39,079
But McDonald's is open.

29
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:43,850
I've worked at McDonald's before.

30
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:46,085
- Where?
- I've worked at McDonald's.

31
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,153
- When?
- Really?

32
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,955
Yeah, after CSAT.

33
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:50,390
- After the exam?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:52,158
Did you actually make the burgers?

35
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,462
Yeah, of course.

36
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:57,398
(Wait, Su Young's cooking
started with McDonald's?)

37
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:00,767
(Kihyun is in charge of ordering.)

38
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:03,603
I would love a cup ramyeon right now.

39
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:06,139
Yeah, I wish there was
a convenience store or something.

40
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,508
That's what I miss the most.

41
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,377
- There's no convenience store.
- No.

42
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:14,115
(Settling for a burger,
they head to board the train.)

43
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:16,015
(A tip for traveling to Sicily /
There are lots of different options.)

44
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:18,251
(But night trains are cost-saving,
and it's a unique experience.)

45
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:19,519
Where is it?

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,721
Here.

47
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,123
This is it.

48
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:25,158
(Full of excitement
for this new experience)

49
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,259
Awesome.

50
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,460
This is cool.

51
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,561
I love it.

52
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:29,930
I'm a bit excited.

53
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,465
I've never been on a sleeper train.

54
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,067
- Same.
- It's my first time too.

55
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:36,069
It's just big enough for you to lie down.

56
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,537
There's not much room.

57
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,306
Hey, we even get a bottle of water each.

58
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:42,942
(Thermometer, trash bin, cup holder,
outlet, this night train’s got it all.)

59
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,512
Let's have you sit here.

60
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:48,748
You can fold it?

61
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,150
It's now a seat.

62
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:52,452
Yeah. This is what it normally looks like.

63
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:53,554
That's so cool.

64
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,557
- It's got vibes.
- Yeah.

65
00:02:57,558 --> 00:02:59,226
Okay.

66
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:00,294
How nice.

67
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:04,364
- Gosh, things keep falling.
- The water bottle.

68
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,032
It's so cramped in here.

69
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:07,067
It is small.

70
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:10,870
(This is a first for Kihyun as well,
who's a world-class idol.)

71
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:14,340
Even though it's cramped,
we're close, so it's okay, but...

72
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:16,342
- If it's with someone you don't know...
- If it's like that...

73
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,911
And if that person was already in here...

74
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:19,380
It's kind of cozy though.

75
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:22,615
(That was quick. Kyung Ho's already
lying down all cozy.)

76
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:25,319
All right. Let's make the bed.

77
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,488
(Out of nowhere, a blanket game begins.)

78
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:29,590
What?

79
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:31,925
What are you doing?

80
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:34,093
(This 46-year-old
is loving the blanket game.)

81
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:35,529
Aren't you too old for this?

82
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,264
(Whistling)

83
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:39,567
It's going.

84
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,335
We're going now?

85
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:44,938
- Buonasera.
- Good evening.

86
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,873
We're going now.

87
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:48,142
Finally.

88
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,109
(The scenery starts to move.)

89
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,311
Yeah, we're moving.

90
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,146
- We're moving?
- Yeah, we are.

91
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:54,681
It surprised me...

92
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,317
because the view out the window
suddenly started moving.

93
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:58,985
We get to sleep on a train?

94
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:00,620
How fun.

95
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:02,456
I can't believe this.

96
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,690
(Sleep mode)

97
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:05,092
Should we turn off the lights?

98
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:09,096
It could get a little chilly at night.

99
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:15,635
Sleeping on a night train
was on my bucket list.

100
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,070
You've checked one off then.

101
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:18,104
I sure have.

102
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:20,373
How do you feel?

103
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:21,841
Just whatever comes to mind right now.

104
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,610
I'm scared Kyung Ho might fart.

105
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,011
No, but...

106
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:28,182
That's...

107
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:30,049
It's not only me though.

108
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,618
Everyone farts.

109
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,187
(Like kids on a school trip,
they fall asleep chatting away.)

110
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:37,824
(Zzz)

111
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:39,560
(Zzz)

112
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:44,532
(While they're fast asleep,
morning has come.)

113
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:48,536
(Who's here at this hour?)

114
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:52,807
(The crew has come
to give them some coffee.)

115
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,678
(Kihyun also gets up from the noise.)

116
00:04:57,845 --> 00:04:59,379
Let's drink coffee.

117
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,580
We should get up.
We're almost there.

118
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,049
We should get up?

119
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:07,020
(The trio is all up.)

120
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:08,154
We're almost there.

121
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:10,356
(Then, the train stops somewhere.)

122
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:12,326
We got up even before the alarm.

123
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,762
What's happening?

124
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,663
We're almost there.

125
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:20,367
Earlier, I saw this was
Villa San Giovanni Station.

126
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:22,268
We're right by the ocean now.

127
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:23,537
- Gosh.
- Why?

128
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,205
There's a ferry.

129
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,240
(Turning the hat)

130
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:28,209
(Where?)

131
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:29,642
(There's a ferry in front of the train
the boys are on.)

132
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:30,910
There's a ferry.

133
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,946
(There's a ferry in front of the train
the boys are on.)

134
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:34,914
So we're going to get off
and board the ferry?

135
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:37,250
I don't think we're getting off.

136
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:41,689
I think the train will board the ferry.

137
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,957
Look. See?

138
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,693
- Goodness.
- Where are we going?

139
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,127
The train is going on the ferry?

140
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:48,896
Hey, that's a ferry.

141
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:51,398
We're getting on it.

142
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,435
While we're on the train?

143
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:58,505
I couldn't believe it when I heard it,
but it's actually happening?

144
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:00,274
(The railway tracks
continue inside the ferry.)

145
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:01,908
This doesn't make sense.

146
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:03,410
Is the train
actually going onto the ferry?

147
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:05,812
We're on the ferry.

148
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:08,214
How is this even possible?

149
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:11,152
(The train we were on
has boarded the ferry.)

150
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,321
Are there no waves here?

151
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:17,090
I'm super familiar
with cars getting on ferries,

152
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,491
but a train is...

153
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:20,660
With cars, it's common.

154
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,996
Right.

155
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:25,665
This is wild. How far does it go?

156
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,735
Right? It just keeps going.
It's wild.

157
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:29,903
- It's incredible.
- So cool.

158
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,839
I just keep thinking
this is wild.

159
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:34,642
I don’t feel any rocking
from the waves yet.

160
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,410
Makes sense.
We're probably still docked.

161
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:39,879
It feels like it’s coming in
totally flat and even.

162
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,916
How did they think of a system like this?

163
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:44,150
Let's go out.

164
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:45,219
We can't just stay inside.

165
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:48,254
Goodness.

166
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:49,522
How did they do this?

167
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:51,791
The ferry must be huge.

168
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,394
The whole train’s on the ferry.

169
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:57,931
(They hurry up the stairs
with excitement.)

170
00:06:57,932 --> 00:07:00,000
The ferry is turning.

171
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,435
We're turning.

172
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:05,139
(Heading off to Sicily)

173
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:06,973
This is crazy.

174
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:08,041
(A miraculous view you want to take in)

175
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,677
There’s another train car up front.

176
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,612
- This must be where we got on.
- Yeah.

177
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:14,714
We must've come in like this, then...

178
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:16,549
I don't think people in Korea
will believe us.

179
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,617
No, they won't believe us.

180
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:20,620
"Hey, I was on a train,
but then that train boarded a ferry."

181
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:22,455
They're going to say, "That's impossible."

182
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:24,291
People are going to think we're weird.

183
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,496
We got on the ferry from there
and we're all the way here now.

184
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:32,732
I'm still kind of out of it
from the sleep,

185
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:34,934
but this dazed feeling...

186
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:36,704
- makes this more magical.
- Yeah.

187
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:38,539
It's magical that we're on a ferry.

188
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:41,374
It sort of feels unreal.

189
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,043
(The Mediterranean’s misty dawn
adds to the magic.)

190
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:45,746
This is crazy.

191
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:47,380
We were on a train,

192
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:48,848
then the train got on a ferry,

193
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:51,618
- so I made a song.
- What?

194
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:55,255
<i>The train pierces through the night</i>

195
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:57,691
<i>Then, it got on a ferry</i>

196
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,492
(Ryu-GPT is now tweaking songs,
not just Ryu-cipes.)

197
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:02,262
(Flees)

198
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:03,463
- Su Young.
- Yeah?

199
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:05,698
- You're...
- Did you like that?

200
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,133
- Was that to your style?
- Yeah.

201
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:11,037
So, we started from here, Rome,
then we came all the way down...

202
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:12,173
and we're here now.

203
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,010
We've come to the big toe of the boot.

204
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:18,745
The big toe of the boot.

205
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:22,749
We took a plane, a train, a ferry...

206
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,217
And now, we're going to Sicily.

207
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:25,885
What kind of beauty are we in for?

208
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,187
This was such a track.

209
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:29,055
Well, Sicily's famous.

210
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:30,557
The fridge of Italy.

211
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:32,058
The pantry of Italy.

212
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,627
We're going inside of it.

213
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:36,196
- Into the fridge.
- Yeah.

214
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:37,798
(The three boys are headed for Sicily.)

215
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:42,303
(Sicily, located at the southern end
of the Italian peninsula)

216
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:44,688
(The name means "white marble.")

217
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:48,108
(It's the biggest island
in the Mediterranean.)

218
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:52,546
(Their third study abroad location
Sicily)

219
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:56,916
(And Sicily’s second biggest city)

220
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,151
Just about all of Italy’s seafood...

221
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:01,788
and produce comes from here.

222
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:02,989
Nearly all of it.

223
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,557
Catania is an amazing place.

224
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:05,759
A table of paradise.

225
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:10,798
(Catania is located
at the eastern tip of Sicily.)

226
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,799
(Mount Etna / Europe’s highest
and the world’s most active volcano)

227
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,334
They have Mount Etna,

228
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:17,171
and thanks to the fertile soil
from Mount Etna,

229
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:21,408
almost all the crops are grown here.

230
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,213
(The freshest ingredients
as expected from the Table of Paradise)

231
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:29,450
(Even the fruit is unbelievably sweet.)

232
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:34,054
(Catania Fish Market)

233
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:38,992
(With the same-day catch,
the freshness is unmatched.)

234
00:09:38,993 --> 00:09:42,062
It's so fresh. It's unbelievable.

235
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,532
Man, this has got to be
the freshest I’ve ever seen.

236
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:47,701
(Full of various seafood)

237
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:51,572
The freshness was unbelievable.
It probably came straight off the boat.

238
00:09:51,906 --> 00:09:54,275
The Italians must get to enjoy
the freshest ingredients, huh?

239
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,748
(With ingredients in abundance,
they offer just as many seafood dishes.)

240
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:02,916
(Seafood dishes you've never had before)

241
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,552
I've never tasted
anything like this before.

242
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,753
(Unique)

243
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,889
(Diverse)

244
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:11,592
(A fascinating world of seafood dishes)

245
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:16,163
(The trio's Catania journey begins now.)

246
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:18,531
So cool.

247
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:21,234
(A leisurely Catania morning,
full of European charm.)

248
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:23,037
- It's Europe again.
- We're in Europe again.

249
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:25,072
What's this?

250
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:26,773
(Kyung Ho has found something.)

251
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:27,807
Look at this.

252
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:31,177
Sicily is famous for <i>The Godfather</i>.

253
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:33,680
- <i>The Godfather</i> and <i>Cinema Paradiso</i>.
- Yeah.

254
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,715
I was expecting a place like Palermo,

255
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:38,685
but Catania must have
a whole different vibe.

256
00:10:38,686 --> 00:10:41,154
- We're here.
- It's <i>The Godfather</i> apron.

257
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:43,023
Catania.

258
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,027
Here.

259
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,796
Let's just look for now.

260
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,664
We'll talk about it later
while sitting down.

261
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,633
Shouldn't we throw a coin in
and make a wish?

262
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:55,302
Yeah, you have to make a wish here.

263
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:58,938
(A refreshing fountain has caught
the trio's attention.)

264
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,007
This is cool.

265
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:02,509
I should take a photo.

266
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,212
(I can't make a wish,
but I need this selfie.)

267
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,517
(Welcome to Catania,
K-dad doing it for the gram)

268
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:13,287
It's really a market.

269
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:16,089
(Catania Fish Market)

270
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,324
(Sicily’s largest fish market,
selling the day's fresh catch)

271
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:20,895
(Open for 8 hours from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.
every day except Monday)

272
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:27,301
(Fresh from the Mediterranean!
100% freshness guaranteed)

273
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:30,638
(Shouting vendors and nonstop buzz,
a bustling market)

274
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,673
(It's fresh.)

275
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:39,046
(Catania Fish Market)

276
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,648
It's really a market.

277
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,151
It probably seems a little empty
because it rained yesterday.

278
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:47,688
(A little empty?)

279
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:52,893
(Empty)

280
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:56,197
It was super busy in the photo I saw.

281
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:59,532
The weather was bad yesterday
due to the rain.

282
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,768
They said not a lot of ships
could go out yesterday.

283
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:02,937
That must be why.

284
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,606
I've got squid!

285
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:11,044
(Still confident in the freshness!
Hyping up the seafood)

286
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:12,980
How is the mackerel so plump?

287
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:15,883
It's so big.

288
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:18,818
(Full of fresh seafood)

289
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:20,153
It's so fresh.

290
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:22,323
(Full of fresh seafood)

291
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,656
It looks so good.

292
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:24,125
(This is what they call a small catch?)

293
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,160
Markets never let you down.

294
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,062
It's incredibly fresh.

295
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,330
It's fresh!

296
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:33,466
(Surprised)

297
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:34,969
He's full of energy.

298
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,837
(Pushing hard)

299
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:39,707
His voice is so strong.

300
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,410
What's that? The one that's cut whole?

301
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:45,146
Is it a shark?

302
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,981
Why is it so big?

303
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:48,715
(Huge)

304
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:50,049
Is it like a tuna?

305
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,718
What kind of a fish is this?

306
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:54,054
(Pesce spada)

307
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:56,923
(What's that?)

308
00:12:56,924 --> 00:12:57,991
I know.

309
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:00,027
It's a swordfish.

310
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:03,663
(Swordfish / It’s known for
its long, flat, sword-like bill.)

311
00:13:03,664 --> 00:13:06,600
(Commonly caught in the Mediterranean,
it's a staple for the people of Catania.)

312
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:12,640
(Swordfish is a must
at the Catania fish market.)

313
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,376
Do you have the head of the swordfish?

314
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:17,778
No, because it rained yesterday.

315
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,448
- I was curious about the head.
- Swordfish.

316
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:22,082
Swordfish.

317
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:23,150
We need to see its head.

318
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:24,184
Let's come back here.

319
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:27,187
I was really looking forward to seeing it
because they said they were known for it.

320
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:30,591
But since there's not much
fresh catch today...

321
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:37,891
(Mission complete,
Back again for swordfish)

322
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:39,867
What's this?

323
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:42,369
Mussels.

324
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:44,405
They have oysters.

325
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,273
(Even the clams are super fresh.)

326
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,442
So fresh.

327
00:13:50,211 --> 00:13:51,678
Those oysters look amazing.

328
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,647
(Catania’s fish market,
known for unbeatable freshness)

329
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:56,116
(Sniff)

330
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:57,984
It smells like they're cooking squid.

331
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,120
Yeah, I smell squid.

332
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:01,856
(The smell makes them backtrack.)

333
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:04,357
It's grilled octopus.

334
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:06,727
(The smell led them
straight to fresh octopus on the grill.)

335
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:11,064
(This looks like it has to be good.)

336
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:12,566
They're just grilling it.

337
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:15,468
They're just grilling it now...

338
00:14:15,469 --> 00:14:17,137
and eating it like this.

339
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:19,874
There's octopus, swordfish, shrimp...

340
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:22,176
They're just grilling it
straight over the flame.

341
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:23,744
They're grilling everything.

342
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:28,715
(Clink, clink)

343
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:31,919
(Move your body to Catania's rhythm.)

344
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,790
(With Catania vibes,
where we are is the stage.)

345
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:39,626
(Can't help but dance)

346
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:41,027
My body's just moving.

347
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:43,096
(Sizzling to the beat,
cooking to perfection)

348
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:44,964
Looking at this is making me hungry.

349
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:46,533
We should have our first meal.

350
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,101
Let's ask.

351
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:50,037
How should we order?

352
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:52,173
Hey.

353
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:54,909
(Try some before you order.)

354
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,476
They're just giving some?

355
00:14:56,477 --> 00:14:57,644
Try it.

356
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:58,711
You should try it.

357
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:00,213
(I'll give you one more.)

358
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:01,481
No, you should try it first.

359
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:03,551
(Looking out for the youngest first)

360
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:08,521
(What does Catania's mussel taste like?)

361
00:15:08,522 --> 00:15:09,557
Gosh.

362
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,825
It's crazy.

363
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:12,893
It's so good.

364
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,997
(The freshness has them moving
in Italian style.)

365
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:19,500
It's so delicious.

366
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,369
- It's crazy.
- It's so good.

367
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:24,304
- It's delicious.
- It's good?

368
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,707
(That flavor’s got them
licking their lips.)

369
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:31,578
It's like those
casual seafood spots in Korea.

370
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:32,679
I think you just pick what you want,
and they grill it for you.

371
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,914
So they grill it for you on the spot.

372
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:35,348
(Catania's casual seafood spot,
full of fresh catch)

373
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:36,617
It looks so good.

374
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:38,953
It's so fresh.

375
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:40,587
They have hoe (Korean-style raw fish).

376
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:41,654
(Catania's casual seafood spot)

377
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:43,389
(Choose your seafood, and they’ll grill it
or serve it raw right on the spot.)

378
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,425
This must be the freshest oysters
in the entire world, no?

379
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:47,861
This looks like an assorted hoe dish,

380
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:49,396
like the ones they sell in Jeju.

381
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:54,902
(Pick your seafood.)

382
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:59,974
(They grill it for you on the spot.)

383
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:05,311
(Done cooking)

384
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:07,915
(The trio's journey in Catania)

385
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:09,549
(First stop: Freshness 101)

386
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,118
This really is street dining.

387
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:14,988
Here's one too. I'll get the meat for you.

388
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:16,290
(Which fresh seafood will they try first?)

389
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,458
The size of this oyster is unmatched.

390
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:22,629
(Catania oysters,
on another level from the size alone)

391
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,500
You need to release the meat
from the shell.

392
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,002
Then, drain some of the water
so that it's not too salty.

393
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:30,470
- Release the meat.
- Drain some of the water.

394
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:32,272
Drain the water,
then squeeze on some lemon juice?

395
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,107
(You cannot go wrong with this combo
for raw oysters.)

396
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:37,244
(Fresh lemon juice)

397
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,813
(Lemon adds a tangy kick
that lifts the oyster’s flavor.)

398
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:40,880
You can eat it as is.

399
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,883
So there's a way to eat this, huh?

400
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:50,256
(Can't help but dance)

401
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,025
- It's good?
- Yeah.

402
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:53,393
Of course, it's good.

403
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:54,528
The moment you eat it,

404
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:56,229
it feels like...

405
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,165
you just visited the heavens.

406
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:00,801
Gosh.

407
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:02,903
I mean, compared to oysters in Korea,

408
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:05,772
it's not as sweet.

409
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:06,973
(Speechless after that oyster)

410
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:08,408
It's super clean,

411
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,643
and the oyster's good,

412
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:12,346
- but this lemon is amazing.
- Right?

413
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:14,949
The lemon takes the oyster
to another level.

414
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,382
How is it?

415
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:17,517
(Electrifying)

416
00:17:17,518 --> 00:17:18,886
I added too much lemon juice.

417
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,087
But I think this needs lemon.

418
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:22,689
(Happy)

419
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,692
This is good. I should go get some more.

420
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:27,760
(Devouring his second oyster)

421
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:28,829
Shrimp?

422
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:30,463
Gosh, that oyster is insane.

423
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:31,866
- Anymore?
- No more oysters.

424
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:38,672
(Seafood and fruit combination that works!
Oysters and lemon)

425
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,876
The sweetness...

426
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:43,878
The sweetness...

427
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:46,213
- What did you just have?
- This one.

428
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:51,185
(Raw shrimp fresh caught from the sea)

429
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:55,121
What's this red stuff
on top of the shrimp?

430
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:56,222
There's something else with the shrimp.

431
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,324
What's this?

432
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,192
I can't tell what the stuff on top is.

433
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:01,127
What's this?

434
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:03,163
There's incredible sweetness at the end.

435
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:06,734
(What’s that sweet red stuff
on the raw shrimp?)

436
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:09,435
It's strawberry.

437
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,305
- Strawberry?
- Su Young, it's strawberry.

438
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:13,339
You're right.

439
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,675
They sprinkled some salt here.

440
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:17,277
This is so interesting.

441
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:18,511
On strawberries?

442
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:20,146
(Catania's raw shrimp with strawberries)

443
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:21,581
They added strawberries?

444
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:23,617
(Catania's raw shrimp with strawberries)

445
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:25,385
It's so interesting though.

446
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:27,555
They go well together.

447
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:29,923
It's surprisingly good.

448
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:31,358
Strawberry and shrimp?

449
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:34,595
The strawberry sauce is unique.

450
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,199
(Once you start, you can’t stop.)

451
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,433
It's good.

452
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:43,069
(Burst of flavors)

453
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,071
That kind of combination is so cool.

454
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:46,973
This is incredible.
This should be eaten like this.

455
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:48,274
(Seafood and fruit combination that works!
Raw shrimp and strawberry)

456
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:49,742
Kyung Ho,

457
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:50,877
could I go ahead and try some swordfish?

458
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:52,078
- Of course, go ahead.
- Go for it.

459
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,646
The swordfish is out of this world.

460
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:55,014
I should try the oyster with this.

461
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:56,283
Yeah, sprinkle some on it.

462
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,121
Yum.

463
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:06,626
This is the best one for me.

464
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:07,828
It tastes like Spanish mackerel.

465
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:09,662
It's like grilled Spanish mackerel.

466
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:11,464
- It does taste like that.
- Right?

467
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,099
Gosh, this is the best...

468
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,768
That torched aroma makes it incredible.

469
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,036
Its true flavor...

470
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:18,538
Yeah, it's its true flavor.

471
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:19,572
Its original flavor is so good.

472
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:20,940
Just a touch of that grilled aroma.

473
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:23,610
Not the chattiest guy,
but he grills like a pro.

474
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,079
You're right. He's good.

475
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:26,913
Everyone,

476
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:29,015
if I can eat it like this,
it means there's no fishy taste at all.

477
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,050
I mean it.

478
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,519
(Can’t stop being amazed
by this swordfish)

479
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,220
How is a fish this chewy and delicious?

480
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,956
- I've always just had grilled salmon.
- Right.

481
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:39,260
But it's much lighter than salmon.

482
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:42,329
- I've never had a fish like this.
- It's delicious.

483
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,865
Out of these, my top pick is swordfish.

484
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:47,233
Swordfish is insane.

485
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:48,234
Swordfish...

486
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:49,302
It's fantastic.

487
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:50,603
The swordfish is fantastic.

488
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:52,406
("The smoky swordfish gets deeper
and nuttier the more you chew.")

489
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:53,007
(- The Students)

490
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:54,008
It's good.

491
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,409
Let's get into it.

492
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:58,912
This one's good.
This one's delicious.

493
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:02,249
(Time for the trio to chow down)

494
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:04,752
(The seafood has even captured Kihyun,
a seafood newbie.)

495
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:12,559
I know we're all at it right now,

496
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,861
- but there's much more to some.
- Yeah?

497
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:16,663
If we're too full,
we won't be able to taste it properly.

498
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,264
No, not us.

499
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,800
- We should keep eating?
- My big eater mode is on.

500
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:22,569
We're all in our big eater mode.

501
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,803
Big eaters from the start.

502
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:25,872
Let's go eat other things too.
Let's clean up.

503
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:27,241
(First stop: Freshness 101 cleared)

504
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,080
(Goes into overtime alone)

505
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:37,317
What are you eating now?

506
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:38,652
We have a lot to eat today.

507
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:40,855
One second.

508
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:42,155
My diet is doomed.

509
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,724
(I'll try it since you're offering.)

510
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:45,759
It's tangy.

511
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:47,361
It's tangy and nutty.

512
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:50,698
They only added lemon, salt, and oil.

513
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:53,968
Thank you.

514
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:56,870
(Going deeper into the market)

515
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:58,404
I'm starting to feel full.

516
00:20:58,405 --> 00:20:59,573
Yeah.

517
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:02,108
Kyung Ho, you look full.

518
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:03,409
No way.

519
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,445
- Are you full?
- Not at all.

520
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:06,479
Kyung Ho can't be full.

521
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,647
Being full is not allowed.

522
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:08,882
I’m just eating small portions,
that’s all.

523
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:11,552
I'm not hungry at all,
I mean not full at all.

524
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:17,157
(The trio has entered the restaurant alley
inside the market.)

525
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:18,492
The umbrellas are pretty here.

526
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:22,996
(In the middle of the market...)

527
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:26,800
(The sky is decorated
with colorful umbrellas.)

528
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,334
This is so nice.

529
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:31,305
I love this right now.
I love the view.

530
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:33,707
I feel like everything
would taste good here.

531
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:37,911
I heard the owner here was the first
to design an umbrella street like this.

532
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:39,579
- World's first?
- Yeah.

533
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,248
It was the owner’s idea,
and now it’s everywhere.

534
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:45,018
He made it like this
because he thought it'd be pretty.

535
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:46,986
That's amazing.

536
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:51,658
They say this place serves you
even if you don’t order.

537
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,961
It's kind of like an omakase,
where you leave it up to the chef?

538
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:56,063
Sicily-kase.

539
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,898
(Su Young and Kyung Ho met a priest
who's been living in Rome for 13 years.)

540
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:00,733
Make sure to eat seafood.

541
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:03,436
This is what you order
when you go to a restaurant in Catania.

542
00:22:03,437 --> 00:22:05,004
Order the appetizer,

543
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:06,806
then tell them
that you'd leave it up to the chef.

544
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,875
Then the chef will take care of you,
no rip-offs.

545
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:10,010
(I see.)

546
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:13,947
Italian food is really a whole different
kind of eating compared to Korean food.

547
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:15,048
You'll really be inspired.

548
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:16,150
Really?

549
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:19,386
- For our second place?
- Yeah?

550
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:23,156
- Chef-kase?
- Chef-kase, yeah.

551
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:24,191
Sounds good.

552
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:27,194
(Here comes the seafood dishes
recommended by the chef.)

553
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,063
(Cue the jaw drop.)

554
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,564
What is this?

555
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:34,735
A dish full of seafood.

556
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:36,703

557

(Second stop: Fusion seafood dishes)

565
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,894
- I'm the most curious about these two.
- Me too.

566
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:02,529
Stir-fried eggplant with tuna.

567
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,997
This is swordfish.

568
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:04,998
A swordfish dish.

569
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:06,700
This is swordfish.

570
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:12,606
(Swordfish and Eggplant Lasagna)

571
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:16,176
(The base is Italy's ragu.)

572
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:18,478
They made it like a lasagna.

573
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,847
Instead of the lasagna pasta,
they used eggplants.

574
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:22,282
And swordfish.

575
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:24,784
There's cheese on top.

576
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:26,153
It's swordfish lasagna.

577
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:31,859
(A fusion dish of swordfish
and eggplant with a ragu-based sauce)

578
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:35,763
Swordfish?

579
00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:41,234
This straight-up tastes familiar.

580
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:42,303
Yeah?

581
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:47,740
Oh! Yes!

582
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:49,310
Goodness.

583
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,246
- Mamma mia.
- Yeah, mamma mia.

584
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,814
Su Young, you’re getting
so expressive these days.

585
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:56,316
You're basically Italian.

586
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:57,484
Me?

587
00:23:57,485 --> 00:24:00,821
(Like this)

588
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:02,789
(He's become Vincenzo Eo Nam Giovanni.)

589
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,824
It's delicious.

590
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:08,595
(A bite for me too.)

591
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:10,029
Yeah, this is so good.

592
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,665
This is so familiar.

593
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:14,467
This is like that meatball sauce.

594
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:16,836
Yeah, ragu.

595
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:19,440
And they added a swordfish steak
like the one before.

596
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:20,808
It's food.

597
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:22,408
Plus, there's eggplant too.

598
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:23,576
Eggplant, nice.

599
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:25,346
This area is known for its eggplants.

(Catania's local specialty, eggplant)

601

(Thanks to Mount Etna’s fertile soil,
Catania grows top-quality eggplants.)

603
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,459
(Compared to Korean ones,
these are rounder in shape.)

604
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,996
It tastes like an Italian dish.

605
00:24:42,763 --> 00:24:44,298
It's very Italian.

606
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:46,199
Guys, the eggplant...

607
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,401
(The eggplant is shockingly good.)

608
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:50,604
It's good. The eggplant goes well
with all the other ingredients here.

609
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:54,174
The eggplant with this tomato sauce,

610
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:55,942
and the combination with this cheese...

611
00:24:55,943 --> 00:24:57,144
It's good.

612
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,015
(There's no such thing as being full
in front of delicious food.)

613
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:03,250
So tasty.

614
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:05,485
I want to try making this.

615
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:07,120
It's like a trio.

616
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:09,656
- You're right. It is.
- It's so good.

617
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:11,491
The eggplant, the fish, and the cheese
go so well together.

618
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,060
(A fantastic flavor combo
of the eggplant, swordfish, and cheese)

619
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,695
I want to sort of add some heat.

620
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:18,531
You know, like the spicy tuna in Korea.

621
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:20,301
- Like hot pepper tuna?
- Yeah.

622
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:23,203
- There's something I need to say.
- What is it?

623
00:25:23,204 --> 00:25:25,438
There's a dish I tried
while you were busy talking.

624
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,240
It's insane? Give me a bite.

625
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:29,509
- It taste familiar, but...
- What is it?

626
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,211
I'm trying to remember.

627
00:25:31,212 --> 00:25:32,946
I’m digging through my brain right now.

628
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,047
(Grilled octopus that tastes familiar?)

629
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:35,182
What is this?

630

(Asking Ryu-GPT for a flavor analysis)

631
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,384
(Ryu-GPT is processing flavor data.)

632
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:39,920
It tastes too familiar.

633
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:42,056
This is popcorn.

634
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,526
(Kihyun channels
his inner Eo Nam Seon too.)

635
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:48,295
- It is popcorn.
- Right?

636
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:51,664
Yeah, because I see the bits of kernel
on the octopus.

637
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,701
- Yeah?
- Yes, if you look here...

638
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:55,803
Let's ask what this is.

639
00:25:56,137 --> 00:26:00,106
Was popcorn used for this dish?

640
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:01,408
Yes, we used popcorn.

641
00:26:01,775 --> 00:26:04,645
This is our signature dish.

642
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,515
It's like they blended popcorn
in a food processor.

643
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:11,252
(A unique fusion dish
discovered in Catania)

644
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:14,989
(Popcorn Octopus)

645
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:16,891
They used popcorn?

646
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,958
- It's unique and interesting.
- It is.

647
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,996
This dish
is definitely sparking inspiration.

648
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,299
But wait, what's this cream?

649
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:30,504
(An unknown sauce
that's covering the octopus)

650
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:33,439
(Ryu-GPT is analyzing the sauce.)

651
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,608
Mayonnaise.

652
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,544
It's nothing fancy. It's mayonnaise.

653
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:39,947
I do taste the mayonnaise.

654
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:43,017
It's just mayonnaise and blended popcorn.

655
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:47,387
How interesting. They must've covered it
in mayonnaise, then tossed it in popcorn.

656
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:48,555
Yeah, this is good.

657
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:50,824
Octopus and mayonnaise
go well together, you know?

658
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:51,858
Incredible.

659
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:55,829
I just learned that corn
and octopus go well together.

660
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,364
I've never thought about that.

661
00:26:57,765 --> 00:27:00,433
(Ryu-GPT is starting to get inspired.)

662
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:01,935
I feel like you could adapt this
in so many ways.

663
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:05,205
- Cheongyang mayo is popular in Korea.
- Right.

664
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,608
So we could use that instead
to add a Korean flair.

665
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:10,677
Then, toss it in some popcorn.

666
00:27:10,678 --> 00:27:12,445
I think that would work well together.

667
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:15,381
Or if we're going in that direction,
we could use Korean popcorn.

668
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:15,999
That would be good.

669
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,485
Or even injeolmi powder
(roasted soybean powder).

670
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:19,719
- Right?
- Injeolmi powder.

671
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,221
Injeolmi sounds like an idea.

672
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,289
Some kind of roasted bean powder.

673
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:25,592
Now that we've been studying,
these things are coming into my head.

674
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:27,560
You're right.

675
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:30,164
The way you look and approach food
is totally different.

676
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:32,032
Have you tried this?

677
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:33,366

681

I really like this.

682
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:43,144
It's a bit spicy. I really like it.

683
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:46,580
Drizzle some lemon juice
on the bread, and...

684
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:48,816
This isn't pickled.

685
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:50,884
It's raw anchovy.

686
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:52,952
- It's good.
- This is delicious.

687
00:27:52,953 --> 00:27:54,822
It's super unique.

688
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:56,523
What an experience.

689
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:57,792
An experience I'll never forget.

690
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:00,760
Delicious.

the square, holds a special tale.)

705

(Mount Etna is quite close
to the city of Catania.)

706

From what I heard, Sicily,
especially Catania,

707
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:57,218
was nearly wiped out
because of Mount Etna...

708
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:59,886
due to volcanoes and major earthquakes.

709
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:01,654
Completely ruined land.

710
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:03,189
Nearly wiped out.

711
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,291
And on that land
that was nearly wiped out...

712
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,127
I mean, in a place that seemed
beyond rebuilding,

713
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:08,661
people started over.

714
00:29:08,662 --> 00:29:11,632
They rebuilt using volcanic stone.

715
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,167
All this was probably ruined,

716
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:16,636
but they rebuilt this all,
rebuilt the square,

717
00:29:16,637 --> 00:29:18,905
the church, the statue...

718
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:20,207
- Unbelievable.
- Incredible people, right?

719
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:23,143
And from that moment on,
they began to rebuild.

720
00:29:23,144 --> 00:29:24,310
(From the ashes,
Catania rose into a beautiful city.)

721
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,312
That was probably also built
using volcanic stones.

722
00:29:26,313 --> 00:29:28,948
Yeah, so when the city was ruined
after a volcanic eruption,

723
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:32,185
I think they built
a statue of an elephant as a symbol...

724
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:34,321
of their strength and determination.

725
00:29:34,622 --> 00:29:36,991
Right, that place...

726
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:40,560
That place is famous for arancino.

727
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:41,996
You know, it's the arancino.

728
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:43,630
- We finally get to eat it.
- Finally.

729
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:45,699
(The trio's journey in Catania)

730
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,737

(Italy's Fried Jumeokbap
Arancino)

740
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:24,638
But why are they called arancino here
instead of arancini?

741
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:27,073
Volcano.

742
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:29,209
"No" from the volcano.

743
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,878
It was inspired by the volcano
from the mighty Etna.

744
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:34,781
That's why it's shaped like it too.

745
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:36,382
It's in the shape of a volcanic mountain.

746
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:37,884
It's triangular and not round.

747
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:43,023
(In western Sicily, round-shaped arancini
/ In eastern Sicily, cone-shaped arancino)

748
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,194
Buongiorno.

749
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:50,363
Is this the place that's famous
for arancino?

750
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:51,831
Of course.

751
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:52,800
It’s not arancini?

752
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:56,270
It's arancino.

753
00:30:57,171 --> 00:30:59,840
(In Catania, that's in the east,
"arancini" is a forbidden word.)

754
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:01,841
Arancino.

755
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:04,712
(Not arancini, arancino)

(The classics of all classics

762
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:28,635
It's just like I told you, right?

763
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,069
It's in the shape of a volcanic mountain.

764
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,838
You're right. Should we try it?

765
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,706
(When you break the top of the volcano...)

766
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:34,842
What is this?

767
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:37,444
- This looks good.
- This has to be good.

768
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:41,247
(A crunchy shell
filled with juicy risotto and savory ragu)

769
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:42,982
This one's plain.

770
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:44,184
Very basic.

771
00:31:44,185 --> 00:31:45,852
(A crunchy shell
filled with juicy risotto and savory ragu)

772
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:48,221
- This looks good.
- This has to be good.

773
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:49,790
It looks like it has to be good.

774
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:51,791
(Smells it first)

775
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,160
Gosh, the smell...

776
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:54,662
Wow.

777
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,164
I feel it already.

778
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,966
(The smell raises expectations!
So how does the ragu arancino taste?)

779
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,535
The filling here is the real deal.

780
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:10,945
(A nod of certainty)

781
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:13,012
This tastes familiar because it's ragu.

782
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:14,013
Yeah.

783
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:15,081
I'm not good at swimming,

784
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:16,784
and this feels like
I've stepped out of the water.

785
00:32:17,318 --> 00:32:18,551
What does that mean?

786
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:20,620
I’m not great with seafood, remember?

787
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:22,389
It feels like I'm finally back on land.

788
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:24,324
You're right.

789
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:26,559
No surprises. Just as good as it looks.

790
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,730
(The youngest goes all in
on big eater mode.)

791
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:31,898
(The oldest one is impatient
and opens the next arancino.)

792
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:33,601
- Melanzani.
- Eggplant?

793
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:39,472
(Ragu with Eggplant
Eggplant Arancino)

794
00:32:39,473 --> 00:32:41,107
Gosh, this is...

795
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:42,308
This will also taste familiar.

796
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:45,112
(It smells familiar already.
What about the taste?)

797
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:50,016
(Why is this also so good?)

798
00:32:50,017 --> 00:32:52,686
(Agrees)

799
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:55,455
I can tell they added ricotta cheese.

800
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:57,925
It's ricotta, eggplant, and tomato sauce.

801
00:32:58,192 --> 00:32:59,927
- Impressive.
- Just those?

802
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:02,061
Eggplant and ricotta.

803
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:03,863
And tomato. That's it.

804
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:05,231
(Simple ingredients,
surprisingly rich flavor)

805
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:08,034
The eggplant is really...
It has a lot of textures.

806
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:09,202
Yeah, the eggplant is good.

807
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:12,972
Yeah, they're known for eggplants here.

808
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:15,842
Eggplant is a southern specialty,
and gosh, it's good

809
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:17,177
And the flavor has more depth somehow.

810
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:20,146
It has tomatoes in it,

811
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:22,382
so I expected this to taste like
a pasta dish, but it doesn't.

812
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:23,650
I thought it'd be spicy,
but it's not.

813
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:24,684
This is not your style?

814
00:33:24,685 --> 00:33:26,219
- It's salty.
- It's salty?

815
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,854
I want to add something.

816
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,088
(This K-dad is desperate for some kimchi.)

817
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:30,423
Go get me some kimchi.

818
00:33:30,424 --> 00:33:31,624
- Let's try the pistachio.
- It's good.

819
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:33,327
It'd be so good with kimchi.

820
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:35,528
(This time, the filling is white.)

821
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:36,729
I have no idea
what this is going to taste like.

822
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,765
This looks like a croquette.

823
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:41,001
(Looks different
from the ragu-based arancino)

824
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:46,073
(This is a cream-based arancino.)

825
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:49,742
I seriously have no idea what to expect.

826
00:33:49,743 --> 00:33:51,011
(This arancino is a mystery.)

827
00:33:51,545 --> 00:33:54,013
There's pistachio with the rice,
and cheese?

828
00:33:54,014 --> 00:33:55,282
(Arancino with pistachio inside)

829
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:58,786
(Catania's local specialty, pistachio)

830
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:00,820
(Catania's Pistachio)

831
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,489
(Thanks to its volcanic soil, this region
produces world-class pistachios.)

832
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,991
(Deep, roasted flavor that’s just perfect)

833
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,362
(A rich cream cheese
meets nutty pistachio.)

834
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:12,867
(Pistachio Arancino)

835
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:15,736
I got some on my finger,
so I tried it,

836
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,209
and it's good.

837
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:26,079
(One bite, one mind)

838
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,148
For this one, when everyone took a bite,
our expressions...

839
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,149
(Their big eater mode is activated.)

840
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,517
- I'm glad.
- This is it.

841
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:31,918
This is good.

842
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,021
- It goes well with pistachio.
- And cheese.

843
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:36,790
I thought they'd fully blend
the pistachio,

844
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,024
and make a sauce out of it,

845
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:40,995
but I tasted some chunks of pistachio.

846
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,397
- These are all pistachio?
- Yeah.

847
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:45,498
This too?

848
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:47,867
It's been crushed.

849
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:49,269
How nice. This is good.

850
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,704
It sneaks up on you,
then boom, flavor everywhere.

851
00:34:51,705 --> 00:34:53,606
(Kihyun’s totally hooked
on the pistachio arancino.)

852
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:55,341
I keep thinking...

853
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:56,976
I keep thinking it would sell well.

854
00:34:56,977 --> 00:34:59,946
This is so good.
It's a taste that sticks with you.

855
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:02,148
This one is really nice.

856
00:35:02,149 --> 00:35:04,317
- I want to try making it.
- This one's good.

857
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:06,119
Do you want to try it?

858
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,855
I do want to try it.

859
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,558
You know, with rice...

860
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:14,762
(Third stop: Soul food arancino cleared)

861
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:18,665
We can each try to make one arancino.

862
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,700
Then you can take the pistachio one.

863
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,035
- A competition?
- Nice.

864
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,770
From now on, we're rivals.

865
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:25,038
You think you can arancini?

866
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,740
Mind your own arancini.

867
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:30,744
(They danced together.)

868
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:35,516
(They helped out together.)

869
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:40,988
(Ryu-cipe has been such a fun ride.)

870
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:43,657
(But today, forget everything.)

871
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:45,693
- It's a war.
- It's a war.

872
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:48,662
(The Ryu-cipe competition has begun.)

873
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:51,432
(Comes with built-in swagger)

874
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,768
(Ryu-cipe showdown! Rules? What rules?)

875
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,204
(I cannot lose to the boys.)

876
00:35:57,471 --> 00:35:59,106
What is that?

877
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:01,876
(Su Young unveils
his secret weapon sauce!)

878
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:07,014
(Who will win this arancino competition?)

879
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:09,884
My head is all jumbled right now.

880
00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:12,085
I should write down my recipe...

881
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,088
to prepare for the storm later.

882
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,087
(Getting ready to shoot their Ryu-cipes)

883
00:36:17,151 --> 00:36:20,687
- Do you know the recipe to make ragu?
- Yeah.

884
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:22,022
(He's asking a crew member
instead of Ryu-GPT?)

885
00:36:22,023 --> 00:36:23,358
Is it like a tomato sauce?

886
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:25,993
I feel like there should be
some kind of a main flavor.

887
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:27,428
(Kyung Ho is trying to think
of a kick for his arancino.)

888
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:29,597
(Sniff)

889
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:33,334
(Kihyun is carefully checking
his ingredients.)

890
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:34,455
(Hmpf)

891
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,860
It's too sweet.

892
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:43,865
(Su Young's also in full focus mode,
checking every detail.)

893
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,634
Your eyes are...

894
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:48,245
full of determination right now.

895
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:49,980
Hope you're ready for this.

896
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:51,815
Kyung Ho must be super confident.

897
00:36:51,816 --> 00:36:53,083
Look at his eyes.

898
00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:54,117
I wouldn't say super.

899
00:36:54,118 --> 00:36:56,286
I see danger in those eyes.

900
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:57,354
You're all decided, Kyung Ho?

901
00:36:57,355 --> 00:37:00,624
We've been studying abroad
for a while now.

902
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,894
It's time to prove
we've learned something.

903
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:05,162
This is what's nice about today.

904
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:06,697
I want to suggest something.

905
00:37:06,698 --> 00:37:10,267
Ingredients like rice and batter...

906
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:12,035
- We can share them, right?
- Sounds good.

907
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:13,403
Just make rice for the two of you.

908
00:37:13,404 --> 00:37:15,472
I won't be using white rice,
so I'll make mine separately.

909
00:37:15,473 --> 00:37:17,108
What are you using?

910
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:18,842
I'll tell you later.

911
00:37:18,843 --> 00:37:21,245
I'm so curious.
If not white rice, what will you use?

912
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:23,213
Then it's already too different
from the start.

913
00:37:23,214 --> 00:37:24,581
He's taking a different route.

914
00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:25,949
If he goes all out,

915
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,618
then for us who's following...

916
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:28,685
I'm not going all out.

917
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:30,654
There's no answer in cooking.

918
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:31,655
- Yeah?
- Yes.

919
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:33,625
- Shall we start?
- Let's go.

920
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:35,994
Andiamo (Let's go).

921
00:37:36,394 --> 00:37:38,662
Once we start cooking,

922
00:37:38,663 --> 00:37:40,530
- it's a war.
- It's a war.

923
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:42,599
I can use this, right?
The stainless steel container.

924
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,736
I like this one. You can wash
and drain the veggies so easily.

925
00:37:45,737 --> 00:37:47,238
Stainless steel container.

926
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,375
So you're going to make your own rice?

927
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:52,409
Yes.

928
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,244
So you don't need to soak your rice?

929
00:37:54,245 --> 00:37:55,280
No.

930
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:57,047
Sicily!

931
00:37:57,048 --> 00:37:58,548
(Su Young's energy
is off the charts today.)

932
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:00,484
Su Young, what’s up
with your energy here, seriously?

933
00:38:00,485 --> 00:38:02,487
Italy vibes.

934
00:38:02,987 --> 00:38:04,955
Come to think of it,

935
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:06,290
I don't even need to use a knife today.

936
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:07,758
- What?
- I don't need a knife today.

937
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:09,059
You don't even need a knife?

938
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,928
You’re on that level already?

939
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:13,765
No, I just don't need one for this dish.

940
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:16,566
I should start with the pistachio.

941
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:17,902
Pistachio.

942
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:21,638
My father's a big fan of nuts.

943
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,073
So, ever since I was young...

944
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:25,709
You know, almonds, peanuts...

945
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,979
When I was in the army,
while everyone was eating chips,

946
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,315
I went for a bag of roasted almonds.

947
00:38:31,316 --> 00:38:32,583
I bought those for myself.

948
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:34,985
Didn't you say you were going to buy
some pistachio?

949
00:38:34,986 --> 00:38:35,987
The nuts are here.

950
00:38:36,154 --> 00:38:37,454
(Nut lover spotted a nut shop.)

951
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:39,856
Pistachios are
the most expensive ones here.

952
00:38:39,857 --> 00:38:42,460
This area must be famous for pistachios.

953
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:45,196
(What do pistachios
from the Catania market taste like?)

954
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:46,931
- Gosh.
- Yum.

955
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:50,100
Tanto.

956
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:51,703
Tanto. It means to give me lots.

957
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:55,239
I really want to make
a dish or a dessert...

958
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,442
using nuts while in Sicily.

959
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:01,412
(Arancino's nutty transformation)

960
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:04,582
(Packed with Sicilian pistachios inside)

961
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:08,253
(Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
Pista-cino (Pistachio Arancino))

962
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:10,755
(Crunch)

963
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,459
(Nut lover has bought
a crazy amount of nuts.)

964
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:16,159
(Try this.)

965
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,294
It's so good.

966
00:39:17,295 --> 00:39:18,596
Pistachio.

967
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:21,798
(Nut Lover's Pistachio
1. Crush the pistachios in a plastic bag.)

968
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:23,100
You're not going to use all of this.

969
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:24,101
Not all of it, no.

970
00:39:24,102 --> 00:39:26,270
Parmigiano Reggiano.

971
00:39:26,271 --> 00:39:30,974
Didn't we have some celery left?

972
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:31,809
(They’re loud, but he’s locked in.)

973
00:39:31,943 --> 00:39:33,377
(When you crush pistachios,
the nuttiness doubles.)

974
00:39:33,378 --> 00:39:35,379
- It smells so nutty.
- What smell?

975
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,581
- The smell of crushed pistachios.
- Yeah?

976
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:38,983
I'm already losing...

977
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:40,784
with ingredients.

978
00:39:40,785 --> 00:39:42,152
(The nutty smell intimidates Kyung Ho.)

979
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:43,220
Nice.

980
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:44,522
(Already winning with the ingredients)

981
00:39:44,822 --> 00:39:47,892
(First, melt some butter
to make the pistachio base.)

982
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,627
Egg.

983
00:39:51,896 --> 00:39:54,299
(Add an egg to the melted butter.)

984
00:39:54,799 --> 00:39:59,871
(His key ingredient, pistachios)

985
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:04,042
(The crunchy, nutty pistachios
will boost the texture and flavor.)

986
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:06,710
(Parmesan cheese)

987
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:09,279
Su Young, do we have Parmigiano Reggiano?

988
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,781
You can use that one.

989
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:12,649
Use Grana Padano.

990
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,986
It's less cheesy
compared to Parmigiano Reggiano.

991
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:20,624
I think you have to age Grana Padano
to make Parmigiano Reggiano.

992
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,327
(Long-aged, deep-flavored Parmigiano
VS Soft and mellow Grana Padano)

993
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:24,529
Goodness.

994
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:26,663
Why?

995
00:40:26,664 --> 00:40:28,065
It smells amazing.

996
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:29,633
- Still quite cheesy?
- Yeah.

997
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:33,705
(2. Grate in Grana Padano
into the butter, egg, pistachio mixture.)

998
00:40:38,076 --> 00:40:41,478
(The cheese isn't grating?)

999
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:44,214
Why isn't this grating?

1000
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:45,315
What?

1001
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:47,618
Su Young, can I just add in pieces
and melt them?

1002
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,886
It'll melt, but it's better to grate it.

1003
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:51,356
It's not really grating.

1004
00:40:52,323 --> 00:40:55,093
Here, use this and gently grate like this.

1005
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,694
What?

1006
00:40:57,462 --> 00:40:59,763
(Grana Padano shreds smoothly and easy)

1007
00:40:59,764 --> 00:41:01,099
What?

1008
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,366
You used the wrong side, huh?

1009
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,102
Just gently like this.

1010
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:06,638
I must've used the wrong side.

1011
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:09,740
(Overly confident Kihyun)

1012
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:11,275
How stupid was that?

1013
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:14,512
(Overly clumsy Kihyun)

1014
00:41:14,946 --> 00:41:18,249
(Time to add Kihyun's kick)

1015
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,485
Could I use a bit of lemon zest?

1016
00:41:21,486 --> 00:41:22,552
Lemon zest?

1017
00:41:22,553 --> 00:41:23,987
You're going to add some lemon zest?

1018
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:24,989
Just a little.

1019
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,524
I liked it,

1020
00:41:27,525 --> 00:41:29,626
but I think it could get
a bit too heavy.

1021
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:32,529
So, I'm just going to add
a tiny bit of zest.

1022
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:35,867
(Lemon zest to lift the heaviness)

1023
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:37,802
I must be better at cooking now.

1024
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,440
(Preparing the rice, the core ingredient,
and he's watching closely...)

1025
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:45,642
(3. Mix the rice
with the lemon, pistachio sauce.)

1026
00:41:45,643 --> 00:41:47,011
This is pistachio?

1027
00:41:47,545 --> 00:41:49,981
Pistachio and butter.

1028
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:52,649
It looks pretty good.

1029
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,984
It does, right?

1030
00:41:53,985 --> 00:41:56,187
(Pressure's on)

1031
00:41:56,554 --> 00:42:00,058
(Done making the filling
for his Ryu-cipe)

1032
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:01,925
It smells like what we had earlier.

1033
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:03,828
Yeah? It looks good.

1034
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:07,565
I should start prepping the base here
so that it's super low-key.

1035
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,535
Hello.

1036
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:14,538
Thank you for joining me
at Yoon Kyung Ho's Cooking School.

1037
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:16,607
- Let's finish by eight o'clock.
- Okay.

1038
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:17,808
Since it's a new dish.

1039
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:18,842
(One moment, please.)

1040
00:42:18,843 --> 00:42:20,445
- Until eight?
- Yes.

1041
00:42:20,778 --> 00:42:21,913
That's two hours.

1042
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:24,748
Everyone, that's more than enough.

1043
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:27,618
Anyway, thank you for coming
to Yoon Kyung Ho's Cooking School.

1044
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,152
For today,

1045
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:31,022
I'm going to make
kimchi fried rice arancini.

1046
00:42:31,856 --> 00:42:35,459
Since arancino's shaped after the volcano,

1047
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,995
I wanted to add my own meaning.

1048
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:40,964
I want to add some Korean flair
and use a Korean base...

1049
00:42:40,965 --> 00:42:44,002
with Catania's ingredients
to build my Ryu-cipe.

1050
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:47,004
So, if I'm going Korean,

1051
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:48,239
It's Mount Halla.

1052
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,909
And when I thought about
what to put inside,

1053
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,477
I thought it'd be nice...

1054
00:42:53,478 --> 00:42:55,280
to use kimchi fried rice
since it's Korean.

1055
00:42:56,981 --> 00:42:58,415
Halla-cino.

1056
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:01,051
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe Halla-cino)

1057
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:02,519
The ingredients are simple.

1058
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,354
Anyone can easily make this at home.

1059
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:05,789
Dads can also easily make this...

1060
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,691
kimchi fried rice arancino.

1061
00:43:07,692 --> 00:43:10,193
Then, let's get started.

1062
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:11,261
Go, go.

1063
00:43:11,262 --> 00:43:12,596
Kyung Ho, why are you cheating?

1064
00:43:12,597 --> 00:43:13,830
Why are you running your own show?

1065
00:43:13,831 --> 00:43:16,833
No, it was too cramped over there,
so I moved here,

1066
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:18,902
but now,
the camera is right in front of me.

1067
00:43:18,903 --> 00:43:20,404
I'm directly looking at it.

1068
00:43:20,405 --> 00:43:21,973
It makes you feel like
you need to do something?

1069
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,844
Today’s all about capturing
that authentic Italian vibe, you know?

1070
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:30,647
So, I'm going to use celery
instead of scallions.

1071
00:43:30,648 --> 00:43:34,118
But at home,
you can use scallions or onions.

1072
00:43:34,652 --> 00:43:38,156
(Celery, red onion)

1073
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,525
Now, kimchi.

1074
00:43:41,426 --> 00:43:42,894
It should be cut into tiny pieces.

1075
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:47,632
(Chop the kimchi nice and small,
and prep about a cup.)

1076
00:43:47,932 --> 00:43:49,634
I'm just going to use the sink.

1077
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,071
Hey, something smells good.

1078
00:43:54,072 --> 00:43:55,173
(Glancing)

1079
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,575
(Glancing again)

1080
00:43:58,576 --> 00:43:59,744
Everything going well?

1081
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:01,579
I put some oil on my hands,

1082
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:03,648
so it's not sticking anymore.

1083
00:44:04,415 --> 00:44:06,718
(Kyung Ho pauses in deep thought.)

1084
00:44:10,188 --> 00:44:11,522
Should I boil these peas?

1085
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:17,028
(Green peas have caught
Kyung Ho's attention.)

1086
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:19,697
I need to do something.

1087
00:44:21,266 --> 00:44:23,268
Everyone's ingredients
are getting an upgrade,

1088
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:25,570
so should try adding some of these peas.

1089
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:28,605
(Kyung Ho's ingredients
are getting an upgrade too.)

1090
00:44:28,606 --> 00:44:31,009
All the prep is done now.

1091
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,245
(Rice Ho's Kimchi Fried Rice)

1092
00:44:34,246 --> 00:44:37,282
(1. Heat the oil, stir-fry
the prepped veggies.)

1093
00:44:37,548 --> 00:44:39,384
Still not sure about the peas.

1094
00:44:39,651 --> 00:44:42,586
I'm worried about
if the peas will cook through.

1095
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:43,955
They'll be cooked.

1096
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:47,759
(2. Add 1/3T sugar, 1T soy sauce,
2T pepperoncino, stir-fry.)

1097
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,729
(Anchovy sauce)

1098
00:44:52,096 --> 00:44:53,864
- Nice.
- Why?

1099
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:55,466
That's going to be nice.

1100
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:58,502
I'll add the kimchi to this.

1101
00:44:58,503 --> 00:45:02,840
(3. Once the veggies are cooked,
add a cup of finely chopped kimchi.)

1102
00:45:04,676 --> 00:45:07,779
(That heavenly scent of kimchi fried rice
that every Korean loves)

1103
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:10,582
I'm going to add some tuna to this.

1104
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:14,351
(Tuna?)

1105
00:45:14,352 --> 00:45:15,752
When we first visited
the Catania's market,

1106
00:45:15,753 --> 00:45:19,057
they were grilling swordfish.

1107
00:45:19,524 --> 00:45:20,624
(This morning,
it caught Kyung Ho's attention.)

1108
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:23,628
Let's try the grilled seafood right now.

1109
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:26,965
(Fresh swordfish,
flame-grilled to perfection)

1110
00:45:30,168 --> 00:45:31,568
It's soft.

1111
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:33,937
It's very chewy,

1112
00:45:33,938 --> 00:45:36,441
and it's still so juicy.

1113
00:45:37,075 --> 00:45:40,244
It made me want to use the swordfish
for my Ryu-cipe,

1114
00:45:40,245 --> 00:45:43,614
but I kept wondering
if I'd be able to use it properly,

1115
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,182
so I just went with tuna.

1116
00:45:45,183 --> 00:45:47,384
(K-dad's recipe!
Using canned tuna instead of swordfish)

1117
00:45:47,385 --> 00:45:49,219
That's going to be good.

1118
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,388
You've won already.

1119
00:45:51,923 --> 00:45:53,123
It already looks delicious.

1120
00:45:53,124 --> 00:45:55,026
The smell is already divine.

1121
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:58,363
- Using kimchi is cheating.
- It's over.

1122
00:45:58,596 --> 00:46:01,498
(Midway check by the recipe owner)

1123
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:05,103
(Very satisfied)

1124
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,138
I have a chance of winning today.

1125
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:08,472
I have a good feeling today.

1126
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:09,673
How can I beat your dish?

1127
00:46:09,674 --> 00:46:12,043
I just want to stuff my face
with it right now.

1128
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:16,546
Wait a minute, please.

1129
00:46:16,547 --> 00:46:18,382
When this becomes an arancini...

1130
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:21,052
When this gets shaped into an arancini,
it's going to be so good.

1131
00:46:21,586 --> 00:46:23,053
The smell is insane.

1132
00:46:23,054 --> 00:46:24,554
Yeah? That's good.

1133
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:26,057
Now you have to cool the rice.

1134
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,960
Then, I should shape the arancini.

1135
00:46:29,794 --> 00:46:31,996
(Scoop some onto your hand
and shape it.)

1136
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:33,498
You're both good.

1137
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:35,999
It is our third location after all.

1138
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,368
Now that it's been over a month,
you're both getting the hang of it.

1139
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:40,371
- It's been over a month.
- Yeah.

1140
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:42,172
Yeah, if you keep at it, you'll improve.

1141
00:46:42,173 --> 00:46:43,408
(Surprised)

1142
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:45,876
Goodness, that's going to be good
when that cheese melts.

1143
00:46:45,877 --> 00:46:47,745
(Even mozzarella inside the volcano?)

1144
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:49,046
Are you adding cheese?

1145
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:50,348
Of course.

1146
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:52,683
(Kyung Ho's not fully satisfied.)

1147
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,318
I wish there was a mold.

1148
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,686
- A mold?
- Yeah.

1149
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,989
- A cone-shaped mold.
- Cone-shaped?

1150
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:00,824
You want to make it into a cone shape?

1151
00:47:00,825 --> 00:47:01,992
Yeah.

1152
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:03,661
Should I use those? The cups?

1153
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:06,763
You're going to make them that big?

1154
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:10,034
(Kyung Ho has noticed the plastic cups.)

1155
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:14,539
(Shape the rice by packing it into a cup,
with cheese tucked inside.)

1156
00:47:15,473 --> 00:47:19,611
(It's super easy! Place it on a plate,
lift the cup, and you're done.)

1157
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:22,312
(Surprised)

1158
00:47:22,313 --> 00:47:23,547
How did you do it so well?

1159
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:25,382
I used the plastic cup as a mold.

1160
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:26,450
(After shaping it like a volcano,
dredging the rice ball)

1161
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:27,517
You're so good.

1162
00:47:27,518 --> 00:47:29,686
While watching you cook until now,

1163
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:32,123
I've learned that presentation
is just as important.

1164
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:36,059
Yours already tastes good
even without anything else.

1165
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,996
(It’s slowly taking shape.)

1166
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:40,897
It's fun to be working on
the same dish like today.

1167
00:47:40,898 --> 00:47:42,199
Yeah? You feel competitive, right?

1168
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,300
Yeah.

1169
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:44,868
They're the same but different.

1170
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:45,937
Right.

1171
00:47:46,971 --> 00:47:51,342
(Full-on competitive mode)

1172
00:47:52,644 --> 00:47:57,282
(Shaping the arancino
with a delicate touch)

1173
00:47:57,782 --> 00:48:00,985
(Then, into the heated oil)

1174
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,220
It doesn't go all the way in.

1175
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:06,457
(Being careful
so that it doesn't ruin the shape)

1176
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,425
The top part isn't in the oil.
Is this okay?

1177
00:48:08,426 --> 00:48:10,028
You can scoop it like this.

1178
00:48:13,164 --> 00:48:14,564
(Fry for 3:30 minutes
while scooping the oil onto the arancino.)

1179
00:48:14,565 --> 00:48:16,266
If I want to take these out...

1180
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:17,602
Should I use this?

1181
00:48:19,504 --> 00:48:21,204
(Get a stainless steel rack,
and you're ready to scoop them out.)

1182
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:23,641
Trusty container.

1183
00:48:24,742 --> 00:48:28,046
(Once golden and crispy, get them out
and shake off the excess oil.)

1184
00:48:29,113 --> 00:48:31,782
This container is very useful.

1185
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,384
It's nice.

1186
00:48:33,718 --> 00:48:35,753
I like it. It's super convenient.

1187
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:39,356
Now I know.

1188
00:48:39,357 --> 00:48:40,691
I'm good at frying.

1189
00:48:40,692 --> 00:48:43,027
You are definitely good at it.

1190
00:48:43,461 --> 00:48:45,529
Should we try one of mine?

1191
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,731
Yeah.

1192
00:48:47,432 --> 00:48:48,566
Split it open.

1193
00:48:50,234 --> 00:48:53,771
(Inside the crispy layer,
it's filled with tuna kimchi fried rice.)

1194
00:48:54,038 --> 00:48:56,573
(A picture-perfect dish
that wows instantly)

1195
00:48:56,574 --> 00:48:58,109
- Did the cheese melt?
- Yes.

1196
00:48:58,209 --> 00:48:59,977
- One bite, please.
- But I think I could use more cheese.

1197
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,212
The part with the cheese.

1198
00:49:01,546 --> 00:49:02,947
Then take a bite of this.

1199
00:49:04,182 --> 00:49:08,119
(The nerve-wracking first bite)

1200
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,088
(Curious)

1201
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:12,957
Yum.

1202
00:49:13,224 --> 00:49:15,026
- Is it okay?
- It's tasty.

1203
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:17,195
It's just straight-up, good flavor.

1204
00:49:18,196 --> 00:49:20,164
(Mouth wide open)

1205
00:49:20,898 --> 00:49:23,268
(Look at the melted cheese.)

1206
00:49:25,903 --> 00:49:28,806
(It's so good, it makes you chuckle.)

1207
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,874
It's crispy.

1208
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:31,942
(Lastly, Kyung Ho takes a bite too.)

1209
00:49:31,943 --> 00:49:33,077
It's good.

1210
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:35,979
It's good. Try it.

1211
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,782
It's delicious.
There's nothing more to say.

1212
00:49:39,984 --> 00:49:42,019
(Makes you automatically nod
in satisfaction)

1213
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,954
It's delicious.

1214
00:49:42,955 --> 00:49:44,289
It's very good.

1215
00:49:45,523 --> 00:49:47,558
- Yum!
- Thumbs up.

1216
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:49,559
- Yum!
- It's a thumbs up.

1217
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,594
It's delicious.

1218
00:49:50,595 --> 00:49:53,231
(Recharged his

1219
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:54,498
(Satisfied)

1220
00:49:54,499 --> 00:49:56,067
No, I'm not done yet.

1221
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:59,003
I need to top it with an egg.

1222
00:49:59,404 --> 00:50:01,505
(Almost forgot the most important part)

1223
00:50:01,506 --> 00:50:02,540
Eggs and some Parmesan.

1224
00:50:04,342 --> 00:50:07,845
(A yolk dropped
right on the volcano peak.)

1225
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:13,051
(It's really done
once you grate some cheese on it.)

1226
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:15,485
(Attention)

1227
00:50:15,486 --> 00:50:16,621
Are you a chef?

1228
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:20,157
- What is going on?
- What is happening?

1229
00:50:20,158 --> 00:50:21,825
(Satisfied)

1230
00:50:21,826 --> 00:50:24,362
This is the arancino I wanted to make.

1231
00:50:25,229 --> 00:50:26,663
(Final version of Kyung Ho's arancino)

1232
00:50:26,664 --> 00:50:28,566
This is good.

1233
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:32,302
I said you should mentally prepare.

1234
00:50:32,303 --> 00:50:33,438
Are you serious?

1235
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:35,340
I'm sorry.

1236
00:50:36,975 --> 00:50:38,508
I present to you,

1237
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:41,445
reinterpretation of arancino,

1238
00:50:41,446 --> 00:50:42,646
with Jeju-do as the background,

1239
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:44,616
Halla-cino.

1240
00:50:45,683 --> 00:50:47,150
(Inspired by Mount Etna)

1241
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:50,688
(Halla-cino was inspired by Mount Halla.)

1242
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:55,426
(The savory yolk represents
Baeknokdam at the summit.)

1243
00:50:56,027 --> 00:50:59,564
(Cheese representing
the snowy peak of Mount Halla)

1244
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:00,643
(Halla-cino / 1. Stir-fry 3T celery,
3T red onion, 3T green pea...)

1245
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:01,132
(2T pepperoncino, 1/3T sugar,
1T anchovy sauce)

1246
00:51:01,132 --> 00:51:01,953
(2. Add 1 cup kimchi,
1 canned tuna, 1T water.)

1247
00:51:01,954 --> 00:51:02,934
(3. Make rice balls
and add mozzarella in the middle.)

1248
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,036
(4. Shape it, dredge, fry.
5. Add a yolk, Parmesan on top.)

1249
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,472
Kyung Ho, it's really pretty.

1250
00:51:08,373 --> 00:51:09,373
It's so pretty.

1251
00:51:09,374 --> 00:51:12,310
(Feeling great)

1252
00:51:13,077 --> 00:51:14,812
Good-looking food tastes better.

1253
00:51:16,214 --> 00:51:18,215
(Can't stop smiling)

1254
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:20,084
- It's good. Respect.
- It's good?

1255
00:51:20,551 --> 00:51:22,586
It's incredibly delicious.

1256
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:24,155
(Su Young's compliment continues.)

1257
00:51:24,322 --> 00:51:26,089
(I'm so proud of myself.)

1258
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,859
A little arrogant, no?

1259
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,995
No, I'm just taking a break
because I'm tired.

1260
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,364
Something feels different.

1261
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:39,404
I think being efficient while cooking
is important too.

1262
00:51:39,704 --> 00:51:41,471
What do I do? Su Young?

1263
00:51:41,472 --> 00:51:42,640
- Why?
- Su Young...

1264
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:45,944
(When things got tough,
Kyung Ho turned to Su Young.)

1265
00:51:46,377 --> 00:51:51,983
(Ryu-GPT was always there to help.)

1266
00:51:52,183 --> 00:51:54,318
Cooking is hard. It is hard.

1267
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,554
(Cooking wasn't easy for Kyung Ho.)

1268
00:51:57,021 --> 00:51:59,523
We want to make it easy
so that people can try it at home.

1269
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:00,792
It just has to taste good.

1270
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:04,127
Cooking should be fast and efficient.

1271
00:52:04,128 --> 00:52:05,430
(Seriously?)

1272
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:07,432
(Flinch)

1273
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:11,134
Might as well lie down on the floor.

1274
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,403
No, no.

1275
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,105
I didn't even know I was sliding off.

1276
00:52:16,874 --> 00:52:19,343
A culinary study abroad?

1277
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,578
No big deal.

1278
00:52:26,084 --> 00:52:27,951
I'm always thinking of the boys.

1279
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:29,519
I should be doing better,
even if just by a bit.

1280
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,554
I have that pressure.

1281
00:52:30,555 --> 00:52:32,656
I can't lose to them.

1282
00:52:32,657 --> 00:52:37,261
I thought I've seen
all the fresh seafood markets,

1283
00:52:37,262 --> 00:52:39,596
but this place
is number one for freshness.

1284
00:52:39,597 --> 00:52:41,332
(Number one freshness,
Catania fish market's seafood)

1285
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:45,869
(A seafood paradise fresh enough to make
Su Young, Hulk of the kitchen, go wild.)

1286
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,138
So, Eo-rancino.

1287
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:50,674
I'm Eo Nam Seon, so it's Eo-rancino.

1288
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:52,209
(Impressed)

1289
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,613
I thought the squid
would go well with the cream sauce.

1290
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:59,917
I said I was a chef,

1291
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:01,285
and they gave me these shrimps.

1292
00:53:01,286 --> 00:53:02,986
- Just these two?
- Yeah, these big shrimps.

1293
00:53:02,987 --> 00:53:04,655
These are a couple of dollars each.

1294
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:05,989
Should Kihyun and I have one each?

1295
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,059
No.

1296
00:53:08,459 --> 00:53:10,093
We'll eat it later.
You can taste it then.

1297
00:53:10,094 --> 00:53:11,261
Let me cook it first.

1298
00:53:11,262 --> 00:53:14,432
(Saved from the boys, the fresh shrimp
and squid are ready to be cooked.)

1299
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,935
(Drop)

1300
00:53:17,135 --> 00:53:18,902
(What did he add to the melted butter?)

1301
00:53:18,903 --> 00:53:20,104
Gosh.

1302
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:22,272
(Shrimp heads, shells, and guts)

1303
00:53:22,273 --> 00:53:23,907
The head and the guts are tasty.

1304
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:28,145
I'm going to cook the heads,
shells, and gut in butter...

1305
00:53:28,146 --> 00:53:30,814
and make a concentrated seafood base.

1306
00:53:30,815 --> 00:53:32,617
That will have so much flavor.

1307
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:38,288
Then, add béchamel...

1308
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:40,223
(Smooth cream sauce made with butter,
garlic, flour, milk, and tuna sauce)

1309
00:53:40,224 --> 00:53:42,993
That's going inside the arancini?

1310
00:53:42,994 --> 00:53:44,294
I think it's looking good.

1311
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:45,396
(Success is in the air!)

1312
00:53:45,763 --> 00:53:49,534
(A flavor-packed seafood cream sauce)

1313
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:51,936
What's that?

1314
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,303
If you add some canned corn...

1315
00:53:53,304 --> 00:53:55,272
(Canned corn)

1316
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,242
I added some canned corn for texture.

1317
00:53:58,243 --> 00:53:59,476
Then, I shaped and fried it.

1318
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:00,877
If you add some canned corn...

1319
00:54:00,878 --> 00:54:02,145
(Add some sweet and nutty canned corn.)

1320
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:04,048
They will burst in your mouth.

1321
00:54:04,716 --> 00:54:05,716
Get your nose in there and take a whiff.

1322
00:54:05,717 --> 00:54:07,150
It smells so good.

1323
00:54:07,151 --> 00:54:09,086
(Sniff)

1324
00:54:09,087 --> 00:54:10,421
It looks so good.

1325
00:54:10,822 --> 00:54:12,155
Let's add some black peppers and wait.

1326
00:54:12,156 --> 00:54:13,258
Not yet.

1327
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,461
(Quickly gives up)

1328
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,029
I'll wait.

1329
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,699
(Wait just a moment.)

1330
00:54:25,336 --> 00:54:26,371
(Whoosh)

1331
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:29,239
(What's that sound?)

1332
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,375
(Got up right away out of curiosity)

1333
00:54:31,376 --> 00:54:33,044
(What's Su Young doing?)

1334
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:35,345
Black rice?

1335
00:54:35,346 --> 00:54:36,446
You're using black rice?

1336
00:54:36,447 --> 00:54:37,849
That's cheating.

1337
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:41,552
(Su Young's secret kick was black rice.)

1338
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:43,520
When you make rice with Italian rice,

1339
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:46,390
the texture is a bit rough
compared to what we're familiar with.

1340
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:49,059
So I thought about how I could use
smoother rice to make my Eo-rancino.

1341
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,560
I chose black rice at first, and...

1342
00:54:50,561 --> 00:54:51,963
(Black Rice)

1343
00:54:51,964 --> 00:54:56,167
(Just the right amount of chew and fluff,
it holds its shape with a great texture.)

1344
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,534
You're using black rice?

1345
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,802
That's cheating.

1346
00:54:58,803 --> 00:55:01,071
I didn't know they'd have black rice.

1347
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:02,307
I'm rice-ing to the occasion.

1348
00:55:04,142 --> 00:55:06,109
I should stop laughing at his jokes.

1349
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,244
Ta-da.

1350
00:55:07,245 --> 00:55:09,279
(The black rice is ready,
and he's done prepping the ingredients.)

1351
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,481
It's rice.

1352
00:55:10,915 --> 00:55:11,982
It's not cooked yet.

1353
00:55:11,983 --> 00:55:14,084
Shoot. I messed up. What do I do?

1354
00:55:14,085 --> 00:55:15,285
Why?

1355
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:16,821
- The rice isn't done?
- It's not done.

1356
00:55:17,155 --> 00:55:18,489
This isn't good.

1357
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:21,092
The stove must've been off.

1358
00:55:21,793 --> 00:55:23,660
I thought I had it on low heat,
but I think it was turned off.

1359
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:24,929
How could it still be this raw?

1360
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:26,598
Goodness.

1361
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:28,466
- What do I do?
- It's okay.

1362
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:29,800
You can save it.

1363
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:33,136
When everyone says that you can't,

1364
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:34,404
shout that you can.

1365
00:55:34,405 --> 00:55:35,873
I'm Eo Nam Seon.

1366
00:55:36,174 --> 00:55:38,376
I'm Eo Nam Seon.

1367
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:41,646
Hey, that's too much.

1368
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,747
Get ready! I'll save you.

1369
00:55:43,748 --> 00:55:44,849
Yeah?

1370
00:55:46,251 --> 00:55:48,051
When everyone says
that the rice is dead...

1371
00:55:48,052 --> 00:55:49,487
(Save the black rice.)

1372
00:55:49,754 --> 00:55:51,656
(How will he do it?)

1373
00:55:51,756 --> 00:55:54,292
(Cover it with a lid and rest it
so that the steam doesn't escape.)

1374
00:55:54,993 --> 00:55:56,861
(Check after 10 more minutes.)

1375
00:55:57,161 --> 00:56:01,132
(Was it saved?)

1376
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:03,935
I don't think this will work.

1377
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:05,903
(Black rice fail)

1378
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:07,672
I messed up.

1379
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:09,339
The black rice...

1380
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,507
doesn't stick to each other.

1381
00:56:10,508 --> 00:56:12,160
It's even less stickier than barley,

1382
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,379
and I was going to use it
for making arancino.

1383
00:56:15,346 --> 00:56:16,680
That was a big mistake I made.

1384
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:19,349
I should’ve researched
black rice a bit more.

1385
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,318
It was my fault.

1386
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,452
I was being arrogant.

1387
00:56:22,353 --> 00:56:24,221
I'm just going to borrow some white rice.

1388
00:56:24,222 --> 00:56:26,523
- Yeah, we made enough.
- Thanks.

1389
00:56:26,524 --> 00:56:27,991
It must be upsetting.

1390
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:29,160
It's okay.

1391
00:56:30,995 --> 00:56:35,166
(The most heartbroken face
of the whole study abroad journey)

1392
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,971
(Mix the white rice
with the seafood cream sauce.)

1393
00:56:40,338 --> 00:56:43,241
(I have to make this work.)

1394
00:56:43,641 --> 00:56:46,878
(Using both of his hands
to shape the Eo-rancino.)

1395
00:56:47,912 --> 00:56:50,581
(Shaped like a giant ball)

1396
00:56:50,582 --> 00:56:53,116
Su Young's is this big.

1397
00:56:53,117 --> 00:56:54,885
- Su Young's?
- His is this big.

1398
00:56:54,886 --> 00:56:57,487
I just tried to stick to the basics...

1399
00:56:57,488 --> 00:56:59,490
for the shape.

1400
00:57:00,058 --> 00:57:01,124
(The huge size is his last weapon.)

1401
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:03,127
They have to be similar in shape
for them to cook evenly.

1402
00:57:03,661 --> 00:57:07,365
(I need to fry them well.)

1403
00:57:07,832 --> 00:57:11,102
(Carefully placing them in oil,
one by one)

1404
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:15,939
(Sizzling into that perfect golden brown)

1405
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,742
It smells good.

1406
00:57:18,076 --> 00:57:19,676
You can't go wrong with frying something.

1407
00:57:19,677 --> 00:57:21,012
(Crispy and crunchy, fried to perfection)

1408
00:57:21,846 --> 00:57:25,283
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe Eo-rancino)

1409
00:57:25,783 --> 00:57:27,551
(Eo-rancino /
1. Clean and prep 1 squid, 2 shrimps.)

1410
00:57:27,552 --> 00:57:29,086
(2. Add the shrimp heads, shells, and gut.
3. Take out heads, shells, add the sauce.)

1411
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,756
(4. Add the cleaned squid, shrimp, cook.
5. Add canned corn, shape it, fry.)

1412
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,893
(Su Young is unsatisfied
from failing his black rice.)

1413
00:57:36,928 --> 00:57:38,028
Should I make two versions?

1414
00:57:38,029 --> 00:57:39,396
Just do one.

1415
00:57:39,397 --> 00:57:41,398
Think of us too, Su Young.

1416
00:57:41,399 --> 00:57:42,699
Two versions...
I think it'll be fun.

1417
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,335
- I think I can be quick.
- Yeah?

1418
00:57:45,069 --> 00:57:46,271
There's some squid left.

1419
00:57:47,305 --> 00:57:49,007
I should make some
last-minute fried squid.

1420
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,875
That'll be good.

1421
00:57:51,976 --> 00:57:58,449
(2. Fry it in between 170 to 180℃.)

1422
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,550
The fried squid smells nice.

1423
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:02,487
- It's nice.
- Yes.

1424
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:04,821
I love it.

1425
00:58:04,822 --> 00:58:06,257
I love fried squid.

1426
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:13,765
(3. Take it out
once golden brown and crunchy.)

1427
00:58:14,499 --> 00:58:18,069
(Super fast fried squid done)

1428
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,377
(The kick of fried squid)

1429
00:58:26,744 --> 00:58:28,011
You're making popcorn?

1430
00:58:28,012 --> 00:58:29,080
Yeah.

1431
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,714
(Popcorn for a special fried squid)

1432
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,950
(Pop!)

1433
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:34,218
So cute.

1434
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,723
(Fried squid with popcorn?)

1435
00:58:39,624 --> 00:58:41,092
Polpo corn.

1436
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:42,526
That's good.

1437
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:43,860
It's just grilled octopus,

1438
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:45,262
but they tossed it in popcorn.

1439
00:58:45,263 --> 00:58:46,330
And with what?

1440
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:48,433
With teriyaki mayonnaise.

1441
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,204
I thought it'd be fun
to tweak it a little.

1442
00:58:53,671 --> 00:58:56,407
(Get ready for the ultimate
drinking snack, popcorn squid.)

1443
00:58:57,508 --> 00:58:58,676
The sound is fun.

1444
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:03,581
(Blend until the popcorn
becomes a powder.)

1445
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,917
He's making popcorn himself
instead of using a ready-made one.

1446
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,118
It'll taste better that way.

1447
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:09,319
(The popcorn tastes better
when you make it yourself.)

1448
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,055
Ready-made popcorn can be soggy.

1449
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,056
(The fried squid
and popcorn powder are ready.)

1450
00:59:13,057 --> 00:59:14,491
Squid popcorn.

1451
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:15,893
(The fried squid
and popcorn powder are ready.)

1452
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:18,563
(Don't forget the sauce!
Here's a special mayonnaise sauce.)

1453
00:59:18,863 --> 00:59:23,167
(There are only three ingredients
in this special mayonnaise sauce.)

1454
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:25,302
(Mayonnaise, tuna sauce, sugar)

1455
00:59:25,303 --> 00:59:26,871
Try the mayonnaise sauce. It's good.

1456
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,439
I just have a bit on my finger right now.

1457
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,974
- Gosh.
- Good, right?

1458
00:59:30,975 --> 00:59:33,076
I've never tasted
anything like this before.

1459
00:59:33,077 --> 00:59:36,747
I've only had mayonnaise with soy sauce.

1460
00:59:36,748 --> 00:59:39,217
This tastes very modern.

1461
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,454
What is this?

1462
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,022
Why is this so good?

1463
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,124
(Relief)

1464
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,293
I just thought to quickly fry the squid...

1465
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,961
and make a dish similar to what we had.

1466
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,763
- Amazing.
- If you...

1467
00:59:52,764 --> 00:59:56,700
try cooking the squid this way,

1468
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:58,368
I think it'd be nice to do it at home.

1469
00:59:58,369 --> 01:00:00,003
I'm going to try the one
you dropped right here.

1470
01:00:00,004 --> 01:00:01,439
I'll give you one.

1471
01:00:02,173 --> 01:00:05,176
(Anticipating)

1472
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,212
(The power of the Kitchen Hulk,
as expected of Eo Nam Seon)

1473
01:00:09,213 --> 01:00:10,715
It's good, right?

1474
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,084
- It's not salty?
- No.

1475
01:00:14,085 --> 01:00:16,186
It's interesting.
The moment you eat it,

1476
01:00:16,187 --> 01:00:17,721
I suddenly crave a glass of beer.

1477
01:00:17,722 --> 01:00:20,724
- You need beer for this.
- Yeah?

1478
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:23,160
This is so good. Why is this so good?

1479
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,495
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

1480
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:28,066
(Upgraded nuttiness
with crunchy fried squid and popcorn)

1481
01:00:28,466 --> 01:00:32,036
(An insane combination
of savory, nutty, and sweet)

1482
01:00:32,537 --> 01:00:36,573
(Su Young's Ultimate Drinking Snack
Popcorn Squid)

1483
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:37,574
Let's try one.

1484
01:00:37,575 --> 01:00:38,942
So, the lemon...

1485
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:40,678
You don't need to drizzle it.

1486
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:42,512
You can if you want though.

1487
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,748
(First, they go for
the freshly fried squid.)

1488
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,317
(They both try it at the same time.)

1489
01:00:46,918 --> 01:00:47,985
(A perfect collaboration
of popcorn and fried shrimp)

1490
01:00:47,986 --> 01:00:50,021
The texture of this popcorn
and the squid is out of this world.

1491
01:00:50,655 --> 01:00:52,123
(Hurry up and try it.)

1492
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:54,158
- Su Young, this is crazy.
- It's so juicy.

1493
01:00:54,726 --> 01:00:56,560
- It's good.
- It's good, right?

1494
01:00:56,561 --> 01:00:58,362
- The seasoning is just right too.
- Why is this so good?

1495
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,429
The seasoning is just right too.

1496
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,999
And you made the popcorn yourself.

1497
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,334
So, it's different from the popcorn
we get at theaters.

1498
01:01:04,335 --> 01:01:05,970
It hasn't been seasoned,

1499
01:01:06,337 --> 01:01:07,638
so they go so well together.

1500
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:09,107
Yeah, these go so well together.

1501
01:01:09,607 --> 01:01:11,041
Good thing we tried those dishes
in the morning.

1502
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,777
If we hadn't,
I wouldn't have thought of this.

1503
01:01:13,511 --> 01:01:16,447
You could totally sell this
on the street in Catania.

1504
01:01:18,182 --> 01:01:19,984
It's even better with lemon juice.

1505
01:01:21,152 --> 01:01:23,020
With lemon juice,

1506
01:01:23,021 --> 01:01:27,125
you can really taste the mayonnaise sauce.

1507
01:01:27,859 --> 01:01:30,761
- Su Young, compared to the polpo...
- It's better,

1508
01:01:30,762 --> 01:01:32,030
It's so much better, right?

1509
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:34,498
- It's good.
- It's really good.

1510
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:36,234
This one’s on another level.

1511
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,401
It's so delicious.

1512
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,170
I personally think
the squid tastes better than the octopus.

1513
01:01:40,171 --> 01:01:41,638
When you make this dish.

1514
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:43,607
It doesn't have to be an octopus, huh?

1515
01:01:43,608 --> 01:01:45,375
Plus, that was grilled.

1516
01:01:45,376 --> 01:01:47,144
You can beat it when it's fried.

1517
01:01:47,145 --> 01:01:48,145
I fried it a little.

1518
01:01:48,146 --> 01:01:49,614
Less than three minutes.

1519
01:01:49,781 --> 01:01:52,583
- If you don't claim this recipe...
- Someone else?

1520
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,485
CGV is going to steal it.

1521
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,888
If we can have this in the theater,
it'd be so great.

1522
01:01:57,889 --> 01:01:59,757
I would go to the theater to have this.

1523
01:02:00,124 --> 01:02:02,160
This could bankrupt
a movie theater snack bar.

1524
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,362
Shall we try the arancini?

1525
01:02:05,363 --> 01:02:06,664
Arancini.

1526
01:02:06,965 --> 01:02:08,899
- Should we start with Kihyun's?
- Sure.

1527
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,968
I think mine will be the mildest,
so we should eat it first.

1528
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:12,770
They're all shaped differently.

1529
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:17,308
(A collaboration of nutty pistachio
with tangy lemon)

1530
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:20,844
If you look closely,
I also added some pistachio outside.

1531
01:02:20,845 --> 01:02:22,080
I you look here...

1532
01:02:23,481 --> 01:02:25,483
It's totally crunchy.

1533
01:02:26,184 --> 01:02:26,985
(Crunch)

1534
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:30,989
(Crunch)

1535
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:36,860
The one Kihyun made...

1536
01:02:36,861 --> 01:02:38,162
is better than the restaurant one.

1537
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,197
You should just settle down here.

1538
01:02:40,198 --> 01:02:41,699
This is good.

1539
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:43,834
Why is it good?

1540
01:02:43,835 --> 01:02:44,902
Why is it so delicious?

1541
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:47,237
This is better, don't you think?

1542
01:02:47,238 --> 01:02:48,472
Should we open a restaurant?

1543
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,640
This is good.

1544
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:50,842
Good job. You did well.

1545
01:02:51,676 --> 01:02:53,944
(Eating)

1546
01:02:53,945 --> 01:02:56,314
(Eating some more)

1547
01:02:56,848 --> 01:03:00,051
(You can't stop eating
Kihyun's Lemon Pista-cino.)

1548
01:03:00,218 --> 01:03:02,819
Do you taste the lemon?

1549
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,022
I do, and something's popping in there.

1550
01:03:05,023 --> 01:03:07,658
I grated some lemon zest.

1551
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:08,926
I saw you adding that.

1552
01:03:08,927 --> 01:03:10,994
There wasn't any lemon
in the restaurant one.

1553
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,530
They didn't use lemon.

1554
01:03:12,797 --> 01:03:14,798
Adding lemon was a genius move.

1555
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,634
It pops in your mouth,
so how should I say this?

1556
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:19,336
It tastes alive.

1557
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,172
I could have two or three of these easily.

1558
01:03:21,472 --> 01:03:22,573
I'm happy.

1559
01:03:22,574 --> 01:03:24,442
- It's delicious.
- When the juice comes out...

1560
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:26,343
Which one should we have next?

1561
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,879
Mine.

1562
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:32,550
(Kyung Ho's Koreanized Arancino,
made by K-dad hands)

1563
01:03:33,117 --> 01:03:36,054
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe Halla-cino)

1564
01:03:36,554 --> 01:03:39,924
(Halla-cino, inspired by Mount Halla,
looks as perfect as it tastes)

1565
01:03:40,258 --> 01:03:41,192
Pop it for us.

1566
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,795
(Must pop the yolk first)

1567
01:03:44,262 --> 01:03:46,764
(So excited)

1568
01:03:46,898 --> 01:03:48,465
This is straight-up volcano lava.

1569
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:50,168
The volcano has erupted.

1570
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:51,568
Kyung Ho,

1571
01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:53,870
so do I get some yolk
and get a spoonful like this?

1572
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:56,673
- No, you need to push it down.
- Push it down?

1573
01:03:56,674 --> 01:03:58,442
So that it goes into the rice.

1574
01:03:58,443 --> 01:03:59,576
Yes.

1575
01:03:59,577 --> 01:04:01,179
This is insane.

1576
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,916
(Splits it open so that the yolk
gets mixed in with the rice)

1577
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:07,184
I wanted to add this inside, but...

1578
01:04:07,185 --> 01:04:09,153
(A combination that has to be good
with creamy yolk and Kyung Ho's arancino)

1579
01:04:11,789 --> 01:04:13,057
(Fork drop)

1580
01:04:13,825 --> 01:04:15,026
(Surprised)

1581
01:04:16,828 --> 01:04:18,363
Nobody can win against this.

1582
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,864
It's touching my cells.

1583
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:22,933
It's waking them up.
They're springing to life.

1584
01:04:22,934 --> 01:04:24,401
(Very satisfied)

1585
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,936
Did you add any cream sauce?

1586
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:27,271
- No.
- No, right?

1587
01:04:27,272 --> 01:04:29,507
But it still tastes like kimchi risotto.

1588
01:04:30,008 --> 01:04:33,378
(It tastes like risotto even though
he didn't add any cream sauce?)

1589
01:04:34,345 --> 01:04:36,714
Why is it like that?

1590
01:04:37,382 --> 01:04:38,583
I don't know.

1591
01:04:38,983 --> 01:04:41,752
Wait, it's because of the yolk.

1592
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,022
- Right?
- The yolk acts like a cream sauce.

1593
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:48,759
(The runny yolk like lava)

1594
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,630
(Made the creamy texture)

1595
01:04:54,165 --> 01:04:55,934
- It's so good.
- Yeah?

1596
01:04:57,568 --> 01:05:00,103
There's green peas and lots of veggies,

1597
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,471
so the taste is so flavorful.

1598
01:05:01,472 --> 01:05:02,940
(Green peas and veggies
come together for a flavor explosion.)

1599
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,408
You added celery, right?

1600
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:05,909
- You taste it, right?
- Yeah, I do.

1601
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:08,078
It's because you added celery.

1602
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,681
That's why we get that crunchy texture.

1603
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,415
It's delicious.

1604
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:13,318
- Thank you, everyone.
- It's tasty.

1605
01:05:14,218 --> 01:05:15,519
Is it time for today's highlight?

1606
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,887
Wait a minute. I need to...

1607
01:05:16,888 --> 01:05:19,156
(Su Young's arancino is on hold?)

1608
01:05:19,157 --> 01:05:20,324
Wait a minute. I need to...

1609
01:05:20,325 --> 01:05:22,126
Now that I've had yours,

1610
01:05:24,195 --> 01:05:26,330
- I've been inspired.
- What do you mean?

1611
01:05:26,331 --> 01:05:28,365
Both of yours were so tasty,
so I can't...

1612
01:05:28,366 --> 01:05:29,666
It tastes very simple and clean, you know?

1613
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:31,501
I packed it with umami flavors.

1614
01:05:31,502 --> 01:05:33,103
- You seem nervous today.
- I am.

1615
01:05:33,104 --> 01:05:34,771
So, I'm quickly going to whip up a sauce.

1616
01:05:34,772 --> 01:05:36,306
Just wait a minute.

1617
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,741
I just need a minute.

1618
01:05:37,742 --> 01:05:39,776
Seeing that he's nervous...

1619
01:05:39,777 --> 01:05:41,311
I am nervous.

1620
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:44,581
My determination made him nervous,

1621
01:05:44,582 --> 01:05:46,851
but seeing him like this is making me sad.

1622
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:51,923
(Kihyun's Lemon Pista-cino was delicious.)

1623
01:05:52,423 --> 01:05:55,326
(Kyung Ho's Halla-cino
also received great reviews.)

1624
01:05:56,094 --> 01:05:58,796
(With every bite,
Su Young’s thoughts got heavier.)

1625
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:03,200
The boys did so well.

1626
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:06,104
I thought it couldn’t measure up to them
if I just left mine as it was.

1627
01:06:06,437 --> 01:06:07,504
I thought of what I should do.

1628
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,306
I've had an idea for a while...

1629
01:06:09,307 --> 01:06:12,075
of combining gim (seaweed) with mayonnaise
to make a Cheongyang and gim mayo sauce.

1630
01:06:12,076 --> 01:06:13,610
I've always thought that...

1631
01:06:13,611 --> 01:06:15,879
it'd be fun to make that
since I've never seen it anywhere.

1632
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,748
But I didn't have any Cheongyang peppers,

1633
01:06:17,749 --> 01:06:19,117
so I blended some jalapeños.

1634
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,319
This is going to be so easy
to make it at home too.

1635
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,621
You can make it at home.

1636
01:06:25,256 --> 01:06:28,126
(Jala-gim Mayo
1. Mince 2T of jalapeño or Cheongyang.)

1637
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,662
Mayonnaise and lemon juice.

1638
01:06:33,131 --> 01:06:40,004
(2. Mix 4T mayonnaise, 2T lemon juice,
2/3 tuna sauce.)

1639
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,874
Then some water and a little bit of sugar.

1640
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,476
(What's next?)

1641
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,679
You're adding the ones with salt, right?

1642
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:49,246
For now, yes.

1643
01:06:49,247 --> 01:06:51,615
I think the non-seasoned ones
would be nice too, but...

1644
01:06:51,616 --> 01:06:52,750
(If you don't have any seasoned gim,
use non-seasoned ones.)

1645
01:06:53,451 --> 01:06:56,421
(Blend the gim to make a powder.)

1646
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,991
- All blended.
- So cool.

1647
01:07:00,692 --> 01:07:02,726
Isn't gim like Korea's parsley?

1648
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:06,096
Really? I never thought of using
dried gim like that.

1649
01:07:06,097 --> 01:07:07,230
Gim mayo.

1650
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,967
How did he think of this?

1651
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:11,369
I think this will work.
Let's put it on the arancino.

1652
01:07:12,036 --> 01:07:13,236
(Looking crazy good)

1653
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:15,139
So it looks like this, huh?

1654
01:07:16,107 --> 01:07:17,241
Should we split it open?

1655
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,409
- Yeah, let's split one open.
- Go for it.

1656
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,044
(Goes for it with a fork)

1657
01:07:21,045 --> 01:07:22,446
It already smells good.

1658
01:07:22,447 --> 01:07:23,815
The smell, gosh.

1659
01:07:24,449 --> 01:07:25,482
(Cannot take your eyes off of it)

1660
01:07:25,483 --> 01:07:27,285
- What's with the filling?
- Try it.

1661
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:28,919
Thank you, Su Young.

1662
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,956
(It's finally time to taste
Su Young's Eo-rancino.)

1663
01:07:33,124 --> 01:07:35,893
(A big bite)

1664
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:38,996
Goodness.

1665
01:07:38,997 --> 01:07:41,565
Su Young, this is a hotel-quality food.

1666
01:07:41,566 --> 01:07:43,301
It's a dish they sell at five-star hotels.

1667
01:07:47,005 --> 01:07:51,409
(Kyung Ho is speechless after a bite.)

1668
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,077
Why is your face turning red?

1669
01:07:54,879 --> 01:07:56,648
This is a flavor I love.

1670
01:07:57,815 --> 01:08:00,919
It's upsetting to me
that I have no choice but to admit this.

1671
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:02,719
I can't argue with this.

1672
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,855
(Happy)

1673
01:08:04,856 --> 01:08:07,291
This would sell well.

1674
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:11,094
It's like gimbap (rice roll),
but tangy.

1675
01:08:11,095 --> 01:08:14,431
It's deep, but the flavors are...

1676
01:08:14,432 --> 01:08:18,001
Familiar tastes have been mixed
with something new.

1677
01:08:18,002 --> 01:08:21,538
You're so good at making sauces.

1678
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:23,307
You're good at finding what works.

1679
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:26,643
You just thought of this mayonnaise sauce
on the spot,

1680
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:27,978
so how does it go so well
with the arancino?

1681
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,180
You just thought of this in your head
without tasting it.

1682
01:08:30,181 --> 01:08:31,315
I was scared.

1683
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,649
Yeah, you were scared,

1684
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,118
but you knew that this combination
would work well with this dish.

1685
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:36,354
Are you a genius?

1686
01:08:36,788 --> 01:08:39,090
(Feeling ecstatic)

1687
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:41,659
Everything tastes so good.
I'm so happy.

1688
01:08:42,627 --> 01:08:44,895
Hey, doesn’t it feel like
today’s study abroad was a success?

1689
01:08:44,896 --> 01:08:45,929
Totally.

1690
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,166
We've really grown, right?

1691
01:08:48,766 --> 01:08:52,703
The world is definitely big,
and there's so much to eat.

1692
01:08:52,704 --> 01:08:53,904
So many cool dishes.

1693
01:08:53,905 --> 01:08:56,708
(Three unique flavors,
arancino Ryu-cipes a total success!)

1694
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,577
(Now, the trio
has even come to a volcano.)

1695
01:08:59,911 --> 01:09:02,380
(Ryu-cipe made with snow
from the volcano?)

1696
01:09:03,214 --> 01:09:06,451
(Made with the trio's sweat and struggle)

1697
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,519
(Traditional granita)

1698
01:09:08,653 --> 01:09:10,421
(It tastes better after a struggle.)

1699
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:13,958
(Going deeper to look for tradition)

1700
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,227
(Found the Sicilian local meal master
in the mountains)

1701
01:09:16,261 --> 01:09:17,527
(Traditional carbonara)

1702
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,829
(Traditional braised eggplant)

1703
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:19,897
(Traditional meatball)

1704
01:09:20,164 --> 01:09:21,766
(Three sets of local meals)

1705
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:25,168
(Up close and personal
with the master of local meals)

1706
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:27,871
(With a touch of Sicilian magic)

1707
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:31,809
(Crushed it)

1708
01:09:32,143 --> 01:09:34,112
(It's time to execute!)

1709
01:09:34,412 --> 01:09:36,014
(Kihyun goes for the meatballs.)

1710
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,049
(Even Su Young has admitted
his ultimate cooking skills.)

1711
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,118
(But you haven't reached my level yet.)

1712
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,185
(Su Young's braised eggplant)

1713
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:43,855
(And a collaboration
with donkatsu (fried pork))

1714
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:45,290
(Another masterpiece in the making)

1715
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:46,958
(No words needed for this taste)

1716
01:09:47,358 --> 01:09:49,894
(But is Kyung Ho struggling?)

1717
01:09:50,428 --> 01:09:54,132
(Is Cooking Fairy Kyung Ho
going to fail his Ryu-cipe?)

1718
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,668
(Will he be able to overcome it?)

1719
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:59,903
You wanted to taste the Ryu-cipes, right?

1720
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,906
The three boys will go to you.

1721
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,376
It's a familiar but new flavor.

1722
01:10:06,377 --> 01:10:10,614
A dash of uniqueness we learned
gets added to a familiar flavor.

1723
01:10:10,615 --> 01:10:13,951
If you get a taste, you won't
be able to stop making it at home.

1724
01:10:13,952 --> 01:10:16,887
- Come meet the three boys.
- Come.

1725
01:10:16,888 --> 01:10:18,455
Right now.

1726
01:10:18,456 --> 01:10:21,525
- Italy.
- Right now.
