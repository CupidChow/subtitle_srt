1
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:13,059
(Let's study Portugal's morning.)

2
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:18,364
(From bifana that's similar
to Korea's jeyuk bokkeum)

3
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:22,368
(To the bold yet addicting francesinha)

4
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,571
(Completely immersed)

5
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:29,665
("Bifana isn't complex,
it's direct and bold.")

6
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:30,810
(Kihyun, studying abroad)

7
00:00:31,477 --> 00:00:34,925
("Francesinha tastes like
a hamburger dipped in budaejjigae.")

8
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:36,582
(Kyung Ho, studying abroad)

9
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:40,519
(Su Young met
with a 2-star Michelin chef.)

10
00:00:40,987 --> 00:00:43,122
(This is kimchi jeon.)

11
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:46,659
(Korean cuisine reimagined
by a 2-star Michelin chef in Portugal)

12
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:49,295
(Kimchi jeon taco
made by a 2-star Michelin chef)

13
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:59,272
("Korean flavors have embraced Portugal."
Su Young, studying abroad)

14
00:00:59,772 --> 00:01:03,109
Now, it's time for you to cook for me.

15
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,077
Honestly, after tasting your food,

16
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:06,445
I don't think I can cook anything.

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,115
I don't think I can.

18
00:01:09,815 --> 00:01:10,816
Goodbye.

19
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:13,252
(Tries to leave)

20
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:14,453
It's okay.

21
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:16,522
Take your time.

22
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:18,658
Then, I'm from Korea,

23
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:22,361
so I'll prepare a very simple dish
that I think is Korean cuisine.

24
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,035
I'm a bit nervous.

25
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:33,906
(This has never happened before.)

26
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:37,510
(Su Young takes on a new challenge.)

27
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:41,981
(A master of easy and simple recipes)

28
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:46,419
(Su Young's dishes
have always been approachable.)

29
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:49,822
(Now, forget about all that.)

30
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:53,125
(Upgraded from studying abroad)

31
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,395
(Su Young's fine dining)

32
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,333
(It's time for the reveal.)

33
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:04,537
I intended to keep it simple,

34
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:07,807
in a traditional Korean way,
without any fancy twists.

35
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,141
Just clean and honest.

36
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:12,111
(Before meeting the chef,
Su Young dropped by a market in Porto.)

37
00:02:12,678 --> 00:02:15,114
Here's carpaccio.

38
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,482
I need to use this.

39
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:20,453
(Carpaccio / Thinly sliced
raw meat or fish, topped with sauce)

40
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:24,423
Then the carpaccio meat
suddenly looked like flower petals.

41
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:27,560
(The carpaccio meat
reminded him of flower petals.)

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,263
So, what should I make with this?

43
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:31,631
Should I make a flower?

44
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:34,267
I'm in Portugal.
What kind of flower should I make?

45
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:35,401
Mugunghwa (Rose of Sharon).

46
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:40,273
(Mugunghwa carpaccio
will bloom from Su Young's hands.)

47
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,110
(Inspired by the shape of the mugunghwa)

48
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:46,510
(This sauce is the kick.)

49
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,948
(The sauce will be the kick
for Mugunghwa carpaccio.)

50
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:53,419
(The main ingredient is butternut squash.)

51
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:58,257
(Butternut squash can be swapped
for easily available kabocha squash)

52
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:04,830
(Squash Sauce /
1. Dice the squash into small pieces.)

53
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:09,635
(2. Boil the diced squash for 8 minutes.)

54
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:13,439
Do you have a strainer?

55
00:03:14,874 --> 00:03:19,779
(Of course, the sous-chef
had already grabbed a strainer.)

56
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,282
- I'm here just to help.
- Thank you.

57
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:26,319
(While the squash boils,
prepare the base of the sauce.)

58
00:03:26,652 --> 00:03:29,655
(Soy cause from Kyung Ho)

59
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:33,492
(1T of soy sauce)

60
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:37,363
(Let me see what you're adding.
1T of sugar)

61
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:41,200
(And the one ingredient you cannot forget)

62
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:45,771
(1T of perilla oil for that nuttiness)

63
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,674
I'm sorry to interrupt.

64
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:50,740
(Ping from sous-chef!
The squash is done.)

65
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,154
Perfect. Thank you.

66
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:54,715
- Want me to stop the cooking?
- Yes, thank you.

67
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:56,971
- Great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

68
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:58,884
It's so nice to have him by my side.

69
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:00,386
(Perfectly cooked squash,
thanks to the sous-chef.)

70
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:05,291
(Squash Sauce / 3. Drain the water
and add the cooked squash into the base.)

71
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:11,497
(Sprinkle some lemon zest
to brighten it up.)

72
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:16,302
(Something's still missing...)

73
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:19,138
Can I use your kimchi a little bit?

74
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:22,521
You can use everything you want.

75
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:24,467
- Thank you.
- If you prefer the vegan one,

76
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:25,544
you can use that too.

77
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:26,646
(Baek kimchi acquire)

78
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:29,615
They've made
a delicious baek kimchi (white kimchi),

79
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:30,816
so I want to use...

80
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:34,720
(Adding baek kimchi
to the squash sauce?)

81
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,925
(What are you going to do
with our kimchi?)

82
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:45,464
(Squash and Kimchi Sauce / 4. Finely chop
the baek kimchi and add it to the sauce.)

83
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,969
I often use kimchi and squash together.

84
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:53,306
It's how my mom does it.

85
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:55,813
The squash is sweet
and the kimchi is salty,

86
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,110
so I think they'll
work well together.

87
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:02,315
(Perfectly sweet and salty,
what will the impromptu sauce taste like?)

88
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:05,051
(Nod of confidence)

89
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:09,722
(The sous-chef who helped out
also gets a taste.)

90
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:12,391
It tastes good.

91
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:19,231
(Plating with his delicate touch)

92
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:24,170
(In Korea, you can use low-fat cuts
like round or eye of round.)

93
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:28,641
(A flower blooming one petal at a time)

94
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,777
(Interesting)

95
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:35,014
(Use a touch of sesame oil,
and season with salt.)

96
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:38,851
This is a Korean-style carpaccio.

97
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:43,389
(Chopped cilantro becomes the leaves)

98
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:47,493
(Next, the kick
of the Mugunghwa Carpaccio)

99
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:53,032
(Squash and kimchi sauce)

100
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:58,904
(Add color to the petals.)

101
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:02,908
(Finish off with sesame seeds
to represent the stamen.)

102
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:06,312
The pronunciation is really hard.

103
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:09,515
Mugunghwa.

104
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:12,652
(Korean is hard.)

105
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:15,121
(Embraced the shape of mugunghwa)

106
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:20,293
(The Mugunghwa Carpaccio
has bloomed from Su Young's hands.)

107
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:24,063
(What is he cooking now?)

108
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,735
(Su Young has prepared yukjeon
(beef pancake) as his second dish.)

109
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,805
This is yukjeon.

110
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:34,807
Beef pancake.

111
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:37,276
Like kimchi jeon, this is yukjeon.

112
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:40,947
Yuk means beef or carne.

113
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:46,752
(The sous-chef is learning a lot
about Korean cuisine today.)

114
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:53,826
We usually make this
when we're having a party or something.

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,731
It's become easier
to find Korean food in Porto.

116
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:03,169
A Korean restaurant opened nearby.

117
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:07,039
(This Korean food lover
usually goes for tteokbokki.)

118
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,941
Tteokbokki, yes.

119
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:13,145
Yes, I've had deep-fried hot dog
with tteokbokki.

120
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:15,014
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

121
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:18,751
I normally order it to go.

122
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,754
(Meet the sous-chef,
Porto’s biggest Korean food lover.)

123
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:26,359
- The hot dog is always good.
- Yes.

124
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,431
(Yukjeon is glowing
with a beautiful golden color.)

125
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,335
(Here comes the 2-star chef.)

126
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,371
Be my guest.

127
00:07:39,438 --> 00:07:43,542
(Couldn't hold back the curiosity
and has entered the kitchen)

128
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:48,381
Is this a flower?

129
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:52,218
That's Korea's national flower, mugunghwa.

130
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,054
I'm curious about the taste.

131
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:56,889
Really? I hope it's good.

132
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:59,225
I'm also nervous.

133
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:02,361
It's okay.

134
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:07,166
(First, plate the yukjeon.)

135
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:11,671
(Delicately top it off with scallops.)

136
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:14,206
Beef and scallops?

137
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:16,676
Yes, we call this samhap (flavor trio).

138
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:21,314
It's a local delicacy
from the Jeollanam-do region of Korea.

139
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:25,952
(Finishes the samhap with cilantro)

140
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:29,488
I'll whip up some sauce real quick.

141
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:34,794
(Attention! Perfect for yukjeon,
Su Young's go-to spicy sauce)

142
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:38,431
(I'm going to memorize this recipe.)

143
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:42,668
(3T of perilla oil for nuttiness)

144
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:47,039
(3T of soy sauce
for signature Korean saltiness)

145
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,444
(1/2T of red pepper powder, 1/2T of sugar)

146
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:55,314
(Add 5T of water
to adjust the consistency.)

147
00:08:56,482 --> 00:09:00,820
(Drizzle Su Young's go-to spicy sauce.)

148
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,590
(Additional nuttiness with sesame seeds)

149
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:07,526
This is yukjeon samhap.

150
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:08,794
(Su Young's festive dish
Yukjeon Samhap)

151
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:13,432
(An unexpected combo
of yukjeon, scallops, and cilantro)

152
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:16,269
Could I try some now?

153
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,971
Yes, try it with a little bit of cilantro.

154
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:21,374
(Making sure to get some sauce)

155
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,976
(Eyes locked on the yukjeon samhap)

156
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:26,412
Could I try some as well?

157
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:32,118
(How will the 2-star chef
think of the yukjeon samhap?)

158
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:35,388
(Nervous)

159
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:38,190
Good.

160
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,994
I taste Portugal in this yukjeon.

161
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:44,630
(Completely agrees)

162
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,167
I taste our beef fried with breadcrumbs,

163
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,936
and there are even scallops.

164
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:52,071
This sauce isn't Portuguese at all, but...

165
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:55,541
(I smell Portugal
when I get a whiff of the cilantro.)

166
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,110
Thank you.

167
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:05,184
(Now, for the Mugunghwa Carpaccio)

168
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,622
(Have it with this sauce.)

169
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:12,825
(Su Young's squash and kimchi sauce)

170
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:20,099
(Will he be able to satisfy
the 2-star chef again?)

171
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,573
Fresh.

172
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:32,678
It's tasty and fresh,
so it really gets your appetite going.

173
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:33,613
It's good.

174
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:36,549
This is very good.

175
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:40,319
(The squash and kimchi sauce
has stolen the 2-star chef’s heart.)

176
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:42,922
The two dishes are very different.

177
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:46,525
- I'm very satisfied with both dishes.
- Thank you.

178
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:49,795
I want to learn how to make this sauce.

179
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:52,632
The squash and kimchi sauce is very nice.

180
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:54,033
Thank you.

181
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,036
This is my mom's recipe.

182
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:58,137
(Su Young's Squash and Kimchi Sauce)

183
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,639
(1. Finely chop the squash
and boil in water for 8 minutes.)

184
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,107
(2. Meanwhile,
finely chop some baek kimchi.)

185
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:02,041
(3. Drain the water from the squash
and combine with the kimchi.)

186
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,242
(4. Mix with 1T soy sauce,
1T perilla oil, some lemon zest.)

187
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:06,145
(Everywhere you look,
you're met with a picturesque view.)

188
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,314
Everything has been so nice.

189
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,082
(Kyung Ho and Kihyun are on the tram,
riding along the river.)

190
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:11,984
This is insane.

191
00:11:11,984 --> 00:11:14,153
(Kyung Ho and Kihyun are on the tram,
riding along the river.)

192
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:17,223
So, why are we here?

193
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:18,424
To learn.

194
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,326
Are we off on an outing right now?

195
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:21,994
- Nope.
- Never.

196
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:24,430
We can't get too excited.
We should calm ourselves.

197
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:26,098
No more smiling.

198
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:28,200
(Hold it in)

199
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,036
No, smiling is okay, but...

200
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,537
- But no wide grins.
- No wide grins.

201
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:32,705
Don't show your teeth.

202
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:35,374
(Exchange student Yoo Ki-hyun!
Do not show your teeth!)

203
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:38,210
We also need to remind ourselves...

204
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,947
- that we'll be learning about desserts.
- Yes.

205
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,717
I didn’t know much about Portugal
before coming here.

206
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:46,719
So, I had absolutely no idea...

207
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,155
that Portugal was famous
for their desserts.

208
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:51,324
Our local coordinator told us...

209
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:54,594
that Portugal takes desserts seriously,

210
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,162
that dessert is no joke.

211
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:59,465
(Which country do you think of
when thinking about egg tarts?)

212
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:03,269
(The original home of egg tarts, Portugal)

213
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,540
(But that's not all.)

214
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:10,176
- A dessert kingdom.
- Seriously.

215
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:15,047
If I think about how amazed I was...

216
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:16,616
when I took that first bite...

217
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,317
of the local meal master's egg bread...
Unreal.

218
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:20,753
(The members had tried some dessert
made by the local meal master.)

219
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:22,555
Goodness, what is this?

220
00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:25,992
(Farófias / Meringue dessert)

221
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,495
(Port Wine Pudding)

222
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:31,831
(Lime Tart)

223
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:35,434
(Kidney Bean Tart)

224
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,171
(Experienced a new world of desserts)

225
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:42,775
It makes me want to learn
how to make these desserts.

226
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,710
They're not joking around.
This is so delicious.

227
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,283
(Kyung Ho and Kihyun are here
to seriously learn about their dessert.)

228
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:52,018
(My goodness)

229
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:54,887
(Can't help but be amazed
as soon as you step in)

230
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,691
This is unbelievable.
There are so many desserts.

231
00:12:58,691 --> 00:12:59,992
(Every kind of dessert is here,
from traditional to Gen Z favorites.)

232
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:01,594
This is crazy.

233
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:05,531
Look at the layers.
How do they do this?

234
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,500
(This is dessert heaven.)

235
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,102
I wish we could try all of them,
but we can't.

236
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,973
Could you recommend
some traditional desserts for us?

237
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:16,709
- From the store?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,311
(Local staff's pick, croissant)

239
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:21,914
(Special sandwich)

240
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,050
What's the name of the sandwich?

241
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,920
(The name of the sandwich
is lanche misto.)

242
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:31,123
(Totally unfamiliar)

243
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,928
(They're curious,
so they go with the staff's picks.)

244
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:37,801
- We're going to order more.
- Okay.

245
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:39,713
And an egg tart.

246
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:43,970
I want another, very Portuguese dessert.

247
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:47,807
(Hunting for traditional
Portuguese desserts like a hawk)

248
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:51,110
Something very Portuguese...

249
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:57,249
Should we try this?
It looks very interesting.

250
00:13:57,249 --> 00:13:58,651
(They order two more desserts
after contemplating.)

251
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,921
(Which desserts did they pick?)

252
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:07,460
(They're going to study
the 5 most popular Portuguese desserts.)

253
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,862
- I'm going for it.
- Go ahead.

254
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,898
Lanche misto.

255
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:14,700
A sandwich you can have as a snack.

256
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:20,172
(The most common dessert
found everywhere in Portugal)

257
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:28,547
How does it taste?

258
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:31,784
Try it.

259
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,053
Okay.

260
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:38,824
The way the knife goes in...

261
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,259
It sort of feels like hotteok
(syrup-filled pancake).

262
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,536
I'm going to have some water.

263
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:55,708
(Gulping down water
without saying a word.)

264
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,444
It sort of felt like
I was chewing on some dough.

265
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,681
It tastes very similar to a panini,

266
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,617
but the taste of the dough
is stronger,

267
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:08,220
and I think the dough tastes kind of raw.

268
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,023
("Delivers an unexpectedly floury taste"
Kyung Ho, studying abroad)

269
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,094
Shall we move on?

270
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,362
I'm going to try this one next.

271
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:17,930
Okay. Gosh, that one...

272
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,032
Let's try this. I'm excited for this one.

273
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:22,802
It's filled to the bream with custard.

274
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,403
It's name is bola de Berlim.

275
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:27,073
The original version is from Berlin.

276
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,441
(A Portuguese twist
on the German Berliner doughnut.)

277
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:32,144
Portugal took that
and gave it their own twist.

278
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:38,517
(The cream-filled doughnut
goes straight into his mouth.)

279
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:40,786
It's sweet.

280
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,526
This tastes very familiar, right?
We've had this a lot.

281
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:50,830
It's exactly the same as Custard,
a snack in Korea.

282
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,933
I knew I've had this before.

283
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:55,668
We nailed recreating this.

284
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:58,004
There's sugar on it,
but it's not that sweet.

285
00:15:58,004 --> 00:15:59,839
You're right. It's not.

286
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,307
The cream is super sweet,

287
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:02,675
(Compared to the sweet cream,
the sugar tastes light.)

288
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,344
Does sugar usually taste this light here?

289
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,947
- Or are we...
- Is it our taste buds?

290
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,782
Are we too tired to taste properly?

291
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:11,851
Have we lost our sensitivity to taste?

292
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,519
No, If I think about it,

293
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,055
I think we're trying too hard
to analyze the taste.

294
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,257
We're trying to mimic Mr. Eo.

295
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,825
Let's not do that.

296
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,460
- Instincts.
- Yes, use your instincts.

297
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,828
And let's just say what we really think.

298
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:24,196
We'll use our instincts.

299
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,499
I'm looking forward to this one.

300
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:29,535
This is a Brazilian-style bread.
I'll try it.

301
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,120
It tastes totally different
from what I was imagining.

302
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,157
I was expecting it
to be super thick and chocolaty.

303
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:53,259
That's what I was expecting,

304
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,728
but it's totally different.

305
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:58,898
How should I describe it?

306
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:00,466
(How do I explain the taste?)

307
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:02,635
It kind of taste like
there's fruit in this.

308
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,003
- Yeah?
- Fruit...

309
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:06,138
Wait, I might be right about this.

310
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:07,673
The fruit flavor is super strong.

311
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:09,642
(You have to ask when you're curious.)

312
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,011
I love him for this.

313
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:14,880
He's always subtly considerate
of me and Su Young.

314
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,985
Is it normal to be this happy
when you're with Kihyun?

315
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:20,553
Can I be this happy?

316
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,288
I can't be showing my teeth.

317
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,792
I have a question.

318
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:33,132
I just had this,
and I can taste some kind of a fruit.

319
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:38,271
(There's no fruit in this?)

320
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,740
It's traditional Brazilian chocolate.

321
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,745
(I swear I taste fruit, though)

322
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:48,648
Maybe you're tasting the fruit...

323
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:53,419
from the chocolate coating
because that's made with...

324
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:54,487
Port wine.

325
00:17:57,757 --> 00:18:01,460
You're probably tasting the fruit
from the port wine.

326
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,562
(Kihyun got it right!
As expected from the elite youngest)

327
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,865
I’d be happy
even if it were just Kihyun and me.

328
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,634
I asked what the fruit was,

329
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,169
but they said fruits weren't used.

330
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,071
I thought we had lost it.

331
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:15,074
All that analyzing
messed with our taste buds.

332
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:19,045
But apparently, there's some port wine
used for the chocolate coating.

333
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:23,449
They said that I must be tasting the fruit
from the port wine.

334
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:24,750
(He's got elite taste buds.)

335
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,052
That's amazing.

336
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,120
Forever Mr. Eo.

337
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,056
Wannabe Mr. Eo.

338
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:31,490
That's impressive.

339
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,759
- You tasted that little bit of port.
- I should write this down.

340
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,028
(One discovery
has fired his curiosity for desserts.)

341
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,630
Now that I'm here,
I can see how serious they are.

342
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,065
They're serious about dessert.

343
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,666
So, I wanted to try making a dessert.

344
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,703
I thought I couldn’t say
I’d truly been to Portugal

345
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:45,338
unless I tried making a dessert.

346
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:47,907
I thought it'd be a meaningful challenge,

347
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:49,308
so I got started right away.

348
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:54,280
(Kyung Ho and Kihyun
are busy studying in the car ride back.)

349
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:58,317
(Kihyun is immersed
in organizing the recipe.)

350
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:02,788
(Kyung Ho is immersed in music.)

351
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,691
(Got caught)

352
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:09,795
(I studied too.)

353
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:14,834
Su Young got to study
with a 2-star Michelin chef,

354
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:17,703
so a regular recipe won't work.

355
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:20,640
I'm going to have to use
a secret weapon today.

356
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:23,309
Look forward to that.

357
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:29,015
(The boys are finally together again.)

358
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:31,617
Su Young.

359
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,119
We're back.

360
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,621
Welcome back.

361
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:36,989
Who are you talking to?

362
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:39,392
(But we've been back for a while.)

363
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:42,028
I just thought to say it...

364
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,230
to start things off, you know?

365
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,966
I thought there should be like
an opening line.

366
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,200
You startled me.

367
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,069
- Why are they so big?
- Right?

368
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:51,971
So how could I pass on them?

369
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:55,975
It's like how we always buy bean sprouts
when we go grocery shopping in Korea.

370
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:58,577
It was one of those things
I just had to buy.

371
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:00,446
So, I did.

372
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,381
A local now, huh?

373
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:04,250
How was today? Was it fun?

374
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,451
- Today?
- Yeah.

375
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:06,686
The start was good.

376
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:09,488
It was very relaxing.

377
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,157
I heard you shot "Culinary Class Wars."

378
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:12,425
No, no.

379
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:16,829
There wasn't a lot of time
for me to finish two dishes,

380
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:19,565
but I think I did okay.

381
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:24,437
I made yukjeon and cooked some scallops,
then topped it off with cilantro.

382
00:20:24,437 --> 00:20:27,340
Then I put some sauce on the plate
and made yukjeon samhap.

383
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,109
- Plus, I made yukheo (carpaccio).
- Amazing.

384
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:32,111
The sauce turned out quite nice,
so I was happy.

385
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:35,615
Good work, Su Young.

386
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:38,951
That looks complicated.

387
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:41,487
I'm trying to decide...

388
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:44,557
If I was cooking up a savory dish,

389
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:45,891
I wouldn't be like this.

390
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:48,561
But I want to make a dessert...

391
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,930
because that's what we studied today.

392
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,600
I've never baked in my life, though,
so it's kind of...

393
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,936
It's been frustrating.

394
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:58,904
So I started thinking all sorts of things.

395
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:03,576
There's this thing
called "Bola de Berlim."

396
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:08,014
It's like a round doughnut
with a custard filling.

397
00:21:08,014 --> 00:21:09,815
Custard is hard to make.

398
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:12,218
I'm going to make the custard,

399
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:14,920
and I bought some dough.

400
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,555
Where is it? Could I see it?

401
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:18,824
I've only used frozen dough.

402
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,092
Here it is.

403
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:22,161
They sell this? How interesting.

404
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:25,898
You're right. It's pastry dough.

405
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:27,033
Yes.

406
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:32,805
(A complicated and tedious process
that's unavoidable in baking.)

407
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:38,811
(Make baking easier
with store-bought dough.)

408
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:43,582
(Even in Korea,
refrigerated dough is easy to get.)

409
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:45,017
Using a dough like this is easy.

410
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:46,552
When you bake it, it'll puff up.

411
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:48,120
I wanted to try and make
a really good dessert.

412
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,188
Do it. You can do it.

413
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:50,656
And as long as you measure properly,

414
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:52,291
custard will be easy to make.

415
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,527
- I have the amounts here.
- Follow it to a tee.

416
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:55,561
I learned it today.

417
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:59,198
Baking can be fun since the result
is guaranteed if you measure right.

418
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:02,668
(Please look forward
to Kihyun's first baking project.)

419
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:06,138
Kyung Ho, we also went to eat
before studying desserts.

420
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,240
We had francesinha...

421
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,610
- and bifana.
- How was it?

422
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,212
Francesinha...

423
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:15,481
tasted like budaejjigae (army stew.)

424
00:22:16,816 --> 00:22:20,086
It tasted like a sandwich
that had been dipped in budaejjigae.

425
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:25,291
It's a sandwich with ham, cheese...

426
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,792
And you cover it with cheese.

427
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:27,893
What's this?

428
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:29,762
This is bifana.

429
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:30,963
It's bifana.

430
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:33,366
I already smell
the jeyuk (spicy stir-fried pork).

431
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:35,234
A mild jeyuk bokkeum.

432
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:40,006
It's a very mild version of jeyuk bokkeum.

433
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:42,008
A mild jeyuk bokkeum.

434
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:44,377
Jeyuk bokkeum without the sweetness.

435
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:45,878
I think it’d taste better warm.

436
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:47,580
- It must be cheap too.
- You're right.

437
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,049
I'm thinking of using this...

438
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,018
I came up with a recipe using this.

439
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:56,055
I need to get you
to check this recipe for me.

440
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,291
You don't need to.
Go for it if you're confident.

441
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:02,495
I'm asking because I'm not confident.

442
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:05,865
I don't want results like yesterday.

443
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:09,468
(Tasting Kyung Ho's bacalhau egg soup
on the first night)

444
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:13,372
(Pause)

445
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:15,641
Why is this so fishy?

446
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:18,444
It tastes like straight cod.

447
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:20,413
This is below my expectations as well.

448
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:21,580
(Kyung Ho's controversial egg soup
that was very fishy)

449
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,916
- What happened to this?
- I didn't expect this at all.

450
00:23:24,884 --> 00:23:27,620
I thought about putting jeyuk bokkeum
inside a bread.

451
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,591
But just like the messed-up,
fishy-tasting bacalhau egg soup,

452
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:34,093
I was worried
the sweetness of the jeyuk...

453
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:36,929
wouldn't go with the bread
like I imagined.

454
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:43,336
So, I wanted to use this budaejjigae taste
from the francesinha and bifana's bread,

455
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:47,073
and make something
like a budaejjigae burger.

456
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,209
(Tilts head, thinking)

457
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:57,383
So, for the dads
who have had a burdensome day...

458
00:23:57,717 --> 00:23:58,918
Since I'm a dad.

459
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:00,486
- Me too.
- You are too.

460
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:03,422
For dads who have had a burdensome day,

461
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:05,124
let's make a Burden-Breaking Burger.

462
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:07,059
Kyung Ho, you wanted...

463
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,462
So you wanted to introduce
the Burden-Braking Burger,

464
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:10,930
but you weren't
even sure about it, so...

465
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,633
(Kyung Ho tried to cover up
his lack of confidence with a story.)

466
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,901
I had a bit of a hard time
trying to come up with this earlier.

467
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,403
You poor thing.

468
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:19,338
How are you going to put this
inside a bread?

469
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:22,475
I was thinking like a pasta bread bowl.

470
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:24,644
You'd hollow out the bread?

471
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:26,112
- And put budaejjigae inside?
- Yes.

472
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:32,485
Then you'd need it to have some thickness
for it to stay inside the bread.

473
00:24:32,485 --> 00:24:33,953
If it's too soupy, it'll sip through.

474
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:35,988
Right, I thought of that too.

475
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:40,760
So, I'll add some starch powder
to make it thick.

476
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,929
- Adding starch?
- Right.

477
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:45,765
- Adding budaejjigae?
- Yes.

478
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:48,534
I have an idea
of how I want this to taste.

479
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:51,971
It will have the characteristics
of a budaejjigae,

480
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:54,941
but with a tomato base
so that it's lighter.

481
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:56,475
Plus, a bit of spice.

482
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,444
That's a flavor combination I really like.

483
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:02,415
I wanted to come up with a recipe
that was both simple...

484
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:03,683
and delicious.

485
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:07,153
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe
Burden-Breaking Burger)

486
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:09,121
Budaejjigae.

487
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:11,157
Are we having some soju today, then?

488
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:14,627
If I succeed.

489
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:17,163
But I also think
if it's budaejjigae with bread,

490
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:18,564
we could totally go for some beer.

491
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:19,865
- Yeah?
- Yes.

492
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,702
(Starting with some meatballs
for the budaejjigae)

493
00:25:22,702 --> 00:25:25,504
I think about this much meat will be good.

494
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,540
(Eyeballing the measurements)

495
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,275
I'd say this is about...

496
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:32,278
maybe 100g? 200g?

497
00:25:32,712 --> 00:25:33,746
Let me see.

498
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:35,114
(Scale mode is on.)

499
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:36,616
I don't think it's even 100g.

500
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:37,917
It's not?

501
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:40,753
You can just check
how much this package is.

502
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:45,925
(Checking the weight
as per Ryu-GPT's advice)

503
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,261
It's 500g.

504
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:55,668
(Dividing the 500g into five 100g lumps)

505
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:59,038
(Season the meat with salt and pepper.)

506
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:01,440
One pinch is about 0.6g.

507
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,743
This is 100g, right? Then do two pinches.

508
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,912
Same thing with pepper, right?

509
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:09,015
Just ground some in.

510
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:12,418
(Knead the meat well
so it absorbs the seasoning.)

511
00:26:12,652 --> 00:26:15,154
If you really want to perfect it,
try cooking one first.

512
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:18,824
And if it's good, go for it.
If it needs more seasoning, add more.

513
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:28,868
(Checking the seasoning by cooking
a small piece as per Ryu-GPT's advice)

514
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:36,409
(Tastes good)

515
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:41,814
(Seasoning is done,
so now, get to cooking.)

516
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:47,219
(Made smaller meatballs
for easier stuffing into the bread)

517
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,555
You're like a meatball expert.

518
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:51,457
That looks good even by itself.

519
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:55,261
(Expert vibes)

520
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:59,665
Those don't need to be well done
since you'll be cooking them more.

521
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,667
You just want to sear the outside.

522
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:06,405
That's good.

523
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:07,773
- It's tasty.
- Yeah?

524
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:09,542
- It's well-seasoned.
- Right?

525
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:12,011
I'm kind of nervous.

526
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:14,246
- It already tastes American.
- Right.

527
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:15,348
Don't be nervous. Relax.

528
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:17,350
You need to relax
for your dish to taste good.

529
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,417
It'll be delicious.

530
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,553
I have a goal, you know.

531
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:24,523
I want the courage
to be honest about your dish.

532
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:26,192
- Courage.
- And...

533
00:27:26,192 --> 00:27:29,795
I know it's too early,
and it doesn't even make sense,

534
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,964
but you know...

535
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:34,734
"The apprentice has surpassed the master."

536
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:36,736
That saying.

537
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:38,537
Better than Mr. Eo?

538
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:40,206
I want to be better than Eo Nam Seon.

539
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:41,707
Better than Mr. Eo.

540
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:45,378
Yoon Kyung Ho's journey.

541
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,347
- Yoon's Journey.
- You get it?

(Preparing the crown jewel
of the budaejjigae, canned ham)

543

(Burden-Breaking Burger)

544
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:54,987
(1. Slice and mash the ham
with the back of your knife.)

545
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:58,791
(2. Add a variety of hams, 3 strips
of minced bacon, a handful of macaroni...)

546
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:01,963
(Finely chopped cabbage, a handful
of minced jalapeño, 1T canned peanuts...)

547
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:04,297
(2T of canned white beans,
3T of minced garlic)

548
00:28:04,297 --> 00:28:05,965
More cheese the better, right?

549
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,199
Make it super thick?

550
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,868
- Too much will make it heavy.
- Just two, then.

551
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:10,169
Your choice.

552
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:12,738
I'll add the cheese, and...

553
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:15,274
(2 slices of cheese)

554
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,944
Now, I'll add some water
and make the sauce.

555
00:28:19,178 --> 00:28:20,880
It feels like I'm cooking.

556
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,648
(1/2T of salt, 3 swirls of ketchup,
1/2T of sesame oil)

557
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,087
(Kyung Ho's budaejjigae
starts bubbling away.)

558
00:28:31,991 --> 00:28:33,726
- Gosh, Kyung Ho.
- Yeah?

559
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:35,161
The smell...

560
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:36,429
Insane, right?

561
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,131
It smells so good.
Can I taste it?

562
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:41,367
Yes, but I haven't added those yet.

563
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:43,536
The texture you want is happening already.

564
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:45,738
Right, I haven't added the piri-piri yet.

565
00:28:45,738 --> 00:28:47,807
(The soup is getting thicker as it boils.)

566
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:53,746
(Glance)

567
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:54,880
It's a bit bland.

568
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,049
Is it? But once it reduces a little...

569
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:58,250
Right, I think it's okay then.

570
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,385
Then, this is right.

571
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:00,920
But actually,

572
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:04,357
I do want a more of a clearer,
more defined flavor.

573
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,093
What if the ham flavor
stood out a little more?

574
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:08,494
Be bold with it.

575
00:29:08,828 --> 00:29:12,598
(Before adding more ham,
add 5T of starch water for consistency.)

576
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:14,800
- Should I?
- Be bold.

577
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,968
I'll be bold.

578
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,040
(Add 3 swirls of the piri-piri sauce,
the spice of Portugal)

579
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,142
Now, let's work it!

580
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:25,678
(Magic spell activated!)

581
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:30,716
(Will it taste the way Kyung Ho hopes?)

582
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:37,857
Not bad at all.

583
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:41,160
I should hollow out the bread now.

584
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:44,563
(Bola de mistura
that will hold the budaejjigae)

585
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:47,133
(A beloved traditional Portuguese bread)

586
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:50,436
(Made with a blend of wheat and rye flour,
it has a chewy outside and a soft inside.)

587
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:54,840
(You can substitute it
with a hard roll or sourdough.)

588
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:58,844
(Hollow out the bread.)

589
00:29:59,312 --> 00:30:02,581
(Kyung Ho makes room for his budaejjigae.)

590
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:03,950
Can I try the bread?

591
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:06,752
Oh, this is good.

592
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:08,187
Right? This bread is...

593
00:30:08,187 --> 00:30:09,555
The texture is like a tteok (rice cake).

594
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:11,824
Yeah. I really thought about
which bread to use.

595
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:15,828
- It's like sulppang (makgeolli bread).
- Right?

596
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:17,697
Why does this taste Korean?

597
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:19,765
This totally hits like Korean food.

598
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:23,769
So this sort of felt like rice to me.

599
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:25,738
You're right.

600
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:30,109
Now, let me do this nicely.

601
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:34,513
(Carefully add the budaejjigae
into the bread.)

602
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:37,783
(Grin)

603
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,722

and finish by closing the bread.)

to 100g of ground meat, sear on high.)

606
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:50,329
(2. In 300ml of water, boil meatballs,
ham, bacon, macaroni, veggies, etc.)

607
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:51,931
(3. 3 swirls of ketchup, 1/2T sesame oil,
1/2T salt, 5T starch water for texture.)

608
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:53,666
(4. Fill the bread with budaejjigae,
top with pepper, parsley, and close it.)

609

(It's Kihyun's first time baking,
and he's going for a custard pie.)

610
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:59,672
I need 120g of egg yolks, so...

611
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:05,044
Why are the yolks so small
compared to the size of the eggs?

612
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,246
(1 yolk is 13g?)

613
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:09,915
It's only 13g? That's not good.

614
00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:14,153
That's a lot of eggs.

unlike his pumped-up arms)

(Surprised by his baking skills)

631
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:21,921
It already has that taste.

632
00:32:22,822 --> 00:32:25,691
Su Young, I haven't used much,
but it already tastes like custard.

Love that.

Why is it good?

638
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,440
It's good.

639
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,675
I haven't done anything to it yet.

640
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:44,343

the vanilla beans.)

(Either the seeds
or the full pod can be used.)

647
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:03,829
It says to use exactly 6cm of the pod.

648
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:06,934
I've never used a vanilla bean before.

649
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,279
(Open the pod and scrap the seeds.)

650
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:13,105
(The second step of the custard cream
is to make the milk base.)

651
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:17,043
Exactly 50g.

00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:27,034

Hey, this already looks done.

659
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:43,836
It already tastes good.

660
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:45,137
That vanilla bean though.

661
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:49,742
(5. Add the milk base
to the whipped egg yolks.)

662
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:54,547
(Strain the mixture
for a smoother texture.)

(1. Cut the dough to your liking, prick it
with a fork to prevent it from puffing.)

674
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:43,496
(2. Sprinkle some sugar on the dough,
add custard cream, then fold it in half.)

(Kihyun wants a photo
of his first baking experience.)

678
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:01,881
Try flipping one. The bottom
might not have been browned properly.

679
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:04,717
If so, then you can flip them
and bake longer.

682
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:12,725
Then flip it and bake for longer
on higher heat. Make it 200℃.

683
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:14,460
Do a butter wash.

684
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,763

a butter coating for enhanced flavor)

685

Look, it's puffing up.

687
00:35:23,903 --> 00:35:26,505
- It's going to be delicious.
- It totally looks good.

688
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,408
(Golden brown custard pies)

689
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:31,510
- Crispy.
- They're crispy.

690
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,980
Goodness, they smell amazing.

691
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,147
That was some dedication.

692
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:36,549
(Custard Pie / Custard Cream)

693
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:38,456
(1. Whisk 120g of yolks, then add 120g
of sugar, 50g of cake flour and whip.)

694
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:39,414
(2. Boil 500ml of milk, 50g
of butter, a 6cm vanilla bean.)

695
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:40,371
(3. Mix the whipped yolks
and the milk base and strain.)

696
00:35:40,396 --> 00:35:41,954
(4. Boil on low heat until thickens.
5. Chill it in a bowl of ice water.)

697
00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:43,522
I'm going to start cooking now.

698
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:48,394
(It's Ryu Su Young's time now.)

699
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:51,731
I bought some incredible mushroom
at the market.

700
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:54,033
Ta-da.

701
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,636
- What?
- It's super big, right?

702
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,539
(Today's main ingredient
is the portobello mushroom.)

703
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,476
Portuguese cuisine
is all about the ingredients.

704
00:36:03,476 --> 00:36:06,012
They use amazing ingredients.
They know it too.

705
00:36:06,012 --> 00:36:10,049
Using mushrooms in hamburger steak
can be a nice way

706
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:12,652
to get kids to like them.

707
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:14,120
Adults will like them anyway.

708
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,058
(Mushroom hamburg steak
made with Portugal’s premium ingredient)

709
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:24,897
It smells really good.

710
00:36:24,897 --> 00:36:26,198
Are they button mushrooms?

711
00:36:26,198 --> 00:36:27,700
No, they're portobello.

712
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,736
The ingredients here
all seem slightly bigger than in Korea.

713
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,740
(In Korea,
portobellos can be hard to find.)

714
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:40,179
(Instead, use large shiitakes
or button mushrooms.)

715
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:44,951
(Use a spoon to scrape off
every last bit of gills.)

716
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:48,621
(Next key ingredient is a chorizo.)

717
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:52,224
They have such a large variety of hams.
There were like ten different kinds.

718
00:36:52,224 --> 00:36:53,893
I hope I picked a good one.

719
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:57,997
(Remove the casing.)

720
00:36:58,264 --> 00:36:59,776
(Mushroom Hamburg Steak)

721
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,835
(1. Remove the casing,
mash the chorizo, mince.)

722
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:05,504
(Add 500g of ground beef
to the minced chorizo.)

723
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:09,175
(6g of salt, 6g of pepper)

724
00:37:09,675 --> 00:37:10,843
(2. Knead the mixture
for a juicy, bouncy texture.)

725
00:37:10,843 --> 00:37:12,945
That looks good.

726
00:37:12,945 --> 00:37:14,981
(2. Knead the mixture
for a juicy, bouncy texture.)

727
00:37:15,114 --> 00:37:18,985
(Shape the meat into a ball
and pop it into the mushroom.)

728
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:24,490
(Press it in evenly,
making sure to leave no space.)

729
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,927
This is funny. I just realized
that all three of us...

730
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:29,629
are making stuffed dishes today.

731
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:30,997
You're right.

732
00:37:30,997 --> 00:37:32,976
(Kihyun's custard pie,
Su Young's mushroom hamburg steak)

733
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,233
(Kyung Ho's burden-breaking burger)

734
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:37,069
(Just cook the meat on medium heat.)

735
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:40,172
(You've got to cook the meat for flavor.)

736
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:50,616
(The sound of delicious sizzling
fills the room.)

737
00:37:51,484 --> 00:37:55,488
(Kyung Ho comes over as if possessed.)

738
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:57,690
- That's amazing.
- What is?

739
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,158
- Amazing.
- What do you mean?

740
00:37:59,158 --> 00:38:00,259
I'm craving some makgeolli.

741
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:01,861
That'd be nice.

742
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:04,730
- Like the ones you have on holiday.
- Jeon (pancake) on a holiday.

743
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,232
A massive shiitake jeon.

744
00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:08,267
You’ve never had
shiitake jeon like this before.

745
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:15,341
(The meat inside the mushroom
has browned deliciously.)

746
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:16,943
What is this?

747
00:38:17,677 --> 00:38:18,911
A massive shiitake.

748
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:20,579
(I'm here because it smelled like holiday,
but what?)

749
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:23,115
- Did you make this?
- Yeah.

750
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:24,550
(Su-young’s Ryu-cipe
is one surprise after another.)

751
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,085
A massive shiitake.

752
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:28,988
- It looks so delicious.
- A massive shiitake jeon.

753
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:34,093
(It's massive,
so it must be massively delicious.)

754
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:42,101
(Flip the mushroom and let it rest
for 10 minutes for the juices to absorb.)

755
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:46,305
(Next ingredient is mussels.)

756
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:49,442
I'm going to steam some mussels
in the air fryer.

757
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:50,876
(Su Young's second Ryu-cipe,
Steamed Seafood)

758
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:54,880
(Clean the mussels.)

759
00:38:55,214 --> 00:38:57,283
This stainless steel container is nice.

760
00:38:57,283 --> 00:38:58,584
It's convenient.

761
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,289
This region has such good-quality mussels.

762
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:04,557
(Mussels don’t need purging
since they don’t suck in sand or mud.)

763
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:08,461
Shrimps are cheap.

764
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:10,596
Su Young, bread is super cheap here.

765
00:39:10,596 --> 00:39:14,300
Bread is cheap, this fish is cheap...

766
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,435
Everything was cheap
when I went grocery shopping earlier.

767
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:18,571
It's actually unbelievable.

768
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:20,239
This many shrimp was only ten dollars.

769
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:22,341
It costs 13 dollars.

770
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:25,444
(Done prepping the shrimps)

771
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,784
(Mussels go straight
into the air fryer.)

772
00:39:29,808 --> 00:39:31,384
(This can be used
as a steamer too.)

773
00:39:32,752 --> 00:39:34,153
I should add some water.

774
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:36,856
There's already water.

775
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:44,230
(Steamed Mussels / Prep mussels and steam
in an air fryer for 10 minutes at 115℃.)

776
00:39:44,964 --> 00:39:49,201
(While the mussels
get deliciously steamed...)

777
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:50,937
Could I borrow your Chinese cleaver?

778
00:39:50,937 --> 00:39:53,339
- The cleaver?
- Thank you.

779
00:39:53,906 --> 00:39:55,775
You should bow the Chinese way

780
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:56,842
when receiving the Chinese cleaver.

781
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:58,311
Hǎo.

782
00:39:58,911 --> 00:40:01,847
(The Chinese way?)

783
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:04,450
(Hi-yah! Hoo-cha!)

784
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:08,754
(What are you...)

785
00:40:11,457 --> 00:40:12,692
(That's not it.)

786
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,393
Courteously.

787
00:40:14,393 --> 00:40:17,563
(Playing with Su Young / Be courteous.)

788
00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:19,665
Don't do this.

789
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:21,267
Don't do it. It's embarrassing.

790
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:23,769
I'm regretting it right now.
Why did I do that?

791
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:28,441
(Crushing garlic and shaking off regret)

792
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:30,309
Woah.

793
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:33,646
It might shoot out.

794
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:35,114
(He's clumsy most days,
but all flair when he’s cooking.)

795
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:38,351
(It even sounds professional.)

796
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:42,121
So you have to use your wrist
and use the tip.

797
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:45,558
It needs to be mashed like this.

798
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:50,730
Nicely cooked.

799
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,634
(Meanwhile,
the mussels are done steaming.)

800
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:57,203
- Are we having a party?
- Right?

801
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,475
(The mussels are having a juicy party.)

802
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:06,646
(Now that the mussels are done,
what's next?)

803
00:41:07,013 --> 00:41:10,950
(Cook the shrimps in the air fryer.)

804
00:41:12,451 --> 00:41:15,288
(Add garlic and butter
to enhance the flavor.)

805
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:20,826
(Then...)

806
00:41:23,129 --> 00:41:25,298
Let's try cooking both at the same time,
shall we?

807
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:28,634
(Mushroom hamburg steak on the 2nd floor,
Shrimp with garlic and butter on the 1st)

808
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:33,572
Steam fry.

809
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:35,141
Let's try this.

810
00:41:35,141 --> 00:41:36,575
You can cook like that?

811
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:40,713
Even when you're barbequing,
you can leave a bowl underneath.

812
00:41:40,713 --> 00:41:41,781
Then the juice will collect.

813
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:44,650
You can use that juice to make gravy.

814
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:46,519
This is going to be good.

815
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:48,354
(The juice from the meat
becomes the sauce.)

816
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:49,655
Are you done now as well?

817
00:41:50,122 --> 00:41:51,424
Come look at it.

818
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:54,493
Take a look inside.
It's like a commercial.

819
00:41:54,493 --> 00:41:56,195
Gosh.

820
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:58,965
- The juices are flowing from the meat.
- You're right.

821
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:01,534
That juice is coating the shrimp,
it's mixing with the melted butter...

822
00:42:01,534 --> 00:42:05,204
(The mushroom hamburg steaks
are oozing with juices.)

823
00:42:05,705 --> 00:42:10,076
(Can't even imagine how good
this is going to taste)

824
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:12,244
This is crazy.

825
00:42:12,244 --> 00:42:13,446
(Take out the steamed shrimps.)

826
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:15,114
It's a party.

827
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:17,984
What is that?

828
00:42:20,286 --> 00:42:21,721
(Put the juicy shrimps
on top of the mussels.)

829
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:24,190
You're coating the mussels
with the juice from the meat.

830
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,326
(Put the juicy shrimps
on top of the mussels.)

831
00:42:28,027 --> 00:42:30,162
I liked the piri-piri sauce.

832
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:32,265
(Add some spiciness with the piri-piri sauce
and sprinkle some parsley.

833
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:36,802
(Cannot take my eyes off of it)

834
00:42:36,802 --> 00:42:38,337
This is nice.

835
00:42:38,337 --> 00:42:40,940
This is seriously a party.

836
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,110
(The ultimate umami dish
completed with garlic, butter, drippings)

837

3. Top the shrimp with butter and garlic.)

(4. Steam the shrimps in the air fryer
for 10 mins. at 195℃, 10 mins. at 175℃.)

840
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,015
(5. Place the mussels on a large plate,
top with shrimps and the juices.)

841
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,050
(6. Drizzle the piri-piri sauce,
then sprinkle parsley.)

842
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:52,752
What are you doing now?

843
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:53,986
The sauce.

844
00:42:54,654 --> 00:42:58,224
(He's making sauce with port?)

845
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,528
(Porto’s iconic dessert wine,
known for its sweetness and strong aroma.)

846
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:06,065
There are so many different kinds of port.

847
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:13,739
(Fell for the sweetness of port wine
the moment he tasted it.)

848
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:15,474
This is really interesting.

849
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:17,443
(It might be fun to use it when cooking.

850
00:43:17,443 --> 00:43:23,616
I made a thick sauce
by mixing port with butter.

851
00:43:23,616 --> 00:43:25,718
I knew it would make the dish better.

852
00:43:25,718 --> 00:43:30,222
(The port wine sauce pairs perfectly
with the mushroom hamburg steak.)

853
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:35,294
(The super simple port wine sauce
is revealed.)

(While the alcohol gets cooked away...)

856
00:43:45,237 --> 00:43:47,707
(Prepare 2 finely chopped tomatoes.)

857
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:54,647
(2. Add the tomatoes, 3T of ketchup,
50g of butter, reduce on low heat.)

858
00:43:55,314 --> 00:43:58,551
(Once it thickens...)

859
00:43:59,051 --> 00:44:02,154
(3. Add 1T of oyster sauce
and some parsley.)

860
00:44:02,955 --> 00:44:06,425
(The super simple
port wine sauce is done.)

861
00:44:10,363 --> 00:44:11,564
Delicious.

862
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:14,267
I think I'm about done.

863
00:44:17,536 --> 00:44:19,038
(Juice)

864
00:44:21,173 --> 00:44:25,645
(Mushroom hamburg steaks,
bursting with juicy flavor)

865
00:44:25,778 --> 00:44:27,513
What in the world?

866
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:29,982
Port wine is good, no matter what.

867
00:44:29,982 --> 00:44:32,218
I just reduced it.
I didn't even add any sugar.

868
00:44:33,753 --> 00:44:37,089
(A perfect harmony of flavors)

869
00:44:38,691 --> 00:44:40,359
That looks insane.

870
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:44,196
(Brought together on a single plate,
Mushroom Hamburg Steak)

871
00:44:45,231 --> 00:44:46,324
(Mushroom Hamburg Steak / Port Wine Sauce)

872
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,511
(1. Add 1/2 bottle of port to a pan,
reduce, cook away the alcohol.)

873
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:48,652
(2. Add 2 finely chopped tomatoes,
3T ketchup, 30g butter, reduce.)

874
00:44:48,677 --> 00:44:49,635
(3. Once it thickens,
add 1T oyster sauce, parsley.)

875
00:44:50,736 --> 00:44:52,138
Let me clean this.

876
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:55,041
Add the water...

877
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:59,045
(Every great meal
ends with a clean kitchen.)

878
00:44:59,045 --> 00:45:00,313
Wash.

879
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:03,516
Air fryers these days
are so easy to clean.

880
00:45:04,216 --> 00:45:07,620
(Cleanup done quickly and effortlessly)

881
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,323
We finished making everything
without any difficulties.

882
00:45:10,323 --> 00:45:12,491
Our teamwork is out of this world.

883
00:45:12,858 --> 00:45:14,594
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

884
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:15,795
Please open.

885
00:45:17,697 --> 00:45:21,634
(Kyung Ho's Burden-Breaking Burger
finally opens.)

886
00:45:23,135 --> 00:45:26,105
(Yes)

887
00:45:26,238 --> 00:45:28,407
- This looks good.
- It's filled to the bream.

888
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:31,110
It looks like the filling
has become one with the bread.

889
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:34,480
(Filled to the bream for the tired dads)

890
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,650
I don't see any broth. Oh no.

891
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:39,619
I'm curious too.

892
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:41,454
- Let's try it.
- Let's eat.

893
00:45:41,454 --> 00:45:43,322
- How should I eat it?
- As you please.

894
00:45:43,322 --> 00:45:44,657
As you please?

895
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:46,592
So, however we want to? Nice.

896
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:48,227
- I'm going to go for it.
- Dig deep.

897
00:45:49,262 --> 00:45:50,730
Get rid of that burdensome day.

898
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:54,033
Think of that like the sauce.

899
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:56,168
- Here's some bread.
- There you go.

900
00:45:56,168 --> 00:45:57,770
Thank you.

901
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:00,306
- It's hot.
- It's hot?

902
00:46:00,306 --> 00:46:02,241
It's still very hot. It hasn't cooled.

903
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:03,309
Thank you.

904
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:05,878
(What will Kyung Ho's burger taste like?)

905
00:46:10,816 --> 00:46:12,818
(Nervous)

906
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:16,022
It's budaejjigae.

907
00:46:16,555 --> 00:46:19,792
(The nervousness melts away
at Kihyun's reaction.)

908
00:46:20,092 --> 00:46:21,928
This is straight up budaejjigae.

909
00:46:21,928 --> 00:46:24,230
(Cannot taste the sauce on my fingers)

910
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:26,832
I know. This tastes like
budae bokkeum (stir-fry).

911
00:46:26,832 --> 00:46:28,100
Budae bokkeum.

912
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:31,938
The meatball is tasty.

913
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:34,140
It's a bit salty,
but it's perfect with some bread.

914
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,141
Right?

915
00:46:35,975 --> 00:46:39,312
These macaroni pasta... and you fried it.

916
00:46:39,312 --> 00:46:42,081
These meatballs too.

917
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:45,084
The beans, hams...
The combination is perfect.

918
00:46:48,354 --> 00:46:49,789
(It's so delicious.)

919
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:51,057
Thank you.

920
00:46:51,057 --> 00:46:52,124
This is really good.

921
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:55,828
This is seriously delicious.

922
00:46:56,929 --> 00:46:59,932
(Now that his nervousness is gone,
he takes a bite.)

923
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:01,300
The meatballs are good.

924
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,603
You have to eat it with bread.

925
00:47:03,603 --> 00:47:04,437
Then, the seasoning is perfect.

926
00:47:04,437 --> 00:47:07,106
- Can I tear some bread?
- Yes, let's go for it.

927
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:08,874
(If you tear the bread...)

928
00:47:09,408 --> 00:47:11,110
This is wild.

929
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,878
It also feels like
veggie hoppang (steamed bun).

930
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:15,214
Veggie hoppang for dads.

931
00:47:15,214 --> 00:47:17,216
(This is veggie hoppang for dads.)

932
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:18,951
Burden-Breaking Veggie Hoppang.

933
00:47:18,951 --> 00:47:20,286
This is actually nice.

934
00:47:20,286 --> 00:47:23,623
This is so much better than
the francesinha we had this morning.

935
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:25,958
It’s a huge step up in quality.

936
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:30,196
There was no middle ground
for the francesinha.

937
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,299
What was this again?
Jumping like this.

938
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:35,401
High... no, a long jump.

939
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:37,169
The francesinha feels like a long jump.

940
00:47:37,169 --> 00:47:38,838
But this has a good run-up
before the jump.

941
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:40,473
- Like a triple jump.
- It's full of flavor.

942
00:47:40,473 --> 00:47:42,575
However you imagined it,
this one's for adults.

943
00:47:42,575 --> 00:47:44,410
Let me cut that for you.

944
00:47:45,177 --> 00:47:47,013
This one has been waiting for too long.

945
00:47:47,013 --> 00:47:48,681
(Next up, the mushroom hamburg steak)

946
00:47:48,681 --> 00:47:52,752
What did you sprinkle on top?

947
00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:55,588
This is Parmigiano Reggiano.

948
00:47:55,588 --> 00:47:57,690
Parmigiano Reggiano?

949
00:47:59,325 --> 00:48:01,160
Yes, it's Parmigiano Reggiano.

950
00:48:02,528 --> 00:48:03,596
Really?

951
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:05,231
Yes. It's Parmigiano Reggiano.

952
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:08,834
Why is the name so long?

953
00:48:09,035 --> 00:48:11,404
You know the cheese you sprinkle
on your pasta?

954
00:48:11,404 --> 00:48:13,239
That's this. It's Parmesan.

955
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:15,241
I know Parmesan.

956
00:48:15,808 --> 00:48:18,744
(Somehow upset)

957
00:48:18,744 --> 00:48:20,179
He feels tricked.

958
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:22,248
You just did that
because I wouldn't know.

959
00:48:22,648 --> 00:48:25,985
(Let's taste this now.)

960
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:33,192
(It hits as soon as you take a bite.)

961
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:38,531
Oh my goodness.

962
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:40,199
Kyung Ho, hurry up and try it.

963
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,134
Why? What is it?

964
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:45,037
(Just how good is it
to get that kind of reaction?)

965
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:50,810
(This is off the charts.)

966
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,079
This is absolutely mind-blowing.

967
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:55,548
When you take a bite...

968
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:57,516
You know that feeling?

969
00:48:58,184 --> 00:49:00,753
You feel like you're a child again.

970
00:49:00,753 --> 00:49:03,556
It's that donkatsu (pork cutlet)
you had with your mom for the first time.

971
00:49:03,556 --> 00:49:06,492
You know where I've had this before?
When I was young,

972
00:49:06,492 --> 00:49:08,794
for my birthdays,
not every birthday though...

973
00:49:08,794 --> 00:49:09,996
because it was expensive.

974
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:11,631
The Western-style restaurant.

975
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:13,599
It’s the same flavor
I remember from there.

976
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,502
- Right, a casual dining restaurant.
- It's better than that.

977
00:49:16,502 --> 00:49:21,140
The hamburg steak
and the sauce hits you with familiarity.

978
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,177
The mushroom is thick,
but it's been cooked so well.

979
00:49:25,177 --> 00:49:28,748
So, as your teeth sink in,
you get that juice.

980
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:29,915
It's so soft.

981
00:49:29,915 --> 00:49:33,586
(Fantastic collaboration of the juices)

982
00:49:33,586 --> 00:49:35,655
The port sauces I've had before...

983
00:49:35,655 --> 00:49:37,556
were so obviously made from port.

984
00:49:37,556 --> 00:49:38,991
It just came at you,

985
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:42,028
but this one just blends together
so harmoniously with the dish.

986
00:49:42,528 --> 00:49:44,797
This taste is unreal.

987
00:49:46,232 --> 00:49:47,733
It's like this.

988
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:49,936
In movies or something,
judges take a bite...

989
00:49:49,936 --> 00:49:53,372
then just go into a frenzy
and can't stop eating.

990
00:49:53,372 --> 00:49:55,641
Really? I'm glad. Thank you.

991
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:58,110
Should we try
the steamed shrimp and these?

992
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,681
Just the look of it
is already so striking.

993
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:04,417
When you're having a party,
you can just steam everything,

994
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:06,152
and enjoy the broth.

995
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:08,054
Thank you.

996
00:50:08,054 --> 00:50:10,456
I can smell
the rich nuttiness from the butter.

997
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,092
- I'll be honest.
- Please.

998
00:50:16,529 --> 00:50:17,830
This is...

999
00:50:28,007 --> 00:50:32,011
I don't usually like mussels.

1000
00:50:32,011 --> 00:50:33,045
Same here.

1001
00:50:33,045 --> 00:50:36,415
But I just stuffed my face
with three mussels.

1002
00:50:37,116 --> 00:50:38,484
I swear, I want to say
that this isn't good,

1003
00:50:38,484 --> 00:50:41,053
but why is this so delicious?

1004
00:50:41,053 --> 00:50:42,655
You want to say it's bad,

1005
00:50:42,655 --> 00:50:44,123
so you're trying to find a flaw.

1006
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,527
I know I can't win against him, but...

1007
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:50,563
I just keep thinking,
"This is good too?"

1008
00:50:52,898 --> 00:50:54,367
This is really delicious.

1009
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:57,536
It's all in the ingredients.

1010
00:50:57,536 --> 00:51:00,439
- Get some broth in this and...
- The broth is good.

1011
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:07,246
The sauce is spicy and nutty...

1012
00:51:07,246 --> 00:51:09,181
This depth of flavor is insane.

1013
00:51:09,181 --> 00:51:12,752
It's just the broth from the ingredients.

1014
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:15,154
It's all the juices
from mussels and shrimps.

1015
00:51:15,154 --> 00:51:16,589
And the depth of flavor was created...

1016
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:19,992
when the juices from the mushroom
and the beef sipped into the shrimps.

1017
00:51:19,992 --> 00:51:21,827
In that oven?

1018
00:51:21,827 --> 00:51:24,230
Yeah, so the broth
isn't just an ordinary broth.

1019
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,601
It's a mixture of beef,
portobello, and shrimp broth.

1020
00:51:29,302 --> 00:51:30,703
Is this spiciness coming
from the piri-piri sauce?

1021
00:51:30,703 --> 00:51:32,605
Yeah, I drizzled it on top.

1022
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:35,975
You drizzled it at the end like this.

1023
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:41,080
The combination of that
and the mixture of all these broths...

1024
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,581
It's truly fantastic.

1025
00:51:42,581 --> 00:51:44,216
You're kind of...

1026
00:51:44,216 --> 00:51:46,485
Can I say this here?

1027
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:48,654
You always crack me up.

1028
00:51:48,654 --> 00:51:50,156
You're asking if you can say it?

1029
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:52,792
Su Young, could you
cover your ears for a second?

1030
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:57,063
He's a bit like...

1031
00:51:57,063 --> 00:51:59,999
a batshit creative genius.

1032
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:02,234
I'm serious.

1033
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:03,569
Did you hear me?

1034
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,038
- What are you?
- Why?

1035
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:09,241
It wasn't me. It was all
Portuguese mussels and shrimps.

1036
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:12,144
(Flavors from the ingredients)

1037
00:52:12,144 --> 00:52:13,980
Even that comment was perfect.

1038
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,248
You're making me upset.

1039
00:52:16,248 --> 00:52:18,217
I just want to bury my face in it.

1040
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:21,721
This is so delicious,
but now,

1041
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,390
we have Kihyun's dessert.

1042
00:52:26,058 --> 00:52:27,793
Finally, dessert.

1043
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:28,928
You sprinkled sugar too.

1044
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:30,029
Yes, I did.

1045
00:52:30,029 --> 00:52:31,931
The smell alone already gets a pass.

1046
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:33,499
Could I try it first?

1047
00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:35,434
I wasn't able to check the taste.

1048
00:52:35,434 --> 00:52:36,602
Sure, that's important.

1049
00:52:40,206 --> 00:52:44,910
(Holding it gently, he takes a bite.)

1050
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,380
(The boys are curious.)

1051
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:49,115
Crispy?

1052
00:52:49,115 --> 00:52:50,249
(Subtle smile)

1053
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,218
His eyes have become confident.
Let's try it.

1054
00:52:52,218 --> 00:52:53,753
Can we try it?

1055
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:56,055
(You sure can)

1056
00:52:56,055 --> 00:52:57,089
You can.

1057
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,626
(The first baking recipe
from the youngest member)

1058
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,630
(His face says it all
about the custard pie.)

1059
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:06,365
Listen carefully, everyone.

1060
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:13,606
(Self ASMR)

1061
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,176
You're scaring me a little.

1062
00:53:17,176 --> 00:53:18,577
Yeah, you're being scary.

1063
00:53:19,211 --> 00:53:21,681
(So much for the concept,
but who cares when it’s this good?)

1064
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:22,848
It's good.

1065
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,018
- The custard filling is nice.
- Good.

1066
00:53:26,018 --> 00:53:27,219
Hey, the custard...

1067
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:28,321
Let's bring the custard.

1068
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:31,724
Let's try with some more custard
on top like this.

1069
00:53:31,724 --> 00:53:33,059
It's much stronger.

1070
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:34,560
(Going all in on the custard cream)

1071
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,995
Just put more on like this.

1072
00:53:38,864 --> 00:53:41,100
(This is what I'm talking about.)

1073
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:43,569
(The pleasant sweetness amplifies,
the more custard you add.)

1074
00:53:43,569 --> 00:53:45,037
This is it.

1075
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,341
- It's so good.
- This is it.

1076
00:53:48,341 --> 00:53:49,842
This is what I wanted.

1077
00:53:51,177 --> 00:53:53,713
It's not heavy or too sweet.

1078
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,314
It's not too sweet.

1079
00:53:55,314 --> 00:53:57,149
It's not that sweet,
but it's very delicious.

1080
00:53:58,084 --> 00:54:01,654
(Soft and rich custard
made by elite-class whipping)

1081
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:05,758
(Custard pie that's both crispy and sweet)

1082
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:08,661
This is pure luxury.

1083
00:54:08,661 --> 00:54:11,163
I stuck to the measurements perfectly.

1084
00:54:11,163 --> 00:54:13,599
Can I have the recipe
so I can make it for my daughter?

1085
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:14,967
I want to do that too.

1086
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:16,736
Everyone would like this.

1087
00:54:16,736 --> 00:54:19,872
If this is the result on your first try,

1088
00:54:19,872 --> 00:54:21,107
you've got amazing skills.

1089
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:23,042
This is absolutely delicious.

1090
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,779
(Savoring the success of his first bake)

1091
00:54:26,779 --> 00:54:27,913
I'm happy.

1092
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,383
We all succeeded today.

1093
00:54:30,383 --> 00:54:31,651
We did.

1094
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:32,885
Your dish was so good.

1095
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:35,655
The quality became insane in just a day.

1096
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:37,957
What are we going to do tomorrow?
That's what's scary.

1097
00:54:41,827 --> 00:54:42,833
I just got chills...

1098
00:54:42,858 --> 00:54:44,697
the moment I passed the steel gates.

1099
00:54:44,697 --> 00:54:45,998
It's scary.

1100
00:54:46,966 --> 00:54:49,402
- The vibe.
- The vibe?

1101
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:50,903
(Mysterious photos hanging all around)

1102
00:54:50,903 --> 00:54:53,739
It's a bit intense.

1103
00:54:53,739 --> 00:54:55,541
(Mysterious photos hanging all around)

1104
00:54:57,677 --> 00:54:58,811
What's this?

1105
00:54:59,078 --> 00:55:00,980
It was a bit overwhelming.

1106
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,384
(Where are they?)

1107
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:07,286
This is a really famous school.

1108
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:09,922
Graduates go to work all over the world.

1109
00:55:09,922 --> 00:55:11,958
(This is a school?)

1110
00:55:12,825 --> 00:55:14,527
Turismo de Portugal.

1111
00:55:15,194 --> 00:55:19,565
(One of the best
culinary schools in Europe)

1112
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:23,869
(A place that teaches and
carries on the traditions of Portugal.)

1113
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:28,040
(A culinary school in Portugal,
a hub to countless chefs)

1114
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,676
What is it? Let's see.

1115
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:34,714
There are hats too.

1116
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:35,815
(What are the boys wearing?)

1117
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:36,983
Looking cool.

1118
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:40,486
This is no joke.

1119
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,289
(Personalized chef jackets
with their names on them)

1120
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:44,523
Eo Nam Seon.

1121
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:49,128
I'm not on the level
to be learning cooking like this.

1122
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:51,063
Don't you remember
your Burden-Breaking Burger?

1123
00:55:51,063 --> 00:55:52,732
No, I mean...

1124
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:54,400
That burger means you can be here.

1125
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:56,569
Even our names are on this.

1126
00:55:59,305 --> 00:56:00,773
This is an honor for the whole family.

1127
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:04,844
(I must take a photo
for the family archives.)

1128
00:56:04,977 --> 00:56:07,146
How short do the sleeve need to be?

1129
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:10,516
I really wanted to learn.

1130
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,687
I've never had a restaurant
nor have graduated from a culinary school.

1131
00:56:14,687 --> 00:56:16,847
But cooking in Europe is fun.

1132
00:56:16,872 --> 00:56:20,326
I think you can learn all kinds of methods
and cuisines in Europe.

1133
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:22,762
I've barely scratched the surface.
There are so many kinds of food,

1134
00:56:22,762 --> 00:56:25,131
and all we know is the typical stuff.

1135
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,999
"I want to learn this country's cuisine."

1136
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:28,234
That's what I thought.

1137
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:31,971
I get to wear a classic chef's jacket

1138
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,739
and properly learn something.

1139
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:37,176
I'm not even joking.
It made me genuinely...

1140
00:56:37,176 --> 00:56:39,512
want to learn more about cooking.

1141
00:56:40,246 --> 00:56:41,714
Just wait, I'll cook for you.

1142
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,152
(The three boys
have entered a culinary school.)

1143
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,220
I'm really nervous.

1144
00:56:50,456 --> 00:56:51,991
Which way is it? Here?

1145
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,225
This way.

1146
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,429
It's this way.

1147
00:56:56,963 --> 00:56:59,432
You're trying to be funny now, huh?

1148
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:01,634
- I thought you meant this way.
- I wanted us to be cool.

1149
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:03,302
How do we wear the hat?

1150
00:57:03,302 --> 00:57:04,403
Do we just put it on?

1151
00:57:04,403 --> 00:57:05,671
Is it supposed to be like this?

1152
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:13,512
(Appears looking a little suspicious)

1153
00:57:13,846 --> 00:57:16,449
(Caught off guard)

1154
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,751
(Smile)

1155
00:57:18,951 --> 00:57:22,321
(Sort of looks like someone
from the Joseon Dynasty)

1156
00:57:23,723 --> 00:57:24,824
Hello.

1157
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:25,925
Are you ready?

1158
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:32,365
(Hugo Martins /
Master Chef of the Culinary School)

1159
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,267
And these two are...

1160
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:37,536
Hello.

1161
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:40,773
(Ace chefs who will be learning with them)

1162
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,777
(Suddenly self-conscious about the hat)

1163
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:46,912
(Kyung Ho, push the hat down.)

1164
00:57:46,912 --> 00:57:49,882
(Adjusting)

1165
00:57:50,116 --> 00:57:55,288
(Which dish will the boys
be learning today?)

1166
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:57,690
It's Portugal's traditional dish.

1167
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,192
(A traditional dish)

1168
00:58:00,459 --> 00:58:02,795
Jardineira.

1169
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:08,401
(A simple dish
made with meat and veggies at home)

1170
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:11,837
(A beloved staple
of traditional Portuguese home cooking)

1171
00:58:12,538 --> 00:58:16,142
(Portuguese-style braised ribs)

1172
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:19,779
The first step is to prepare...

1173
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:21,881
a rich tomato sauce.

1174
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:23,616
(Ready)

1175
00:58:23,616 --> 00:58:25,885
(Su Young is always ready. Let's go!)

1176
00:58:26,385 --> 00:58:28,120
We can do it.

1177
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:30,890
(Sigh)

1178
00:58:32,892 --> 00:58:34,493
It was very nerve-wracking.

1179
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:38,197
It's where you go
to become a professional chef,

1180
00:58:38,197 --> 00:58:43,636
but I'm just an ordinary Korean dad,
who's never learned how to cook.

1181
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:46,872
And I had to learn how to cook
with Mr. Eo in that kitchen.

1182
00:58:46,872 --> 00:58:49,809
I was constantly worried
I might trouble others.

1183
00:58:50,409 --> 00:58:55,681
The first step is to adjust the stove...

1184
00:58:56,983 --> 00:58:59,385
to medium heat.

1185
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,689
(Clinking)

1186
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,427
(Can't light the stove
from being too nervous)

1187
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:10,997
(Keeps failing)

1188
00:59:10,997 --> 00:59:13,833
It turns on
when it's in that oddly specific spot.

1189
00:59:14,267 --> 00:59:16,736
But is it the one on the far right?
Is it this one?

1190
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:17,870
(Elite Kihyun goes to rescue Kyung Ho.)

1191
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:19,071
That's the one.

1192
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:23,276
(Stove's fire up, thanks to Kihyun)

1193
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,711
(Not easy from the start...)

1194
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:32,351
(The first ingredient is olive oil.)

1195
00:59:32,351 --> 00:59:33,653
This seems like a lot.

1196
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:38,524
(Add onions and garlic to the oil.)

1197
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,526
(Glancing)

1198
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,828
Did I add too much olive oil?

1199
00:59:42,828 --> 00:59:44,196
Chef?

1200
00:59:44,196 --> 00:59:47,099
Could you check if this is too much oil?

1201
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,669
Don't worry. You're good.

1202
00:59:50,403 --> 00:59:52,405
(Sniff)

1203
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,474
Smells good.

1204
00:59:55,474 --> 00:59:57,743
Next, add the bay leaf.

1205
00:59:57,743 --> 00:59:59,045
Where's the bay leaf?

1206
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,314
The bay leaf is...

1207
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,982
Bay leaf...

1208
01:00:03,582 --> 01:00:06,152
Under the knife?

1209
01:00:06,152 --> 01:00:08,721
("Dumb and Dumber")

1210
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,291
(It's trouble after trouble,
but he finally adds a bay leaf.)

1211
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,960
So they use a bay leaf.

1212
01:00:17,463 --> 01:00:19,532
(Steal)

1213
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,269
(It's here.)

1214
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,439
(Sharing is caring.)

1215
01:00:26,872 --> 01:00:28,507
(Portuguese-style braised ribs)

1216
01:00:28,507 --> 01:00:30,943
(1. Fry the onion and garlic in olive oil,
then add the tomato sauce.)

1217
01:00:31,477 --> 01:00:33,946
(2. Add white wine to enhance the flavor.)

1218
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,516
(Stir evenly for 2 minutes
to incorporate everything.)

1219
01:00:37,516 --> 01:00:38,851
Two minutes of even stirring?

1220
01:00:39,585 --> 01:00:43,055
(The main ingredient is beef.)

1221
01:00:43,055 --> 01:00:45,324
Which part of the cow is the meat from?

1222
01:00:45,324 --> 01:00:48,894
This cut is from the cow’s hind leg.

1223
01:00:48,894 --> 01:00:50,463
Meat from the hind leg.

1224
01:00:50,463 --> 01:00:52,164
It's top round.

1225
01:00:52,665 --> 01:00:54,106
(Top round has
a low fat content.)

1226
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:57,069
(It keeps the dish from being
greasy and gives it a clean flavor.)

1227
01:00:57,637 --> 01:01:00,206
Do you cook like this at home too?

1228
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:04,810
I usually cook for my family at home.

1229
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:10,116
I've never learned cooking
at a school though.

1230
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,853
(Kihyun is keeping up well
even though it's also his first time.)

1231
01:01:13,853 --> 01:01:20,026
You're good at prepping the meat.
It's perfect.

1232
01:01:20,326 --> 01:01:22,728
(A compliment?)

1233
01:01:23,062 --> 01:01:24,463
Chef,

1234
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,831
how is this?

1235
01:01:25,831 --> 01:01:27,466
It's perfect.

1236
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:30,169
(Asking for praise)

1237
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:33,072
I'll make it for you at home.

1238
01:01:35,741 --> 01:01:39,211
(Got caught)

1239
01:01:39,211 --> 01:01:42,348
(3. Add the diced beef
into the tomato sauce mixture.)

1240
01:01:44,717 --> 01:01:47,753
(2 pinches of salt and pepper each)

1241
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:55,094
I think this will be a bit like...

1242
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:56,729
a Portuguese-style
galbi jjim (braised ribs).

1243
01:01:56,729 --> 01:01:58,230
I think so too.

1244
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:01,968
Instead of soy sauce,
we're using tomato sauce.

1245
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:07,740
(Two dishes,
similar in both method and ingredients)

1246
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:11,277
(The difference is the sauce.)

1247
01:02:11,577 --> 01:02:13,646
(Then how will it taste?)

1248
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,786
I have a question.

1249
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,758
Most of the Porto dishes I've tried...

1250
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,327
had a strong salty flavor.

1251
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,962
Is sweetness not really a thing

1252
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:33,366
in Porto cuisine other than for desserts?

1253
01:02:33,366 --> 01:02:34,834
- I'm curious too.
- I'm curious...

1254
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,336
about why the saltiness
is always so forward.

1255
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:40,172
Forty years ago...

1256
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:46,826
(Back when there was no refrigeration,
food was preserved through salting.)

1257
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:54,778
(As a result, Portuguese cuisine
still tends to be salty.)

1258
01:02:56,689 --> 01:03:03,095
(But Portugal continues
to strive for new flavors.)

1259
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,766
(Understood)

1260
01:03:06,766 --> 01:03:11,003
(Add the carrots, potatoes, and radishes.)

1261
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,739
(Mix well.)

1262
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,241
(Cook for 15 minutes.)

1263
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:17,310
I can already tell
this is going to taste good.

1264
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:22,114
(Last step, plating)

1265
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:25,184
(Top with some parsley.)

1266
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:28,654
(The three boy's
Portuguese-style braised ribs)

1267
01:03:29,255 --> 01:03:31,991
(Now, it's time
to get your dish evaluated.)

1268
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:36,963
I'm going to taste it
and share my opinion with you.

1269
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,933
(Don't be nervous.)

1270
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:43,803
(First, the youngest member,
Kihyun's dish)

1271
01:03:44,303 --> 01:03:46,339
He tried mine.

1272
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,876
(Su Young and Kyung Ho are also nervous.)

1273
01:03:50,876 --> 01:03:55,781
I think you lost a bit of the taste
because you added some water in the end.

1274
01:03:58,884 --> 01:04:02,154
(Kihyun realized
the carrots needed more time.)

1275
01:04:04,056 --> 01:04:07,093
(And he added more water at the end.)

1276
01:04:07,693 --> 01:04:11,897
But overall,

1277
01:04:11,897 --> 01:04:13,199
you've done a good job.

1278
01:04:13,899 --> 01:04:17,236
(Grin)

1279
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:21,207
In my opinion, it's a very good dish.

1280
01:04:24,043 --> 01:04:25,278
This is nerve-wracking.

1281
01:04:29,048 --> 01:04:30,616
Please be gentle with me, Chef.

1282
01:04:32,418 --> 01:04:34,954
Give him a shoulder massage.

1283
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,089
How could I do that?

1284
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:41,594
(Fidgety)

1285
01:04:41,994 --> 01:04:44,363
(After taking a bite...)

1286
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:46,699
(The chef has turned his back.)

1287
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,434
(Why isn't he saying anything?)

1288
01:04:48,434 --> 01:04:50,169
He took a bite
and went completely silent.

1289
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:54,740
You asked a lot of questions
during the class today.

1290
01:04:54,740 --> 01:05:03,449
I like it when students ask
a lot of questions.

1291
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:07,954
Considering this is your first time,

1292
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:09,855
you did well.

1293
01:05:10,256 --> 01:05:13,559
(Kyung Ho was praised for his dish
and his attitude during class.)

1294
01:05:14,293 --> 01:05:16,295
(Phew)

1295
01:05:18,064 --> 01:05:20,199
(Lastly, it's Su Young's turn.)

1296
01:05:28,074 --> 01:05:33,746
It's hard to recreate
he traditional flavors of Portugal.

1297
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:39,318
but when I tried your dish,

1298
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:40,987
I tasted Portugal.

1299
01:05:40,987 --> 01:05:45,224
(In awe)

1300
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:46,592
(As expected)

1301
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:48,127
That's the highest praise.

1302
01:05:48,127 --> 01:05:50,863
(The boys have finished
learning the traditional dish.)

1303
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:54,000
(It's the last Ryu-cipe of Portugal.)

1304
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,569
(A guest is coming?)

1305
01:05:56,936 --> 01:05:59,038
(We poured everything
we learned in Porto into this.)

1306
01:05:59,305 --> 01:06:01,240
(We are fully prepared.)

1307
01:06:01,974 --> 01:06:05,278
(A perfect full-course meal,
from main to dessert)

1308
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:08,681
(Guests arrive one at a time)

1309
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:12,285
(Will they be able to satisfy the locals?)

1310
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:16,289
(Even the mighty Mr. Eo is nervous.)

1311
01:06:16,455 --> 01:06:17,957
(Where's the next study abroad location?)

1312
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:20,192
(The second study abroad location, Brunei)

1313
01:06:20,593 --> 01:06:22,395
(The three boys have landed in Brunei.)

1314
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:25,398
(We're still thirty to learn.)

1315
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:29,402
(A bumpy study abroad journey
to quench a thirst for growth)

1316
01:06:30,369 --> 01:06:35,975
(A whole new world of gourmet delights)

1317
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:37,977
I want to show our passion.

1318
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:41,247
(The three boy's undying,
fiery passion for food)

1319
01:06:41,647 --> 01:06:45,484
(Never a dull moment
in their study abroad journey)

1320
01:06:46,152 --> 01:06:50,389
(Even upgraded Ryu-cipes)

1321
01:06:52,058 --> 01:06:54,160
How's a guy who knows how to cook?

1322
01:06:55,194 --> 01:06:56,329
Meh.

1323
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,499
You wanted to taste the Ryu-cipes, right?

1324
01:07:00,499 --> 01:07:03,269
We will go to you.

1325
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,138
Not because we made it,
but isn't it actually delicious?

1326
01:07:06,138 --> 01:07:08,307
It tastes familiar yet unique.

1327
01:07:08,307 --> 01:07:09,375
Why?

1328
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:13,746
Because we added our own kicks
to the Ryu-cipes.

1329
01:07:13,746 --> 01:07:16,515
Come meet us.

1330
01:07:16,515 --> 01:07:17,516
- Hurry.
- Come.

1331
01:07:17,516 --> 01:07:20,019
- Come.
- Come right now.

1332
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:22,088
- The food's getting cold.
- Oh no.
