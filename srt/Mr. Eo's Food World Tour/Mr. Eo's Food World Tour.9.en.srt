1
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:16,094
(A rainy, drizzly second day in Sicily)

2
00:00:18,463 --> 00:00:22,367
(A noisy morning at the house?)

3
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:26,237
(The kitchen's bustling
with production crew.)

4
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:29,573
(Su Young looks busy among them.)

5
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:31,308
What's the red soup?

6
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,549
It's doenjang (soy bean paste).

7
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:37,915
(There's a deep story
behind this "red broth"...)

8
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:42,286
(After last night's shoot)

9
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:45,223
(Heavy breathing heard from the house)

10
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:50,128
(The three boys are working out
with furniture.)

11
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:55,198
(Feast hard, sweat harder!)

12
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,719
How are you supposed to dance to this?

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,338
(Grooving to the hip-hop beat...
for no reason at all)

14
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:03,140
You can do what you usually do.

15
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:04,175
Which one?

16
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:08,046
(You're looking at 11-year idol swag.)

17
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:10,580
(Realization)

18
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:13,918
(Creaking)

19
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:17,188
Same steps
but the vibe's totally different.

20
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:21,059
(I'll show you.)

21
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:23,594
(Full-on party mode)

22
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:27,231
(A dance party has started
in the middle of the night.)

23
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:29,032
This is my song.

24
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:30,134
Really?

25
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:33,537
("Youth" by Kihyun)

26
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:37,375
(Starts the party again
with Kihyun's song)

27
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:40,311
You're listening to Kihyun's "Youth."

28
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,212
This is also Kihyun's song.

29
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:45,015
(Kihyun's hit song medley)

30
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:47,417
("Bad Liar" by Kihyun)

31
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:48,987
A bad lie.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,321
I've worked on a lot of OST.

33
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:54,791
An OST millionaire.

34
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,059
No.

35
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,094
Rich boy Kihyun.

36
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:58,796
I actually did more than you'd think.

37
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:01,965
Say what you just said again.

38
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:03,367
Kihyun is a singer.

39
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:05,936
Right. Kihyun wasn't just someone
who cooks with us.

40
00:02:05,937 --> 00:02:09,006
He's a singer.
Gosh, I'm sorry for making you cook.

41
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:10,574
Kihyun wasn't just a K-pop idol.

42
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:12,275
He's the main singer.

43
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:14,277
You write music too, right?

44
00:02:14,278 --> 00:02:15,579
- I write lyrics.
- Lyrics?

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,848
(Chop chop chop)

46
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:20,362
(While the two are having fun,
Su Young is focused on prepping the meat.)

47
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:25,423
(The spicy red broth was made
for the hardworking crew.)

48
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:31,496
(Using every last bit of the ingredients
leftover from cooking Ryu-cipes)

49
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,034
Try it and tell me if it's a radish.

50
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:39,670
- Celery.
- It's celery root, right?

51
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:43,708
It taste good though.
It's not bitter or anything.

52
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:48,012
(Using local meat and vegetables)

53
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:53,184
(Sicilian edition of a beef radish soup)

54
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:56,720
(Su Young comes to check on it
before going to bed.)

55
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:58,256
Looking good.

56
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:02,660
(This big batch of beef radish soup
needs time to develop its rich taste.)

57
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:11,002
(Checks in from time to time,
cooking with care)

58
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:15,239
(That's how the breakfast was made.)

59
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:18,775
That's really a lot of soup.

60
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,110
Did you make a lot for us?

61
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,312
Yeah, so that we can all share.

62
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:22,879
No way.

63
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,148
So sweet.

64
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:28,686
(I need a photo of this.)

65
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:30,320
It looks good.

66
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:32,090
(Su Young's breakfast is a total hit.)

67
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:34,392
Goodness.

68
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:35,793
Could I have some of this rice?

69
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:37,027
Of course.

70
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,230
(The spicy soup makes them crave rice.)

71
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:40,931
(Satisfied)

72
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,634
- It's good, right?
- It's very good.

73
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:44,202
- Does it taste okay?
- It's delicious.

74
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:45,536
That's good to hear.

75
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:48,840
I didn't even drink last night,
but this is hitting like a hangover cure.

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,875
Really? I'm glad.

77
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,645
This is the taste of Korea.

78
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:54,645
It's so good.

79
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:56,280
Thank you.

80
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,150
Let's go.

81
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:01,318
I'll be your assistant.

82
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,820
(Now that the rain's stopped,
time to go study)

83
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,122
- I'm feeling a bit excited today.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:07,225
It's been a while since I've been in
an unfamiliar place like this.

85
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:09,093
Driving in a new country like this...

86
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:12,396
We haven't started
to go up the mountain yet?

87
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:14,431
- We're on our way up.
- We've started to.

88
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:15,666
We have to up really high.

89
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,535
We're going to be ascending
for 30 minutes.

90
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:20,004
For 30 minutes?

91
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:21,838
That's quite high.

92
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,508
The total height
is just under 4,000 meters.

93
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:25,442
That's probably similar to Mount Fuji.

94
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:28,043
If it's that high, I feel like
we're going to be above the clouds.

95
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,980
(We have to go up for 30 minutes?)

96
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,748
We're going up to the 2,000m-mark.

97
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,651
I wonder where we're going.

98
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:36,486
The reason why we're here...

99
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:38,589
is because of Mount Etna, right?

100
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:41,792
Sicily's everything, Mount Etna.

101
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,394
(Sicily's icon, and its everything)

102
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:48,366
(Located in Catania, the eastern edge
of Sicily, where the trio is staying)

103
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,303
(Just an hour's drive
from the city center)

104
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:55,505
The tallest
and largest active volcano in Europe.

105
00:04:55,506 --> 00:04:58,108
(Mount Etna /
A UNESCO World Heritage-listed Volcano)

106
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,777
(Standing 3,369 meters tall,
it's Europe's largest active volcano.)

107
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,981
(However)

108
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:05,016
(An active volcano
that could erupt at any time)

109
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:07,184
Isn't there still magma in the crater?

110
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:09,305
Apparently, it's still filled
and constantly bubbling.

111
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:16,928
(Erupting continuously
for the past 500,000 years)

112
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:22,033
(One of the most active volcanoes
in the world)

113
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:25,168
- I've never visited an active volcano.
- Me neither.

114
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,237
It's a bit scary, right?

115
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:28,806
Just a little bit.

116
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,608
Su Young, have you been to Mount Baekdu?

117
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:31,808
No.

118
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,143
- Have you?
- No.

119
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:35,579
I have a story related to it, though.
Do you want to hear it?

120
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,047
Yes, please.

121
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:40,283
When my mother was pregnant with me,

122
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:41,885
when she gave birth to me,

123
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:44,755
my father wasn't with her.

124
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:46,791
(These two fathers are speechless.)

125
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:49,359
He was on a work trip.

126
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,994
He was on a work trip to Mount Baekdu.

127
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:52,729
(Should we feel relieved?)

128
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,232
So, my mother
still talks about that sometimes.

129
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,834
"When you were born,
your dad wasn't here."

130
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,368
"He was at Mount Baekdu."

131
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,504
I heard it's important to be there.

132
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:02,307
Of course. Someone should be there
to suffer with you.

133
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:03,975
They can hold it against you for life.

134
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:05,710
(Looking around)

135
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:08,646
There's snow now.

136
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:09,946
(Surprised)

137
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:10,947
Goodness, look.

138
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:14,251
I need to capture this.

139
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:15,986
This is incredible.

140
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:18,188
I can't believe we're up this high.
There's snow.

141
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,623
We've come up so high.

142
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:21,725
We've hit an altitude of 1,900 meters.

143
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:23,361
We're almost at the top of Mount Halla.

144
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:25,228
We're here.

145
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:26,464
Thanks, Su Young.

146
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:29,266
It's not as cold as I thought.

147
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:30,601
I was expecting it to be way colder.

148
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:31,601
Here's an umbrella.

149
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:33,136
No, that would ruin the vibe.

150
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:34,471
You're hair will get wet.

151
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:37,741
(Gives up on the vibe)

152
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:40,144
- Since it's snowing.
- Yeah, since it's snowing.

153
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:43,247
I mean...

154
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:45,744
I have no idea
what we're supposed to be looking at,

155
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:46,684
but let's go look at something.

156
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:47,919
All right.

157
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:50,339
The snow keeps hitting my face.
It's kind of ticklish.

158
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:54,524
(Uh, what?)

159
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,860
Okay, we're here,

160
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:58,596
but what are we supposed to do?

161
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:00,198
Enjoy the snow.

162
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:03,433
(The snow storm is getting worse.)

163
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:06,970
There's nothing to look at.

164
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:08,439
There's nothing here.

165
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:14,612
(Thus, they enter the gift shop.)

166
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,015
(Su Young has already found
some honey to eat.)

167
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:18,515
It's good.

168
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:20,752
This is really good.
I should take some home.

169
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:23,720
(Right up his alley)

170
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,081
It's honey. What more do you need?

171
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:30,762
(Mesmerized by the ingredients...
There's goes his wallet.)

172
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,031
Is this what we're supposed to do here?

173
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:36,033
Hey, but it looks like the cup
is made with volcanic ash.

174
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:37,134
Yeah.

175
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:38,502
That's special.

176
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:39,971
I want that.

177
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:41,638
I want to buy this.

178
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,075
Yeah, let's get one each.
I'll buy it for you.

179
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:46,710
It's on me.

180
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:47,945
Mamma mia.

181
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,248
So cute, right?

182
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,082
This too...

183
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,851
This is also a magnet.

184
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:55,987
This is pretty.

185
00:07:57,622 --> 00:07:58,755
Did I get too much?

186
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:02,359
But I mean,
when you're buying gifts,

187
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,796
it's hard to actually list everyone
you want to give the gift to.

188
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:06,697
That would take forever, you know?

189
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:08,666
- You grabbed so many.
- Yeah.

190
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:11,602
Who are you going to give these to?

191
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:12,870
I have so many people to give.

192
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:14,771
This too.

193
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:16,974
(Going wild
while Su Young quietly suffers)

194
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:18,042
All together.

195
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:19,978
(You'll pay for them, right?)

196
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,413
All together, please.

197
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:24,881
We should go study now.

198
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:26,917
- A new experience.
- Yes, we should.

199
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:29,052
I heard they eat granitas here
in the morning.

200
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:32,756
So they have something cold.
That's unique, right?

201
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:34,491
Let's go see what granita is.

202
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:36,227
They make it in a traditional way.

203
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:40,130
(A traditional dessert of Sicily)

204
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,468
Apparently, granita means
to break the ice or something.

205
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:50,775
(1,200 years ago, when ice was a luxury,
granita began with snow from Mount Etna.)

206
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:54,746
(An icy dessert with a long history)

207
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:59,717
(A refreshing dessert
when eaten by itself)

208
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:07,458
(A Sicilian breakfast
when paired with brioche)

209
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,572
(They will learn the traditional way
to make it at Mount Etna.)

210
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:13,064
(Antonello, a granita master)

211
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:16,566
(A special outdoor activity
with Antonello at Mount Etna)

212
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:20,538
I've gathered this snow
from Etna this morning.

213
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:23,408
(Snow from Etna?)

214
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:29,113
(The master gathered the snow
before the trio arrived.)

215
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:32,550
(Using the exact method
from 1,200 years ago)

216
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,817
How interesting.

217
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,819
Oh, so this is how
they freeze it bit by bit.

218
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,622
Right?

219
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,301
(A must-have ingredient to
lower the freezing temperature)

220
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:40,992
(Salt)

221
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:42,760
Salt?

222
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:47,097
That's so cool. Oh, on the snow...

223
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:49,833
When you add salt, does it freeze faster?

224
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:50,201
(Why salt is added to snow)

225
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:51,636
(The snow will melt faster,
and absorb heat in the process.)

226
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:54,037
- This is like an Earth science class.
- Right?

227
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,573
How cool.

228
00:09:56,474 --> 00:10:00,110
What we're going to add...

229
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,813
is orange.

230
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,915
(Pure juice
extracted from Sicilian specialty oranges)

231
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:05,817
I thought it was tomato
because it's so red.

232
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:08,952
Thanks to the volcano,
the land became fertile,

233
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:11,356
which is why everything here
is to fresh and flavorful.

234
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:15,826
(The red flesh
is a unique trait of Sicilian oranges.)

235
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:19,230
Pour the extracted juice into the bucket.

236
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,068
That's going to be nice and sweet.

237
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:30,842
Now, stir with a spatula
to help bring the temperature down.

238
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:38,415
- Goodness.
- Look. He's not just stirring.

239
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,051
He's making waves against the bucket.

240
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:42,119
I see. Like this...

241
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,253
There's skill to this.

242
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,555
That way, the ice cream
forms along the sides of the bucket.

243
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:45,856
Exactly.

244
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:46,923
Amazing.

245
00:10:46,924 --> 00:10:48,525
Then, he scraps it.

246
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:50,027
Yeah, he scraps it in between.

247
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:51,128
This is a lot of work.

248
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:52,529
It's really cool.

249
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,265
- It's a natural slushy machine.
- You're right.

250
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,700
A machine without electricity.

251
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:58,535
Should we each take turns?

252
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:01,538
(The boys give it a go.)

253
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:03,874
We should try making this in the summer,
not just dalgona.

254
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,643
This would be nice.

255
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:09,313
- Or outside when it's snowing.
- Yeah.

256
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,548
- That'd be fun.
- That'd be fun.

257
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:11,615
Jinx!

258
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:15,585
Pile up some snow,
and use a container that stays cold.

259
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:16,787
Right, like a thin pot.

260
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:19,508
Can't we use an aluminum pot
that's usually used for cooking ramyeon?

261
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,258
I should give this a go when I get back.

262
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:24,528
It'd be so much fun
to do this when you go camping.

263
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:25,929
The kids would love it.

264
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,498
- Should I try it too?
- Sure.

265
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,001
Just a moment.

266
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:35,073
(The granita master shakes the bucket.)

267
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,142
(This way, the liquid will cool evenly,
giving it a smoother texture.)

268
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:39,376
Shake it like that? Okay.

269
00:11:39,377 --> 00:11:41,511
We need to shake it from time to time.

270
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,679
It looks a bit...

271
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,915
No, never mind.

272
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:46,216
It's only been like four minutes.

273
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:47,652
We need to do this for ten minutes?

274
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:55,225
(Let's go with determination.)

275
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:56,594
It's starting to freeze.

276
00:11:56,661 --> 00:12:00,164
(Power up!)

277
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,934
I kind of want to sing.

278
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:05,669
<i>Quaejina chingching nane</i>

279
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,938
<i>Quaejina chingching nane</i>

280
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:11,242
<i>Yes, granita</i>

281
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,510
(No surprises
with the older boy's work tunes)

282
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,713
This is literally eat, learn, execute.

283
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:18,583
Our hands are going to freeze too.

284
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:21,785
Who knew this was how hard
you needed to work for a slushy?

285
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:23,054
This is no joke.

286
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:24,589
Are your hands stuck?

287
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,159
He's a quick-learner.

288
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:29,727
Very nice.

289
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:32,562
You can go take a rest.
Please tell him to go inside and rest.

290
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:33,765
Tell him that we can do this.

291
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:35,932
Go inside and get some rest.

292
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,235
We'll call you when it's done.

293
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:40,038
(These guys are funny.)

294
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:42,340
I'm starting to scrap some
with the spatula.

295
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:44,642
The texture has totally changed.

296
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:48,178
(All that stirring with care...)

297
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:49,946
It's become a slushy.

298
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:51,749
(It has transformed
the liquid into granita.)

299
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,021
(A soft, delicate texture
created by snowflake-like ice crystals)

300
00:12:58,022 --> 00:12:59,257
That looks good.

301
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:01,625
We made slush naturally.

302
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:02,893
Naturally formed slush.

303
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:06,697
The texture is totally...

304
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:07,899
It's totally a slushy.

305
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:12,003
(A traditional dessert made on Mount Etna)

306
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:16,507
(The Trio Edition
Traditional Orange Granita)

307
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:17,909
Let's try it.

308
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:21,746
(Zing!)

309
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,614
(Shocking)

310
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:25,682
It's really sweet.

311
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,084
(Don't worry, they're loving it.)

312
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:28,485
It's tasty.

313
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:30,021
It's different from the oranges in Korea.

314
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:35,058
It's like a mix of 30% Korean orange
and 70% grapefruit.

315
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,430
Then, you get this slushy.
It's so good.

316
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:46,770
- It's smooth.
- It's sugar free.

317
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:49,239
Sicilian oranges are really sweet.

318
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,808
(Perfectly sweet even without sugar)

319
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,678
I can't stop eating it.

320
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,780
This is really good.

321
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:59,350
(Kihyun is officially in love
with granita.)

322
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,385
(Too good)

323
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:03,521
(Can't stop)

324
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:07,058
(And more)

325
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,228
(If the spoon isn't working,
just drink it.)

326
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:13,097
(Cleared)

327
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:17,368
(Determined to finish every last drop)

328
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,836
(Thank you for enjoying it.)

329
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:21,838
I just keep going back for more.

330
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,943
(The three boys have fallen in love
with granita.)

331
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:30,047
It's really good.

332
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:32,616
It's so delicious.
I was so surprised.

333
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:34,184
It's the flavor of effort.

334
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:36,553
It tastes good when you work hard for it.

335
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:39,589
You could use a slushy machine,

336
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,425
but that was a slushy made with our hands.

337
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:43,660
You need to try it.

338
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:45,729
Everyone needs to try it.

339
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,835
(A special traditional granita experience,
worth sharing with everyone)

340
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:52,569
I'll get in the front.

341
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,737
You'll get in the front.

342
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:55,940
- You'll get in the back.
- I'll get in the back.

343
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,608
(Where will they go
for their next experience?)

344
00:14:58,609 --> 00:14:59,910
Where are we going now?

345
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:02,846
We're going to have some local dishes.

346
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,114
Yes, shall we?

347
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,782
Let's go have some local meals.

348
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,453
(Off to tastes some local Sicilian dishes)

349
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:11,688
I wonder what kind of dishes
they're going to be.

350
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:14,225
- When I talk about local meals...
- You think of Korean meals, right?

351
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:18,228
- Rice, doenjang jjigae (stew)...
- Jeyuk (spicy pork).

352
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:21,264
Or grilled fish, you know?
And kimchi.

353
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:24,134
Since Sicily is the origin of dry pasta,

354
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:26,470
they eat pasta at least once a day.

355
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:27,671
It's like rice for them.

356
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:28,805
A pasta a day.

357
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:31,308
We also want to have rice
for at least one of our meals, right?

358
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:34,111
It's like that. They have pasta
for at least one of their meals.

359
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:35,480
They probably have...

360
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,881
- Carbonara.
- Yeah, carbonara.

361
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:41,151
Looks like
we'll get to try authentic pasta.

362
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:42,285
Buongiorno.

363
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:44,122
We're here.
There's a parking lot on the right.

364
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:45,890
(A village
nestled on the slopes of Mount Etna)

365
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,725
It's that one.

366
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,930
Look here.

367
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:55,933
(What is Kyung Ho impressed by?)

368
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:58,101
The view is incredible here.

369
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:00,504
Kyung Ho, the view is so refreshing.

370
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:02,385
(A view that captures
the entire city of Sicily)

371
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,410
(A sense of freedom from being away
from the hectic city)

372
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:07,679
Clear air too.

373
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,716
This is crazy.

374
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:13,918
The air is so refreshing.

375
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:15,753
Come here.

376
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:18,856
A view like this
is why you come to these places.

377
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:21,259
- Insane.
- Yeah.

378
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:22,994
Glad I came to study abroad.

379
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,963
What a beautiful view.

380
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:27,898
- What a view we get to enjoy.
- You're right.

381
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,967
- When else would we get to come here?
- Exactly.

382
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:31,601
This is unrealistic.

383
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:33,103
You can't capture this in a photo.

384
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,639
(Shall we do enjoy a Sicilian local meal?)

385
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,274
It's that one.

386
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,675
That house.

387
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:41,980
The house is so pretty.

388
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:45,582
When you wake up in the morning,

389
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,285
the view from here would be unreal.

390
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:50,988
(Is this the local meal master's house?)

391
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,557
Let's knock.

392
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,225
(According to my big eater instincts,
this is the master's house.)

393
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:55,525
I smell is.

394
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:56,995
This place is so pretty.

395
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:02,500
Ciao.

396
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,870
(The master was waiting for the boys.)

397
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:09,974
(Antonella,
a Sicilian local meal master)

398
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:15,113
(A master of local dishes,
devoted to traditional recipes)

399
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:24,389
(Traditional Sicilian Meals)

400
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,793
(Welcome to the world
of Sicilian local meals.)

401
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:32,296
Antonella.

402
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:34,564
(Miss Antonella?)

403
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,534
I've got three adult children.

404
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:37,435
(Forever young)

405
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,269
She's got an ultimate baby face.

406
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,370
You look so young.

407
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:41,639
Looks nowhere near your age.

408
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:43,607
It sort of smells like kimchi jjigae.

409
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:47,078
I smell Korean food.

410
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:50,113
It smells so good.
It smells like kimchi jjigae.

411
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:52,282
Would it be okay if we smelled it?

412
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:54,785
Could we take a look?

413
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:55,986
The smell...

414
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:58,556
(Stay tuned for the local Sicilian dish
that surprised all three!)

415
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:00,791
It's ready.

416
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:01,892
Thank you.

417
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:04,494
As you may know, we've been learning
about different cuisines,

418
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:05,696
so we were just very curious.

419
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:07,565
What's this?

420
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:15,840
(Just boiling water)

421
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:19,377
(I'm going to cook
something else with this.)

422
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,579
She even has a meat slicer here.

423
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,247
And this is a brass pot.

424
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:26,017
Only those who love cooking has this.

425
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:31,222
It's a pot made with copper.

426
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,890
This brass pot is a nice one.

427
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:37,527
She had brass pots,
a staple for those who love cooking...

428
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:39,797
(Loved due to the high heat conductivity,
which allows for precise control)

429
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:41,431
And a meat slicer.

430
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:44,235
- This isn't common for a home kitchen.
- There's a meat slicer and...

431
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:50,778
("This is my favorite place,
and also the most beautiful one.")

432
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,543
(- Local Meal Master)

433
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,079
(In this kitchen, cookware is the decor
with plates...)

434
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,648
(Cutting boards as decor)

435
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:58,849
(Bellows as decor)

436
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,117
(Bellows)

437
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:03,620
That's a wood-fired oven.

438
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:05,256
It must be a wood-fired oven.

439
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,091
A really one?

440
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:16,127
(Every Saturday, we fire up the oven
to make pizza or lamb dishes.)

441
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:19,037
I can imagine the smoke going up.

442
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:23,308
Then are those dishes especially for us?

443
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:27,111
(Their expectations have risen
after looking around the kitchen.)

444
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:30,848
(Local Sicilian dishes
will blow your mind.)

445
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:33,483
(Staring)

446
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:35,153
This looks familiar.

447
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,455
This is artichoke.

448
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:40,891
This is sun-dried tomato.

449
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:43,728
They must have artichokes quite often.

450
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:48,332
(Marinated artichokes,
marinated tomatoes, marinated olives)

451
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,133
These olives look like kimchi.

452
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:52,302
It seems like they used
red pepper power here.

453
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:54,463
These days, many people
make olive kimchi in Korea too.

454
00:19:55,807 --> 00:20:01,145
(Just like side dishes in Korea,
marinated veggies are a stable in Sicily.)

455
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:06,483
(Is it thanks to the marinated olives?
Even in Korea, olive kimchi is popular.)

456
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:09,319
This is interesting.
When we first went abroad to study,

457
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,521
we kept looking
and talking about the view,

458
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:11,823
even when we went to someone's house.

459
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:13,657
- But now, food.
- Spices.

460
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:16,727
We're talking about
what went in here, what they used...

461
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:19,663
I was surprised.
He was touching the pots and everything.

462
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:20,897
This smell...

463
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:22,165
People change.

464
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,267
(The three boys,
grown through three study trips abroad.)

465
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:24,669
She really enjoys cooking.

466
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:32,109
(The first local dish is finally here.)

467
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,344
It's so pretty.

468
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:37,348
It's meat.

469
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:40,851
(A signature Sicilian dish,
polpette agrodolce)

470
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:42,987
What does that mean?

471
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:47,991
Agro means sour.

472
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:51,362
Dolce means sweet.

473
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,601
(A signature dish loved by Sicilians)

474
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:58,902
(Polpette Agrodolce)

475
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,705
(Minced veal meatballs
paired with a tangy-sweet sauce)

476
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:01,805
Sweet and sour.

477
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:03,107
It's like tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork).

478
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:04,541
Tangsuyuk is sweet and sour.

479
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:07,511
- It's their version of tangsuyuk.
- You're right.

480
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:08,846
That looks good.

481
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:11,215
I can't wait to try it.

482
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,683
Thank you for the meal.

483
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:15,585
Buon pranzo.

484
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:18,790
Buon appetito.

485
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,760
(Su Young's Italian energy spikes
with local dishes in front of him.)

486
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,628
Let's try it.

487
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:25,796
I want to try the meat first.

488
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:27,365
(How will the meatballs taste?
It had that Korean aroma.)

489
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:30,133
(What?)

490
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:35,573
(The boys say nothing and just laugh.)

491
00:21:35,974 --> 00:21:39,410
Is it good?

492
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:41,446
It's so good.

493
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:44,682
It's unbelievable.

494
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,551
(Satisfied)

495
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:50,754
I haven't tasted any sweet Italian dishes,

496
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:52,556
but there's a sweetness here,

497
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:54,825
so I think that's why
it tastes more pleasant.

498
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:56,126
The sweet and sour...

499
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:57,394
Su Young, it is tangsuyuk.

500
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:59,129
It tastes like beef tangsuyuk.

501
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,130
This is unbeatable.

502
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:04,569
This dish is very similar
to a Korean this. It's very familiar.

503
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:10,407
(A bite of the meatball)

504
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:13,378
(A bite of the marinated tomato)

505
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:19,317
(Off he goes on a culinary adventure.)

506
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:22,185
Su Young, have the meatball,

507
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:24,956
then try a piece of the sun-dried tomato.

508
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,758
(I've found the ultimate combination.)

509
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:28,859
Are they a perfect match?

510
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,461
The two together is just incredible.

511
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:33,031
I thought it'd be too spicy.

512
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:37,901
(I've found my dopamine.)

513
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:40,838
It's like tangsuyuk without the batter
eaten with danmuji (pickled radish).

514
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:43,273
- Spot on.
- This combination is...

515
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:45,008
This combination is very lovely to me.

516
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,077
We're not the only ones
who eat kimchi.

517
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:49,146
In a way, this is like kimchi too.

518
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:50,814
It cleans your palate.

519
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:52,615
- And it keeps the flavor interesting.
- Yeah.

520
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,253
This is what she has at home?

521
00:22:55,853 --> 00:22:57,188
It's too delicious.

522
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:00,892
(It's just everyday stuff at our house.)

523
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:03,560
- I'm happy.
- It's delicious.

524
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:04,829
I'm happy.

525
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,065
The pasta...

526
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:11,869
Voglio imparare...

527
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,941
(Can't understand him at all)

528
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:18,709
(What? Carbonara?)

529
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,945
(Okay, I got it.)

530
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,915
(Confused(

531
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,451
Carbonara is an Italian dish, right?

532
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:29,953
I've always wanted to learn
how to make carbonara in Italy.

533
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:32,290
Somehow, it never tastes the same at home.

534
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,491
I wanted to be there myself,

535
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:36,493
not just see it on TV or online.

536
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:38,629
I wanted to see carbonara
made by the people...

537
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,197
who actually live that life.

538
00:23:40,198 --> 00:23:41,466
That's why I'm here too, right?

539
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:46,537
(Local Sicilian pasta)

540
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:50,675
(Learn how to cook carbonara
in a country of pasta.)

541
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,844
This is my first time
trying authentic carbonara.

542
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,278
Same here. In Italy too.

543
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,114
Plus, at someone's house.

544
00:23:57,115 --> 00:24:01,352
A real and authentic
homemade carbonara.

545
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,189
(Boil the pasta first for carbonara, )

546
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,260
(Which pasta had the master picked?)

547
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:13,631
Tortiglioni.

548
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:15,499
It's tortiglioni.

549
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,768
It's a bit thinner than the one I used.

550
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:20,238
(Tortiglioni / Cylindrical pasta
that holds sauce for a deeper flavor)

551
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:23,341
How much salt do you need to add?

552
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:27,511
(Authentic Carbonara
1. Add 1T of salt and boil the pasta.)

553
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:31,181
I also add about 1T per 2L of water.

554
00:24:31,182 --> 00:24:33,284
I also add a similar amount of salt.

555
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,254
Getting her confirmation
makes me feel reassured.

556
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:40,725
As I'm learning,
I'm confirming that I wasn't wrong.

557
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,162
That's black. Is it Camembert?

558
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:46,631
What is that? What cheese is it?

559
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:51,568
- Pecorino.
- Romano.

560
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:54,471
(What does that mean?)

561
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:57,007
Pecorino is made from sheep's milk.

562
00:24:57,008 --> 00:25:00,043
The method is similar to making
Grana Padano but you use sheep's milk.

563
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:01,979
So, pecorino tends to be smellier.

564
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,314
(Pecorino Romano / Italian cheese
made from sheep's milk, peppery and bold)

565
00:25:03,314 --> 00:25:06,817
How do you even know pecorino?

566
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:08,820
You need pecorino to make carbonara.

567
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:10,988
Do you use cream to make carbonara?

568
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:15,058
No.

569
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,128
I've seen a lot of videos
where Italians react to adding cream.

570
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:20,130
They go like this.

571
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:21,611
You shouldn't add cream to carbonara.

572
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,037
(I need to teach him the real stuff.)

573
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:31,209
(Korean carbonara uses milk.)

574
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:34,144
(Authentic carbonara
only uses 2 ingredients.)

575
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:37,582
(Pecorino romano, egg)

576
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:43,621
(2. Grate some pecorino romano
into 5 egg yolks.)

577
00:25:43,788 --> 00:25:46,089
Should I do it?

578
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,725
Do you want to?

579
00:25:49,894 --> 00:25:51,128
Tutto.

580
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:52,163
I need to grate all of it?

581
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:53,364
Yeah, all of it.

582
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:54,665
This is a lot.

583
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,234
It's about 60g.

584
00:25:57,302 --> 00:26:01,406
(Egg yolks and pecorino romano)

585
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:06,110
(When you mix the two,
the texture becomes creamy.)

586
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:10,814
(Next, what is she holding?)

587
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:13,650
I see. She's going to use the meat slicer
to get thin slices.

588
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:14,985
I want to see it.

589
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:17,588
(A meat slicer?)

590
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:22,293
(She was holding guanciale.)

591
00:26:22,827 --> 00:26:26,063
(Guanciale / Cured Italian pork jowl,
seasoned with salt and aged)

592
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:29,600
(An essential ingredient
for authentic carbonara)

593
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:34,405
(Authentic carbonara uses guanciale,
and Korean carbonara uses bacon.)

594
00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:37,941
I've tried making
aglio e olio using guanciale.

595
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:38,976
It was really good.

596
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,277
- Guanciale?
- Yes, guanciale.

597
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:42,279
You know so much about food and cooking.

598
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,915
If you know guanciale,
you're definitely not a casual cook.

599
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:46,350
For me, guanciale sounds like...

600
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:48,919
If someone asked me,
"Do you know guanciale?"

601
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,922
I feel like I'd say, "Where's that?"

602
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:53,824
(Where's that?)

603
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:56,593
I wouldn't have known
that it was an ingredient.

604
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:57,996
"Excuse me? Guanciale?"

605
00:26:58,129 --> 00:27:03,067
(This is guanciale.)

606
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:06,104
(3. Cook the thinly sliced guanciale
in low heat.)

607
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:09,239
(Adding some pasta water...)

608
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,942
(To the guanciale?)

609
00:27:12,143 --> 00:27:14,711
(She's adding pasta water
when cooking meat?)

610
00:27:14,712 --> 00:27:16,246
This way, the fat renders out better.

611
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:18,815
If you don't do this,
it might burn,

612
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:20,376
or the fat might take longer to render.

613
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:22,619
When you cook it with water first,

614
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,755
it helps the fat render out better.

615
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:26,223
There, the fat's starting to render.

616
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:28,459
(Sauté until the moisture evaporates.)

617
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,264
(Set the cooked guanciale aside.)

618
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:37,635
(Mixing the rendered fat with pasta water
helps the sauce cling to the pasta.)

619
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:39,103
(An authentic carbonara recipe
brings out the flavors of the ingredient.)

620
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:40,772
So she doesn't throw out the fat.

621
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:44,775
(4. Mix the yolk, pecorino, black pepper
for an authentic carbonara sauce.)

622
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:47,011
She doesn't use as much black pepper
as I thought.

623
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:53,484
(5. Mix the pasta, sauce and guanciale.)

624
00:27:57,488 --> 00:28:02,826
(Add the guanciale too
and mix for a delicious carbonara.)

625
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:04,562
It's done already. That was quick.

626
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:07,665
I know how to make carbonara now.

627
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:10,867
Su Young, so when you mix the sauce...

628
00:28:10,868 --> 00:28:12,437
with the pasta,
you do it off the heat, right?

629
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,037
Right, you don't want to cook the yolk.

630
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:17,874
If the yolk cooks,
it'd be noodles with scrambled egg.

631
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,978
I think the most important thing here
is to make sure the egg stays creamy.

632
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:23,181
- She's generous with portions.
- Is she giving us a lot?

633
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:25,650
This is the usual portion size in Italy.

634
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:30,121
(A traditional recipe that brings out
the pure flavors of each ingredient.)

635
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,359
(Its delicate golden color
is enough to make your mouth water.)

636
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:35,895
(Authentic Carbonara
1. Boil pasta with 1T salt.)

637
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:36,928
(2. Mix 5 yolks, 60g pecorino,
1/2T black pepper.)

638
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,262
(3. Sauté thinly sliced
guanciale with pasta water.)

639
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:39,430
(4. Turn off the heat
and mix everything.)

640
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,470
(What's the flavor
of true carbonara without cream?)

641
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,500
This is the original.

642
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,402
This is carbonara.

643
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:47,338
- It's al dente.
- Yes, al dente.

644
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:49,974
I love "al dente."

645
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:55,479
So this is what al dente
is supposed to taste like.

646
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,681
I always thought
it tasted a bit under cooked.

647
00:28:57,682 --> 00:28:59,016
- It's good.
- It's different.

648
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:02,153
How did she cook this perfectly
without having a timer?

649
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:03,887
It's delicious.

650
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:06,923
With this original, authentic carbonara,

651
00:29:06,924 --> 00:29:08,358
you can really taste the cheese.

652
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,426
Yeah, you're right.

653
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:11,428
The cheese flavor I'm tasting right now...

654
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:15,232
is like, you know processed cheese slices?

655
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:17,968
You know the cheesy taste you get
when you fold that multiple times?

656
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:20,003
You get that intense cheese flavor.

657
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:21,238
It's like that.

658
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:24,074
(Salty, savory, and nutty cheese sauce)

659
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:27,244
I can't believe there's eggs in this.

660
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,613
I can't really taste the egg at all.

661
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:30,213
It doesn't have that egg texture.

662
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:31,949
I can't believe it doesn't taste
like the eggs from soy sauce and egg rice.

663
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:34,851
It's so interesting
how the egg becomes creamy like this.

664
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:35,953
Yeah, it's creamy.

665
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:38,488
Now that I've had this,

666
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:40,491
I've realized that all the carbonaras
I've had until now...

667
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:42,592
weren't proper carbonaras.

668
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:44,662
This has such a deep flavor.

669
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:51,235
(Reviewing the carbonara recipe
with the master)

670
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:57,675
Guanciale, pecorino romano, eggs.

671
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:00,445
It's so delicious.
I want her to cook everything for us.

672
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:04,815
(Stop it.)

673
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:07,651
There was this dish we had yesterday...

674
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:09,252
It was called caponata.

675
00:30:09,253 --> 00:30:11,521
It had layers of eggplant in it.

676
00:30:11,522 --> 00:30:14,559
Could we also learn how to make that?

677
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,894
(Of course, you can.)

678
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:19,957
(Caponata,
a Sicilian classic made with eggplant)

679
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:23,401
(One of the island's specialties,
grown in its fertile volcanic soil)

680
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:31,275
(Since it uses a lot of vegetables,
it's perfect as a fridge clean-up dish.)

681
00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:35,647
(The local meal master's
caponata recipe is here.)

682
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:41,085
(Prep the main ingredient for caponata,
eggplants.)

683
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:43,321
The eggplant is very round.

684
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:44,989
(Sicilian eggplants are large and round.)

685
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,724
It's literally "egg" plant.

686
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:48,826
I've never seen something like this.

687
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:49,827
How interesting.

688
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:54,699
(Caponata / 1. Peel the skin, then chop.)

689
00:30:55,033 --> 00:31:00,170
What? She's peeling it
like she's peeling a watermelon.

690
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:01,472
She's not precise with it.

691
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,276
She leaves some skin on like that.

692
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:07,545
Leaving all the skin on
makes the texture too tough,

693
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:11,549
but when you get rid of all the skin,
it'll lose its shape and taste boring.

694
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,321
(Cut the eggplant in cube shapes.)

695
00:31:16,654 --> 00:31:18,056
Do you need help?

696
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:21,625
(Glancing)

697
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,094
Should I peel some onions?

698
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:26,630
Yes, I will need that soon.

699
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,398
Let's peel these.

700
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,500
- I need to take notes.
- Yeah?

701
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,537
- I need to learn.
- Yeah?

702
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:34,771
(Awkward scratch)

703
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:37,474
I can't just remember everything like you.

704
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:39,609
I'm writing everything down
like what size...

705
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,212
Okay, fine.

706
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:44,349
If you're not going to help me later,
you peel them.

707
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,252
(Cut other vegetables into cubes as well.)

708
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:51,656
(Marinated olives, bell pepper,
tomato, cherry tomato)

709
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,891
She's cut everything
into nice bite-sized pieces.

710
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:56,027
I think you're right.

711
00:31:56,661 --> 00:32:00,198
(Add celery
that's been boiled for 10 minutes.)

712
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:02,200
(That's basically
an anti-aging diet right there.)

713
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,002
Yeah, you're right.

714
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:06,069
Drizzle some olive oil...

715
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,840
(2. Season with 3T olive oil,
1T salt, 1T black pepper.)

716
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:12,609
- It has all the healthy vegetables.
- Right?

717
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,512
I think that's what makes it unique.

718
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,015
We also have a one-pan recipe
for japchae (stir-fried glass noodle).

719
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:19,383
I think she's just cooking everything
together right now,

720
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:21,144
but normally,
I bet you cook them separately.

721
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:25,623
(Correct)

722
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:30,561
Cook it at 250 degrees.

723
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:33,197
(Cook it on high it,
almost like you're frying it.)

724
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:34,564
That hot?

725
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:36,401
(Cook it on high it,
almost like you're frying it.)

726
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:37,901
For how long do we cook it for?

727
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:39,603
Thirty minutes.

728
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:40,637
(Surprised)

729
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:41,906
It takes a long time, huh?

730
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:46,843
So this dish
is all about prepping and time.

731
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:49,713
- Right.
- Once you put it in the oven...

732
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:53,283
The oil-coated vegetables
will get nice and crispy in the oven.

733
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:55,852
It'll turn out like...

734
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:57,588
as if you've pan-fried it.

735
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:00,525
Then, she said
she was going to use agrodolce,

736
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:03,560
the sweet and sour sauce from earlier.

737
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:04,629
Agrodolce?

738
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:08,533
(The agrodolce sauce
is the key to caponata.)

739
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,001
(Agro mean sour.)

740
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:14,772
(Dolce means sweet.)

741
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:18,543
(Just like Koreans,
Sicilians like the sweet and tangy taste.)

742
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:24,382
(It's the sauce that was used
in the meatball dish earlier.)

743
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:28,853
(You only need 3 ingredients
to make the agrodolce sauce.)

744
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:32,389
(120ml of vinegar,
50ml of water, 1T sugar)

745
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,426
(Put it on heat, then boil.)

746
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,931
(Boil the sauce for 20 minutes
to get rid of the sharp, sour taste.)

747
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,734
I suddenly smell something like
balsamic vinegar.

748
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:46,637
The sauce seems quite simple.

749
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:50,408
You just boil vinegar, water, and sugar
to make the sauce.

750
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:56,381
(Caponata is done cooking.)

751
00:33:58,282 --> 00:33:59,917
So after 30 minutes, it looks like this.

752
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:01,686
(Once all the seasoned vegetables
get deliciously cooked in the oven...)

753
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:04,354
The colors have toned down a bit.

754
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:05,989
Totally caramelized.

755
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,257
You're right.

756
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:08,493
The onions...

757
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,329
(Caponata / 3. Pour the agrodolce sauce
on the cooked veggies, mix.)

758
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,498
You just pour it
on the veggies right away.

759
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:16,700
Mushrooms would've been nice too.

760
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:19,370
- Yeah, mushrooms.
- Like button mushrooms.

761
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:22,806
Remember how it smelled
really sharp earlier?

762
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:25,442
That subtle sweetness
has gotten stronger now.

763
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:27,344
I really want to try a spoonful right now.

764
00:34:27,345 --> 00:34:29,579
It totally smells like an Italian dish.

765
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,750
(A Signature Sicilian Dish
Caponata)

766
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,486
(Caponata / 1. Partially peel the eggplant
and dice it into cubes.)

767
00:34:35,486 --> 00:34:35,918
(2. Cube 3 eggplant,
2 onion, 1 bell pepper...)

768
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:36,401
(1 tomato, 5 cherry tomato,
8 marinated olives.)

769
00:34:36,402 --> 00:34:37,422
(3. Chop celery,
boil in salted water for 10 mins.)

770
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:37,915
(4. Season with 3T olive
oil, 1T salt, 1T pepper...)

771
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:38,311
(Cook for 25 mins in
a 250-degree oven.)

772
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:38,929
(5. Boil 120ml vinegar, 50ml
water, 1T sugar for 20 mins...)

773
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,357
(Mix with veggies, cook for 5 more mins.)

774
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:40,891
Let's try it.

775
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,860
Let me scoop some.

776
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:46,864
(Full of anticipation)

777
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:49,199
(Curious)

778
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,434
It's delicious.

779
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:52,403
It's different from the taste I imagined.

780
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:55,772
It smells sharp and sour,

781
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:57,742
but it doesn't taste really sour.

782
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,578
It's sweet and tangy.

783
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:03,247
You can taste that
from all the vegetables,

784
00:35:03,614 --> 00:35:06,551
but you also get the natural flavors
from each vegetables. It's great.

785
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:08,952
I want to add sausage here.

786
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:10,121
It's kind of like ssoya
(sausage and veg stir-fry).

787
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:11,755
You're right. It is.

788
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:14,558
I guess instead of sausages,
you're using eggplants for this one.

789
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,960
But the aroma is so much better
compared to ssoya.

790
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:18,262
It tastes really sophisticated.

791
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,465
How do bell peppers
taste so sweet like this?

792
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:22,566
It's sweet.

793
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:23,701
The bell peppers are really sweet.

794
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:24,901
Very refined.

795
00:35:24,902 --> 00:35:26,236
(It's so delicious.)

796
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:28,373
She only used vinegar, sugar, and salt,

797
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:36,481
but if you pair this with steak,
you could have this nonstop.

798
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:39,784
(Totally lost in it)

799
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:42,152
(Satisfied)

800
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:44,921
We've tried lots of dishes
at the market yesterday,

801
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,424
but your dishes taste the best.

802
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,192
Thank you.

803
00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:51,763
It's number one.

804
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:53,431
I want to learn how to make it,
then cook it tonight.

805
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:57,335
I wanted to make
the meatball dish earlier.

806
00:35:57,735 --> 00:36:00,672
(The first dish they tasted
was polpette agrodolce.)

807
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:05,159
(Then there was carbonara,
for which they learned the full recipe.)

808
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,477
(And even caponata)

809
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:09,414
(The local Sicilian dishes have sparked
the boy's creativity.)

810
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:12,517
(Tonight, it returns
with a special twist.)

811
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:14,686
(Caponata competition
between Su Young and Kyung Ho)

812
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:17,788
I think I got a special idea.

813
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:19,089
A secret weapon.

814
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,091
It smells really good.

815
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:22,193
Yeah?

816
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:25,196
(A new meatball recipe
by the dessert prince, Kihyun)

817
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:27,065
Kihyun, it smells good.

818
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:34,739
(What kind of twist will the boys bring
to the Sicilian table?)

819
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:40,345
(The second Ryu-cipe night
in Sicily starts now.)

820
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:46,651
(The boys have arrived back at home
after learning about the local meals.)

821
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,786
- Mamma mia.
- Mamma mia.

822
00:36:49,253 --> 00:36:50,921
What is this?

823
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:52,790
(Goes straight to the kitchen
after arriving at home)

824
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,459
How nice and spacious is this?

825
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:55,926
How's the kitchen?

826
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:57,628
- It's so nice and spacious.
- Yeah.

827
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:58,929
Looks like we've made it.

828
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,998
Come and take a look.

829
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:02,812
(Su Young and Kyung Ho
are also very impressed.)

830
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:04,869
(A cozy space
that the three boys can enjoy)

831
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,104
It's nice.

832
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:07,704
This is too nice.

833
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:10,073
The stove looks nice
and the oven looks new.

834
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:11,642
There are six stove tops.

835
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,210
You're right.

836
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:15,245
What we talked about earlier
is all here.

837
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:17,080
This is nice.

838
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:20,385
Do Italians generally prefer
spacious kitchens?

839
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:22,486
Since food is important.

840
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:24,389
No wonder it's one of the world's
top three food countries.

841
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:25,757
The kitchen is the biggest space here.

842
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:29,427
There's this strong feeling
of doing things together here.

843
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:31,796
This is quite something as well.

844
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:34,865
- This is...
- A chicken.

845
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,700
This is a rooster.

846
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:39,102
We learned about the hen in Portugal.

847
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:40,604
The rooster here...

848
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,707
What could this mean?

849
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:45,943
I just hope
it turns out the way I want it to.

850
00:37:45,943 --> 00:37:48,346
We chose what we were going to make
while grocery shopping earlier.

851
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:49,379
Right.

852
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,748
Then I'll start prepping the ingredients,

853
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,817
and start cooking caponata.

854
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:57,288
I'll organize my recipe later.

855
00:37:57,689 --> 00:38:00,324
- We're all used to grocery shopping now.
- Olive.

856
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:02,559
Can you show my what you wrote?

857
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,660
Can you read it?

858
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:04,896
(Caponata ingredient list
from Kyung Ho's recipe note)

859
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:07,664
I just picked up bell peppers, celery...

860
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:09,065
What's your plan for your Ryu-cipe?

861
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:13,136
I wanted to recreate caponata,
the dish we learned about today.

862
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:16,073
I thought that the texture...

863
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:19,576
of these tangy vegetables would pair well
with noodles in the summer.

864
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,611
Tangy noodles sound perfect.

865
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:27,684
I'm planning to make tangy cold noodles.

866
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,454
I don't think I've ever had bibim guksu
(spicy cold noodles)...

867
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:31,255
- with so many vegetables like that.
- Exactly.

868
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:34,691
Then maybe chop the vegetables
into noodle shapes...

869
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:36,661
because cubes might be hard to eat
with the noodles.

870
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:39,396
You could just julienne the vegetables.

871
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:41,264
(Kyung Ho has received an idea
from Ryu-GPT.)

872
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:42,800
Right?

873
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:48,206
(Sweet and sour caponata
meets bold K-spicy sauce.)

874
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:55,246
(A Summer Treat
Caponata Cold Noodles)

875
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,651
(Start by prepping the eggplant,
the key ingredient for caponata.)

876
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:02,854
(Ryu-GPT's idea
was to julienne the vegetables.)

877
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:07,558
(The reason for julienning
is that it's easier to eat with noodles.)

878
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,560
(Starring)

879
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:14,132
I get what you're trying to do,
but I think it's a bit too long.

880
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:16,100
(Hesitant)

881
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:17,802
I think you need to cut it across
at least once.

882
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:18,269
(Glancing)

883
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,771
I think you need to cut it across
at least once.

884
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:24,776
(Applied right away)

885
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:31,482
(Apart from egg plants,
you could use whatever veggies you want.)

886
00:39:31,683 --> 00:39:34,251
The spoons here are bigger
compared to the Korean ones,

887
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,954
so we need to use less
compared to our normal amounts.

888
00:39:36,955 --> 00:39:39,323
(1T of salt, 1/3T of black pepper)

889
00:39:39,324 --> 00:39:43,727
I'm seasoning with black pepper
and drizzling olive oil.

890
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:46,430
It's making me feel like a proper chef.

891
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:48,365
You are a proper chef.

892
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:50,126
You've even come
for a culinary study abroad.

893
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:53,403
But is this truffle oil
and not just olive oil?

894
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:55,706
This is a truffle oil, truffle bianco.

895
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:56,507
Using truffle oil will be nice too.

896
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:58,376
Should I use truffle then?

897
00:39:58,609 --> 00:39:59,978
That's going to add lots of truffle aroma.

898
00:39:59,978 --> 00:40:02,346
- Which one did you go with?
- Truffle.

899
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:05,248
Wouldn't it be fine? It will lose
its aroma when heated, no?

900
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:06,350
Right?

901
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:08,452
This could lead to a new recipe,

902
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:12,390
or it could turn out to be the reason
for failure and a lesson to reflect on.

903
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:15,560
(Will the truffle oil
lead him to success?)

904
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,995
I just put it in the oven, right?

905
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:18,796
Just open that and put it in?

906
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:24,669
(Cook the seasoned vegetables
in the oven for 25 minutes.)

907
00:40:25,637 --> 00:40:27,038
Right, vinegar.

908
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:31,142
This will make a difference again.

909
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,510
Regular vinegar is okay,

910
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:35,712
- but the master didn't use that.
- Right? So...

911
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:36,880
So I bought one.

912
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,750
- Gosh, thank you.
- Is this what the master used?

913
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,284
They pretty much always use
white wine vinegar here.

914
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,620
(Agrodolce sauce
made with white wine vinegar)

915
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:46,089
- Then could I use some of this?
- Of course.

916
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,327
White wine vinegar
is the standard vinegar here.

917
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,729
It's sort of like makgeolli vinegar
but with a different aroma.

918
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,865
There's such thing as a makgeolli vinegar?

919
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:54,966
It's naturally fermented vinegar.

920
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:57,501
Lots of people prefer
naturally fermented vinegar these days.

921
00:40:57,502 --> 00:40:59,270
Brewed vinegar
is made through chemical processes.

922
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,406
(Makgeolli vinegar / Naturally fermented,
rich and savory with a distinct tang)

923
00:41:01,406 --> 00:41:04,942
(You could replace white wine vinegar
with makgeolli vinegar.)

924
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,578
(Mix white wine vinegar, sugar, and water,
then reduce to make the agrodolce sauce.)

925
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:09,179
This is definitely...

926
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,883
It's losing its sourness as it boils.

927
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:14,117
Yeah. It goes away quickly.

928
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:16,386
It's like the night of vinegar
at this point.

929
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:17,455
You're right.

930
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:18,755
This is what I thought.

931
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:20,858
Boiling it in water
to mellow out the sourness works well too,

932
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:22,392
but if you're going to get rid of it,

933
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:25,063
how about doing it all at once
and use only one pan for it?

934
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,200
(An easy one-pan caponata recipe
by Su Young)

935
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:31,636
I'll quickly cook
all the vegetables separately.

936
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:36,007
(Su Young's caponata
1. Cook vegetables separately.)

937
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,143
(Tomato, onion, bell pepper, squash)

938
00:41:39,377 --> 00:41:41,980
Then, I'll combine them all, add sugar...

939
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:49,447
(2. Combine the vegetables,
add sugar, then sauté.)

940
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:55,560
(Transfer the sautéed vegetables
to another bowl.)

941
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:59,329
Wouldn't it taste the same if we quickly
cook off the vinegar and mix it in?

942
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,333
You just have to understand the method.

943
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:05,469
Either way,
we're getting rid of the sourness.

944
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,872
As long as the texture and taste
of the sauce are similar, right?

945
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:12,075
I'll do five vinegar to two sugar.

946
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:15,112
- It's not a sweet dish.
- No.

947
00:42:15,113 --> 00:42:17,314
- I mean, in-your-face sweet.
- No.

948
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:19,883
(Use the same pan and cook the sauce.)

949
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:21,685
Now, I just have to reduce it, right?

950
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:22,819
Right.

951
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,191
After waiting a bit, the sugar melted
and turned into caramel.

952
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:31,396
When the sugar gets caramelized,
it gets a deeper flavor.

953
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:35,033
(Caramelized sauce)

954
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:39,836
(Add the vegetables into the sauce.)

955
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:41,338
Now, if I combine everything...

956
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:43,941
It's kind of like
a cooked version of pickles.

957
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:46,643
But if the peppers cook a bit more,

958
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:48,478
it would become thicker.

959
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,181
(Sauté until the sauce thickens.)

960
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:53,850
In some ways, it was a dish like japchae.

961
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:57,020
People who've cooked a lot
are just on another level.

962
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,088
No, it's not that.

963
00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:01,124
This is just my version
of a no-oven caponata.

964
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,960
I'm just going to enjoy the freshness.

965
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:05,596
But of course, it won't have
that deep flavor like the master's one.

966
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:08,298
- Is it okay? Did it burn?
- Yeah, It's burnt.

967
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:09,466
(It's burnt?)

968
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:10,567
Goodness.

969
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:12,403
I should've checked on it.

970
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:13,937
Isn't that a bit too burnt?

971
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:15,772
Let's try it. Is it too burnt?

972
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:17,141
- Wait a minute.
- Transfer it to a bowl.

973
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:18,809
It smells burnt.

974
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,179
- Pour it in here.
- That happened so quickly.

975
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:23,081
I can't believe this just happened.

976
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:26,050
I've failed.

977
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:27,684
What did you...

978
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:28,819
No, this won't work.

979
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,254
It smells like herbal medicine.

980
00:43:31,522 --> 00:43:32,957
No, I can't use this.

981
00:43:33,191 --> 00:43:34,959
I can't believe this happened.

982
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:37,996
(The sauce turned into
an herbal medicine and died.)

983
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:39,396
Goodness...

984
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:40,698
Gosh.

985
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:42,333
(Kyung Ho has done it again today.)

986
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,569
- Gosh.
- Too bad...

987
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:46,871
- It's upsetting, right?
- Yeah.

988
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:50,907
Everything was going well too.

989
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:52,577
I'll quickly make one again.

990
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:56,347
What a waste of this white wine vinegar.

991
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:58,282
I'm going to keep my eyes on it this time.

992
00:43:58,282 --> 00:43:59,584
- Yeah?
- Yes.

993
00:44:00,752 --> 00:44:01,853
This is making me nervous.

994
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:06,724
(How are the vegetables doing?)

995
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:09,145
I think I'll take the vegetables
out of the oven.

996
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:16,266
(Did the seasoned vegetables cook well?)

997
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:18,302
Kyung Ho, it smells really good.

998
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,470
Yeah?

999
00:44:20,672 --> 00:44:21,739
(Vegetables cooked
to tender perfection in the oven)

1000
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:23,273
That looks good.

1001
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:25,176
(Vegetables cooked
to tender perfection in the oven)

1002
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:28,446
(Now, pouring the successful
agrodolce sauce onto the vegetables)

1003
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,684
(Mix the vegetables and the sauce well.)

1004
00:44:33,685 --> 00:44:35,887
- I'm looking forward to that.
- Right?

1005
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:37,955
Maybe Kyung Ho...

1006
00:44:37,956 --> 00:44:40,090
actually understands caponata the best.

1007
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:41,251
- Even more than me.
- Really?

1008
00:44:41,693 --> 00:44:43,760
- Thanks, Su Young.
- I mean it.

1009
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:47,265
(Places the caponata in the fridge
so that it can be eaten cold.)

1010
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:53,904
Looking pretty good. What's this?
Is it chojang (sweet and sour gochujang).

1011
00:44:53,905 --> 00:44:55,006
- That?
- Yeah.

1012
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:57,341
- It's a secret.
- I don't make comments.

1013
00:44:57,342 --> 00:44:59,143
What do you mean chojang?
Don't try to guess.

1014
00:45:00,912 --> 00:45:04,682
(A secret sauce recipe
that Su Young doesn't even know)

1015
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:09,854
(4T of sesame oil, 5T soy sauce.

1016
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:13,324
(A spicy combo of 2T red pepper powder,
2T gochujang (red pepper paste))

1017
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:15,426
(Add 1T of garlic for that sharp spice.)

1018
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,696
(Add 4T of sugar for that sweetness.)

1019
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:20,797
This has to be good.

1020
00:45:20,798 --> 00:45:22,532
Everything's in here.

1021
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:23,109
(Here's Kyung Ho's
secret sauce recipe!)

1022
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,402
(It's 4T sesame oil, 2T red pepper powder,
1T garlic, 6T soy sauce, 4T sugar.)

1023
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:27,572
Where's that thing I bought earlier...
Found it.

1024
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,608
Nice.

1025
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:31,943
My secret weapon.

1026
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,544
Those are just noodles.

1027
00:45:34,545 --> 00:45:36,246
These aren't Korean noodles.

1028
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:38,715
It's a type of pasta they sell here.

1029
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:40,050
I tried to pick a similar one.

1030
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:42,453
It's called "angel hair" pasta.

1031
00:45:43,054 --> 00:45:46,057
(Chose capellini,
similar to Korean somyeon)

1032
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:50,294
(Twirl the cooked pasta
and place it on a bowl.)

1033
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:51,995
I think it's good.

1034
00:45:51,996 --> 00:45:53,665
I can feel the love
and passion you have for cooking.

1035
00:45:53,665 --> 00:45:55,065
Thank you.

1036
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:57,067
That is looking good.

1037
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:59,704
I've collected the vegetable juices
from making caponata.

1038
00:46:00,238 --> 00:46:04,208
(Collect the caponata broth in advance
and let it cool.)

1039
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:08,545
(Here's comes another kick!
Caponata veggie broth)

1040
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:11,281
You used vegetable broth?
That's important.

1041
00:46:11,282 --> 00:46:12,550
I've already learned from you.

1042
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:15,320
Pour the sauce so that
it runs down the side.

1043
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,354
(A spicy sauce
sure to hit the spot for K-dads.)

1044
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:19,257
Are you done? What a success.

1045
00:46:19,557 --> 00:46:20,757
This is incredible.

1046
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:21,259
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe
Caponata Cold Noodles)

1047
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,193
I think it'll be delicious...

1048
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:27,230
because there's caponata, gochujang,
and various veggies.

1049
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:28,999
I think they will go well with each other.

1050
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,335
(Caponata Cold Noodles / 1. Prep veggies,
cook for 25 mins. 2. Mix agrodolce sauce.)

1051
00:46:30,335 --> 00:46:31,671
(3. Pour the sauce onto the cooked vegs,
cook 5 more mins in the oven.)

1052
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:32,337
(4. Make the sauce for the noodle.)

1053
00:46:32,637 --> 00:46:34,539
I really want to hit exactly 300 grams.

1054
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:38,409
(He's measuring again?)

1055
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:41,446
(Today, he'll use meat.)

1056
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:46,616
When I had some meatballs
and sun-dried tomatoes together,

1057
00:46:46,617 --> 00:46:48,786
As soon as I tasted it, it was incredible.

1058
00:46:51,723 --> 00:46:53,191
This combination...

1059
00:46:53,758 --> 00:46:55,360
This combination is so lovely to me.

1060
00:46:56,194 --> 00:46:57,728
First, meatball...

1061
00:46:57,729 --> 00:46:59,496
Or maybe meat tangsu?

1062
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:02,733
I could make the sauce thicker
and add a bit of sweetness.

1063
00:47:02,734 --> 00:47:03,935
I think it'll be a tangsuyuk sauce then.

1064
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,970
- With starch water?
- Yeah, a small amount.

1065
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:09,673
(With Kihyun's special kick)

1066
00:47:09,674 --> 00:47:11,776
(Perfect for Korean taste buds)

1067
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:17,081
(Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
Meat Tangsu)

1068
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:20,084
(Prepare 300g of meat.)

1069
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:25,089
Measuring is a piece of cake now.

1070
00:47:25,523 --> 00:47:29,694
(Reviewing the recipe
while whisking the eggs)

1071
00:47:31,696 --> 00:47:34,565
(1 egg)

1072
00:47:34,966 --> 00:47:37,368
(3 pinches of salt, 10 whirls of pepper)

1073
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:39,170
(Parmesan cheese)

1074
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:40,838
(A reason for adding Parmesan)

1075
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:43,918
(Adds umami and saltiness to the meat,
enhancing the flavor of the meatballs.)

1076
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:48,946
(And here comes Kihyun's kick.)

1077
00:47:50,348 --> 00:47:52,149
(Catania's specialty, nuts)

1078
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,585
These pine nuts are good too.
Gapyeong pine nuts should watch out.

1079
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:55,886
They have pine nuts?

1080
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:57,207
(Came across pine nuts in Europe)

1081
00:47:57,555 --> 00:48:01,793
(They're small, nutty, and rich,
perfect for pesto and desserts.)

1082
00:48:03,294 --> 00:48:05,963
When I tried the pine nuts,
they were pretty good,

1083
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:07,404
so I wanted to try using nuts again.

1084
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:10,600
(He used pistachios
on their first day in Sicily.)

1085
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:11,935
It smells so nutty.

1086
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:13,504
That particular pistachio aroma.

1087
00:48:14,372 --> 00:48:18,076
(For this nut lover,
it's pine nut today.)

1088
00:48:18,242 --> 00:48:19,743
It sounds like a motorcycle.

1089
00:48:19,744 --> 00:48:20,812
Right?

1090
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,582
(The mixer-cycle is getting ready.)

1091
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:29,087
(Racing instincts)

1092
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,522
(What's this noise?)

1093
00:48:33,992 --> 00:48:35,626
What's happening right now?

1094
00:48:35,627 --> 00:48:37,195
(Hops on naturally)

1095
00:48:38,296 --> 00:48:40,164
(The age when motorcycles
are just irresistible.)

1096
00:48:40,164 --> 00:48:41,633
Stop it now.

1097
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:45,102
I couldn't pass the sound.

1098
00:48:45,103 --> 00:48:46,604
How can you say no to a motorcycle?

1099
00:48:47,972 --> 00:48:49,706
(Add the pine nuts to the meat.)

1100
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:50,975
That looks good.

1101
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:52,476
Gosh, he smell.

1102
00:48:52,477 --> 00:48:53,211
(Finely ground pine nuts
fill the air with their nutty aroma.)

1103
00:48:53,212 --> 00:48:54,679
Smells so nutty.

1104
00:48:57,115 --> 00:49:00,417
The white and red onion
taste similar, right?

1105
00:49:00,418 --> 00:49:01,885
Yeah, there's not a huge difference.

1106
00:49:01,886 --> 00:49:03,221
You can just use whatever color you want.

1107
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:04,756
The red onion
tends to be less spicy though.

1108
00:49:04,756 --> 00:49:06,676
(White onion is spicier.
Red onion is sweeter.)

1109
00:49:10,094 --> 00:49:14,065
(Finely chop the less spicy red onion.)

1110
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:22,907
(His eyes are starting to water.)

1111
00:49:23,508 --> 00:49:24,808
My eyes are watering like crazy.

1112
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:25,809
From the spiciness?

1113
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,577
My eyes...

1114
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:28,980
(I thought red onions were less spicy...)

1115
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,347
What's spicy?

1116
00:49:30,348 --> 00:49:32,282
The onions are fresh, so...

1117
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:34,017
Have a piece of onion in your mouth.

1118
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:35,485
That works.

1119
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:36,955
That actually works?

1120
00:49:38,723 --> 00:49:40,892
But I think that's like
fighting heat with more heat.

1121
00:49:42,427 --> 00:49:46,230
(Red onions,
chopped at the cost of a few tears.)

1122
00:49:47,098 --> 00:49:49,734
(Self-praise)

1123
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:54,405
(Add the onions to the mixture
and knead well.)

1124
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:57,441
Su Young, do I need to add sugar
to the minced meat?

1125
00:49:57,442 --> 00:49:59,376
No, don't. It'll taste bad.

1126
00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:01,111
What about vinegar?

1127
00:50:01,112 --> 00:50:02,312
- No need.
- No need?

1128
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:04,048
For meat, just cooking it by itself
will taste the best.

1129
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:05,568
If you really want to add something...

1130
00:50:07,218 --> 00:50:08,720
Let me smell the meat.

1131
00:50:09,153 --> 00:50:10,321
Let's smell this one.

1132
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:12,223
The meat is super fresh. You're good.

1133
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,858
Onions? Oh...

1134
00:50:14,626 --> 00:50:16,628
You shouldn't add raw onions.

1135
00:50:17,295 --> 00:50:19,130
It'll create moisture,
and it won't taste good.

1136
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,163
Oh no.

1137
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:21,933
If you want to add onion
to meatballs like this,

1138
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:23,635
you need to cook it first
so that it tastes better.

1139
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:27,137
You can still do it, but the onions
might end up undercooked.

1140
00:50:27,138 --> 00:50:27,905
Should I take out the onions?

1141
00:50:27,906 --> 00:50:30,474
Using raw onion for this is a bad idea.

1142
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:32,610
If you want to use it,
you should cook it first.

1143
00:50:34,112 --> 00:50:36,446
I still have some time,
so I'll try to take them out.

1144
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:37,548
Yeah, take them out.

1145
00:50:37,649 --> 00:50:39,650
Thankfully, I didn't add too much.

1146
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:40,885
I can take them out quickly.

1147
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:42,654
(Another day, another battle with myself.)

1148
00:50:42,654 --> 00:50:44,088
Picking out onions.

1149
00:50:45,056 --> 00:50:47,759
(Picking out the pieces of onions)

1150
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:51,229
(No matter what anyone else is doing,
he's focused on onions.)

1151
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:53,431
Gosh, why are there so many?

1152
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:59,971
(The artisan awakens)

1153
00:51:01,706 --> 00:51:03,808
(So does the sighing)

1154
00:51:04,242 --> 00:51:07,845
(Never-ending onions)

1155
00:51:08,313 --> 00:51:11,449
(Finished picking out the onions)

1156
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,385
I won't cook with onions tomorrow.

1157
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:16,788
Kyung Ho, do you want to see this?

1158
00:51:17,322 --> 00:51:19,156
- What is that?
- I took out all the onions.

1159
00:51:19,157 --> 00:51:20,991
(Showing everyone the onions he took out)

1160
00:51:20,992 --> 00:51:24,161
I don't need onions though.

1161
00:51:24,162 --> 00:51:25,562
(Kihyun's blood, sweat, and onions)

1162
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:30,969
(Gently shape the meatballs.)

1163
00:51:31,936 --> 00:51:34,906
(Neatly shaped with love.)

1164
00:51:35,206 --> 00:51:37,875
(He's doing
a lot of repetitive work today.)

1165
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:41,079
(Perfect little rounds of meatballs)

1166
00:51:43,681 --> 00:51:45,016
(Cook the meatballs
in a heated pan with olive oil.)

1167
00:51:45,016 --> 00:51:47,217
So you're not deep frying it.

1168
00:51:47,218 --> 00:51:50,455
It looks like you're pan-frying.

1169
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:52,690
(The key is to pan-cook gently,
not deep-fry.)

1170
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,191
That looks good.

1171
00:51:54,192 --> 00:51:55,727
(The key is to pan-cook gently,
not deep-fry.)

1172
00:51:55,727 --> 00:51:58,229
I'm a bit afraid that the inside...

1173
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,131
- won't get fully cooked.
- Right.

1174
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:03,767
- You want it to cook all the way?
- Yeah.

1175
00:52:03,768 --> 00:52:05,737
Should I taste if it's been cooked?

1176
00:52:06,371 --> 00:52:08,406
- Do you want to?
- I'll be the tasting person.

1177
00:52:08,706 --> 00:52:10,140
Then one second.

1178
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:11,208
Should I cut it open?

1179
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:12,376
Let's let it rest a bit.

1180
00:52:12,377 --> 00:52:13,377
Okay.

1181
00:52:13,378 --> 00:52:14,444
It needs to rest a little.

1182
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:16,246
Do you need the needles?

1183
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:17,914
To see if it's been cooked?

1184
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,850
- I'll try it and keep a straight face.
- Me too.

1185
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:21,586
No, tell me what you think.

1186
00:52:22,253 --> 00:52:23,253
Is it beef?

1187
00:52:23,254 --> 00:52:24,421
It smells good.

1188
00:52:24,422 --> 00:52:27,158
It's definitely at its tastiest right now.

1189
00:52:27,759 --> 00:52:29,126
It's beef anyway.

1190
00:52:29,127 --> 00:52:30,595
(Crazy)

1191
00:52:32,697 --> 00:52:34,097
- It's good?
- Yeah.

1192
00:52:34,098 --> 00:52:36,900
(You're done, Kihyun.)

1193
00:52:36,901 --> 00:52:38,101
(Satisfied)

1194
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:40,370
There's no seasoning,
but it's good.

1195
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:42,307
- There's no seasoning?
- There is though.

1196
00:52:43,241 --> 00:52:45,275
It hasn't reached
the proper seasoning yet.

1197
00:52:45,276 --> 00:52:47,436
The meatballs haven't reached
the proper seasoning yet.

1198
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:49,881
(A bit embarrassed by what he said)

1199
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:51,215
Proper.

1200
00:52:51,749 --> 00:52:53,016
You heard him, right?

1201
00:52:53,017 --> 00:52:54,752
He said it hasn't reached
the proper seasoning yet.

1202
00:52:54,752 --> 00:52:57,321
It hasn't reached
the proper seasoning yet.

1203
00:52:57,322 --> 00:52:59,189
Please work hard
to reach the proper seasoning.

1204
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,325
Yes, sir.

1205
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:02,711
How much longer until it reaches
the proper seasoning?

1206
00:53:02,727 --> 00:53:05,263
The proper seasoning
will coming with the sauce, so...

1207
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:09,132
(Attention now!)

1208
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:12,704
(Kihyun's special sauce
using the agrodolce sauce)

1209
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:14,216
(Kihyun's Special Sauce)

1210
00:53:14,217 --> 00:53:16,541
(1. Caramelize the onions
in the leftover oil from the meatballs.)

1211
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:20,911
I'm going to cook the onions
until they become transparent.

1212
00:53:20,912 --> 00:53:23,046
(It's done when the onions
turn golden brown.)

1213
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:25,984
To this, 6T of sugar,
4T of white wine vinegar.

1214
00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:28,919
(The kick for Kihyun's special sauce)

1215
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,455
And to this, soy sauce.

1216
00:53:31,456 --> 00:53:35,793
(The agrodolce sauce used water,
but Kihyun is using soy sauce.)

1217
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,796
(Once the sauce starts to simmer...)

1218
00:53:39,163 --> 00:53:43,067
(Add 1T of starch water for texture.)

1219
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:47,939
(Kihyun's simple
but special sauce is done.)

1220
00:53:51,643 --> 00:53:56,014
(Coat the meatballs in the special sauce.)

1221
00:53:56,414 --> 00:53:58,615
Kihyun, it smells good.

1222
00:53:58,616 --> 00:54:00,585
Doesn't it smell like donggeurangttaeng
(meat patty)?

1223
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:03,053
No, it smells for beefy.

1224
00:54:03,054 --> 00:54:04,055
It does?

1225
00:54:04,455 --> 00:54:08,126
(Tasting it to reach the proper seasoning)

1226
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:14,565
(What is this?)

1227
00:54:16,601 --> 00:54:18,670
(What is he looking for?)

1228
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,941
(Bread?)

1229
00:54:24,842 --> 00:54:28,713
(Blending it in the mixer)

1230
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,749
(What is he doing?)

1231
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,051
What? What are you frying?

1232
00:54:34,052 --> 00:54:36,320
(He's frying the breadcrumbs
he just blended?)

1233
00:54:36,321 --> 00:54:39,623
The seasoning is too strong
to have the meatballs by itself,

1234
00:54:39,624 --> 00:54:43,293
so I'm going to add this to mellow it out
and to some crunchy texture.

1235
00:54:43,294 --> 00:54:45,630
For a crunchy texture? Good idea.

1236
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:48,265
From what I've seen,
Kihyun reacts really fast.

1237
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:51,668
If something doesn't work,
he changes it right away.

1238
00:54:51,669 --> 00:54:52,904
Good job.

1239
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:55,406
The smell is insane right now.

1240
00:54:56,074 --> 00:54:57,241
This is an ultimate dish.

1241
00:54:58,876 --> 00:55:00,978
Try smelling it. It's insane.

1242
00:55:00,979 --> 00:55:02,379
I really want to try one right now.

1243
00:55:04,949 --> 00:55:06,250
You've done it.

1244
00:55:08,987 --> 00:55:12,489
(Suddenly charges at the camera)

1245
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,759
(Here's my dish.)

1246
00:55:16,194 --> 00:55:19,463
(The cameraman was caught off guard, too)

1247
00:55:19,464 --> 00:55:22,265
Nice. A self-produced close-up.

1248
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:24,035
(Fully self-directed)

1249
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:28,106
(Kihyun has turned meatballs
into Meat Tangsu.)

1250
00:55:28,339 --> 00:55:31,809
(A perfect combination
with crispy breadcrumbs)

1251
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,947
(Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
Meat Tangsu)

1252
00:55:36,147 --> 00:55:36,723
(Meat Tangsu)

1253
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:38,449
(1. Mix and fry 300g meat, 1T garlic, egg,
3g salt, pepper, Parmesan, pine nuts.)

1254
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:39,037
(2. Cook onions
in the left over oil from the meat.)

1255
00:55:39,038 --> 00:55:40,051
(Mix 6T sugar, 4T white wine vinegar,
2T soy sauce, 1T starch water for sauce.)

1256
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:42,371
(3. Coat the meatballs in the sauce,
sprinkle breadcrumbs.)

1257
00:55:42,654 --> 00:55:45,389
(Now, here comes
Su Young's final Ryu-cipe.)

1258
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,492
(What is he doing?)

1259
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:52,563
(He was pounding meat?)

1260
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:56,668
(Two hours earlier,
at a local grocery store)

1261
00:55:57,502 --> 00:56:01,072
(Ryu-GPT scanned every aisle.)

1262
00:56:02,006 --> 00:56:05,677
You need at least this much fat
for it to taste good.

1263
00:56:06,678 --> 00:56:07,812
Nice.

1264
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:11,249
(Scanning the grocery store again)

1265
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:17,355
I found breadcrumbs, so if I have this,

1266
00:56:17,689 --> 00:56:18,890
should I fry it?

1267
00:56:20,024 --> 00:56:22,927
(Will he be frying some meat
for this Ryu-cipe dish?)

1268
00:56:23,628 --> 00:56:27,765
(Deep fry it
for a crunchy donkatsu (pork cutlet).)

1269
00:56:27,865 --> 00:56:29,399
Is it donkatsu?

1270
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,667
It's similar.

1271
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:33,537
I'm thinking of using donkatsu...

1272
00:56:33,538 --> 00:56:35,606
to make something like a cordon bleu.

1273
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:38,842
(Cordon bleu / Thin slices of meat
rolled with ham and cheese...)

1274
00:56:38,843 --> 00:56:40,712
(Then breaded and fried or baked)

1275
00:56:41,145 --> 00:56:45,450
(It's filled with ham and cheese.)

1276
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:48,553
(Then what will Su Young choose
as his fillings?)

1277
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,856
(Su Young's kick is provolone.)

1278
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,493
(A classic Italian cheese, provolone.)

1279
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,331
(Known for its uniquely chewy
and creamy flavor)

1280
00:57:00,531 --> 00:57:05,136
(He will just use provolone
without the ham.)

1281
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,270
When we were at the grocery store earlier,

1282
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:09,239
I noticed how important cheese is
to this culture.

1283
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,574
Totally.

1284
00:57:10,575 --> 00:57:13,377
The cheese section
was as big as the meat section.

1285
00:57:13,378 --> 00:57:15,312
- It was the same size.
- Exactly.

1286
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:16,914
Just as big as the meat section.

1287
00:57:17,515 --> 00:57:20,218
It'll be like donkatsu
with a cheese filling.

1288
00:57:21,252 --> 00:57:22,886
Just cheese? No meat?

1289
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:24,454
There's meat.

1290
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:27,358
It'll taste a bit foreign,
but I think it'll be pretty good.

1291
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:29,560
Amazing.

1292
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:33,731
This is why everyone
talks about Mr. Eo Nam Seon.

1293
00:57:34,098 --> 00:57:38,135
(Dip in egg yolk
and coat with breadcrumbs.)

1294
00:57:38,136 --> 00:57:40,203
- You know what?
- What?

1295
00:57:40,204 --> 00:57:42,172
When we're just hanging out
during the day,

1296
00:57:42,173 --> 00:57:45,275
we're just friends,
but once we start cooking,

1297
00:57:45,276 --> 00:57:47,377
- I become instinctively more respectful.
- You do.

1298
00:57:47,378 --> 00:57:48,880
You're so annoying during the day.

1299
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:51,549
Could be a bit nicer during the day too?

1300
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:52,582
- During the day?
- Yeah.

1301
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:54,051
But we're all friends.

1302
00:57:54,052 --> 00:57:55,119
Right.

1303
00:57:56,254 --> 00:57:59,791
(One of the friends
starts frying the cheese donkatsu.)

1304
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:05,595
(Turning golden brown and crunchy)

1305
00:58:05,596 --> 00:58:07,065
It smells so good.

1306
00:58:08,466 --> 00:58:09,634
What is this?

1307
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:11,402
We definitely need rice today.

1308
00:58:11,703 --> 00:58:12,937
So pretty.

1309
00:58:14,172 --> 00:58:15,273
(Impressed by how they look)

1310
00:58:15,273 --> 00:58:16,707
You're on another level.

1311
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:17,842
No, I'm not.

1312
00:58:18,343 --> 00:58:23,214
(Crunch cheese donkatsu is done.)

1313
00:58:23,815 --> 00:58:26,850
(He places the cheese donkatsu
on the bread.)

1314
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:28,186
(Then, tops it with rich caponata)

1315
00:58:28,186 --> 00:58:29,920
- That's art.
- Stop it.

1316
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:32,589
Today feels less like actual cooking...

1317
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:37,328
and more like reviewing
and exploring new ingredients.

1318
00:58:38,596 --> 00:58:42,600
(Juicy meat and rich cheese
packed into every bite)

1319
00:58:43,334 --> 00:58:46,604
(A sweet and tangy caponata,
cooked in one pan and used as a sauce)

1320
00:58:47,205 --> 00:58:50,775
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
Caponata Cheese Donkatsu)

1321
00:58:51,175 --> 00:58:56,114
(Ryu-cipes completed
for Day 2 in Sicily.)

1322
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,982
(It's time to taste test.)

1323
00:58:58,983 --> 00:59:00,084
It smells delicious.

1324
00:59:00,451 --> 00:59:01,452
(Warming up before tasting)

1325
00:59:01,452 --> 00:59:02,452
What should we try first?

1326
00:59:02,453 --> 00:59:03,621
Don't you want to try this first?

1327
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:05,456
My mouth is watering.

1328
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,924
- I'm so curious.
- It looks good.

1329
00:59:07,925 --> 00:59:08,926
(Kyung Ho's Caponata Cold Noodles)

1330
00:59:08,926 --> 00:59:09,960
I'm salivating.

1331
00:59:09,961 --> 00:59:11,662
I feel the tingle right here.

1332
00:59:11,663 --> 00:59:13,703
I haven't seen a red-colored noodle dish
in so long.

1333
00:59:14,365 --> 00:59:17,602
(A bold red hue and K-spicy sauce
that makes your mouth water)

1334
00:59:18,236 --> 00:59:21,706
(It definitely looks like cold noodles.)

1335
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:23,374
Smells good.

1336
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:35,586
(He smiles as soon as he takes a bite.)

1337
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,354
(How is it?)

1338
00:59:37,355 --> 00:59:38,589
(Tell me.)

1339
00:59:39,857 --> 00:59:41,291
Hey,

1340
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:42,694
why is this so good?

1341
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:44,696
It's really good.

1342
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:51,234
- It's pretty good.
- It's delicious.

1343
00:59:51,235 --> 00:59:53,003
It's extremely delicious.

1344
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:54,005
Why is it so good?

1345
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:56,808
- Right?
- It's very delicious.

1346
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:59,376
I can't pin point why.

1347
00:59:59,377 --> 01:00:00,544
Why is this so good?

1348
01:00:00,545 --> 01:00:03,881
I think the noodles
are one of the reasons, and...

1349
01:00:04,282 --> 01:00:07,251
(Used capellini that's similar
to Korean noodles, somyeon)

1350
01:00:07,986 --> 01:00:11,623
(A familiar texture
makes it easier to enjoy.)

1351
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:13,991
I wanted to mix
the sweet and tangy flavors...

1352
01:00:13,992 --> 01:00:16,426
of the caponata with the spiciness
from a bibim-myeon...

1353
01:00:16,427 --> 01:00:18,261
and have it together with noodles.

1354
01:00:18,262 --> 01:00:19,363
I think it's perfect.

1355
01:00:19,364 --> 01:00:21,366
You got plenty of vegetable broth.

1356
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,267
(How does
caponata's vegetable broth taste?)

1357
01:00:24,268 --> 01:00:26,337
Hey, try the broth.

1358
01:00:27,672 --> 01:00:30,041
Nice and refreshing, right?
I used vegetable broth.

1359
01:00:30,508 --> 01:00:32,042
I used caponata broth.

1360
01:00:32,043 --> 01:00:33,244
The depth of flavor is amazing.

1361
01:00:33,244 --> 01:00:35,612
You got broth from all the vegetables.

1362
01:00:35,613 --> 01:00:38,248
You gave the vegetables time
to release its broth.

1363
01:00:38,249 --> 01:00:40,651
By using the oven
the broth slowly released...

1364
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:42,953
and got mixed with oil,

1365
01:00:42,954 --> 01:00:45,055
then that got mixed
with sugar and vinegar.

1366
01:00:45,056 --> 01:00:47,325
- It's like natural MSG.
- Exactly.

1367
01:00:47,692 --> 01:00:50,027
It's also kind of like
kimchi guksu (noodles).

1368
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:51,328
It has that feel.

1369
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:54,765
But kimchi guksu
tastes clean at the end, right?

1370
01:00:54,766 --> 01:00:57,534
But this has...

1371
01:00:57,535 --> 01:01:00,237
- It tastes like meat broth.
- Yeah, it has that...

1372
01:01:00,238 --> 01:01:01,906
It tastes like meat broth
even though I didn't use any meat.

1373
01:01:01,906 --> 01:01:04,308
The vegetable broth is super concentrated.

1374
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:06,810
There's this lingering flavor
that spreads at the end.

1375
01:01:06,811 --> 01:01:07,812
It tastes dynamic.

1376
01:01:08,212 --> 01:01:13,885
(A cool and spicy Caponata Cold Noodles,
made to hit the spot for K-dads.)

1377
01:01:14,085 --> 01:01:15,085
Let's try Kihyun's dish.

1378
01:01:15,086 --> 01:01:19,057
It tasted like tteokgalbi (rib patty)
earlier because of the soy sauce.

1379
01:01:19,624 --> 01:01:21,826
(Meatballs that tastes like tteokgalbi.)

1380
01:01:22,393 --> 01:01:27,799
(A sweet-savory kick from soy sauce,
plus a crispy bite from breadcrumbs)

1381
01:01:28,232 --> 01:01:32,337
(Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
Meat Tangsu)

1382
01:01:34,405 --> 01:01:38,176
(Big eater mode in sync)

1383
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,944
(It's a fork drop again.)

1384
01:01:40,945 --> 01:01:42,213
Why is everyone so good?

1385
01:01:42,747 --> 01:01:45,949
(Feeling confident after their reactions)

1386
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,185
Hey, seriously...

1387
01:01:47,285 --> 01:01:48,586
How is everyone so good?

1388
01:01:50,021 --> 01:01:51,155
You've gotten so much better.

1389
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:53,023
This is so good.

1390
01:01:53,024 --> 01:01:55,893
- This would be perfect for kids.
- This is really good.

1391
01:01:56,327 --> 01:01:58,161
I wasn't trying
to make tteokgalbi, but...

1392
01:01:58,162 --> 01:01:59,163
- Why did it become a tteokgalbi?
- It's delicious.

1393
01:01:59,163 --> 01:02:00,765
Both the sweetness
and the seasoning are perfect.

1394
01:02:00,765 --> 01:02:02,500
(Seasoned with soy sauce,
giving it that classic tteokgalbi flavor)

1395
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,934
What did you coat this with?

1396
01:02:03,935 --> 01:02:05,302
I used slices of bread,

1397
01:02:05,303 --> 01:02:09,340
and fried it in the tiniest bit of oil
to get the crunch.

1398
01:02:09,674 --> 01:02:12,310
I want to try this combo.

1399
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:14,845
This is how you should eat it.

1400
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:16,179
This is the insane combo.

1401
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,482
This tastes like tteokgalbi, right?

1402
01:02:17,482 --> 01:02:19,416
And this is bibim myeon.

1403
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:20,418
Hey, this is it.

1404
01:02:25,189 --> 01:02:28,426
(Makes you dance as soon as you taste it?)

1405
01:02:28,793 --> 01:02:32,597
(Copies Su Young's combination)

1406
01:02:33,164 --> 01:02:34,632
- It's so good, right?
- It's so good.

1407
01:02:34,632 --> 01:02:37,435
It's really good.
It's done.

1408
01:02:38,169 --> 01:02:39,671
Does someone want to try it?

1409
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,609
(Delivery)

1410
01:02:44,942 --> 01:02:46,311
Yum.

1411
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:48,179
That's all I need.

1412
01:02:48,613 --> 01:02:50,615
(Very satisfied)

1413
01:02:51,149 --> 01:02:52,583
That reaction is all I need.

1414
01:02:53,151 --> 01:02:56,387
(She also tries
the noodles and meatball combo.)

1415
01:02:58,456 --> 01:02:59,556
Super delicious, right?

1416
01:02:59,557 --> 01:03:00,857
- Yum.
- Yeah, it's good.

1417
01:03:00,858 --> 01:03:02,225
(Proud)

1418
01:03:02,226 --> 01:03:04,228
It tastes like a grandma
who used to make caponata...

1419
01:03:04,228 --> 01:03:07,031
went to work at a mil myeon place
in Busan then became the boss.

1420
01:03:07,632 --> 01:03:09,232
It's really delicious.

1421
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:10,233
(Totally agrees)

1422
01:03:10,435 --> 01:03:14,771
(Kyung Ho's Caponata Cold Noodles
with Kihyun's Meat Tangsu)

1423
01:03:14,772 --> 01:03:16,273
Now, for today's highlight.

1424
01:03:16,274 --> 01:03:17,475
No, it's not.

1425
01:03:18,209 --> 01:03:22,113
(A combination of sweet and tangy caponata
with cheese donkatsu)

1426
01:03:23,014 --> 01:03:26,294
(A rich flavor from the meat and cheese,
then a refreshing punch from the caponata)

1427
01:03:27,685 --> 01:03:31,322
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
Caponata Cheese Donkatsu)

1428
01:03:31,823 --> 01:03:33,625
Look at the cheese oozing out.

1429
01:03:34,726 --> 01:03:37,729
(Cheese oozing out
in all its shimmering glory)

1430
01:03:38,029 --> 01:03:41,032
(It's mesmerizing.)

1431
01:03:41,132 --> 01:03:43,667
(It makes your mouth water
just by looking at it.)

1432
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:44,769
This looks good.

1433
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,315
Our dishes...

1434
01:03:58,316 --> 01:04:00,617
The taste was very...

1435
01:04:00,618 --> 01:04:01,752
PG, you know?

1436
01:04:01,753 --> 01:04:02,953
What?

1437
01:04:02,954 --> 01:04:04,888
But this is Rated R.

1438
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:06,857
(Tastes like Rated-R?)

1439
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:07,924
It's an R-Rated movie.

1440
01:04:07,925 --> 01:04:09,626
- It's R-Rated?
- Yeah.

1441
01:04:09,627 --> 01:04:11,161
No, it's not that extreme.

1442
01:04:11,162 --> 01:04:12,562
(Laughing out loud)

1443
01:04:12,563 --> 01:04:13,597
The taste is...

1444
01:04:13,598 --> 01:04:15,198
You know what I mean, right?

1445
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:17,668
Of course I do.

1446
01:04:17,669 --> 01:04:20,638
The moment you started
to compare our dishes...

1447
01:04:21,272 --> 01:04:25,176
I mean, there's no such thing
as losing against this dish.

1448
01:04:25,943 --> 01:04:27,477
I apologize.

1449
01:04:27,478 --> 01:04:29,112
(Suddenly feels like a confession booth)

1450
01:04:29,113 --> 01:04:30,281
I'm so embarrassed.

1451
01:04:30,748 --> 01:04:32,050
What do we do, Kyung Ho?

1452
01:04:32,884 --> 01:04:34,285
What do you mean?

1453
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:36,354
We should just enjoy this and stay quiet.

1454
01:04:37,655 --> 01:04:38,922
No, your dishes were good.

1455
01:04:38,923 --> 01:04:40,324
These were really delicious.

1456
01:04:40,325 --> 01:04:41,692
No, yours were more direct.

1457
01:04:41,693 --> 01:04:46,697
I think caponata
pairs well with meat and bread.

1458
01:04:46,698 --> 01:04:51,902
But he paired it well
with donkatsu, you know?

1459
01:04:51,903 --> 01:04:54,638
Plus, these juicy vegetables
act like the sauce.

1460
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:56,239
These are like the donkatsu sauce.

1461
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,910
There's no juice on the plate,
but we taste everything.

1462
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:02,046
It's very interesting, and it's delicious.

1463
01:05:02,747 --> 01:05:04,948
Caponata is an amazing dish.

1464
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:08,385
Since the sauce
has white wine vinegar in it,

1465
01:05:08,386 --> 01:05:11,021
it taste familiar to us too.
It's a familiar taste for us.

1466
01:05:11,022 --> 01:05:12,223
It's delicious.

1467
01:05:18,296 --> 01:05:21,432
(He's gone another culinary journey.)

1468
01:05:23,067 --> 01:05:25,903
Is that zucchini blossom?

1469
01:05:26,504 --> 01:05:28,872
This is good, right? The yellow part?

1470
01:05:28,873 --> 01:05:30,541
(Zucchini blossom?)

1471
01:05:31,242 --> 01:05:32,276
What's that?

1472
01:05:37,148 --> 01:05:38,316
Zucchini blossom.

1473
01:05:43,988 --> 01:05:47,358
(Zucchini blossoms are a popular
summer ingredient in Italy.)

1474
01:05:48,092 --> 01:05:49,460
I heard they eat this a lot in Italy.

1475
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,895
When we go to fine-dining places in Korea,

1476
01:05:51,896 --> 01:05:53,630
they use this too.

1477
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:55,833
I've always wanted to try frying it.

1478
01:05:56,467 --> 01:05:59,504
(Just used frying powder)

1479
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:00,838
(Fried zucchini blossoms for the summer)

1480
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:03,740
This is like art, Su Young.

1481
01:06:03,741 --> 01:06:05,009
Oh, stop it.

1482
01:06:06,077 --> 01:06:09,480
(A zucchini blossom has bloomed
on top of the cheese donkatsu.)

1483
01:06:09,747 --> 01:06:11,415
This is good, right? The yellow part?

1484
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:12,549
It's really good together.

1485
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,117
Yeah? Why don't I get one?

1486
01:06:14,118 --> 01:06:15,986
Here. Have a bite of this.

1487
01:06:15,987 --> 01:06:17,055
I should've had it together.

1488
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:19,223
- It's so good together.
- It pairs well.

1489
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:22,260
(This is it.)

1490
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,761
It's like baechu jeon
(napa cabbage pancake).

1491
01:06:23,761 --> 01:06:26,730
It is, but better.

1492
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:28,465
It pairs really well.

1493
01:06:28,466 --> 01:06:29,466
You're right.

1494
01:06:29,467 --> 01:06:31,101
When you chew it until the end,

1495
01:06:31,102 --> 01:06:32,670
it's so delicious together.

1496
01:06:33,504 --> 01:06:36,239
So we're getting
four different tastes at once.

1497
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,610
If we have it separately,
it's donkatsu and caponata,

1498
01:06:40,611 --> 01:06:43,246
but together, it goes so well together.

1499
01:06:43,247 --> 01:06:44,614
It's cuts through the oiliness.

1500
01:06:44,615 --> 01:06:45,916
It's an amazing dish.

1501
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:47,985
It's a luxurious dish.

1502
01:06:47,986 --> 01:06:49,987
- Do you know what's funny?
- What?

1503
01:06:49,988 --> 01:06:51,922
When I first started this,

1504
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:55,258
I wanted to make dishes for my kids.

1505
01:06:55,259 --> 01:06:57,928
But I'm just making what I want to eat.

1506
01:06:57,929 --> 01:07:03,334
And your dishes are what I want to make
for my kids.

1507
01:07:04,369 --> 01:07:06,804
Mine's too spicy for the kids.

1508
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:09,373
It's weird.

1509
01:07:09,374 --> 01:07:11,342
It's for yourself,
who's been working hard.

1510
01:07:11,509 --> 01:07:14,611
I'm gaining weight,
but I know my mind is getting fuller.

1511
01:07:14,612 --> 01:07:16,480
That's a great way to put it.

1512
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:18,182
- We've actually gained a bit of weight.
- Yes.

1513
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:19,684
We're always cooking and eating at night.

1514
01:07:19,684 --> 01:07:21,385
- I feel heavy.
- Yeah.

1515
01:07:21,386 --> 01:07:22,486
Eat, learn,

1516
01:07:22,487 --> 01:07:24,388
- Gain weight.
- gain weight.

1517
01:07:24,389 --> 01:07:26,624
- It's complete because we've gained.
- Time for digestion pills.

1518
01:07:26,624 --> 01:07:27,992
I feel like I'll become this big
if we continue.

1519
01:07:27,992 --> 01:07:29,027
(A study abroad life
as joyful as the weight we've gained)

1520
01:07:29,027 --> 01:07:30,193
Eat, learn...

1521
01:07:30,194 --> 01:07:32,196
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1522
01:07:32,363 --> 01:07:35,266
(Even the wright gain feels worth it
for this second-day Ryu-cipe night.)

1523
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,267
Have a lot of this with it.

1524
01:07:37,268 --> 01:07:39,770
With lots of vegetables.

1525
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:42,506
- It's so tasty.
- Right? It's not bad at all.

1526
01:07:42,507 --> 01:07:44,107
(Everyone's loving the Ryu-cipe dishes.)

1527
01:07:44,442 --> 01:07:46,176
Is it good?

1528
01:07:46,177 --> 01:07:47,210
I'm glad.

1529
01:07:47,211 --> 01:07:48,545
It's so savory and nutty.

1530
01:07:48,546 --> 01:07:50,581
- So good.
- It's so good, right?

1531
01:07:51,115 --> 01:07:53,985
The volcano erupted.

1532
01:07:54,485 --> 01:07:57,722
(100% Real situation)

1533
01:07:58,022 --> 01:07:59,256
You can see it well from here.

1534
01:07:59,257 --> 01:08:01,292
- You see it?
- I do.

1535
01:08:02,794 --> 01:08:04,728
Could I get the footage from the heli-cam?

1536
01:08:04,729 --> 01:08:10,001
(Everyone's confused from the news
of the eruption.)

1537
01:08:10,401 --> 01:08:12,670
That's what it looks like, huh?

1538
01:08:12,937 --> 01:08:14,539
Did it actually erupt?

1539
01:08:16,474 --> 01:08:17,674
It's a bit scary.

1540
01:08:17,675 --> 01:08:19,210
Yeah, it is.

1541
01:08:22,246 --> 01:08:28,052
(Cannot believe it
even when seeing it with their eyes.)

1542
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:31,455
(Mount Etna was so peaceful this morning.)

1543
01:08:31,456 --> 01:08:33,690
Is that okay, though?

1544
01:08:33,691 --> 01:08:35,258
That's an erupting volcano.

1545
01:08:35,259 --> 01:08:36,728
I can't believe we can see it from here.

1546
01:08:36,728 --> 01:08:38,896
(It erupted in just half a day,
spewing lava into the sky.)

1547
01:08:38,896 --> 01:08:40,464
I've never seen anything like it.

1548
01:08:40,465 --> 01:08:41,866
(The trio shared
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.)

1549
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:42,866
Hey, that's a volcano.

1550
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:44,168
This is my first time seeing it.

1551
01:08:46,871 --> 01:08:50,274
(Next week, something more fiery
than the volcano is coming!)

1552
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,744
(The ultimate Sicilian pasta dish)

1553
01:08:53,611 --> 01:08:57,582
(They go meet the 50-year pasta master.)

1554
01:09:00,418 --> 01:09:01,753
(You can taste injeolmi
from their traditional pasta dish?)

1555
01:09:01,753 --> 01:09:02,820
(You can taste chueotang
from their traditional pasta dish?)

1556
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:04,122
(You can taste kaljebi
from their traditional pasta dish?)

1557
01:09:04,122 --> 01:09:05,656
(Korean flavors in Sicily)

1558
01:09:05,657 --> 01:09:08,826
It'd be really fun to have them try
every Ryu-cipe dish we've made so far.

1559
01:09:09,594 --> 01:09:13,130
(They run around town
for the best Ryu-cipe dishes.)

1560
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:14,965
Should I roll some kimchi or something?

1561
01:09:14,966 --> 01:09:18,936
(A next-level recipe
packed with the essence of Sicily)

1562
01:09:19,671 --> 01:09:23,574
(The ultimate K-food,
Sicily and Korea have met.)

1563
01:09:24,175 --> 01:09:26,576
(Pasta with spiciness,
tteokbokki)

1564
01:09:26,577 --> 01:09:29,046
(Filled with Sicilian anchovies,
gimbap)

1565
01:09:29,047 --> 01:09:31,316
(Crispy outside, caponata inside,
oven chicken)

1566
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:37,121
(Let's show them
real K-food with a Sicilian twist!)

1567
01:09:37,989 --> 01:09:42,359
(The most anticipated Ryu-cipe meal yet)

1568
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,329
(There's no time.)

1569
01:09:45,129 --> 01:09:48,900
(Mistakes are made from nervousness.)

1570
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:53,704
(Will the trio be able to succeed?)

1571
01:09:53,705 --> 01:09:56,040
This is our biggest crisis yet.

1572
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:59,276
You wanted to taste the Ryu-cipes, right?

1573
01:09:59,277 --> 01:10:02,279
The three boys will go to you.

1574
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,615
It's a familiar but new flavor.

1575
01:10:05,616 --> 01:10:09,987
A dash of uniqueness we learned
gets added to a familiar flavor.

1576
01:10:09,988 --> 01:10:13,223
If you get a taste, you won't
be able to stop making it at home.

1577
01:10:13,224 --> 01:10:16,159
- Come meet the three boys.
- Come.

1578
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,894
Right now.

1579
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:20,797
- Italy.
- Right now.
