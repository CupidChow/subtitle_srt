00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,272
(It's their third day
of studying in Brunei.)

2
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:19,476
Hello.

3
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:20,644
Hello.

4
00:00:21,144 --> 00:00:24,648
(Where have they come
on their third day?)

5
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:25,382
(Buzzing)

6
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:29,453
(Where have the three boys come to?)

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,357
Welcome.

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,361
(Welcome treats for the three boys)

9
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,129
(Table full of Brunei snacks)

10
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:40,697
These must be to welcome us.

11
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:42,032
Could I try one?

12
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:44,001
You don't have to give us a lot.

13
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:45,168
(Big eater mode twitching)

14
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:46,503
This is fried banana?

15
00:00:47,337 --> 00:00:49,139
Which one? This one, okay.

16
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:53,777
It's good. It's tasty.

17
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:55,145
- It's delicious.
- It's good.

18
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,681
All of you are students
learning to cook here?

19
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:59,349
- Yes, we are.
- You're students.

20
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:01,885
(Students learning to cook?)

21
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:04,421
(A royal culinary school
run by the Sultan of Brunei)

22
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:06,356
This is a really famous school.

23
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:08,859
They have a cooking department
and also a tourism department.

24
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:10,394
So they have multiple departments.

25
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:13,196
Apparently, graduates from here
go on to work all over the world.

26
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:19,169
(A leading center
for cultivating top culinary talent)

27
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:23,540
(The crown of culinary education,
Brunei's Royal Cooking School)

28
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:26,610
(We received an email from the school.)

29
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,845
(Dear international students, I heard
that you are coming to Brunei to study.)

30
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:32,149
(We would like to introduce our dishes
and taste your dishes.)

31
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:34,818
We thought we could learn a lot.

32
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:37,921
So we really thought hard
about what we could do.

33
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:40,791
This wasn't going to be
just us tasting their dishes.

34
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,927
We had to introduce them
to our dishes as well.

35
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:46,563
So, we wanted Ryu-cipes created
on the foundation of Korean cuisine.

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,267
(And with that, the Ryu-cipe exchange
between Korea and Brunei began.)

37
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:53,971
(But... we didn't know then.)

38
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:56,073
I don't think they're students.

39
00:01:56,707 --> 00:01:58,909
These dishes are insanely high in quality.

40
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:03,647
The dishes we prepared
aren't appropriate right now.

41
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:08,185
(Top-quality dishes
that were presented to the boys)

42
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:12,356
(And the three brothers fell silent.)

43
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:14,825
Producer.

44
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:16,360
If we just go with what we prepared...

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,095
(Emergency discussion with the crew)

46
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:19,396
We just thought...

47
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:22,499
we were going to be working
with students who've just started...

48
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,167
We're also professionals.

49
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:25,902
(I'm a professional?)

50
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:27,404
This is bad.

51
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:29,306
If we just go with what we prepared,

52
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:30,907
I feel like we'll come off as insincere.

53
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:32,476
Look how much effort they're putting in.

54
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:34,678
We did not prepare for this properly.
This isn't good.

55
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:38,315
(What happened at the culinary school?)

56
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:41,551
I'm Chef Aziz.

57
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:43,553
(Let us introduce him.)

58
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:47,391
(Aziz, the new face of fine dining
in Brunei's food scene)

59
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:51,161
(Winner of Brunei's Best Chef Award
and Best Dessert Award)

60
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:55,365
(Mentor to the best and brightest
at the culinary school)

61
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:59,469
(And his devoted students)

62
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:02,306
(Top-class students)

63
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:06,310
(They swept national and international
cooking competitions.)

64
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,916
What we're going to do today...

65
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:17,421
is modernizing traditional food.

66
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:20,179
It's going to be creative and new,

67
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,363
but we're going to keep the essence
of the traditional and local ingredients.

68
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:28,332
Spirit of "On-go-ji-shin."

69
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:30,400
(On-go-ji-shin /
Learning the new by studying the old)

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,505
I'm going to make
ambuyat cracker with shrimp ceviche.

71
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:39,209
First, I will show you my dish.

72
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,313
(Today's first dish
is ambuyat cracker with shrimp ceviche)

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,416
He's already made the ambuyat mixture.

74
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:51,154
You guys have tried ambuyat, right?

75
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:54,291
(Ambuyat mixture?)

76
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:58,462
(Kyung Ho challenged himself
to make ambuyat for his first Ryu-cipe.)

77
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:03,033
(Kyung Ho made muk (jelly) with ambuyat.)

78
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:06,570
(How will the chef use ambuyat?)

79
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,739
We're going to spread it thinly.

80
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,246
(Focused attention)

81
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:21,018
It's going to be dehydrated
for at least two hours.

82
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:26,690
Then, it will form into this.

83
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,893
(Instead of its usual sticky texture,
it's dried and used in solid form.)

84
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:34,398
(Before dehydrating, slimy /
After dehydrating, solid)

85
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:36,300
And when we fry this...

86
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,968
it will become a cracker.

87
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:42,739
(Fry the dehydrated ambuyat in oil.)

88
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:46,543
(As soon as it hits the oil,
the ambuyat cracker puffs up.)

89
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:49,179
That's why it's called a cracker.

90
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:52,716
(Reimagined ambuyat in snack form)

91
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:56,586
It's as quick as frying
dashima bugak (kelp chip), right?

92
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:58,889
(Similar to Korean dashima bugak)

93
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:03,527
To me, the process of dehydrating
the slimy ambuyat...

94
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:05,963
and frying it like that is so fascinating.

95
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:06,997
Yeah, same.

96
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:09,733
Is this your own twist,
or is it a common method?

97
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,168
Yes.

98
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:12,669
It's my own twist.

99
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:15,105
I don't think anyone in Brunei
had done this before.

100
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:16,773
Really?

101
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:19,943
You crack it and eat it with umai.

102
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:21,645
(Umai?)

103
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:24,181
Umai is also called ceviche.

104
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:27,551
- Ceviche.
- Yes, ceviche.

105
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:29,224
(Ceviche)

106
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:31,555
(A traditional South American
dish of cured seafood in citrus juice)

107
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:34,458
(What makes it unique
is that it's "cooked" by acid, not heat.)

108
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:39,096
But we'll be making it the Bruneian way.

109
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:43,100
(A super simple recipe that's perfect
with crackers, Bruneian shrimp ceviche.)

110
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:46,637
(1. Remove the guts and mince the shrimp.)

111
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,839
That's some serious knife skills, Chef.

112
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,944
(Juice of 2 limes, 2T of vinegar)

113
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:56,747
This technique is called cold cooking.

114
00:05:56,747 --> 00:06:00,350
You can see the shrimp turning white
after adding the lime juice and vinegar.

115
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,520
(Lime's acidity changes the color
and enhances the chewy texture.)

116
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,888
The acidity cooked it.

117
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,793
I made a powder with lime leaves.

118
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:11,795
(The lime leaf powder will add
and refreshing bitterness.)

119
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:13,497
I see. It was made from lime leaves.

120
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,834
(Sprinkle the lime leaf powder
and salt mixture.)

121
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:21,705
(It could be replaced with lemon zest.)

122
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:27,077
(2. Mix a little bit of salt, pepper,
1 finely chopped red chili, some herbs)

123
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:28,478
(Bruneian Shrimp Ceviche)

124
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:29,980
(1. Remove guts, finely dice shrimp.
2. Add juice of 2 limes, 2T vinegar.)

125
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,896
(3. 2 pinches of lime leaf powder
or lemon zest.)

126
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:31,949
4. Mix with salt, pepper,
1 chopped red chili, herbs.)

127
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,985
This is the final product.

128
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:38,722
(Straight out of a masterclass)

129
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:42,092
(Deep-fried it
into a cracker like a snack)

130
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,762
(And paired it with shrimp ceviche
for a reimagined fine-dining dish)

131
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:49,866
(Ambuyat cracker with shrimp ceviche)

132
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:52,235
Here we go. Cheers.

133
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:53,737
It's going to fall.

134
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:55,672
(It looks fantastic,
but what about the taste?)

135
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:56,940
It's aromatic.

136
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,311
(Nervous)

137
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:06,249
(A flavor that makes you clap
after one bite?)

138
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,051
(Satisfied)

139
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:10,487
There's the crunchy ambuyat cracker,

140
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:15,392
then the ceviche's lime leaf powder
and the lime juice give that citrusy pop.

141
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:17,861
It's perfectly balanced.

142
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:19,896
It's really delicious.

143
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:23,166
Unbelievable.

144
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:25,802
Thank you.

145
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:26,603
(Crunchy ambuyat cracker)

146
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,872
When they have ceviche in South America,

147
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:30,941
they also eat it
with something crunchy on the side.

148
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,377
So he's kept that combination...

149
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,979
but changed everything
to make it Bruneian.

150
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:39,182
(Ambuyat Cracker with Shrimp Ceviche
reimagined with Bruneian ingredients)

151
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,852
I heard he was going to use ramyeon.

152
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:44,888
(The dish of the winner
of Brunei's National Cooking Competition)

153
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:47,958
(The winner
of Brunei's National Cooking Competition)

154
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:51,595
Bruneian appi ramyeon.

155
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:54,331
Appi means spicy?

156
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:57,134
Appi means fire.

157
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,404
(Brunei's No. 1 will make a fire ramyeon.)

158
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:04,374
(Today's second dish
is Bruneian fire ramyeon.)

159
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:06,476
Do you often enjoy Korean ramyeon?

160
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:13,951
There's a Korean market nearby,
so we have it often.

161
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,052
(Definitely a ramyeon lover)

162
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:16,853
It's obvious. He's really into it.

163
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,588
A tea bag?

164
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:23,527
I'm going to make a Korean spicy ramyeon.

165
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,563
(Bonito flakes, shiitake,
ramyeon seasoning packet, kelp)

166
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,298
You're using bonito flakes.

167
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:29,333
Yes.

168
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,469
I have all the ramyeon seasonings at home.

169
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:33,704
At your house?

170
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:35,973
Yeah, all the dried ingredients.

171
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,307
I have it all at home.

172
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:39,109
There are about 80 different kinds.

173
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,545
So you can customize the flavor
to your liking.

174
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:44,014
If you come over, I can make you
the weirdest ramyeon combos ever.

175
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:47,551
He's putting thought into every step.

176
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:48,685
No shortcuts.

177
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:52,623
So cute.

178
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:54,891
(Placed inside a pot as if brewing tea)

179
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:56,093
That's how
he's going to make the broth.

180
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:58,695
He's making it like tea.

181
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:04,034
You can tell he's putting
his whole heart into it.

182
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,035
(A broth brewed
with the same care as serving tea)

183
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:07,571
It's so interesting
that this is how he's making the broth,

184
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:11,141
and it's so clever that
he was inspired by ramyeon.

185
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:12,876
He's totally recreating it.

186
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:16,947
(He gave it an interesting texture
with fried dangmyeon (glass noodle).)

187
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:22,085
(Reimagined spicy ramyeon
with broth that was brewed like tea)

188
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:26,757
(Reinterpreted spicy ramyeon
Bruneian Fire Ramyeon)

189
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:30,227
Look at it melt.

190
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:34,498
(The broth is poured over the noodles
like instant cup ramyeon.)

191
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,600
This has to be good.

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,402
So well put together.

193
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,673
(What does the Bruneian fire ramyeon
taste like?)

194
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:53,650
(Nervous)

195
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,753
It has a subtle metallic note,
almost like copper.

196
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:59,389
It has that sharp kick in the throat,
and I love it.

197
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,158
Thank you.

198
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:02,726
The shiitake flavor was so nice.

199
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,662
I think he really captured
the essence of this brand's ramyeon.

200
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:09,132
The mushroom flavor
is surprisingly intense in your mouth.

201
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:10,200
It works really well.

202
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,570
Plus, those crunchy dangmyeon...

203
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,238
It makes me want to drink it
straight from the bowl.

204
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,208
(Like this?)

205
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:20,344
That's how a ramyeon should be eaten.

206
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:21,378
I can't believe how the flavor...

207
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:24,014
- was taken up to the fine-dining level.
- Right.

208
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,449
- It's incredible.
- Thank you for the dish.

209
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:26,950
Thank you.

210
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,786
(A dish from a true Korean ramyeon lover)

211
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:35,459
(Bruneian fire ramyeon,
reimagined as fine dining)

212
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,660
Director, you need to capture this.

213
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,828
It's so cool.

214
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:41,665
(What kind of dish is it this time?)

215
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:48,605
We're reinterpreting nasi lemak...

216
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:51,742
while using all the original ingredients.

217
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:54,125
(Traditional nasi lemak /
Fusion nasi lemak)

218
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:56,913
(A modern reinterpretation
using the same ingredients)

219
00:10:57,414 --> 00:11:00,517
(A creative modern take on tradition
Fusion Nasi Lemak)

220
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:03,587
(A new version of nasi lemak
that's been reconstructed in a modern way)

221
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:05,956
(This is no joke.)

222
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:07,591
Look how creative this is.

223
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,727
This is a high-quality dish.

224
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:14,031
What is the name of this?

225
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,534
It will trap the soup into a bubble.

226
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:19,136
(A soup? Bubble?)

227
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,238
I'm using a little bit of science.

228
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:23,440
(They're even using science?)

229
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:27,044
(He's adding the frozen broth
into a hot water.)

230
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:29,079
This is so interesting.

231
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,614
(But the broth is keeping its shape
instead of melting.)

232
00:11:30,614 --> 00:11:32,816
A skin has formed.

233
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:36,153
(A thin film formed
through a chemical reaction.)

234
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:39,456
(That's how the broth is kept inside.)

235
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:41,858
(Thin layer)

236
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:43,994
Wait, is this molecular cooking?

237
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,562
Yeah, he's using science.

238
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:47,564
(Respect)

239
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,557
(Fusion nasi lemak)

240
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:55,172
(They kept the tradition
and added new insights.)

241
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,182
(Molecular soup)

242
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,711
(And they reinterpreted
the dishes in a modern way.)

243
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:02,446
Please have a taste.

244
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:04,815
(What will the molecular soup taste like?)

245
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,551
It suddenly bursts, right?

246
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,852
It surprises you, right?

247
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:11,722
If we just grate some radish here,

248
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:12,756
it becomes a broth for buckwheat noodles.

249
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:13,890
You're right.

250
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:16,560
(Pop)

251
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,728
It pops, right?

252
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:20,197
Kihyun was right on with his explanation.

253
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:21,999
There's nothing more to say.

254
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,934
(No more flavor explanation needed)

255
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:26,937
Let's try this together.

256
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:29,806
Yeah, let's go for it.

257
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,213
How is it?

258
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,582
It's a flavor like this.

259
00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:49,793
So they've reinterpreted a simple dish...

260
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:51,762
with rice, sambal, and a side...

261
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:53,530
into a fine-dining dish.

262
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,731
That flavor of the yolk.

263
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,733
The new flavor of sambal.

264
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,168
And beef that was sous vide.

265
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:00,437
The glutinous rice, the pandan shell...

266
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:02,039
When you have them all in one bite,

267
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,041
it makes you think
they should sell this in Korea.

268
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,410
This is a flavor everyone would enjoy.

269
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,146
It's perfectly balanced.

270
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:11,148
(Satisfied)

271
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,150
I'm actually getting really nervous.

272
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,452
Now that we had all these
unexpectedly amazing dishes,

273
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:19,556
I'm worried. I'm not so sure anymore
about the dishes we prepared.

274
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:22,392
I don't know if we can show it to them.

275
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,196
No pressure.

276
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:28,999
These dishes are insanely high in quality.

277
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,902
I feel like I need to roll
the dangmyeon or something...

278
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:34,171
like how he did with his dish earlier.

279
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:36,340
It makes me think
I need to create something like that.

280
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,576
(Kyung Ho approaches the crew.)

281
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:42,212
Our dishes are going to be underwhelming
compared to their dishes.

282
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:44,147
They've gone to competitions,

283
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:46,817
and everyone here
is cooking fine dining dishes.

284
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,485
We're also professionals.

285
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:50,187
(I'm a professional?)

286
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,456
If we just go with what we prepared,

287
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,857
I feel like we'll come off as insincere.

288
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:56,026
Look how much effort they're putting in.

289
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:57,728
We did not prepare for this properly.
This isn't good.

290
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:00,597
It wasn't just
an ordinary cooking school.

291
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:01,965
The quality was really high.

292
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:05,168
You know, the fine dining restaurants
that are trendy right now...

293
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:08,272
I think it was a school to teach you
how to cook fine-dining dishes.

294
00:14:08,272 --> 00:14:10,207
So what should we do?

295
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:12,442
We're totally screwed.

296
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:13,844
(Emergency meeting in session)

297
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:16,913
I get that we're international students,

298
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,915
but we've come to a place
that way out of our league.

299
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:22,119
When I tasted the dish by her,
I knew we were screwed.

300
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,087
- The girl who made the nasi lemak?
- The beef.

301
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:27,624
You're putting your name on the line too.

302
00:14:27,624 --> 00:14:29,393
What do we do?

303
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,729
How could I let them taste my dish?

304
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:36,566
(Lost all motivation)

305
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:42,639
(Kihyun is deep in thought.)

306
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,741
Then...

307
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,476
I will...

308
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:49,880
You know how I was going to make
beef bulgogi (grilled beef)?

309
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:53,250
(Kihyun had planned to make
a traditional beef bulgogi.)

310
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,718
Should I make the bulgogi...

311
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,854
into a ssam (wrap) with rice paper?

312
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,923
I can roll the bulgogi inside...

313
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:03,060
with some chopped scallions...

314
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,930
and make it look like
a mandu (dumpling) or something.

315
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:09,566
I can tie it with dangmyeon.

316
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:10,701
Tie it with the noodle?

317
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,669
Su Young, how about I use some rice paper
and make it like a mandu?

318
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:14,571
It'll be a beef bulgogi mandu.

319
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:16,773
- That's not bad.
- Pretty good, right?

320
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:17,975
That's pretty good.

321
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:19,810
I need to at least do something like that.

322
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:23,347
Your expression right now...

323
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,581
(His soul has left his body.)

324
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:26,083
I'm completely out of it right now.

325
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,384
Your expression...

326
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:29,286
What were you supposed to make?

327
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:30,721
Don't even look.

328
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,923
(A mental breakdown
has turned him into Sassy Fairy.)

329
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:33,957
Your expression...

330
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:35,325
This is really embarrassing.

331
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:38,261
(He had prepared an upgraded version
of Double S Fire.)

332
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:40,464
How about we do this?

333
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:45,135
They prepared fine-dining dishes
so that we could taste...

334
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,470
a little bit at a time.

335
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,039
So, we can also use
just this amount of noodles...

336
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,608
Hide it from them.

337
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:53,710
- Leave them wanting more.
- Wanting more?

338
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,879
Just the smallest piece of a squid,

339
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:58,048
and tiny pieces
of the radish and the cucumber...

340
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:01,084
so that even if they want to have more,
there's only enough for a bite each.

341
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,486
What you just said
does seem like an idea...

342
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:03,820
So, leave them wanting more.

343
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,255
Just enough to taste it.

344
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,357
A slightly small portion
makes it feel more satisfying, somehow.

345
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:08,525
Exactly.

346
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:10,093
He's already drawing it.

347
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,496
He's a total chef now.

348
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:14,164
He's even drawing.

349
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:17,935
A total chef? Are you kidding me?

350
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,903
Who's a chef right now?

351
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:22,072
Why did you have to bring us here?

352
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:23,473
Why am I here?

353
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,323
This is the moment...

354
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:28,812
our late-night
brainstorming goes to waste.

355
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:31,848
- We were brainstorming until one.
- We were up until one in the morning.

356
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:33,951
- Let's go up.
- Are we cooking upstairs?

357
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,419
Let's look at
the ingredients first.

358
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,920
(They head to the kitchen
without a solution.)

359
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:38,956
We're cooking in here?

360
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,424
Right here? Yeah?

361
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:42,926
- I'm nervous.
- The ingredients...

362
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,861
(The three boys will be cooking here.)

363
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:48,332
This feels like the final stage.

364
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:51,702
It seems like I'm here to take a test.

365
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:53,503
I'm going crazy.

366
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,874
They prepared knives for us.

367
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,910
These knives are nice too.

368
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,078
Are they?

369
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:03,180
The knives seem new.

370
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,215
(Even the smallest things
feel overwhelming.)

371
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:07,050
Going well?

372
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,719
- Yes.
- Su Young.

373
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:10,287
It's nice here.

374
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:11,588
Su Young, over here.

375
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:13,256
Use the big counter there.

376
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:18,528
(All smiles gone,
Su Young's looking extra serious today.)

377
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:23,867
(He starts his Ryu-cipe with a big sigh.)

378
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:26,336
I'll leave the red chilies here.

379
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,704
- Okay.
- So that it's here when you need it.

380
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:30,207
The moment we start cooking,
I suddenly get all respectful towards him.

381
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:31,541
He suddenly becomes nice.

382
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,544
He goes, "Excuse me,"
instead of the usual "Hey."

383
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:35,679
(Kyung Ho's being extra formal today
under pressure.)

384
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:37,347
I should always be cooking.

385
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,483
(Full of pressure)

386
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,251
- Su Young.
- Yeah?

387
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:45,555
I know I tried to come up
with different ideas earlier,

388
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:47,557
- but like how I decided yesterday...
- Yeah.

389
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,359
- I'll diligently stick to the plan.
- Sounds good.

390
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,195
Then, if I have
a little bit of time at the end,

391
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:55,098
I'll try to decorate it or something.

392
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:56,266
Good idea.

393
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:00,938
(A heart weighed down
by pressure and worry)

394
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:04,975
Actually, I had a deep discussion
with Su Young last night.

395
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,711
And I have a lot on my mind now.

396
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,180
If I try out a new recipe or a method...

397
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,617
and it doesn't work out...

398
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,385
I don't want to fail,

399
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,488
so I decided to go with the dish I made
on the second day in Brunei.

400
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:22,125
An upgraded version
of the stir-fried shrimp and squid.

401
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,227
You know, since seafood here is so fresh.

402
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:27,331
This time, I'm only going to use squid.

403
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:29,152
So, with stir-fried squid in sambal,

404
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:31,702
I'm going to boil
some somyeon (thin noodles)...

405
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:35,238
and make stir-fried squid
in sambal with somyeon.

406
00:18:35,806 --> 00:18:40,611
(He's going to use noodles instead of rice
for his take on nasi lemak.)

407
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:44,514
And if we can find ssaltteok (rice cake),
I'll add that too.

408
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:47,851
I want to use the texture
of the somyeon and ssaltteok...

409
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:50,621
and add that to the dish
to upgrade my Ryu-cipe.

410
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:54,358
(A new soul food for K-dads)

411
00:18:54,958 --> 00:19:00,030
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe
Fiery Squid Bibim-myeon)

412
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,465
I'm nervous.

413
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm honestly very nervous.

414
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:08,038
(Starts with cleaning the squid)

415
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:10,040
Su Young,
I don't need to peel the skin, right?

416
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,342
- I didn't yesterday.
- Do it like yesterday.

417
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:14,411
I feel like I need to peel the skin.

418
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:16,446
It makes me put more heart into it.

419
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,982
I just thought of this right now,

420
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,450
but I should've simply said, "It's tasty."

421
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,753
Instead, I commented on why it was good
and what made it good.

422
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:25,122
It probably made me seem like
some kind of a professional.

423
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,324
Right? You get what you give.

424
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:30,727
I should've stopped with "It's delicious."

425
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:33,530
Life is full of unexpected twists.

426
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,399
They're going to have such
high expectations now...

427
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:36,900
and totally comment on our dishes.

428
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:40,103
(We can't give up though.)

429
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,472
(In one go)

430
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:45,976
(As if to get rid of the pressure,
he cleans the unwanted parts.)

431
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:49,446
(Kyung Ho's skills
have improved significantly.)

432
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:53,650
(The squid is cleaned in a flash.)

433
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:56,887
This is today's highlight.

434
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,224
(Kyung Ho has brought out a red sauce.)

435
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:02,592
Is it sambal?

436
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,795
I'm going to make the sauce with sambal.

437
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,899
(Brunei's heat, sambal)

438
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,603
(And another special ingredient
for the K-dads.)

439
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:17,040
(Korea's heat, red pepper powder)

440
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:21,545
(A taste of Korean cuisine in Brunei)

441
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,583
(Kyung Ho's sauce
holds the taste of home.)

442
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,190
Kyung Ho, you seem like...

443
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:35,392
a professional.

444
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,162
That's how I should think of myself now.

445
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:44,101
(A bold, blazing fusion
of all things spicy)

446
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,471
(Next... a wok?)

447
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:51,308
(It's time for Wok Ho to get to work.)

448
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:53,677
- Shall we give the wok a good spin?
- Go for a spin.

449
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:56,513
(Kyung Ho ambitiously took on the wok.)

450
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:03,053
Don't you think
the wok needs to be hotter?

451
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,621
(Is this right?)

452
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,390
Why isn't this working?

453
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,592
The wok isn't hot enough.

454
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:11,295
Cooking is hard. It is hard.

455
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:14,698
(A painful memory of his wok disaster)

456
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,635
(Giving it another go at the wok today)

457
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:22,606
(First, add the sauce,
the vegetables, and the squid.)

458
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,243
(Will it work this time?)

459
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:34,651
(A success)

460
00:21:34,818 --> 00:21:37,087
It smells good.

461
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,222
It's hot.

462
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:43,493
(Gained wok skills and pain)

463
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,698
It looks much better than yesterday.

464
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,132
Hot.

465
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:50,500
(Absolute mayhem)

466
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:55,405
(When the squid is almost done cooking...)

467
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:58,165
(An ingredient
to upgrade his Ryu-cipe!)

468
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:02,145
(An ingredient
to upgrade his Ryu-cipe, ssaltteok!)

469
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,182
I want to use the texture
of the somyeon and ssaltteok...

470
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:07,884
and add that to the dish
to upgrade my Ryu-cipe.

471
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:13,423
(Not just the texture,
but the flavor has been enhanced as well)

472
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:16,026
All right. I've made it to here.

473
00:22:16,026 --> 00:22:17,728
(Unlike how worried he was,
starting to gain confidence)

474
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:21,832
(It will be perfect
if he can just get the seasoning right.)

475
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,500
It's salty.

476
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:25,669
(In panic)

477
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:27,404
What do I do, Su Young?
It's salty.

478
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:28,872
(Logs in to Ryu-GPT.)

479
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:30,207
- It's salty.
- What?

480
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:32,175
Okay, it's salty, but is it sweet or not?

481
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,678
It's a bit sweet.
Everything else is okay,

482
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:35,979
but it's just salty.

483
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,081
(Ryu-GPT on)

484
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:39,616
It'll be eaten with somyeon, so...

485
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,851
Is it really salty?

486
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,186
This is the tteok.

487
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:45,555
(Ryu-GPT's diagnosis)

488
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:46,757
It's not cooked yet.

489
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,860
It's not salty. It needs more sweetness.

490
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:54,398
(There's not enough sweetness,
so what is Ryu-GPT's prescription?)

491
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:56,700
Drizzle a bit of
maesil-cheong (plum syrup).

492
00:22:57,534 --> 00:22:58,802
And add a scoop of water.

493
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:00,170
Once it boils, turn off the heat.

494
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:02,072
So, add some maesil-cheong,
a scoop of water,

495
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:03,173
then once it boils, turn off the heat?

496
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,574
Yeah, it needs to boil once.

497
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:06,677
(Input complete)

498
00:23:06,977 --> 00:23:09,046
Start with a tablespoon of maesil-cheong.

499
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:10,314
How big is the ladle?

500
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:11,448
The ladle?

501
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,251
Add half a scoop of water.

502
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:15,652
It looks good now.

503
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:17,821
It can't be too watery.

504
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:20,190
Set the heat to high,
then pour in the water.

505
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,893
- I already added it though.
- Did you?

506
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,296
(Input error)

507
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:27,597
Why are we so off?

508
00:23:27,597 --> 00:23:29,066
No, but...

509
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:30,467
Jeez, Kyung Ho.

510
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:33,303
You should've told me
to turn on the heat first.

511
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,909
(Even the lighter is not working.)

512
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:41,311
- Is this broken?
- I'll do it for you.

513
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,581
The lighter isn't working.

514
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:45,682
Never mind.

515
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:48,852
I need to let it boil?

516
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:50,821
Yeah, but don't stir too much.
It'll get all mushy.

517
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:54,124
(Little mistakes continue due to pressure)

518
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:58,962
(Will he be able to complete
his Ryu-cipe?)

519
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:05,168
(It's not over yet.)

520
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,340
(The somyeon will take Double S Fire
into another level.)

521
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,606
I'm going to boil some somyeon...

522
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:16,780
and make stir-fried squid
in sambal with somyeon.

523
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:21,685
(The stir-fried squid
has been reinterpreted into a bibim-myeon)

524
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:26,690
(Boil for about 4 minutes.)

525
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,928
(Roll up the chewy somyeon
into neat bundles.)

526
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,666
(Pile on a generous amount
of fiery squid next to the somyeon.)

527
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:39,536
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe,
fiery squid bibim-myeon, is done.)

528
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:44,975
(Captured the texture of Korean cuisine
with somyeon and tteok)

529
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,077
(Fiery Squid Bibim-myeon)

530
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:47,668
(1. Chop 1 onion, 1 scallion,
2 carrots, 1 Cheongyang peppers.)

531
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:48,145
(2. Score the squid,
cut into bite-sized pieces.)

532
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:49,980
(3. Stir-fry sauce, squid, tteok.
4. Plate stir-fried squid and somyeon.)

533
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,983
What are you going to do?
You're just going with that?

534
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:57,087
I'm going to make beef bulgogi, but...

535
00:24:57,087 --> 00:25:00,991
I wanted to make a dish with gochujang
(red pepper paste) or red pepper powder,

536
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:03,727
but Kyung Ho called dibs on it first.

537
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,896
If I also made a red-colored dish,

538
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:10,801
I was worried
they might think Korean food is all red.

539
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,103
That's why I decided on soy sauce,

540
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:15,305
and thus, beef bulgogi.

541
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:22,980
(Kihyun returns to savory cooking
after a long dessert streak.)

542
00:25:23,213 --> 00:25:25,182
- Kyung Ho, is this soy sauce?
- Yes.

543
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:30,587
(Kihyun's special
soy sauce marinade recipe)

544
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:35,025
(Add 12T of soy sauce,
the base of beef bulgogi.)

545
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:39,262
(Pear, sugar)

546
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:40,998
Is it going well?

547
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,634
Peeling garlic is still hard.

548
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,273
(Bang! Bang! Bang!)

549
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:51,241
Like that, do it like that.

550
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:55,012
(Do it like this.)

551
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,947
(As expected from the Hulk of the kitchen)

552
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:58,682
Su Young, you're like Jekyll and Hyde.

553
00:25:59,616 --> 00:26:00,784
No, that's the right way.

554
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:02,219
Garlic should be...

555
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:05,255
- This is the best way to crush garlic.
- Exactly.

556
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,425
(Thanks to the guys,
the garlic's all peeled.)

557
00:26:09,493 --> 00:26:11,561
(Double knives)

558
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:14,464
(Double knife mode)

559
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,534
(Totally sharpened up for today)

560
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,504
(Fancy knife work)

561
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,373
(Overflowing with charisma)

562
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,976
(Glances)

563
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,512
- Nice.
- Fancy knife work.

564
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,517
(Immediately add the minced garlic.)

565
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:39,589
To this, add maesil-cheong, pear, sugar,
soy sauce, garlic, and 4T of sesame oil.

566
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:44,094
(And the taste?)

567
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:45,295
(Unsure)

568
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:47,397
Su Young,
could you check the sauce for me?

569
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,299
(When you're not sure, ask Ryu-GPT.)

570
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:50,834
- It's a bit salty.
- A bit salty?

571
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,336
You'll regret that later.

572
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,871
It has to be lightly seasoned.

573
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:56,740
It should make you think
you could drink the sauce,

574
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,675
but it shouldn't be bland.

575
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:03,113
(What should I do?
Brain at full speed)

576
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:08,685
(Hurries over to grab something)

577
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,957
I'm going to use coconut water
instead of just water.

578
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,128
So I'm planning to incorporate
some elements...

579
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:22,633
that reflect the characteristics
of the local climate.

580
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,769
(Coconut, a must-have ingredient
across Southeast Asia)

581
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:29,673
(He'll be using a sweetness
that's familiar to the locals.)

582
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:34,111
(Kihyun's special touch
to balance out the saltiness)

583
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:37,381
(A habit from his dessert days?
He measures the coconut water to a tee.)

584
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:39,016
(Kihyun's special
coconut soy sauce marinade)

585
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:40,550
(3T maesil-cheong, 1/2 blended pear,
3T sugar, 12T soy sauce)

586
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,252
(1T minced garlic,
4T sesame oil, 100ml coconut water)

587
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:47,658
(Satisfied)

588
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:51,928
(Marinate the meat in the special
coconut soy sauce marinade.)

589
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,397
Gosh, my back.

590
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:55,332
My feet really hurt.

591
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:57,634
I don't think I'll ever cook
this many dishes...

592
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,236
back-to-back again in my life.

593
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:00,337
So true.

594
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:03,106
- I've really been at it nonstop.
- You're at it nonstop, huh?

595
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:04,408
Every single day.

596
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:06,543
(The three boys
have been cooking every single day.)

597
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:08,545
Cooking like this in another kitchen...

598
00:28:08,545 --> 00:28:09,947
is not an easy task.

599
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:12,015
It was like that for me too.
It's still like that.

600
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:14,885
I was surprised.

601
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:17,354
I was just going to cook
an ordinary soft tofu jjigae (stew).

602
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:20,557
I went in thinking I'd show off
Korea's deep, spicy flavors, but...

603
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:22,526
I would've felt bad if I did that.

604
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:23,627
If I just went with that,

605
00:28:23,627 --> 00:28:25,996
they might've said,
"I've had this before."

606
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,064
You know, they're chefs.

607
00:28:27,064 --> 00:28:30,634
So, I really thought about what to do.

608
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:31,935
(Lost in thought
before cooking his Ryu-cipe)

609
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:33,904
Are you changing your dish?

610
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:35,505
I should, to something simple.

611
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,275
There's no point in cooking
something complicated here.

612
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:41,478
They're probably all familiar
with most of the Korean dishes.

613
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:46,617
(Su Young was deep in thought
for a long time.)

614
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:49,753
I thought about what to do, how to do it.

615
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:52,489
So, I made sweet and spicy chicken
(sweet and spicy chicken).

616
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:54,725
Korea's sweet and spicy chicken is famous.

617
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:56,560
I mixed the Korean sauce...

618
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,995
with sambal...

619
00:28:57,995 --> 00:29:00,130
and made a new sweet and spicy chicken.

620
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:05,035
(Sweet and spicy chicken using sambal)

621
00:29:05,502 --> 00:29:09,072
(Start by prepping the chicken.)

622
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:11,942
(Leg)

623
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,744
(Breast)

624
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:17,814
(Deboning only the legs and breasts)

625
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:22,819
(Blending chicken in a mixer?)

626
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:28,158
(So far, Su Young's chicken
is still a mystery.)

627
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:32,162
(The chicken has been blended.)

628
00:29:32,663 --> 00:29:35,832
(Next, make the sauce.)

629
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,901
I was thinking about
how to enhance this and...

630
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:40,771
(Su Young's special kick
for his sweet and spicy chicken)

631
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:41,939
Sambal.

632
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:44,474
The structure of it was similar...

633
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:45,575
to my sweet and spicy chicken sauce.

634
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,877
Then, let's omit everything.

635
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:48,679
If I just add some ketchup,

636
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,015
sugar, and gochujang to sambal,
it could be similar.

637
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:53,917
And I was right.

638
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,953
It was similar and more complex.

639
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,021
(The sweet and spicy chicken sauce)

640
00:29:58,021 --> 00:30:00,557
(2T ketchup, 1T sugar, 1T soy sauce,
1T gochujang, 2T sambal)

641
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:05,662
(A collaboration of Korea and Brunei!
The sweet and spicy sauce is done.)

642
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:12,002
(He's adding the sauce
to the blended meat?)

643
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:15,305
I totally blended the meat
and added the sauce to it.

644
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,342
What was I going for?

645
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:21,144
ISOF, "Inside Saucy, Outside Fried."

646
00:30:22,312 --> 00:30:24,147
Inside-out chicken.

647
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:26,650
The outside was going to be crunchy
like fried chicken,

648
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,918
and the inside
was going to have the sauce.

649
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:29,953
I thought it would be a fun chicken dish.

650
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:34,024
So, I made ISOF inside-out chicken.

651
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:39,863
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
ISOF Chicken Ball)

652
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:45,569
(Shape it into meatballs.)

653
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:48,972
(What's this?)

654
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:50,407
So, the outside...

655
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:51,808
I wrapped the meatballs
with chicken skin.

656
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,511
(The kick of ISOF
is the crispy chicken skin.)

657
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:55,846
The chicken skin
is the crispy and tasty part.

658
00:30:56,046 --> 00:31:00,083
(Chicken skin is the breakout star
of the fried food scene.)

659
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:04,855
(Its crispy texture
makes it a fan favorite.)

660
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:14,765
(Wrap the chicken meatballs
with the skin.)

661
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:20,804
(It's for the "Fried Outside"
of the ISOF chicken.)

662
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:23,507
I covered it in rice flour and fried it.

663
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,043
(Cover it in rice flour
for added crispiness.)

664
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:30,380
(The chicken skin will hold the juices
for a more flavorful meatball.)

665
00:31:31,214 --> 00:31:32,649
It could burst if I'm not careful.

666
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:35,852
Please don't burst.

667
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:38,221
Be careful.

668
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:41,959
(Attention! Fry it slowly in low heat.)

669
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,160
I don't think they will burst.

670
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,530
It's crispy.

671
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,764
It has to be crispy.

672
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:57,074
(The ISOF chicken meatballs are crispy
on the outside and juicy on the inside.)

673
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:01,111
(Everything is done now.)

674
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:04,615
(I just need to plate it.)

675
00:32:04,982 --> 00:32:08,118
(How will Su Young plate his dish?)

676
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,895
(Like calligraphy,
he draws a single, flowing line.)

677
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:25,535
(Gently placing a chicken meatball on top)

678
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:28,772
(Speechless)

679
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,741
Like a comet, right?

680
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,243
Yes, exactly.

681
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:39,182
(A plating inspired by a comet.)

682
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:42,252
Your cooking is always on another level.

683
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:43,954
This is hard.

684
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:45,522
You're amazing, Su Young.

685
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,303
(Like a blazing comet)

686
00:32:48,304 --> 00:32:52,062
(Saucy on the inside,
crispy on the outside)

687
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:54,097
(ISOF Chicken Meatball)

688
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,766
(1. Blend the chicken leg, breast.
2. Add the sauce with blended chicken.)

689
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,259
(3. Shape into meatballs, wrap it
with skin, cover with rice flour and fry.)

690
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,235
(4. Plate the chicken meatball
with some sauce.)

691
00:32:58,535 --> 00:33:02,873
(Now, it's Kihyun's turn.
He stir-fries his beef bulgogi.)

692
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,609
It smells nice.

693
00:33:07,244 --> 00:33:11,048
(And just like that,
the beef bulgogi is done?)

694
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:14,084
It's lacking something.

695
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:17,220
I thought
I shouldn't just finish it like that.

696
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:20,557
I needed to change
how I was going to present it.

697
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:21,925
(How should he present his beef bulgogi?)

698
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:23,427
(Sizzling)

699
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,699
This is it.

700
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:30,834
I should use the rice paper.

701
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:36,907
(He's frying the rice paper?)

702
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:42,813
(Fried rice paper looks like a bowl.)

703
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,381
You've got something going on.

704
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:45,983
It looks good. Nice.

705
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,884
But with this...

706
00:33:47,884 --> 00:33:49,319
(Something's weird.)

707
00:33:49,386 --> 00:33:51,622
If I add the beef bulgogi,

708
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:54,391
this is going to break.
It's too weak.

709
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:57,628
(The rice paper is more fragile
than he thought.)

710
00:33:57,628 --> 00:34:00,263
Right. Plating with that
is a whole different issue.

711
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:01,298
(It looks good, but it's too weak.)

712
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:05,269
(The rice paper bowl plan has failed.)

713
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:08,071
(Kihyun is back to thinking.)

714
00:34:08,538 --> 00:34:12,376
(Is he going to give up
on the rice paper?)

715
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:14,211
Should I roll it up like mandu?

716
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,746
That might be better, actually.

717
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,850
(Place some of the beef bulgogi
in the middle of the rice paper.)

718
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:24,454
(Wrap it like a mandu.)

719
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,958
Doesn't it look weird?

720
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,226
Does it look okay?

721
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:30,227
Is it cute?

722
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:34,898
(Wrapped beef bulgogi, Ssambul)

723
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:36,466
Do you want to try one?

724
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:37,567
Yeah, let's try one.

725
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:38,635
I'll make you one.

726
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:41,571
Let's see you roll up a proper ssam!

727
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:42,839
Yes, sir.

728
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,877
If I wrap it this way,
I get a clean bottom.

729
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:49,880
- Thank you.
- Of course.

730
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,085
Yum.

731
00:34:55,252 --> 00:34:56,954
Let's just let the flavor do the talking.

732
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:58,255
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

733
00:34:59,323 --> 00:35:02,259
(Su Young gets one too.)

734
00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:04,895
Is it good?

735
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,631
(It's delicious.)

736
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:11,935
- It's good.
- What was that?

737
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:13,036
It's delicious.

738
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:14,638
(Startled by his sudden performance)

739
00:35:14,638 --> 00:35:16,206
What did I just witness?

740
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:17,708
- Do you want to do it too?
- What?

741
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:18,909
You want to do it too?

742
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,811
- One, two, three.
- What is this?

743
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:22,479
One, two, three.

744
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,247
It's good.

745
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,449
It's totally good.

746
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:28,318
(If you're happy, I'm happy.)

747
00:35:28,518 --> 00:35:32,389
(Finish by neatly plating each wrap.)

748
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:35,759
(Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
Ssambul)

749
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,529
(Beef bulgogi meets rice paper)

750
00:35:39,796 --> 00:35:43,033
(Kihyun's special coconut soy sauce
marinade bursts inside your mouth.)

751
00:35:43,233 --> 00:35:44,301
(Ssambul - Special Soy Sauce Marinade)

752
00:35:44,301 --> 00:35:44,992
(12T soy sauce, 1T garlic, 3T sugar,
1/2 maesil-cheong, 4T sesame oil)

753
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:45,302
(100ml coconut water or water)

754
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:45,918
(Beef bulgogi)

755
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,070
(1. Marinate in sauce for 30 minutes.
2. Prepare scallion, carrot, mushroom.)

756
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,705
(3. Cook the beef half-way, add veggies.
4. Wrap the bulgogi with rice paper.)

757
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:52,676
(The three boy's Ryu-cipes are done.)

758
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:54,978
It's like we're going to a war.

759
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:56,179
Okay, let's go.

760
00:35:57,314 --> 00:36:00,117
(It's finally time
to present their dishes.)

761
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:06,223
(The chef
and the students are all seated.)

762
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:12,696
(The boy's Ryu-cipe dishes are here.)

763
00:36:13,397 --> 00:36:18,435
(Can't seem to hide their nervousness)

764
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:21,805
Where should we place these?

765
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,940
Put it in the middle.

766
00:36:23,707 --> 00:36:26,843
(Even Su Young is nervous.)

767
00:36:26,843 --> 00:36:29,546
I'm sorry for making you wait so long.

768
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,649
(Each dish draws everyone's attention.)

769
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:38,855
(They gave it their all
for the dishes despite the pressure.)

770
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:43,894
(The students observe the dishes
with hawk-like eyes.)

771
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:47,264
What should we start with?

772
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,532
(Gulp)

773
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:51,735
My dish is sweet and spicy chicken.

774
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:54,104
I wanted the meat that's inside
to be flavored with sauce,

775
00:36:54,104 --> 00:36:56,006
so I marinated the blended meat.

776
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:59,843
It's been thoroughly marinated,
all the way to the inside.

777
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:02,980
(Their eyes dart to the dish
after listening to the explanation.)

778
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,682
(Silently analyzing with their eyes)

779
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,619
(Is Su Young looking nervous?)

780
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:09,753
(Hey, Kyung Ho.)

781
00:37:09,753 --> 00:37:10,821
Me?

782
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:12,556
This is the dish I made.

783
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:14,858
It's Stir-fried squid
with sambal and somyeon.

784
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,593
(Prepared the fiery squid bibim-myeon,
upgraded with somyeon and tteok)

785
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:20,130
I used sambal instead of gochujang,

786
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,668
so it's a collaboration
between Brunei and Korea.

787
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:28,772
Please enjoy.

788
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:34,711
I wrapped Korea's beef bulgogi...

789
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,715
with rice paper.

790
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,187
I topped it
with some of the bulgogi sauce...

791
00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:47,658
and mushrooms
that have been cooked in the sauce.

792
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:54,197
(The tension is so thick,
you can barely breathe.)

793
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:56,700
We will step outside while you enjoy.

794
00:37:58,168 --> 00:38:00,137
We'll be back once you've had a taste.

795
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,406
You should have my wraps in one bite.

796
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:03,774
Hurry up.

797
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,778
It's probably uncomfortable for them too
if we stay in there.

798
00:38:07,778 --> 00:38:09,613
- This is better.
- This is better for us too.

799
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:12,449
If we're right there,
they might just say it's good.

800
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:13,984
(Wide open)

801
00:38:13,984 --> 00:38:15,218
Good work.

802
00:38:16,053 --> 00:38:20,924
(No matter the result,
the three boys gave it their all.)

803
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,293
- Should we peek inside?
- Should we?

804
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:26,763
You can see a little bit from here.

805
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:31,068
(No sound,
just a narrow view through the door)

806
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:33,870
(They have started the tasting.)

807
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:40,410
(Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
Ssambul)

808
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:50,387
(They focus on the dish silently.)

809
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:54,157
(A nerve-racking tension
that takes your breath away.)

810
00:38:57,828 --> 00:38:59,162
It's good.

811
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:01,098
It's very good.

812
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:07,638
It tastes Bruneian.

813
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:12,709
(Kihyun's ssambul reminds them
of Bruneian home cooking.)

814
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,645
(It's like a home-cooked meal.)

815
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,079
They're laughing.

816
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,548
Why would they be laughing?

817
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:19,616
Because it's tasty?

818
00:39:19,616 --> 00:39:22,085
Maybe it was just too ridiculous.

819
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:24,121
Maybe they're like, "What is this?"

820
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:26,189
(With no sound,
the details remain a mystery.)

821
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:30,794
The beef is very tender.

822
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:37,601
(The rice paper makes it chewy
and the coconut water enhances the taste.)

823
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:40,404
It seems like they're enjoying yours.

824
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:43,674
The bulgogi was good.

825
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:47,311
The bulgogi tastes wholesome,
like a home-cooked meal.

826
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:49,279
- Thank goodness.
- Nice.

827
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,048
It was tasty.

828
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,687
It's time for the fiery squid bibim-myeon.

829
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,760
(A fusion of Brunei and Korean heat)

830
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:07,197
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe
Fiery Squid Bibim-myeon)

831
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:10,000
(Peeking)

832
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,236
They're mixing the somyeon.

833
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:16,073
They're going for the squid.

834
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:17,074
(Tasting the fiery squid)

835
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:18,642
That has to be good.

836
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:23,080
(Anticipation)

837
00:40:23,947 --> 00:40:25,349
It's spicy.

838
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:27,050
- Spicy?
- Yeah.

839
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:32,689
(Disapproval)

840
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:38,695
So, just one thing, the squid...

841
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:41,932
The squid is slightly overcooked.

842
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:45,168
(Kyung Ho has no clue about this.)

843
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:48,672
(An unexpected comment)

844
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,878
Wow.

845
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:58,515
I love it.

846
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:03,086
(It's okay even if I get sauce on me
because it's so good.)

847
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:05,822
Why?

848
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:08,458
I don't know.

849
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,995
I think out of respect for our food,

850
00:41:11,995 --> 00:41:13,163
they're finishing each dish.

851
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:14,464
It was good though.

852
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:16,967
Even if you want to be respectful,
you can't finish it if it's not good.

853
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:18,802
If it's not good, it shows on your face.

854
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:20,470
They're going for more.

855
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,638
They're eating lots.

856
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:25,709
- They like the noodles.
- They're trying the noodles as is.

857
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:29,012
(Devouring it in a flash)

858
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,717
Something I just had wasn't a squid.

859
00:41:33,717 --> 00:41:35,652
- It's squid.
- It is.

860
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,355
It tastes like rice cake.

861
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:41,892
You're right. It's rice cake.

862
00:41:42,326 --> 00:41:45,696
All the ingredients are good.

863
00:41:45,696 --> 00:41:48,932
(Ears stuck to the door)

864
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:53,637
I'm so curious as to what they're saying.

865
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,272
Should I try to do a voice-over?

866
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,342
They're definitely saying that's good.

867
00:41:58,342 --> 00:41:59,743
Let me get some somyeon.

868
00:42:00,677 --> 00:42:02,112
Did you have it in one bite?

869
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:03,614
- I had it with that.
- Did you?

870
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:07,217
Yum.

871
00:42:09,753 --> 00:42:11,521
It definitely looked like "It's good."

872
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:13,991
(Satisfied)

873
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:16,326
Achoo!

874
00:42:17,094 --> 00:42:20,364
(What was that?)

875
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:21,698
Achoo!

876
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:23,767
Goodness, really?

877
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:25,369
What can I do about sneezing?

878
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:26,803
We told them we'd be somewhere else,

879
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:28,538
but if we keep making noises here,

880
00:42:28,538 --> 00:42:30,173
they'll know that we're watching them.

881
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:32,843
But watching from afar is kind of fun.
There's no pressure.

882
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:36,980
Please lower your voice.

883
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:40,684
If they find out, it'll be super awkward.

884
00:42:42,953 --> 00:42:44,688
Now, it's yours.

885
00:42:45,555 --> 00:42:46,823
I can't look. I'm nervous.

886
00:42:46,823 --> 00:42:48,458
- I won't look.
- You get a better view from here.

887
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,626
- Really?
- Yeah.

888
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:52,629
(Su Young is actually curious too.)

889
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:57,668
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
ISOF Chicken Meatball)

890
00:42:57,668 --> 00:42:58,969
They're cutting a piece.

891
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:02,739
They look really interested.

892
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:04,041
Their eyes are sparkling.

893
00:43:04,675 --> 00:43:07,811
(Me too.)

894
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:15,886
(Impressed! This is crazy.)

895
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:20,424
(Crispy)

896
00:43:22,192 --> 00:43:24,528
(It makes you smile after one bite.)

897
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:26,496
- The texture is good.
- The texture is nice.

898
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,733
The outside is crispy,
and the inside is juicy.

899
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,735
It seems like things are going well.

900
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:33,270
Yeah?

901
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,639
(With the tension gone,
Su Young finally smiles.)

902
00:43:36,106 --> 00:43:38,008
Have you tried this sauce?

903
00:43:39,009 --> 00:43:44,214
(A mysterious sauce
next to the chicken meatball)

904
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:48,719
(Shock)

905
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,922
(What is this sauce?)

906
00:43:55,525 --> 00:43:58,462
(This is insane.)

907
00:43:58,462 --> 00:44:00,230
Su Young,

908
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,133
they just tried the garlic sauce,
and they seem to like it.

909
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:04,334
Yeah? The garlic sauce was good.

910
00:44:04,334 --> 00:44:05,535
They tried it and looked surprised.

911
00:44:05,535 --> 00:44:07,137
Yeah, it got a great reaction.

912
00:44:07,137 --> 00:44:08,872
The sauce? The special sauce?

913
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:13,644
(Su Young's secret kick!
The signature garlic sauce)

914
00:44:13,644 --> 00:44:15,145
It's supposed to be done with pork fat.

915
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,883
You almost deep-fry the garlic
to make it fluffy.

916
00:44:19,883 --> 00:44:22,519
(Signature Garlic Sauce
1. Deep-fry whole garlic cloves.)

917
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:26,256
(2. Mash the fried garlic.)

918
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:28,225
Then, it's good with honey
and sesame seeds.

919
00:44:28,225 --> 00:44:29,793
But I didn't have honey,
so I added Korean starch syrup.

920
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:36,300
(A heavenly combination
of spicy chicken with sweet garlic sauce)

921
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:39,469
You have to eat the chicken
with the garlic sauce.

922
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,839
The garlic sauce is very intense,

923
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,412
but when you eat it with ISOF
chicken meatballs, it gives it life.

924
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:57,120
(The chef and the students
are immersed in the dishes.)

925
00:44:58,021 --> 00:45:02,059
(Completely cleaned all the dishes)

926
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:05,896
(Standing ovation)

927
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:08,966
They're done.

928
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:11,168
(We've cleared the plates.)

929
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:13,337
Thank you. You finished all of it.

930
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:14,404
(Seeing the empty plates,
the three boys finally relax.)

931
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:18,175
Cooking legends.

932
00:45:18,408 --> 00:45:20,577
Thank you.

933
00:45:20,577 --> 00:45:22,579
But there's one thing I must say...

934
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:25,115
about the fiery squid bibim-myeon.

935
00:45:25,115 --> 00:45:31,088
The squid was overcooked.

936
00:45:31,088 --> 00:45:35,359
You cooked it a bit more
because of the ssaltteok.

937
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,263
I had to cook it a bit longer
for the ssaltteok to cook through,

938
00:45:40,263 --> 00:45:42,232
so I think that's why it overcooked.

939
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:46,303
But still, flavor-wise...

940
00:45:46,303 --> 00:45:47,704
It was legendary.

941
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:53,277
It was very hearty and warm.

942
00:45:53,277 --> 00:45:59,149
It felt like I could just sit down
and it this all day.

943
00:45:59,616 --> 00:46:02,119
(Time for Kihyun's Ssambul)

944
00:46:02,419 --> 00:46:06,356
It tastes very similar
to Bruneian flavors.

945
00:46:06,356 --> 00:46:10,294
It's a dish that I want to share it
with my family.

946
00:46:10,294 --> 00:46:13,030
I told you we have similar tastes.

947
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,136
(Lastly, how was Su Young's dish?)

948
00:46:19,336 --> 00:46:21,905
(Su Young is still nervous.)

949
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:24,808
Everything about this dish was perfect.

950
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,614
(All of Su Young's worries
are rewarded in an instant.)

951
00:46:30,614 --> 00:46:32,849
(Good job, Su Young.)

952
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:37,988
(The texture, flavor,
and overall composition were all perfect.)

953
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:40,357
I have nothing to say.

954
00:46:43,994 --> 00:46:48,471
("It was truly fun.
It was a priceless experience for us.")

955
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,667
(- Chef and students)

956
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:54,805
(A perfect and unforgettable
Ryu-cipe cooking in Brunei.)

957
00:46:54,805 --> 00:46:55,806
Hello.

958
00:46:55,806 --> 00:46:57,774
We're more familiar
since it's our second time.

959
00:46:57,774 --> 00:46:59,810
I heard it sold a lot last time.

960
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,778
- It's bigger in scale this time.
- It's big.

961
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:02,813
(This time, it's Brunei's Ryu-cipes.)

962
00:47:02,813 --> 00:47:04,514
This is where they sell the merchandise.

963
00:47:04,514 --> 00:47:06,516
(There's even a cute merch zone.)

964
00:47:06,516 --> 00:47:07,985
We haven't even had breakfast.

965
00:47:07,985 --> 00:47:10,454
- I'm suddenly drooling.
- Let's have one each.

966
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:12,389
It feels wrong to cut a burger.

967
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:14,124
- Right, you shouldn't.
- Yeah, it feels wrong.

968
00:47:14,758 --> 00:47:19,529
(Su Young's Pick
Hot Sambal Mozzarella Chicken Burger)

969
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:23,367
(Immediately goes for it)

970
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:28,772
(Satisfied)

971
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:30,974
Gosh, Su Young, this is insanely good.

972
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:33,543
It's a burger, but you can feel the heat.

973
00:47:33,543 --> 00:47:37,047
It's got cheese sauce, mayonnaise,
and sambal,

974
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:40,717
so I think it's a new style
of a spicy chicken burger.

975
00:47:41,451 --> 00:47:42,919
It was sambal.

976
00:47:42,919 --> 00:47:45,956
The spiciness is unfamiliar,
but it's delicious.

977
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:48,425
This isn't Korean heat.
It's Bruneian heat.

978
00:47:49,293 --> 00:47:50,627
This reminds me of Brunei.

979
00:47:50,627 --> 00:47:51,995
Yes, this is it.

980
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,697
(Come at me, all you spicy maniacs.)

981
00:47:54,231 --> 00:47:57,534
(Double S Fire with hot sambal)

982
00:47:57,534 --> 00:47:58,802
It won't be good if it goes soggy,

983
00:47:58,802 --> 00:48:01,204
so we used capellini,
the angel hair pasta.

984
00:48:01,939 --> 00:48:03,674
- How will this taste?
- So generous.

985
00:48:03,907 --> 00:48:09,146
(The Double S Fire must be had
with the noodles.)

986
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:10,681
It's so good.

987
00:48:11,048 --> 00:48:12,983
- This has to be good.
- Yeah?

988
00:48:13,617 --> 00:48:16,053
It's different from gochujang.
It was made with sambal,

989
00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:17,554
so it really tastes
like you're eating out.

990
00:48:17,554 --> 00:48:20,057
It's totally different
from the usual stir-fried squid.

991
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:23,560
It's exactly like a dish you order
at a restaurant.

992
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:27,297
It's delicious but unfamiliar.

993
00:48:27,297 --> 00:48:28,632
It tastes familiar. It's surreal.

994
00:48:28,632 --> 00:48:30,901
It looks almost exactly
like the one Kihyun made.

995
00:48:31,668 --> 00:48:33,904
My dish is the pandan red bean tteok.

996
00:48:34,938 --> 00:48:36,773
Panda smells so good.

997
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:39,409
(A bite)

998
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,278
This is really good.

999
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:45,382
I can totally taste the pandan.

1000
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:47,451
Kihyun, you should open a tteok place.

1001
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:49,653
Let's open one together in Jongno.

1002
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,588
You must open one.
This is really good.

1003
00:48:51,588 --> 00:48:54,424
You can never go wrong
with Kihyun's dessert.

1004
00:48:55,158 --> 00:48:57,327
You have to eat it with this sauce.

1005
00:48:57,327 --> 00:48:58,729
(Pandan red bean tteok's secret weapon!
Make sure to drizzle the sauce.)

1006
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:00,297
- It's so tasty.
- It's really good.

1007
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:03,200
There's going to be
a lot of people today too, right?

1008
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,436
I feel like the dishes
will sell better this time.

1009
00:49:06,436 --> 00:49:09,640
All the dishes are perfect
for the Korean palate.

1010
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,574
You're right.

1011
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:15,145
(A vast ocean stretches out
before the three boys.)

1012
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:16,847
We've come pretty far already.

1013
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,615
Have we left from there?

1014
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:19,883
Yeah, we have.

1015
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:22,819
- Gosh.
- This is crazy.

1016
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:26,056
How long did it take us to come here?

1017
00:49:26,056 --> 00:49:28,825
It was a 12-hour flight from Korea.

1018
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:30,027
Twelve hours.

1019
00:49:30,027 --> 00:49:32,396
Then, an 11-hour train ride to come here.

1020
00:49:32,863 --> 00:49:35,565
Plus, we have to go
an hour more on this ship.

1021
00:49:35,565 --> 00:49:37,901
Then, two more hours on the train.

1022
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,237
It took us more than a day.

1023
00:49:40,237 --> 00:49:41,605
More than a day.

1024
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:43,140
It was 20-something hours?

1025
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,175
- It was 26 hours.
- We took 26 hours.

1026
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:49,646
We took a plane,
a train, and now, a ship...

1027
00:49:49,646 --> 00:49:52,349
All that to go to Sicily.

1028
00:49:52,683 --> 00:49:54,751
Sicily!

1029
00:49:55,218 --> 00:49:58,488
(The third location of the culinary study
Sicily, Italy)

1030
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:00,958
I saw it earlier, and Sicily is huge.

1031
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:02,893
It was 24,900km² or something.

1032
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:04,528
Then it's almost
as big as one of Korea's provinces.

1033
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:06,063
- Right.
- That's quite big.

1034
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:09,900
We've come to the big toe of the boot.

1035
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,635
The big toe area of the boot.

1036
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:14,171
It's also home to Mount Etna.

1037
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:16,940
Thanks to the fertile soil
from Mount Etna,

1038
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,710
almost all the crops are grown here.

1039
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:23,280
(Abundant ingredients,
thanks to fertile volcanic soil)

1040
00:50:24,548 --> 00:50:28,085
People say Sicily
is the table of paradise.

1041
00:50:28,085 --> 00:50:29,653
("Sicily is the table of paradise.")

1042
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:32,556
Since Sicily lies in a seismic zone,

1043
00:50:32,556 --> 00:50:33,857
the ocean is deep.

1044
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:35,926
There are lots of fish.

1045
00:50:35,926 --> 00:50:37,494
That's what makes it so abundant.

1046
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:41,698
You know the dried pasta we eat?

1047
00:50:41,698 --> 00:50:43,166
Sicily is where dried pasta originated.

1048
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,636
This is the birthplace of pasta,
so we must try some pasta.

1049
00:50:45,636 --> 00:50:47,070
- We should.
- Of course.

1050
00:50:48,605 --> 00:50:51,141
This is the best street food I've had.

1051
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:53,210
- Then we should try some.
- In all of Italy.

1052
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:55,912
Then this itself is Sicily.

1053
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:57,247
Right, it's Sicily.

1054
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:00,817
This is the best.

1055
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:03,520
(Their third culinary adventure in Sicily)

1056
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,088
We have to go learn now.

1057
00:51:05,088 --> 00:51:07,024
- Let's go experience it.
- Right.

1058
00:51:07,024 --> 00:51:08,025
(It's starting now.)

1059
00:51:08,025 --> 00:51:09,760
(But before we dive in...)

1060
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:13,797
(A city in Italy)

1061
00:51:14,564 --> 00:51:18,568
(The three boys have stopped by
before heading to Sicily.)

1062
00:51:19,303 --> 00:51:23,974
(A city flowing with romance and art)

1063
00:51:24,574 --> 00:51:29,046
(Kihyun is alone somewhere.)

1064
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:30,714
Kihyun.

1065
00:51:30,714 --> 00:51:32,449
- Su Young.
- How have you been?

1066
00:51:32,582 --> 00:51:33,650
What were you doing?

1067
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,118
- Did you get some sleep?
- I was waiting for you.

1068
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:36,453
You're okay?

1069
00:51:36,453 --> 00:51:37,654
(The three boys reunite with joy,
as if it's been ages.)

1070
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:40,958
(So happy to see each other,
they even shout a chant.)

1071
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:42,326
Have a seat.

1072
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:43,327
How was it?

1073
00:51:43,327 --> 00:51:45,028
- Where did you go?
- Us?

1074
00:51:45,028 --> 00:51:46,964
- Everywhere.
- Everywhere?

1075
00:51:46,964 --> 00:51:48,231
Everywhere.

1076
00:51:48,465 --> 00:51:49,833
This is Rome, huh?

1077
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:51,635
(Rome)

1078
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:55,339
(Italy's capital city, Rome)

1079
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:58,175
(An empire of civilization...)

1080
00:51:58,175 --> 00:52:00,243
(With a thousand years of history)

1081
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:02,379
(An empire of gastronomy...)

1082
00:52:02,379 --> 00:52:04,414
(Rooted in centuries of tradition)

1083
00:52:04,815 --> 00:52:07,184
(The birthplace of carbonara)

1084
00:52:07,651 --> 00:52:09,553
(The birthplace of wood-fired pizza)

1085
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,822
(the birthplace of gelato)

1086
00:52:12,122 --> 00:52:14,024
(The birthplace of espresso)

1087
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,097
(The three boys have landed
in the culinary capital.)

1088
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:21,999
We have to go this way.

1089
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:23,133
You say one thing but do another.

1090
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:24,901
No, since we have to go around like this.

1091
00:52:25,202 --> 00:52:27,838
- Was it 15 years ago?
- Yeah.

1092
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,308
Right now, Mr. Eo is lost
in the memories of 15 years ago.

1093
00:52:31,308 --> 00:52:32,442
- That's true.
- Yes.

1094
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:34,978
I'm feeling a bit emotional.
I was here when I was young,

1095
00:52:34,978 --> 00:52:36,613
and I've been wanting to return
ever since.

1096
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:38,815
Lost in memories?

1097
00:52:38,815 --> 00:52:40,417
If it was a food,

1098
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:43,053
It'd be like,
"There was something this delicious?"

1099
00:52:43,053 --> 00:52:44,655
- Something like that.
- Right.

1100
00:52:44,655 --> 00:52:47,457
It's like having jajangmyeon
(black bean noodles) after 15 years.

1101
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:49,259
"It tastes the same." Like that.

1102
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,863
(Su Young and Kyung Ho
are on the road to somewhere.)

1103
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:56,266
Hey, baby. I'm in Rome right now.

1104
00:52:56,867 --> 00:52:58,936
Hello there.
It's nice to finally see you.

1105
00:52:58,936 --> 00:53:01,104
I'm an uncle who works with your dad.

1106
00:53:01,538 --> 00:53:03,490
He's a specialist in colorectal surgery.

1107
00:53:03,491 --> 00:53:04,141
(Joking)

1108
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:05,575
You're not sick or anything, are you?

1109
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:06,810
(Kyung Ho's Dr. Yu Rim again?)

1110
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,679
Okay, you can talk to your dad now.

1111
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:10,147
(After a happy phone call,
where have they arrived?)

1112
00:53:11,214 --> 00:53:13,450
(Visiting a hidden gem in Rome
known only to locals)

1113
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,818
There's no phone number.

1114
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:18,455
This really must be a hidden foodie place
for the locals.

1115
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:21,458
(When in Rome, eat Roman food.)

1116
00:53:24,795 --> 00:53:28,298
(Su Young's face says it all.)

1117
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:33,136
(A flavor that makes your eyes sparkle)

1118
00:53:33,403 --> 00:53:35,138
They're good.

1119
00:53:35,138 --> 00:53:36,640
- It's good.
- Yum.

1120
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,542
It's really good.

1121
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:40,043
So delicious.

1122
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:46,149
(Then, we must go in for another bite.)

1123
00:53:46,316 --> 00:53:49,453
All that cheese powder on top
adds another layer of charm.

1124
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,922
You need to have good food.

1125
00:53:51,922 --> 00:53:53,523
The atmosphere is nice too.

1126
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:56,259
(Another place they visited
before meeting up with Kihyun)

1127
00:53:56,259 --> 00:53:59,963
So this is medieval Europe.

1128
00:53:59,963 --> 00:54:01,365
(St. Peter's Basilica,
the heart of the Catholic world)

1129
00:54:02,399 --> 00:54:05,168
(A place where Renaissance art lives on)

1130
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:08,338
Goodness.

1131
00:54:09,606 --> 00:54:14,544
(A sacred place where
the spirit of the Renaissance resides)

1132
00:54:15,078 --> 00:54:19,249
(An unbelievable sight
unfolds before their eyes.)

1133
00:54:19,816 --> 00:54:21,685
Nothing has changed
to the point that it's shocking.

1134
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:24,021
Even the atmosphere and all.
Nothing has changed.

1135
00:54:25,188 --> 00:54:27,524
We're at 20,000 steps and counting.

1136
00:54:27,524 --> 00:54:28,825
We've all hit 20,000 steps.

1137
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,429
The most renowned city
for over a thousand years.

1138
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:34,798
This is insane.

1139
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:37,334
It's so magnificent
that it's making me speechless.

1140
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:39,503
This is my first time,
and it's crazy.

1141
00:54:40,704 --> 00:54:42,639
(Must take a selfie here)

1142
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:45,842
(In Rome,
the third culinary study location.jpg)

1143
00:54:46,643 --> 00:54:51,081
(Even records a Reel while at it)

1144
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:54,184
Everywhere you look,
there's a historical site.

1145
00:54:55,052 --> 00:54:55,628
(Vittorio Emanuele II Monument /
A symbolic space for Italy)

1146
00:54:55,629 --> 00:54:57,354
(For history and identity, also known as
the Altar of the Fatherland)

1147
00:54:57,354 --> 00:54:58,689
Incredible, right?

1148
00:54:59,823 --> 00:55:02,459
It just leaves me in awe.

1149
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:08,632
(Kihyun spent the whole day
exploring around Rome.)

1150
00:55:08,966 --> 00:55:12,102
A traditional restaurant in Rome.

1151
00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:13,170
Like a local meal?

1152
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:14,204
Right.

1153
00:55:14,204 --> 00:55:17,240
They said Italy also doesn't use sugar
like Portugal.

1154
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,610
But it's so light and clean.
It's delicious.

1155
00:55:20,544 --> 00:55:22,980
They're cooking behind you right now.

1156
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,514
I also see stoves.

1157
00:55:24,514 --> 00:55:26,450
There are stoves inside over there.

1158
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,885
- It's a wood-fired oven.
- Look at the fire.

1159
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:31,722
Watching the fire like that
makes it look so delicious.

1160
00:55:31,722 --> 00:55:32,990
(The soul of Italy, pizza)

1161
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,726
What I recommend is...

1162
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:36,860
We should get a pizza per person.

1163
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,695
- A pizza for each?
- Yes. It's like that here.

1164
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:40,263
All right. Then, one pizza each.

1165
00:55:40,263 --> 00:55:42,265
I asked for their recommendation
and ordered three pizzas.

1166
00:55:42,265 --> 00:55:44,368
Okay, let's try some pizza
since we're in Italy.

1167
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:48,071
(Italy, the original home of pizza)

1168
00:55:48,272 --> 00:55:52,276
(Italy has been eating pizza
for thousands of years.)

1169
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:57,347
(Rather than flashy toppings,
it stays true to the basics.)

1170
00:55:57,681 --> 00:56:00,094
(From Rome to Naples to Milan)

1171
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:03,954
(Each city has
its own unique style and flavor.)

1172
00:56:04,221 --> 00:56:09,660
(Roman-style pizza is known for
its ultra-thin, crispy crust.)

1173
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:13,897
(A traditional Roman pizzeria
with over 100 years of history)

1174
00:56:14,498 --> 00:56:19,937
(Out of a variety of pizzas,
which ones will the three taste?)

1175
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:24,474
(The pizzas arrive
as they finish talking.)

1176
00:56:24,474 --> 00:56:26,209
(It looks delicious.)

1177
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:28,111
Let's dig in.

1178
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,815
(It's really one pizza per person.)

1179
00:56:32,115 --> 00:56:36,720
(A pizza with 100 years of tradition)

1180
00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:40,557
(Simple, yet on another level,
a pizza that lets the ingredients shine.)

1181
00:56:40,557 --> 00:56:42,292
I feel like we should try this one first.

1182
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:43,827
Yeah, let's do that.

1183
00:56:43,827 --> 00:56:45,162
Insane.

1184
00:56:45,696 --> 00:56:46,897
Totally insane.

1185
00:56:46,897 --> 00:56:48,799
(Which one will they try first?)

1186
00:56:51,068 --> 00:56:53,704
(Light and fragrant arugula
with the boldness of Parmesan)

1187
00:56:54,438 --> 00:56:57,407
(The salty and savory bresaola
(cured beef tenderloin) adds flavor.)

1188
00:56:57,541 --> 00:57:01,078
(Arugula Pizza)

1189
00:57:01,078 --> 00:57:02,312
Let's try it.

1190
00:57:04,948 --> 00:57:07,517
They've dumped arugula on this.
I love it.

1191
00:57:07,918 --> 00:57:09,386
There's no egg here though.

1192
00:57:18,695 --> 00:57:20,964
It's good. It's so good.

1193
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:22,866
That wood-fired oven taste is so nice.

1194
00:57:24,501 --> 00:57:27,404
Bresaola, arugula, Parmigiano Reggiano.

1195
00:57:27,404 --> 00:57:30,907
So they didn't use mozzarella.
They used Parmigiano Reggiano.

1196
00:57:30,907 --> 00:57:33,877
Parmigiano Reggiano.

1197
00:57:33,877 --> 00:57:35,512
Parmesan.

1198
00:57:35,512 --> 00:57:38,048
The cheese I sprinkled
on the mushroom burger.

1199
00:57:38,048 --> 00:57:39,583
(It's the cheese Su Young used
for his Ryu-cipe in Porto.)

1200
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,086
So this is what that cheese taste like
just sprinkled on.

1201
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:45,088
- It's good.
- Very delicious.

1202
00:57:45,088 --> 00:57:49,092
I've always had Parmesan as a powder,
but having it like this...

1203
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:50,861
make it much more intense.

1204
00:57:51,795 --> 00:57:55,966
(Unlike other pizzas
that use mozzarella cheese...)

1205
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:59,536
(They just cook the dough
in the wood-fired oven.)

1206
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:03,340
(Then, they use pieces of Parmesan
instead of a powder for a deeper flavor.)

1207
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:08,679
(Arugula pizza
that lets the ingredients shine.)

1208
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:11,281
But why is Parmigiano Reggiano
called Parmesan?

1209
00:58:11,281 --> 00:58:14,885
It means it's cheese from a place called
Parmigiano Reggiano.

1210
00:58:14,885 --> 00:58:16,620
(Random knowledge unlocked!)

1211
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,488
That's why it's called Parmesan.

1212
00:58:18,855 --> 00:58:21,258
I thought it was from a place
called Parme.

1213
00:58:21,258 --> 00:58:25,095
Since in Korean, "san" is used
for the place of origin,

1214
00:58:25,395 --> 00:58:27,230
so I thought it was from Parme.

1215
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,332
A place called Parme.

1216
00:58:28,332 --> 00:58:30,033
- The place of origin.
- Yes.

1217
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:32,336
Chungbuk"san," Boryeong"san,"

1218
00:58:32,336 --> 00:58:33,971
Incheon"san,"

1219
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:35,906
and Jeju"san," you know?

1220
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,308
I really like arugula.

1221
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:40,377
(A bite)

1222
00:58:40,377 --> 00:58:42,546
(Second bite)

1223
00:58:42,546 --> 00:58:43,880
(Third bite)

1224
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,350
(Immediately goes for three bites)

1225
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,751
The arugula is seriously...

1226
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:48,986
(Only eating the arugula now)

1227
00:58:48,986 --> 00:58:50,287
Gosh.

1228
00:58:50,287 --> 00:58:52,990
The aroma is much more intense
compared to the ones in Korea.

1229
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,091
It is.

1230
00:58:54,091 --> 00:58:55,592
It's almost bitter,

1231
00:58:55,592 --> 00:58:57,227
but it goes so well with this Parmesan.

1232
00:58:58,528 --> 00:58:59,663
It's good.

1233
00:58:59,663 --> 00:59:01,231
(A perfect pairing of arugula and cheese)

1234
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:02,966
This pizza is new.

1235
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,768
It's a new kind of pizza.

1236
00:59:04,768 --> 00:59:06,036
There's an egg on it.

1237
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:11,008
(There's an egg on the pizza?)

1238
00:59:12,209 --> 00:59:14,711
(Add some tomato sauce to the dough.)

1239
00:59:15,912 --> 00:59:19,149
(Add mozzarella and button mushrooms)

1240
00:59:20,117 --> 00:59:23,453
(Crack open a raw egg on the pizza.)

1241
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:28,492
(Then cook it in a wood-fired oven.)

1242
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:32,729
(Capricciosa Pizza)

1243
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,965
I'll try the side with the egg.

1244
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,203
(How will it taste?)

1245
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,873
The egg is really delicious.

1246
00:59:43,373 --> 00:59:44,574
It's so harmonious.

1247
00:59:44,574 --> 00:59:45,876
It's super clean.

1248
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,278
Dipping it in the runny egg...

1249
00:59:48,278 --> 00:59:50,247
makes it taste like...

1250
00:59:50,247 --> 00:59:52,049
I'm dipping it in a cream sauce.

1251
00:59:52,616 --> 00:59:54,751
- Since the runny yolk pops out...
- It's pretty good.

1252
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,087
This is so nice.

1253
00:59:57,087 --> 00:59:59,089
It's like the fried egg you get...

1254
00:59:59,089 --> 01:00:01,725
when you order ganjajang
(stir-fried black bean sauce).

1255
01:00:01,725 --> 01:00:03,994
It has that feel.

1256
01:00:04,428 --> 01:00:06,863
The artichoke's doing all the magic.

1257
01:00:08,932 --> 01:00:10,133
It's an unfamiliar ingredient
for us, but...

1258
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:12,369
- It wasn't cabbage. It was artichoke.
- Yeah.

1259
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:16,173
(Artichoke / A bud-shaped vegetable
with a nutty flavor and subtle sweetness)

1260
01:00:16,173 --> 01:00:18,208
Very interesting, right?

1261
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:20,777
Artichoke is a loved ingredient...

1262
01:00:20,777 --> 01:00:22,312
in the States or Europe,

1263
01:00:22,312 --> 01:00:23,780
but it's still unfamiliar to us.

1264
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,415
(A well-loved ingredient
across America and Europe)

1265
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,618
So this is what artichoke tastes like.

1266
01:00:29,052 --> 01:00:31,088
A pizza with fried egg,

1267
01:00:31,922 --> 01:00:36,860
artichoke, sauce, and meat all together...

1268
01:00:37,661 --> 01:00:39,896
tastes like
something I've never had before.

1269
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,666
(An egg on top of a pizza)

1270
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:46,036
(Familiar flavors,
with a twist of surprise)

1271
01:00:46,036 --> 01:00:47,537
Are these two the same?

1272
01:00:47,537 --> 01:00:48,572
No, they're different.

1273
01:00:48,572 --> 01:00:50,574
They're similar,

1274
01:00:50,574 --> 01:00:53,277
but one has bell peppers
and one doesn't.

1275
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:56,313
(The third pizza looks similar
to the Capricciosa.)

1276
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:02,386
(In addition to the egg and artichoke,
bell peppers and onions were added.)

1277
01:01:02,753 --> 01:01:06,890
(Baffetto Pizza)

1278
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:09,593
One with bell peppers
and one without.

1279
01:01:09,593 --> 01:01:12,696
(A version without bell peppers /
A version with bell peppers)

1280
01:01:19,036 --> 01:01:22,639
The bell pepper and onion in this one
makes it super familiar.

1281
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:24,274
- Yeah?
- It's a taste that we know.

1282
01:01:24,274 --> 01:01:25,609
I'm getting excited.

1283
01:01:26,043 --> 01:01:28,478
(Super excited)

1284
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:36,586
It does taste familiar.

1285
01:01:36,586 --> 01:01:37,621
It's a taste that I know.

1286
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:39,089
Right?

1287
01:01:39,523 --> 01:01:44,094
(A familiar flavor,
completed with onions and bell peppers.)

1288
01:01:44,094 --> 01:01:46,430
The pizzas aren't super fancy.

1289
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:48,398
It just feels like a humble,
everyday dish.

1290
01:01:48,732 --> 01:01:50,567
It's kind of similar...

1291
01:01:50,567 --> 01:01:53,236
to us eating a bowl of gukbap (rice soup).

1292
01:01:54,004 --> 01:01:55,105
Italy's gukbap.

1293
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:56,607
Yeah, it's like gukbap.

1294
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:00,544
It's a dish I've had many times in Korea,

1295
01:02:00,544 --> 01:02:01,979
- so it's easy.
- It is.

1296
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:04,214
I guess this is why
early education is so important.

1297
01:02:05,115 --> 01:02:07,985
Yeah, the dish feels more familiar
because I've had this a lot.

1298
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:10,887
- Must experience things early on.
- Totally.

1299
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:14,658
Hey, but doesn't it really feel like
we're in Italy now that we had pizza?

1300
01:02:14,658 --> 01:02:15,692
Yeah.

1301
01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:18,729
It's so nice, so it's sad to think
that we have to leave right away.

1302
01:02:18,729 --> 01:02:19,830
(Bummer)

1303
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,131
- Right?
- Yeah.

1304
01:02:21,131 --> 01:02:22,766
Where are we going tomorrow?

1305
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,635
- Sicily.
- Sicily.

1306
01:02:24,635 --> 01:02:27,070
They say it has everything from Italy.

1307
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:28,739
It's the fridge of Italy.

1308
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:32,209
That's where Italians grab it from to eat,

1309
01:02:32,209 --> 01:02:33,510
but we're going inside the fridge.

1310
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,512
- Exactly.
- How fresh will that be?

1311
01:02:37,047 --> 01:02:38,649
We have five minutes until we open.

1312
01:02:38,649 --> 01:02:39,216
(5 minutes left)

1313
01:02:39,216 --> 01:02:42,986
How long was the bread baked for
in 200 degrees?

1314
01:02:43,487 --> 01:02:44,655
In 200 degrees...

1315
01:02:44,655 --> 01:02:45,756
About a minute and thirty seconds.

1316
01:02:45,756 --> 01:02:47,724
- Kyung Ho, you should prepare yours.
- Yeah?

1317
01:02:47,724 --> 01:02:49,326
Doing it yourself is important too, so...

1318
01:02:50,294 --> 01:02:53,830
Man, Su Young interferes like crazy.

1319
01:02:55,332 --> 01:02:57,034
Is that how you succeed?

1320
01:02:57,034 --> 01:02:58,201
(The Eo Nam Seon sniper mode is on
and is zeroing in on him.)

1321
01:02:58,201 --> 01:02:59,770
Does he have to take it that far?

1322
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,705
So, 200g of sugar?

1323
01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:04,975
If you do 200g each for the three bottles,
it should be okay for the sauce.

1324
01:03:06,243 --> 01:03:08,879
- Six hundred people.
- Six hundred people...

1325
01:03:09,346 --> 01:03:11,081
One person is in charge of 200 people.

1326
01:03:11,081 --> 01:03:12,716
Kyung Ho, all the boxes
are prepared behind you.

1327
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:14,051
All right. Let's go.

1328
01:03:14,985 --> 01:03:17,020
(Good luck)

1329
01:03:19,389 --> 01:03:21,124
(The pop-up is open.)

1330
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:22,426
(Awkward chuckles
at the insane amount of people)

1331
01:03:22,426 --> 01:03:23,493
Goodness.

1332
01:03:23,493 --> 01:03:25,295
Where did all these people come from?

1333
01:03:25,295 --> 01:03:26,330
Gosh.

1334
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:27,564
(The crowd has filled
both sides of the pop-up.)

1335
01:03:27,564 --> 01:03:28,732
There are more over there.

1336
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:31,501
So many people came today.

1337
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:33,003
Hello.

1338
01:03:33,937 --> 01:03:35,739
Be careful.

1339
01:03:37,274 --> 01:03:38,408
What?

1340
01:03:39,643 --> 01:03:41,912
Hey, what brings you here?

1341
01:03:41,912 --> 01:03:43,847
- I'm here with my mom.
- Really?

1342
01:03:43,847 --> 01:03:45,682
Su Young, we served
in the military together.

1343
01:03:46,249 --> 01:03:47,484
He came to visit me today.

1344
01:03:47,484 --> 01:03:48,518
Hello.

1345
01:03:48,518 --> 01:03:49,953
- Nice to meet you.
- We served together.

1346
01:03:49,953 --> 01:03:52,255
Really? In the military?

1347
01:03:52,255 --> 01:03:54,124
Man, that's true friendship.

1348
01:03:54,124 --> 01:03:55,292
Hey, thanks.

1349
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:56,893
- What did you buy?
- This one.

1350
01:03:57,227 --> 01:03:58,762
Enjoy it. It's really good.

1351
01:03:58,762 --> 01:04:01,231
Good luck.

1352
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:03,400
(An unexpected encounter
gives Kihyun a boost of strength.)

1353
01:04:03,433 --> 01:04:05,269
It smells so good.

1354
01:04:05,969 --> 01:04:07,204
It smells so nice.

1355
01:04:07,638 --> 01:04:11,975
(Hot Sambal Double S Fire Capellini makes
your mouth water with its spicy aroma.)

1356
01:04:12,175 --> 01:04:15,912
If you go with this set,
you'll have no regrets.

1357
01:04:15,912 --> 01:04:19,182
First, eat the burger made by Su Young,

1358
01:04:19,182 --> 01:04:20,984
then balance that richness...

1359
01:04:20,984 --> 01:04:23,253
with this Double S Fire Capellini,

1360
01:04:23,253 --> 01:04:26,089
and finish it off
with Kihyun's pandan red bean tteok.

1361
01:04:26,089 --> 01:04:27,424
It's going to be amazing.

1362
01:04:29,393 --> 01:04:30,360
(Glancing)

1363
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,862
(Tossed aside)

1364
01:04:31,862 --> 01:04:34,064
- The pandan is good, right?
- Yeah.

1365
01:04:34,064 --> 01:04:35,699
We were surprised too.

1366
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:37,334
It's better when you have it cold.

1367
01:04:37,334 --> 01:04:38,368
We need those noodles.

1368
01:04:38,368 --> 01:04:39,836
We're out of the noodles.

1369
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:41,905
Kyung Ho, you need to hurry.

(Startled)

1371
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:45,042
We need those noodles.

1372
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:47,477
Your dish must be selling like crazy.

1373
01:04:47,477 --> 01:04:49,046

(Delivery complete)

1375
01:04:50,314 --> 01:04:52,449
Kyung Ho, your Double S Fire Capellini
is selling very well.

1376
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:54,685
I knew my dish
would be the most-selling one.

1377
01:04:54,685 --> 01:04:57,587
Of course, it can't beat the pandan tteok,
but it's selling well.

(Kyung Ho whisperer, Eo Nam Seon)

Kyung Ho, take a break.

1380
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:03,794
(Ryu-GPT goes in.)

1381
01:05:03,794 --> 01:05:05,062
Insane.

1382
01:05:05,529 --> 01:05:06,964
Yes, enjoy.

1383
01:05:06,964 --> 01:05:10,601
(It doesn't matter what dish.)

1384
01:05:10,601 --> 01:05:13,604
(When Ryu-GPT lays his hands on them...)

1385
01:05:13,604 --> 01:05:15,472
(Double S Fire Capellini cleared!)

1386
01:05:16,406 --> 01:05:18,275
Hello. Welcome.

1387
01:05:18,275 --> 01:05:19,376
You're here to see me.

1388
01:05:19,376 --> 01:05:21,345
Of course, you're so handsome.

1389
01:05:21,345 --> 01:05:22,446
Thank you.

1390
01:05:22,446 --> 01:05:23,513
(Laughing out loud)

1391
01:05:23,513 --> 01:05:25,482
Eat them in order from the top,

1392
01:05:25,482 --> 01:05:26,850
but don't get mad at us
even if it's too spicy.

1393
01:05:30,487 --> 01:05:32,356
(No words needed)

1394
01:05:32,356 --> 01:05:33,857
(I'm the sales king of this area.)

1395
01:05:33,857 --> 01:05:35,425
I know.

1396
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:37,194
One burger and one tteok, please.

1397
01:05:37,194 --> 01:05:38,261
One burger and one tteok.

1398
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:41,999
(The hot sambal mozzarella
chicken burger order keeps pouring in.)

1399
01:05:42,232 --> 01:05:45,168
Kihyun, we need those burgers fast.

1400
01:05:45,168 --> 01:05:46,303
- Which one?
- The burger.

1401
01:05:46,303 --> 01:05:47,471
The burger?

1402
01:05:47,471 --> 01:05:49,940
I'll do it.

1403
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:53,410
(Ryu-GPT appears whenever you need him.)

1404
01:05:54,611 --> 01:05:55,946
(Impeccable)

1405
01:05:56,246 --> 01:05:58,148
(A flood of people continues
to pour into the pop-up.)

1406
01:05:58,749 --> 01:06:01,218
(Which dish is their top pick?)

1407
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:06,923
I came today because I really
wanted to try the burger and tteok.

1408
01:06:06,923 --> 01:06:08,458
It smells so good,

1409
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:11,395
so I'm most looking forward
to the Double S Fire Capellini.

1410
01:06:11,395 --> 01:06:14,064
It's my first time trying pandan,

1411
01:06:14,064 --> 01:06:15,699
so I'm curious about the pandan tteok.

1412
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:17,801
We ordered all three and had them all.

1413
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:19,569
Our top choice...

1414
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:20,604
was the burger.

1415
01:06:20,604 --> 01:06:22,472
The burger was the most delicious.

1416
01:06:22,472 --> 01:06:24,541
There was a lot of cheese,

1417
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:26,343
but the sauce was spicy,

1418
01:06:26,343 --> 01:06:28,412
so it balanced out well. It was so good.

1419
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:29,947
(Brunei pop-up)

1420
01:06:29,947 --> 01:06:31,348
(The top pick)

1421
01:06:31,348 --> 01:06:36,687
(The recipe for the hot sambal mozzarella
chicken burger is revealed now.)

1422
01:06:36,687 --> 01:06:40,357
The most memorable was the sambal
made by the local chef.

1423
01:06:40,357 --> 01:06:42,025
That's why I made...

1424
01:06:42,025 --> 01:06:43,226
the hot sambal mozzarella chicken burger.

1425
01:06:43,226 --> 01:06:44,294
It was good.

1426
01:06:44,294 --> 01:06:46,964
It's a chicken burger,
so what do we need?

1427
01:06:46,964 --> 01:06:48,298
We need chicken.

1428
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:50,901
The breast meat is okay too.

1429
01:06:50,901 --> 01:06:52,102
Just choose the one you want.

1430
01:06:53,503 --> 01:06:54,371
(Huh?)

1431
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:56,239
There's a camera here.

1432
01:06:56,239 --> 01:06:57,708
(Putting the onion back)

1433
01:06:57,708 --> 01:07:00,277
The onion has been added.
How interesting.

1434
01:07:00,544 --> 01:07:03,947
You can see what's inside the fridge
by using your phone.

1435
01:07:03,947 --> 01:07:05,115
(Check fridge inventory with a phone.)

1436
01:07:05,115 --> 01:07:06,850
I think it's very handy
when grocery shopping.

1437
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:07,851
Pork.

1438
01:07:07,851 --> 01:07:10,053
(Customized recipes
based on what you have)

1439
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:11,388
Scallion.

1440
01:07:11,388 --> 01:07:12,456
Recipe search.

1441
01:07:13,323 --> 01:07:16,493
(Listening to the recipe
instead of reading it)

1442
01:07:16,493 --> 01:07:18,629
(A complete guide
for the newbies in cooking)

1443
01:07:18,629 --> 01:07:19,763
All right.

1444
01:07:20,497 --> 01:07:22,065
First,

1445
01:07:22,065 --> 01:07:25,669
we're going to make the sauce
and brine the chicken.

1446
01:07:26,536 --> 01:07:27,671
(Brining Sauce for Chicken)

1447
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:29,640
Just add a handful of garlic.

1448
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,542
(1. Chop 10 peppers, some garlic,
1 ginger, 1/2 of onion.)

1449
01:07:32,943 --> 01:07:35,479
(2. Blend them in a blender.)

1450
01:07:35,779 --> 01:07:38,081
You need to be able to see the peppers.

1451
01:07:38,482 --> 01:07:40,884
(Roughly blend for texture.)

1452
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:42,452
Rinse it with water.

1453
01:07:42,452 --> 01:07:44,087
The chicken breast will be easier to cook.

1454
01:07:44,488 --> 01:07:46,523
Poke some holes in it with a fork.

1455
01:07:47,157 --> 01:07:50,527
Now, just pour the sauce in here.

1456
01:07:50,861 --> 01:07:52,929
It may seem simple,
but it will do you wonders.

1457
01:07:52,929 --> 01:07:54,564
Do this and...

1458
01:07:54,564 --> 01:07:55,899
(A tap with the back of your hand)

1459
01:07:55,899 --> 01:07:56,600
(Gentle)

1460
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,201
Not touching the fridge is convenient.

1461
01:07:58,702 --> 01:08:02,172
Having it the next day
will taste the best.

1462
01:08:02,506 --> 01:08:04,508
We just have to make the sambal now.

1463
01:08:04,508 --> 01:08:05,575
There's nothing much to it.

1464
01:08:05,742 --> 01:08:08,412
Let's say if this is two,
you need one of oil.

1465
01:08:09,613 --> 01:08:11,949
(1. Fry it in a 2:1 ratio
of oil to sauce.)

1466
01:08:11,949 --> 01:08:13,050
Add it together.

1467
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:15,619
(1. Fry it in a 2:1 ratio
of oil to sauce.)

1468
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:17,354
I'm adding about a teaspoon of salt.

1469
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:19,323
Add about two tablespoons of sugar.

1470
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:21,058
A half a tablespoon of vinegar.

1471
01:08:21,525 --> 01:08:23,193
To this, just add red pepper powder.

1472
01:08:23,193 --> 01:08:24,494
Let's add about four tablespoons.

1473
01:08:24,895 --> 01:08:27,731
All the moisture is gone,
and it's only the oil boiling.

1474
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:30,834
The chef said to wait
until the color turns slightly darker.

1475
01:08:30,834 --> 01:08:32,302
But the smell...

1476
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:33,937
You will instinctively know
from the smell...

1477
01:08:33,937 --> 01:08:35,706
because it's going to smell nice.

1478
01:08:36,773 --> 01:08:38,542
Yes, it looks like it now.

1479
01:08:38,542 --> 01:08:40,010
It smells like Brunei.

1480
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,411
Now, we need to pickle some cucumber.

1481
01:08:41,778 --> 01:08:43,547
(1. Chop the cucumber
into bite-sized pieces.)

1482
01:08:43,547 --> 01:08:46,316
(2. Add sugar and salt with 2:1 ratio,
1/2T of salt.)

1483
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,051
That will pickle quickly.

1484
01:08:49,453 --> 01:08:51,688
You need to get the moisture out
so that it's crunchy.

1485
01:08:52,756 --> 01:08:54,524
We just need to cook the chicken now.

1486
01:08:54,758 --> 01:08:57,327
Make sure there's enough oil.

1487
01:08:57,327 --> 01:08:58,929
You sort of need to fry it.

1488
01:08:59,563 --> 01:09:01,531
(Don't touch it too much
so that it keeps the shape.)

1489
01:09:03,133 --> 01:09:07,204
(Make sure it's crispy
all the way through.)

1490
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:09,439
Surprisingly, it's almost done.

1491
01:09:12,509 --> 01:09:15,679
The color looks fantastic.

1492
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,116
Everything's done. Now what?

1493
01:09:19,116 --> 01:09:20,450
Assemble the burger.

1494
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:22,552
When you add some mayonnaise to the bread,

1495
01:09:22,552 --> 01:09:24,254
it will enhance the flavor.

1496
01:09:24,821 --> 01:09:27,758
Plus, this kind of chicken sauce
goes well with mayonnaise.

1497
01:09:27,758 --> 01:09:29,660
Just a small dollop.

1498
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,162
Then, the bread doesn't go soggy.

1499
01:09:32,696 --> 01:09:34,631
The mayonnaise is oil, right?

1500
01:09:34,631 --> 01:09:36,133
It coats it.

1501
01:09:36,767 --> 01:09:38,802
Now, just do what feels good to you.

1502
01:09:38,802 --> 01:09:40,203
There's no answer.

1503
01:09:40,904 --> 01:09:42,372
Add a generous amount of cucumbers.

1504
01:09:43,774 --> 01:09:45,075
Add the chicken.

1505
01:09:46,443 --> 01:09:47,644
Then, the cheese.

1506
01:09:47,644 --> 01:09:50,614
(The savory cheese
makes the burger look tasty.)

1507
01:09:50,614 --> 01:09:54,184
You cannot go wrong
with this combination.

1508
01:09:54,184 --> 01:09:55,385
Look at that.

1509
01:09:55,385 --> 01:09:57,487
Now, add some sambal.

1510
01:09:58,355 --> 01:09:59,556
It's done.

1511
01:09:59,756 --> 01:10:02,459
Pop on the bread,

1512
01:10:03,694 --> 01:10:05,262
and you're done.

1513
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:08,198
A chicken cheeseburger with sambal.

1514
01:10:09,299 --> 01:10:11,735
(The three boys are in Sicily.)

1515
01:10:12,636 --> 01:10:16,707
(The table of paradise)

1516
01:10:18,442 --> 01:10:20,377
(The three boys are intoxicated
by the freshness.)

1517
01:10:20,377 --> 01:10:21,979
This one's the best.

1518
01:10:21,979 --> 01:10:22,913
This looks good.

1519
01:10:22,913 --> 01:10:25,749
(Their big eater mode is on.)

1520
01:10:25,749 --> 01:10:28,085
(They eat and eat.)

1521
01:10:28,352 --> 01:10:30,320
(Your body instantly reacts
to Sicilian flavors.)

1522
01:10:30,687 --> 01:10:33,056
(There's more.)

1523
01:10:33,056 --> 01:10:34,725
It's so interesting
how they have rice balls here.

1524
01:10:34,725 --> 01:10:37,027
(Italy's rice ball, arancino)

1525
01:10:38,528 --> 01:10:41,398
It's so delicious.

1526
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:45,235
(Today, we're all rivals
for the arancino battle.)

1527
01:10:45,235 --> 01:10:47,404
(Kihyun VS Su Young VS Kyung Ho)

1528
01:10:48,005 --> 01:10:49,873
(Burning with competitive spirit!)

1529
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,809
(A surprise twist from the youngest?)

1530
01:10:52,809 --> 01:10:54,211
Looks like my cooking skills leveled up.

1531
01:10:54,211 --> 01:10:55,646
You've gone to that level now?

1532
01:10:55,646 --> 01:10:57,314
I'm screwed. What should I do?

1533
01:10:58,015 --> 01:11:00,150
(The fall of the champion?)

1534
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,485
Bad food is my biggest fear.

1535
01:11:01,652 --> 01:11:03,320
Get ready! I'll save you.

1536
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,289
I'm Eo Nam Seon!

1537
01:11:05,622 --> 01:11:07,824
(Or a surprise win for the Cooking Fairy?)

1538
01:11:08,058 --> 01:11:10,227
(Unexpected)

1539
01:11:10,227 --> 01:11:12,429
(Who will be the winner?)

1540
01:11:12,429 --> 01:11:14,264
A culinary study abroad?

1541
01:11:14,865 --> 01:11:16,099
No big deal.

1542
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:19,169
You wanted to taste the Ryu-cipes, right?

1543
01:11:19,169 --> 01:11:22,105
The three boys will go to you.

1544
01:11:22,105 --> 01:11:25,609
It's a familiar but new flavor.

1545
01:11:25,609 --> 01:11:29,846
A dash of uniqueness we learned
gets added to a familiar flavor.

1546
01:11:29,846 --> 01:11:33,083
If you get a taste, you won't
be able to stop making it at home.

1547
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:36,019
- Come meet the three boys.
- Come.

1548
01:11:36,019 --> 01:11:37,754
Right now.

1549
01:11:37,754 --> 01:11:40,424
- Italy.
- Right now.
