1
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:14,158
(Second morning of studying in Brunei)

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,231
(A sharp, cool air
hang heavily over Brunei.)

3
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,067
It's really scary here.

4
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,802
- It is.
- It's scary.

5
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:28,940
I came here early morning yesterday,
and there was something alive.

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,008
Yeah, you said that yesterday.

7
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:32,977
- It wasn't a cat.
- It wasn't a cat or a dog.

8
00:00:32,977 --> 00:00:34,278
There were lots of it.

9
00:00:34,278 --> 00:00:35,747
- Lots?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:38,449
(A silent street, completely deserted.)

11
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:39,751
It's probably here right now.

12
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:41,452
Keep your eyes open.

13
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:43,021
It's really quiet here.

14
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:45,490
The trees are super lush.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,225
The moment we step into the grass,

16
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:50,495
it feels like a king cobra might bite us
and that wouldn't be weird.

17
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,563
Curious, right?

18
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:54,932
There were lots here.

19
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:56,367
There was a bunch here?

20
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:57,468
Did they all leave because it's hot?

21
00:00:57,468 --> 00:00:59,404
They were probably here
because it was early.

22
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:01,406
What were they?

23
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:05,143
Monkeys.

24
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:07,045
There were lots.

25
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:08,046
(Well, that killed the mood.)

26
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:09,881
It wasn't just one or two.
There were lots.

27
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,250
Monkeys?

28
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,118
I was expecting it to be monkeys,

29
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:16,521
but your face was so funny earlier.

30
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:19,357
(Serious)

31
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:20,692
There were so many here.

32
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:21,893
How big were they?

33
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,695
Not that big. Maybe this big.

34
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:25,296
There were so many yesterday.

35
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:28,399
The water's not dirty, though.

36
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:29,834
- There's a monkey.
- Where?

37
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:30,935
I see it. A monkey.

38
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:32,570
What? A monkey?

39
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,973
Why is a monkey here?

40
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:36,040
Why are you here?

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,709
There are lots. There's one behind too.

42
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:39,077
(Wild monkeys spotted
underneath a floating house)

43
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:43,514
(Monkeys are common in Brunei.)

44
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:48,086
(Come see us next time.)

45
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:49,754
It would've been fun.

46
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:51,155
There were lots of monkeys.

47
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:53,524
I feel like there would be crocodiles too.

48
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:55,927
That's also why I wanted to come.

49
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:57,161
A crocodile spotted?

50
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,496
(Totally)

51
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:00,498
(In sync)

52
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:01,532
It's a crocodile.

53
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:02,972
(At an average age of 45.5)

54
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:04,502
(Channeling their disappointment
into a skit)

55
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:05,570
Now you do it.

56
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:07,672
A crocodile was spotted.

57
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:11,676
(Back to the main job,
full-on acting mode)

58
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:14,412
(Shy)

59
00:02:14,412 --> 00:02:17,582
Someone this cute and soft-spoken...

60
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:19,150
Yeah, I'm soft-spoken.

61
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,685
But when he goes into the kitchen,

62
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:21,719
he turns into a whole different beast.

63
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,488
Just in the tiny kitchen.

64
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:25,189
Hulk of the kitchen.

65
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,292
Just in the kitchen, though.

66
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,794
- The kitchen commander.
- Yeah.

67
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:31,663
The kitchen commander sounds so funny.

68
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:34,299
The knife in your hands
is the knife of a commander.

69
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,701
A sword master just in the kitchen.

70
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,436
"To me!"

71
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:41,005
- Hulk of the kitchen.
- The Excalibur?

72
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:42,273
The expensive knife.

73
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:44,475
Gosh, what's this?

74
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:46,277
(Commander Ryu, Lieutenant Yoon...
and now, the dessert prince is here.)

75
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:48,146
This is a botanical garden?

76
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:50,782
It's scary.

77
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:52,283
(Is Kihyun off to find wild monkeys too?)

78
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:56,287
The vibe, the vibe here...

79
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:01,292
(He found the monkeys?)

80
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,629
This is the beehive?

81
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:06,264
(A beehive?)

82
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:09,634
You could say honey
is the crown jewel of desserts.

83
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:13,705
(Honey is one of
Brunei's specialty ingredients.)

84
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:17,058
(From food and medicine
to gifts for honored guests)

85
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:19,744
(Honey is interwoven
with everyday life in Brunei.)

86
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:21,913
Of course, you also need sugar...

87
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:24,248
to achieve that level of sweetness,

88
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:26,150
but in my opinion,

89
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,685
I think honey is the highlight.

90
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:30,254
(Kihyun has chosen honey as his kick.)

91
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:32,123
I found out
there's a really crucial ingredient.

92
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:34,993
I want to study and explore desserts
in more depth,

93
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:36,628
and try making something again.

94
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:41,165
It looks so different.

95
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,934
What is this?

96
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:45,937
(A uniquely-shaped beehive)

97
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:49,707
(Even the bees are different
from the bees that we're familiar with.)

98
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,876
These are stingless bees.

99
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,778
So these don't sting you?

100
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:59,550
(Stingless bees?)

101
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,887
He says they don't.,

102
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:04,088
but they bite.

103
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:05,523
- They bite?
- Yes.

104
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,160
It's a Bruneian term for a stingless bee.

105
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,562
(Madu Kelulut/ Stingless bees
that bite rather than sting)

106
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:13,898
(Mainly found in tropical regions
such as Southeast Asia and Latin America)

107
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:17,935
But the beehive looks so different.

108
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:19,871
What is this?

109
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:21,406
(A surprise after another,
can't believe what he's seeing)

110
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:24,676
It's an ant's nest.
It looks like an ant's nest.

111
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:26,611
(Looks like an ant's nest)

112
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:28,813
I sort of looked these up.

113
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:32,350
Turns out, it only exists here
and in a few neighboring countries.

114
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,985
(It looks different
from the familiar hexagonal beehive.)

115
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,320
Do you want to try it?

116
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,789
I can just eat it straight
from the beehive?

117
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:39,691
I'd love that.

118
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:42,026
He's using a syringe.

119
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:42,593
(A soft poke of the syringe
into the beehive)

120
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:43,795
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:45,463
I'm sorry, buddy.

122
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:47,699
(Break open the plump little hive,
and out comes the honey)

123
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,302
The honey looks very watery.

124
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:53,838
It smells like honey.

125
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,841
(A taste of honey straight
from the beehive)

126
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:59,844
(Electrifying)

127
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:01,012
Are their vitamins in this?

128
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,081
It's super citrusy.

129
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:04,882
It's delicious.

130
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:08,086
Here, let me explain to you
what this tastes like.

131
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:11,456
You know the multivitamin
that comes in a small bottle?

132
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:13,424
It makes you go like this.

133
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:16,127
You get that tangy flavor
from this honey too.

134
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,428
So good.

135
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:21,366
It has a citrusy flavor
because there's a lemon on the left.

136
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:24,202
And we have a mango tree on the right,
so it's sweet.

137
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:28,506
(Fruit trees have taken root
near the beehives.)

138
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,423
(Stingless bees collect nectar...)

139
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:32,477
(From the flower of fruits
like lemon and mango.)

140
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:33,645
That's why it's so citrusy.

141
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:35,213
It's super tangy.

142
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,616
I totally want to buy lots of this
and bring it back to Korea...

143
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,618
so that my friends can get a taste.

144
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,655
Do you want more?

145
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:44,656
(Of course)

146
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,295
This is totally a dessert.

147
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:52,063
Definitely a dessert.

148
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:54,198
(Tasting)

149
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:55,466
(More tasting)

150
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,969
(Is he here to just eat honey?)

151
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:00,371
I taste a little bit of alcohol too.

152
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:03,441
Can I try collecting it myself?

153
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:09,881
They're bumping into me as they fly by.

154
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:12,016
When you air this episode,

155
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:14,485
could you say
that these are stinging bees?

156
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:15,787
So that I look courageous.

157
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:18,289
You want to try?

158
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,225
(First attempt
at honey harvesting for his dessert)

159
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,530
(Using a syringe
to collect honey packed inside the hive)

160
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,965
Like this...

161
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:28,366
I'm sorry. I'll be quick.

162
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,303
This doesn't taste like the usual honey,
so I think the boys are going to love it.

163
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:37,241
I'm going to attempt to make dessert
with this honey.

164
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:39,444
Now that I've tasted it,
I'm even more sure.

165
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:44,749
I've become more confident
about this dessert journey I'm on.

166
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:46,818
Tasty.

167
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:47,952
(The older boys are back at home.)

168
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,420
Should we make some instant noodles?

169
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,688
Yeah, let's make it...

170
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:52,590
so that the crew can have some too.

171
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:54,726
Let's try the instant mie goreng.

172
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,160
The best-selling instant noodle
in the world.

173
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:58,963
- They have instant noodles.
- Ramyeon?

174
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:01,099
- Shall we try a local one?
- Yeah?

175
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:03,968
This one is the world's top-selling
instant noodle.

176
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,336
Mi goreng?

177
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:07,639
(One of the world's top-selling
stir-fried instant noodles)

178
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,440
- Do we have eggs?
- Let's add some eggs too.

179
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,475
Okay, sounds good.

180
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:15,513
(Su Young's go-to tips for the perfect
stir-fried instant noodles revealed!)

181
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:17,915
I've always wanted to try
instant mie goreng.

182
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:19,250
Mie goreng.

183
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:24,389
(Get rid of as much moisture as you can
for that chewy texture.)

184
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:26,691
(Powder from the packet)

185
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:30,628
(Just mix well, and it's done?)

186
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,698
I smell it.

187
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,036
(Mr. Eo's Tip / Pan fry the noodles.)

188
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:40,672
(The noodles will be chewier and absorb
all the flavor from the packet.)

189
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:43,274
And I think it'll be good
if we have some sambal with it.

190
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:44,509
In "mie" noodles?

191
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:47,645
(The gochujang (red pepper paste) sambal
that was made on the first night)

192
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:49,013
It's going to be very spicy.

193
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,382
My goodness, this is amazing.

194
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:53,985
(A stir-fried instant noodle
and sambal combo you'd never imagine)

195
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:55,953
The Bruneian version
of bibimyeon (cold spicy noodles).

196
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:57,622
(Dump the noodles onto a plate.)

197
00:07:57,622 --> 00:07:58,856
Goodness.

198
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,658
It looks so good.

199
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,026
I'll top it with some sambal.

200
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:05,063
(Adding the sambal
to the stir-fried instant noodles)

201
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,597
I'm curious.

202
00:08:06,597 --> 00:08:07,632
You added sambal here, right?

203
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:08,733
Yeah.

204
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:10,768
I'll just have a little.

205
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,071
Let's add a bit more.
It's a little dry.

206
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:14,372
(More sambal)

207
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:17,642
(Stir-fried instant noodles,
revamped with Su Young's touch)

208
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:18,643
Let's try it.

209
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:20,178
I'll just try a little.

210
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:21,412
I just want a taste.

211
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,917
(That's not little)

212
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:28,453
(Noodles falling into his mouth
like a waterfall)

213
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:32,957
This is good.

214
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:38,329
Yum.

215
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:40,198
(Brow furrows instantly)

216
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:41,232
It's good.

217
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,400
It's delicious.

218
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,437
It sort of tastes like
that hot chicken-flavor noodle.

219
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:48,239
This is good.

220
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:50,575
- Don't have too much, Su Young.
- It's better with sambal.

221
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:52,076
(Is it?)

222
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:54,679
Why aren't the other staff having any?

223
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,247
They've eaten.

224
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:57,448
They've already eaten?

225
00:08:57,448 --> 00:08:58,816
Then I'll go for a bit more.

226
00:08:58,816 --> 00:08:59,984
It's good.

227
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:05,390
(Appetite explosion)

228
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:08,893
(Inhaling from the pot)

229
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,662
It's not a flavor
we have back in Korea.

230
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:13,398
Because everything is from here.

231
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:15,333
If something is good,

232
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,769
there's usually
some sort of a Korean version of it.

233
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,237
But this flavor is new.

234
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:20,672
It's delicious.

235
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:23,608
(Hooked on Bruneian flavors)

236
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,343
You can't stop with instant noodles.

237
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:26,744
You just devour it.

238
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:27,912
You can't stop.

239
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:34,519
(After everyone's had their version
of "honey," it's now lunchtime.)

240
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:39,057
Something smells good already.

241
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:40,191
How nice.

242
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:43,261
(Giving off their big eater mode,
the older boys enter the restaurant)

243
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:44,796
Hey, it's this way.

244
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:47,298
You were at a nice place, huh?

245
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:48,633
- Su Young.
- Did you wait long?

246
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:49,968
Weren't you at a nicer place?

247
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:52,170
Yeah? It's only been a couple of hours,
but I missed you.

248
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,672
I went to collect some honey,

249
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,908
but I heard you had your share of "honey."

250
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:58,743
No, that's not true.

251
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:02,146
- Should I take a guess?
- What we did? Okay.

252
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,781
You probably strolled out of the house,

253
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,750
and walked over to the supermarket
next to our place.

254
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:07,585
Spot on, right?

255
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:08,886
- Correct.
- Right?

256
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:10,154
- Did they tell you?
- No.

257
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:11,255
How did you know?

258
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,725
Now that I've been living with you
for three weeks,

259
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:14,892
I'm starting to get the feel.

260
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:17,895
We cannot escape the hands of Kihyun.

261
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:19,931
But we didn't see any monkeys.

262
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:20,999
No?

263
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,333
What is that?

264
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,701
That looks fancy.

265
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,403
I don't know where to look.

266
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:28,072
(Unveiling the jaw-dropping spread)

267
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:31,309
(Today, we're studying halal food.)

268
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:34,712
(Official religion of Brunei, Islam)

269
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:38,383
(In Islam,
permitted foods are called halal.)

270
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,119
Since pork is prohibited in Quran,

271
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:42,553
they don't eat pork.

272
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:44,522
(Halal Food / Food permitted for Muslims.
Pork and alcohol are prohibited.)

273
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:50,194
So I guess they focused more
on beef, chicken, and lamb.

274
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:51,262
That's right.

275
00:10:51,262 --> 00:10:53,931
From the ocean, from the river...
They probably have it all.

276
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:55,300
(Discovering the halal wonders
of land, sea, and air)

277
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,937
(From beef to seafood)

278
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:04,742
(This is the full spread
of Bruneian halal cuisine.)

279
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,746
(A Bruneian halal feast)

280
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:11,616
I heard this was a seafood place,

281
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:15,787
so I'm going to speak
for all the seafood avoiders.

282
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:18,756
Then let's try the meat first.
That's always a good idea.

283
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:20,892
This was rendang, right?

284
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:21,960
Yeah this is rendang.

285
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:23,928
Let's try it.

286
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:25,897
Hey, look at this dish.

287
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:27,899
(A beef dish
that looks anything but ordinary)

288
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:29,646
(Rendang)

289
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,969
(A traditional Southeast Asian beef dish)

290
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:32,303
(Made by braising beef in a paste
made with coconut milk and spices)

291
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:37,308
(An iconic beef dish of Southeast Asia)

292
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:41,579
("Rendang ranked No. 1, 2
on 'CNN's World's Best Foods' list.")

293
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:42,513
("'CNN' crowned it
the world's No.1 food.')

294
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:43,381
("The most delicious food in the world.")

295
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:50,121
(What will rendang taste like,
a dish that's captivated the world?)

296
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:52,624
I love this smell of coconut...

297
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:54,492
and lemongrass.

298
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:55,860
This flavor is star anise, right?

299
00:11:56,294 --> 00:11:57,662
I taste star anise.

300
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:59,230
They probably used star anise,

301
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:01,532
- but lemongrass.
- Lemongrass?

302
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:04,068
It's mostly lemongrass...

303
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:05,269
and coconut milk.

304
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:07,672
They call this kind of dish rendang.

305
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:11,175
They add various spices and ingredients...

306
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:14,879
and braise the beef in the mixture.

307
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,848
It's like their galbi jjim (braised ribs).

308
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:19,584
The ingredients have been reduced down.
It tastes like a concentrated broth.

309
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:21,586
There's something called gravy.

310
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,955
You reduce the broth
and use it as a sauce for your steak.

311
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:27,792
It's that concentrated taste
with lemongrass and coconut.

312
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:28,926
It's really good.

313
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:32,430
("It's good?" Kihyun goes for a bite
after listening to Su Young.)

314
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,633
(Kyung Ho is in big eater mode
and goes for a big piece.)

315
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:39,570
This is a bit tough.

316
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:43,775
It's the part of beef
we use to make jangjorim (soy sauce beef).

317
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,276
It's that lean cut of beef.

318
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:46,311
It's still good.

319
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,646
I think this is just right.
It will break apart if reduced more.

320
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,448
It's like the cut
we use for jangjorim, right?

321
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:51,916
Looking at the thickness,
maybe it's brisket.

322
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,484
Right, brisket.

323
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:54,619
It's very lean.

324
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:55,787
It's not heavy at all.

325
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:58,156
The food here is really the best.

326
00:12:58,823 --> 00:12:59,924
This is really good.

327
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:02,694
The seasoning is not too strong either.
It's perfect for my taste.

328
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:05,430
Most of the Bruneian dishes
make you devour a bowl of rice.

329
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,397
You're right.

330
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:07,765
I was expecting it
to taste like a typical

331
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:08,833
Southeast Asian dish, but no.

332
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,867
(Just like jangjorim,
rendang makes you finish a bowl of rice.)

333
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:11,803
Incredible.

334
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:13,571
(A piece of rendang
followed by some rice)

335
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,073
I'm so happy.

336
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:18,042
Rendang goes so well with rice.

337
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,177
They cooked it very well.

338
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:20,611
It's tasty.

339
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:21,779
It doesn't have any fat.

340
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,648
Low in carbs and high in protein, right?

341
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,550
- There's no fat here.
- Yeah, it's very lean.

342
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,586
It'd be perfect for those working out.

343
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,054
(Rendang is perfect
for those wanting a lean diet.)

344
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:35,418
("World's No. 1 dish, 'rendang'
is Southeast Asian jangjorim.")

345
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,894
(- The students)

346
00:13:36,894 --> 00:13:38,329
Shall we move onto the main course?

347
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:40,531
I'm looking forward to shellfish.

348
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:42,734
Southeast Asian cuisine is perfect for us.

349
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:47,438
(This time, it's seafood.)

350
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:50,341
(Three top seafood in Brunei)

351
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:53,277
(Three different sauces for each seafood)

352
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:58,449
(Three dishes finished with a smoky touch)

353

in a sweet and tangy chili sauce)

355
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:08,359
(Freshwater shrimp sautéed
in a buttery, creamy sauce)

356
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,200
(A Trio of Bruneian Seafood)

357
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:12,130
(Three different stir-fried seafood dishes
with three different sauces)

358
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,365
(Freshwater shrimp,
clams, slipper lobster)

359
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:17,702
I'm so happy right now.

360
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:19,637
Can we really start our day
with something this fancy?

361
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:22,273
Let's start with something we know.

362
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,541
(Giant)

363
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,209
Hey, the shrimp is huge.

364
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:27,345
Amazing.

365
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:33,351
(The first dish to try
is the stir-fried freshwater shrimp.)

366
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:36,921
I haven't seen a shrimp this big
in a while.

367
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:40,625
I'm getting more excited as I peel this.

368
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,793
(Full of meat)

369
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:45,730
(A gigantic size, similar to your palm)

370
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:48,499
I will try this now with some sauce.

371
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:49,734
(Dipped in the butter cream sauce)

372
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:50,902
Please do.

373
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:56,908
Gosh.

374
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,143
- Right?
- This is excellent.

375
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,316
(Satisfied)

376
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:06,751
The meat is firm.

377
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,119
- It's firm?
- Yeah.

378
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,521
How's it doing for the seafood newbie?

379
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:13,257
This is okay
even for a seafood avoider.

380
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:16,094
- It's okay?
- This is okay.

381
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:17,629
It's good.

382
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:21,199
- The sauce is...
- They make such amazing sauces.

383
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,400
(The sauce is out of this world.)

384
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,369
Isn't this curry?

385
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:25,870
Right, it's the curry we know.

386
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,605
- It's a bit spicy.
- You're right.

387
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,307
It tastes like the Thai-style crab curry.

388
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,175
- It does taste like curry.
- It does.

389
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:33,544
The food here feels like a mix
of different cuisines.

390
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:35,913
I think it's better because it's shrimp.
It's full of meat.

391
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:39,283
I'll try the one next to it.

392
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:40,518
What's this?

393
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:43,988
This looks scary.

394
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:47,592
(This stir-fried slipper lobster
makes a bold first impression.)

395
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:51,396
(A careful bite)

396
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:55,800
The slipper lobster is quite spicy...

397
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,735
You tried it? Let me try one too.

398
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:59,837
I'm feeling a bit of a crisis
as a seafood avoider.

399
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:00,872
It's coming?

400
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,106
I felt it a little.

401
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:03,441
It's a bit...

402
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,310
This one's got a strong fish sauce smell.

403
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,511
They added a lot of fish sauce.

404
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:10,581
(Curious, Su Young tried it too.)

405
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:13,418
Tastes like yuxiang sauce,
but bolder and a bit redder.

406
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:15,353
- It's spicy.
- Yeah, it is.

407
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:17,956
What was that Chinese shrimp dish?

408
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:19,791
Something like the spicy mala crawfish?
A spicy dish.

409
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,393
I'm not sure how to describe this sauce,

410
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:24,796
but it's definitely
not so common in Korea.

411
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,731
The lobster tastes
different from the shrimp.

412
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:27,765
Yeah.

413
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:30,001
It's lighter compared to the shrimp,
which is more rich.

414
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:31,669
- Like the red-banded lobster in Jeju.
- Red-banded lobster.

415
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,137
It tastes similar to that.

416
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:34,739
It does taste like the red-banded lobster.

417
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:35,974
A bigger version of it.

418
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:37,809
I just tried the clam.

419
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:38,943
How is it?

420
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:40,778
It's so insanely good, I'm mind blown.

421
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:42,547
- It's mind-blowing?
- Seriously.

422
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:43,781
It's so insanely good, I'm mind blown.

423
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:45,550
- It's mind-blowing?
- Seriously.

424
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,417
It's mind blowing?

425
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:47,785
- I was so surprised.
- Surprised?

426
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:50,088
- Why would this...
- The sauce has that smoky...

427
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:51,689
Why does it have a smoky flavor?

428
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:53,391
The clam? Let me try.

429
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:55,360
(The stir-fried clam's got that
smoky flavor?)

430
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,363
(Impressed)

431
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:04,202
(Spicy stir-fried clams in sambal sauce,
full of smoky aroma)

432
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:08,172
It's like stir-fried jjamppong
(spicy seafood noodles).

433
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:09,540
- Yes, that's it.
- You're right.

434
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,809
- If we just add noodles...
- This stir-fried jjamppong is so good.

435
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:14,812
If we just add udon noodles to this...

436
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:17,215
It's like fire-grilled jeyuk (spicy pork)
but with clams.

437
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:18,282
- Clam jeyuk.
- You're right.

438
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:20,485
They put so much thought into these clams.

439
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:23,855
Maybe they make jeyuk with clams
since they can't eat pork.

440
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:25,423
These are just littleneck clams, right?

441
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:26,557
Yeah, they are.

442
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,693
These are just
some littlenack clams but...

443
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:30,194
Hey, this is really good. This is...

444
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:33,464
I need to learn how to make this.
I must.

445
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:34,532
Exactly.

446
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:37,302
The way they cooked it
makes it so tasty.

447
00:17:37,302 --> 00:17:38,836
This could work as a main dish, right?

448
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:40,471
I keep thinking about alcohol.

449
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:42,073
This trio would be perfect as a snack
while drinking.

450
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:43,708
I'm surprised that the dishes
are all a bit spicy...

451
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,943
- unlike other Southeast Asian dishes.
- I like it.

452
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:47,712
(A trio of Bruneian seafood
bursting with variety and charm)

453
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:51,883
A Korean person cannot
not like this dish here.

454
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:55,486
They're good at cooking.

455
00:17:55,486 --> 00:17:56,888
Should we try this next?

456
00:17:57,088 --> 00:18:00,158
(An unfamiliar-looking dish)

457
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:02,593
- Do you want some as well?
- Yes, please.

458
00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:03,995
Goodness, Kihyun.

459
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,797
How did they make the rice so fluffy?

460
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,832
I love that you're here right now.

461
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:10,835
It was hard when I was just with Su Young.

462
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:13,671
- Hey.
- Why?

463
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:16,708
(Even their smiles match,
classic love-hate chemistry)

464
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,842
What do you mean why?

465
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:19,243
He's all over the place,
so he's a handful.

466
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:21,245
Enjoy, okay?

467
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,047
If I'm not here,
aren't you the youngest, Kyung Ho?

468
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:25,483
(Finally a bite)

469
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:27,452
This tastes like...

470
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:28,953
What is this?

471
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:31,923
(What is this dish?)

472
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,360
Hey, this is really delicious.

473
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:38,930
(The dish has captivated the boys.)

474
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:43,334
(What exactly are you?)

475
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:46,838
What is this?

476
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:48,206
Soft tofu?

477
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,641
It's tofu but it tastes like meat.

478
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:50,675
Su Young, is this soft tofu?

479
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:53,611
Yeah, it's almost like soft tofu,

480
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:55,279
but the sauce is amazing.

481
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,181
Did they use soy sauce?

482
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:58,349
No, but they don't use soy sauce here.

483
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:04,088
(Mix the secret sauce with garlic powder
and fry the mixture.)

484
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:09,594
(Top the fried tofu
with this garlic sauce, and you're done)

485
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:11,729
(The garlic sauce
has the boys all hooked.)

486
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:15,733
(Crispy Soy Bean
A crispy tofu topped with garlic sauce)

487
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:19,671
All the dishes here are great.

488
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:21,739
This is really good.

489
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,608
They fried the soft tofu/

490
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:26,577
I never thought
to make something like this.

491
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:28,446
We have something similar in Korea.

492
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:31,683
Remember when suyuk (boiled pork)
topped with garlic sauce was trendy?

493
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:32,717
(Right.)

494
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:33,951
It's that, but more intense.

495
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:36,921
But compared to that, this fully coats
and clings more to your mouth.

496
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:37,989
Yeah.

497
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:41,793
It's like the Korean spicy braised tofu,

498
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:42,927
but they fried it.

499
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,330
And that spicy pepper taste is gone.

500
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,267
Instead, they topped the tofu
with this crunchy, garlicky sauce.

501
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:51,536
They chopped the garlic and fried it.

502
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:54,806
The crunch from the garlic is insane.

503
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:58,142
Those fried garlic pieces
are exploding with flavor in my mouth.

504
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:00,778
The garlic aroma has filled my mouth,
and it's wonderful.

505
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:02,847
The tofu is sunbathing on a garlic beach.

506
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:05,516
(The fried garlic sauce
on top of the tofu is the kick.)

507
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,251
How did they make this?

508
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:09,854
(How in the world did they make this?)

509
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:15,259
(Another wave of emotions)

510
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:19,263
But if you fry garlic wrong,
don't you get that bitter taste?

511
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:21,065
Yeah, if you do it wrong,
it turns bitter.

512
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,433
Yeah, it tastes bitter.

513
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:24,836
Impressive! A true cooking prodigy.

514
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:29,707
I don't know. This is just so good.

515
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:31,976
So good.

516
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:35,313
Su Young, if you get to learn this recipe,
please share.

517
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:37,348
This is so good.

518
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:39,283
They cooked it so well.

519
00:20:39,283 --> 00:20:40,318
(Tofu-holic)

520
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:43,054
(His big eater DNA is exploding
with this tofu dish.)

521
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:45,256
If there's one thing I can take away
from Brunei...

522
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:46,691
This is really...

523
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:48,359
This is my top pick right now.

524
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,394
Me too.

525
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:52,630
This tofu dish is the best so far.

526
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,400
We need to create a recipe like this,
something everyone would like.

527
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,968
Anyone would think this is good.

528
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:58,169
(Aye, aye.)

529
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,671
I think my kids would love this too.

530
00:20:59,671 --> 00:21:02,106
I want to learn how to make it
and cook it for them.

531
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:04,208
(His brain kicking into gear)

532
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,576
It doesn't taste like
it would be difficult.

533
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:07,178
No, it's very straightforward tasting.

534
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:08,913
- Straight forward.
- It's not too far.

535
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:09,881
Let's try making it.

536
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:10,915
Will we be able to?

537
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:12,050
We can.

538
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,918
Using tofu?

539
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:19,290
If we can make some sort of
a flaky, soy sauce-flavored sauce,

540
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,125
I think it would taste really good.

541
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:24,295
(A new Ryu-cipe
born from Su Young's touch)

542
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:25,730
Gosh, the smell.

543
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:27,832
So nutty.

544
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:29,801
I topped it with...

545
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:31,936
a crunchier sauce I made.

546
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:37,342
This sweet aroma is similar
to the one before.

547
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,077
You're annoyingly good, Su Young.

548
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,880
This is a uxorious dish, Su Young.

549
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:46,417
Everything was so delicious.
It was incredible,

550
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:49,654
but this sauce in particular,
has captivated all three of us.

551
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:53,358
We make our own tofu.

552
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:58,096
(A fully homemade dish,
including the tofu)

553
00:21:58,096 --> 00:21:59,664
They made the tofu?

554
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:03,701
We use the leftover soy pulp
from making soy milk.

555
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,205
(Soy pulp?)

556
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:08,272
It's soy pulp.

557
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:10,642
They mixed garlic with soy pulp
to create the sauce.

558
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:12,010
It wasn't just garlic.

559
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,778
They mixed soy pulp with garlic.

560
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:16,648
But they fried it,
which makes it so unique.

561
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:17,682
I knew it.

562
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:21,986
You can really taste the care
that went into this. It's so good.

563
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:24,455
So basically, the food culture here
in Brunei is really broad.

564
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:25,590
The spectrum is wide.

565
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,092
Within the spectrum of halal food,

566
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:31,029
they just totally focused in and bam.

567
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:33,364
Halal food is so good.

568
00:22:33,364 --> 00:22:34,465
It's delicious.

569
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:35,500
Let's go do groceries.

570
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,934
We always go grocery shopping
after we eat.

571
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:38,469
Eat, learn, do groceries.

572
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:40,505
Eat, learn, groceries, execute.

573
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:47,845
(Before reaching the market,
the stunning sea welcomed the boys.)

574
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,614
Hello?

575
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:52,183
I wanted to show you the beach.

576
00:22:52,183 --> 00:22:53,318
(Su Young is on the phone with someone
before the shoot.)

577
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:55,586
We're visiting the National Cemetery
with Grandpa tomorrow, right?

578
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:57,255
That'll be nice.

579
00:22:57,255 --> 00:22:58,323
(The beautiful ocean
reminded him of his wife, Ha Seon.)

580
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,059
They say the cherry blossoms
are pretty there, so we're going.

581
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:02,193
Nice.

582
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:04,195
Have fun there.

583
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:06,764
Have something delicious there, okay?

584
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,933
(Even the Hulk Ryu turns soft
when it comes to his wife and daughter.)

585
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:10,301
We'll see you in two days.

586
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,737
Yeah, I'll see you in two days.

587
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:13,871
Hey.

588
00:23:14,472 --> 00:23:16,074
- Hey, Kyung Ho.
- Yeah?

589
00:23:16,674 --> 00:23:18,376
I'm going to pick her up right now.

590
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:21,079
Yeah? Then I can say hi to her too.

591
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,081
- You're coming in two days.
- Yeah.

592
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:27,919
This place follows Islamic customs.

593
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:31,723
They pray at specific hours.

594
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:34,659
Why? Yeah, that's how it is.

595
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:35,994
Wait a minute.

596
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:39,764
- Because I'm trying to explain?
- Yeah, it's funny.

597
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,733
What are you, a journalist
or a correspondent?

598
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:43,735
It just feels strange
being in this environment.

599
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:48,239
At 5 a.m., I suddenly hear prayer chants
blasting through the loudspeakers.

600
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,607
Really?

601
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:50,775
(On the phone)

602
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:54,479
(Kihyun is stuck in the middle of
two married men.)

603
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:57,115
(Single Kihyun is lonely today.)

604
00:23:57,115 --> 00:23:59,784
Of course. We should rent the car
at 4 a.m. and wait.

605
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:02,320
(Bitter)

606
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:05,223
(Surrounded by married men,
it isn't easy for Kihyun.)

607
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:09,694
(Let me just take a selfie...)

608
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:13,531
(For the Gram in Brunei,
I'm the only one single)

609
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:20,471
(Brunei's largest seafood market,
located right by the sea)

610
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:23,808
(Full of fresh seafood)

611
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:29,213
(A market filled with 100% fresh seafood)

612
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:31,082
I think everything will be really fresh.

613
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:32,383
They're supposed to open
between 3:30 p.m. and 4 p.m.

614
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,685
It's exactly 3:30 p.m. right now.

615
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:34,719
We can go now.

616
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,587
The small fishing boat over there.

617
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:39,123
That's what they use to catch
and deliver fresh seafood here.

618
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:41,826
(Seafood is freshly caught
by the seaside at dawn and midday.)

619
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:43,628
We usually think of a big boat,

620
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:45,797
but that's what they use to catch seafood.

621
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:47,465
It'll be super fresh.

622
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:49,934
(Direct to the market to sell)

623
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:52,136
(Jerudong,
the largest seafood market in Brunei)

624
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:53,638
It feels like the Garak Wholesale Market.

625
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:54,973
(Jerudong,
the largest seafood market in Brunei)

626
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:57,675
There are so many types of fish.

627
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,877
There's so much more variety of fish
compared to Korea.

628
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:01,612
(Eyes wide open)

629
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:03,114
So fresh.

630
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:05,550
Look at the squid.

631
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,785
It's super fresh.

632
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:09,687
(A level of freshness
that's on a whole different scale.)

633
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:11,923
This is a bullet squid.

634
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:13,491
A bullet squid.

635
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:15,059
This squid is so interesting.

636
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,595
What is this? It looks like tuna, look.

637
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,665
It's so fresh. It's tuna.

638
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:21,933
It's unbelievably fresh.

639
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:24,202
Gosh, this is a tasty one.

640
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:27,405
What is the name of this fish?

641
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:30,308
That's a golden snapper.

642
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:32,977
Is this delicious?

643
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:34,812
Yes.

644
00:25:35,246 --> 00:25:37,148
Of course, the sellers
are going to say it's good.

645
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:40,351
I know,
but I still want to ask if it's good.

646
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:42,153
Could I buy some shrimp here?

647
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:43,187
Sure. These look so good.

648
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:44,222
A big shrimp.

649
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:46,090
- Here it is.
- These look nice.

650
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,292
If it's $15 for a kilo,
that's super cheap.

651
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:48,860
In Korea, one shrimp would cost
a dollar-something.

652
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,361
Should I just get 1kg?
Do I even need that much?

653
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:51,696
- Buy 1kg.
- Okay.

654
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,098
(Shrimp bought)

655
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:56,634
That's cheap. It was $15.

656
00:25:57,435 --> 00:25:59,837
This looks like jack mackerel.

657
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:02,273
Just 1kg, please.

658
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:04,042
(Unstoppable Commander Ryu,
the Hulk of the kitchen!)

659
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,510
Let's buy these. These are good.

660
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,478
Then while we're here,
I might as well...

661
00:26:07,812 --> 00:26:09,414
- Go for it.
- Buy some too.

662
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:10,915
Buy everything.

663
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:13,918
(Buying this)

664
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:16,821
(Buying that)

665
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:19,090
(There's no hesitation
in front of fresh ingredients.)

666
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:23,928
(No holding back for Commander Ryu,
the Hulk of the kitchen)

667
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:27,031
If the seafood is this fresh,
it'll be good even if you don't cook it.

668
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:28,066
(Hands full)

669
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:29,367
If you think about it,

670
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:30,735
if it's this fresh,

671
00:26:30,735 --> 00:26:33,338
cooking it the least
is the best way to cook seafood.

672
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:37,475
Maybe I'll fry the sea bass...

673
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:40,845
and top it with one of the sauces
we had earlier.

674
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:43,414
The garlic sauce will be good too.

675
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:45,283
You're going to deep-fry the sea bass?

676
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:47,118
Yeah, don't you think it'll be delicious?

677
00:26:47,852 --> 00:26:49,754
I don't know what you're going to do,
but it'll be something amazing, huh?

678
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:50,788
It'll be good.

679
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:52,490
One of these, please.

680
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,026
(The fresh ingredients are all set.)

681
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,962
Look at this. This take the first place
for being the freshest.

682
00:26:58,763 --> 00:27:01,299
It's going to be
an upgraded version of it.

683
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:03,534
- It's so fresh.
- It is.

684
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,638
(Two men's fiery seafood feast)

685
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:08,172
It's done.

686
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:09,707
It came out better this time.

687
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:11,909
(Easy and delicious with fresh seafood)

688
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,714
(Let's get started
with Brunei's second Ryu-cipe night.)

689
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:18,483
(Chopping)

690
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:19,884
(Chop)

691
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,788
(Determined)

692
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:26,924
Eat, learn, execute,

693
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:28,426
and let's go home.

694
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:30,595
Are we ready?

695
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:31,896
It's starting.

696
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:33,097
(Fired up!)

697
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:36,634
(The kitchen gets busy.)

698
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:39,370
(Seafood Kyung Ho bought from the market)

699
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,438
Goodness. My gosh.

700
00:27:41,673 --> 00:27:42,874
I can't believe...

701
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:45,943
I can't believe
I'm cleaning shrimp and squid.

702
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:47,679
I can't believe it.

703
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:49,781
Gosh.

704
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:51,783
I've never touched these before.

705
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:54,218
I can't really touch them either.

706
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:55,486
Yeah, but...

707
00:27:55,486 --> 00:27:56,487
you need to give it a go.

708
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:58,356
I don't really like seafood, so...

709
00:27:58,356 --> 00:27:59,857
But Brunei is perfect
for cooking with seafood...

710
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:01,125
- because it's so cheap.
- True.

711
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,760
- And it's super fresh.
- Yeah.

712
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,263
They literally caught it and brought it
right back, so it's as fresh as it gets.

713
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:06,798
Normally, they use a huge fishing boat,

714
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,433
and it's like
seafood caught yesterday morning.

715
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,969
The fastest they can get it to the market
is in five to six hours.

716
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:12,337
This was brought in
right after it was caught,

717
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:14,005
like within an hour.

718
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:16,040
It's crazy that this much shrimp
only cost $16.

719
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,308
Look how big these are.

720
00:28:18,843 --> 00:28:21,612
This would cost $30 or $40 in Korea.

721
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,982
Can I just leave them out
once they're prepped?

722
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,616
Prep them and put them in the fridge.

723
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,352
- Yes, sir.
- You'll feel better that way.

724
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:28,419
Okay.

725
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:31,422
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe creation starts
on the second day in Brunei.)

726
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:33,825
So, for the Ryu-cipe I'm creating,

727
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:35,660
I just bought the ingredients
from the market earlier.

728
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,729
I got some shrimp, some squid...

729
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:42,200
I used those freshly caught shrimp
and squid, you know?

730
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,701
It's tasty as is.

731
00:28:44,268 --> 00:28:45,603
However, I added sambal.

732
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:48,706
Squid and shrimp on fire,
also known as Double S Fire.

733
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,342
On our first day in Brunei,

734
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:53,211
the local master chef made sambal for us.

735
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:55,246
I felt a sense of familiarity,
and it was just so good.

736
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:56,914
It had a comforting taste, you know?

737
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:01,519
Sambal?

738
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,587
This is like jang (fermented sauce).

739
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:03,755
It is?

740
00:29:03,755 --> 00:29:05,456
How can a foreign sauce
be so comforting?

741
00:29:05,456 --> 00:29:08,626
I thought that this sambal would
really compliment the Korean cuisine,

742
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:11,596
so I used sambal instead of gochujang
for the kick.

743
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:14,232
It felt really fun
because it tasted foreign...

744
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:15,733
even though it was a Korean dish.

745
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:20,571
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe
Double S Fire)

746
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:22,206
Major respects...

747
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:24,175
to those who clean
and prepare seafood.

748
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,412
(Nervous)

749
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:29,380
It was a huge challenge for me.

750
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,383
I've eaten raw squid before,

751
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:35,219
but I've never had to clean
the guts and stuff out of a squid.

752
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:37,088
I was quite nervous.

753
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:41,225
(Attention K-dads!
If Kyung Ho can do it, you can do it too.)

754
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:45,229
(Easy and simple way to clean squid)

755
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:49,167
(Scissors)

756
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,535
Use the knife.

757
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:52,370
I practiced it with scissors, so...

758
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,504
Right, then use those.

759
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:54,993
(How to clean the squid)

760
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,841
(1. Beginners should use
a knife instead of scissors.)

761
00:29:57,442 --> 00:30:01,245
(It won't slip, so it'll be safer.)

762
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:04,449
(Phew)

763
00:30:04,882 --> 00:30:07,218
(2. Carefully pull the legs
to take out the guts.)

764
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:10,088
(Watch out for the bone
in the body section.)

765
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:13,725
(Squid bone)

766
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,562
(3. Just remove the bone from the body,
and you're done.)

767
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:19,197
How's it going?

768
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:20,531
So far, so good.

769
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:22,767
Su Young, so I did it until here.

770
00:30:23,868 --> 00:30:25,536
(Ryu-GPT scans the situation.)

771
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,804
There should be a beak.

772
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:27,739
(For the legs, remove the beak first.)

773
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:29,807
Right, take the beak out.

774
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,242
(4. Remove the beak that's in the middle
of the legs by pushing it.)

775
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:32,644
Nice, good.

776
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:34,278
Then the bone...

777
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:35,546
Yes, the eyes.

778
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:37,081
You need to remove the eyes.

779
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:38,950
(5. Finally, remove the eyes,
and you're done.)

780
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,318
- These are the eyes?
- Yeah.

781
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,953
(Startled)

782
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:44,088
(Watch out for the ink
when removing its eyes.)

783
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:46,524
You really got ink on you, here and here.

784
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:48,926
It got all over.

785
00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:51,162
(Kyung Ho always keeps me busy.)

786
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:53,231
I was done too. It was the last step.

787
00:30:54,198 --> 00:30:55,933
Good job. You cleaned it well.

788
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,770
I'm still learning as I go,
so pretty good, right?

789
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,040
Now that I've cleaned the squid...

790
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,107
A knife...

791
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:05,043
Could I use your cleaver?

792
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,244
Of course.

793
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,112
It's been a while since I used that.

794
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:09,213
True.

795
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:10,748
You're not using it, huh?

796
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:12,650
I've been just using spoons.

797
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,587
(Beaming)

798
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:18,556
- Cooking with a spoon and a sieve.
- Right.

799
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,093
I got my hands on some honey
with a really interesting flavor,

800
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:23,761
so a dessert to showcase that.

801
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:27,198
Pandan crepe pancake.

802
00:31:27,765 --> 00:31:30,068
(The dessert made in Portugal)

803
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:33,938
(Custard Pie, full of sweet custard)

804
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:37,442
(The dessert created
on the first night in Brunei)

805
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:42,146
(Pandan Honey Seolgi,
filled with nutty pandan and palm sugar)

806
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:45,917
(And today's dessert)

807
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:47,852
(Crepe Cake)

808
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:49,153
(Layered crepes give it a soft texture
and a beautiful cross-section.)

809
00:31:49,153 --> 00:31:50,588
(Known as the "King of Desserts")

810
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:55,727
(A viral hit on social media,
it's as delicious as it is beautiful.)

811
00:31:57,328 --> 00:31:59,931
I'm worried I might have chosen
something that's too difficult.

812
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:03,668
(One of the most difficult to make)

813
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:06,471
I'm going to make a crepe cake
for my Ryu-cipe today.

814
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:08,306
(A crepe cake?)

815
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:09,974
I heard that it's a lot of work...

816
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:14,112
because I need to layer
15 sheets like this.

817
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:17,715
Making thin crepes
is more labor-intensive than you'd think.

818
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:18,983
It won't be easy.

819
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:20,918
The crepes are thin,
so they'll rip easily.

820
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:23,421
Tear two of them,
and you might just lose your sanity.

821
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:25,623
You could just lose it like this.

822
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:27,492
If it rips
because Kyung Ho bumps into you?

823
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:28,960
(Hostile)

824
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,161
I won't even go near you.

825
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:32,263
We shouldn't go near him
when he's about to flip it.

826
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:33,965
Cooking with the same passion
as yesterday.

827
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:36,801
Don't worry. We won't be in your way.

828
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:38,303
(Clap)

829
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:39,337
Gosh.

830
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:41,205
(Crack)

831
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:43,374
Is this going to mess up my personality?

832
00:32:44,642 --> 00:32:46,878
Cake flour.

833
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:51,182
(First make the crepe batter.)

834
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:55,820
(Cake flour / Low gluten content
makes it perfect for soft, thin crepes)

835
00:32:56,955 --> 00:33:00,291
(Tap, tap)

836
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:02,226
(Why we sift cake flour)

837
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:05,029
(You get a fine texture
and a smooth, even batter.)

838
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:07,799
(Concentrating)

839
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,401
(It's been 10 minutes)

840
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:11,703
(Tap, tap)

841
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:12,770
(Glance)

842
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:16,407
Aren't you working too hard, Kihyun?

843
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:17,775
I thought you weren't here.

844
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:19,010
We have to leave him alone today.

845
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,145
Right, we said we would.

846
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:22,613
Since it wasn't perfect yesterday...

847
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:24,649
Really? It was good yesterday.

848
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:28,019
But I didn't like what I made.

849
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:31,022
Kihyun gives off artisan energy.

850
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:34,359
Like a lone artisan
who tirelessly perfects one skill.

851
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:38,896
(Kihyun, a dessert artisan recognized
by Su Young and Kyung Ho)

852
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:42,200
(Add the whisked eggs
into the cake flour.)

853
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,135
(Why we add whisked eggs to the batter)

854
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:47,338
(Crepes need to be thin, so they need
the egg's protein to hold them together.)

855
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:50,742
(What is this green liquid
beside the batter?)

856
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:54,078
(Pandan leaf and milk)

857
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:57,949
(Next, add the egg and flour mixture
into the pandan milk.)

858
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,219
Not the most appetizing look, huh?

859
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:02,520
It's okay.

860
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,721
It'll become a delicious dish.

861
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:09,827
(Now it's time to strain
the clumpy batter through a sieve.)

862
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,629
This will take forever to mix.

863
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,531
How's it going, Kihyun?

864
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:14,599
It's okay.

865
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:16,567
It's going well.

866
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:20,605
(Determined lips! "I'm going to
succeed today no matter what.)

867
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:30,181
(Silky and smooth crepe batter
without a lump in sight)

868
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:35,620
(A man who takes dessert seriously)

869
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:37,956
(It's time to cook the batter.)

870
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:39,057
It's starting.

871
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:40,725
The crepes are thin,
so they'll rip easily.

872
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:43,995
(This is when things get serious.)

873
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:45,463
Director, could I go inside, please?

874
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:47,398
I'm sorry.

875
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:52,603
(Determined eyes)

876
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:55,373
(The pandan crepe batter...)

877
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:59,610
(It's on the pan.)

878
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:02,480
He's started with his first crepe.

879
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:05,249
(Nervous)

880
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,552
(I can do this.)

881
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:10,054
Can you flip it?

882
00:35:10,254 --> 00:35:12,390
I think it's slightly,
a bit undercooked right now.

883
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,424
Yeah?

884
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:16,227
(Just a little more)

885
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:18,963
Even the flipping...

886
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,799
It said to use something delicate
like chopsticks...

887
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:23,534
because a spatula might tear it.

888
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:27,872
(High difficulty!
Flipping without tearing the batter)

889
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:31,209
(Laser focus)

890
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:35,113
(His sharp eyes
waiting for the right timing)

891
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:42,186
(Please don't tear.)

892
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:45,523
(Perfect flip!)

893
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:48,493
(A perfectly thin and crispy crepe,
without a single tear)

894
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:49,927
Su Young, look.

895
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:51,629
Su Young.

896
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,666
(Happy, surprised, relief)

897
00:35:54,832 --> 00:35:56,467
I did it.

898
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:57,635
Show it off.

899
00:35:57,635 --> 00:35:59,137
(Nice, right?)

900
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:00,571
- I flipped it. Watch out.
- You did well.

901
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:02,307
You just have to flip 120 times more.

902
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:05,643
Yeah, you need at least 120 layers
for a crepe cake.

903
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:06,644
Right.

904
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:12,417
(Time for the repetitive work)

905
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:15,186
Phew.

906
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:20,358
Is it financially worth it
for those running cafés?

907
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:22,493
There must be a way...

908
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:23,895
to do it more efficiently.

909
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:25,363
If they have to do it like you,

910
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:27,365
they'd have to charge people
at least $80 to make a living.

911
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:29,100
That's what I want to charge people.

912
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:31,936
How long have you been working
as an actor?

913
00:36:32,303 --> 00:36:33,604
As an actor?

914
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:35,840
- Since 2000...
- Since 2000?

915
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,408
Since 2002.

916
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:38,743
In "The Wild Days"...

917
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:40,645
- "The Wild Days"?
- I saw you in that.

918
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:41,646
You did?

919
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:43,114
Yeah, I really liked "The Wild Days."

920
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:45,249
It's not easy to spot me.

921
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:48,720
I didn't know it was you back then.

922
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,989
So, when I heard you were in it,
I watched it again.

923
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:53,257
But I doubt that you could recognize me.

924
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:56,327
I was just an extra.

925
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:58,796
Sometimes, when I watched TV,

926
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:01,899
I'd see an actor talking
and nodding at the same time.

927
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:03,735
Talking and nodding.

928
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:06,137
I saw two actors just doing that.

929
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:08,606
- Totally fake.
- Since there was no audio.

930
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:10,775
I was determined
to show them what real acting was.

931
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:13,177
Like totally realistic.

932
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,647
So, the independence fighters
were in a secret room.

933
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:17,715
They were
secretly discussing independence.

934
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:19,517
Someone would say, "Arrest them all!"

935
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:22,220
Then I had to answer
and take one of the fighters.

936
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,621
I answered
and went up to one of them.

937
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:25,156
(Profanity)

938
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,859
Then, the director shouted, "Cut!"

939
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:28,960
And said, "What's with him?"

940
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,395
Extras shouldn't stand out too much.

941
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:32,697
(He got in trouble
for being too realistic.)

942
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:34,465
"You just need to walk past."

943
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:39,003
And even the person
I was taking away said,

944
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:41,072
"Be gentle."

945
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:42,974
"I'll walk on my own."

946
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,276
But you know what I was going for.

947
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:47,845
I wanted to be actually forceful.

948
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:50,415
Su Young, can you also ask me
when I started?

949
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:51,749
I thought you wanted to be left alone.

950
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,418
- That's why we weren't talking to you.
- Right.

951
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:54,652
See?

952
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:56,587
You told us not to talk to you.

953
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:58,222
Wait a minute.

954
00:37:58,222 --> 00:37:59,324
See?

955
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:00,858
- We were being considerate.
- I can't take my eyes off of this.

956
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:02,593
Then just keep it short.

957
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:04,529
I first appeared in 2014.

958
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:05,997
- Really?
- Yeah.

959
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:08,466
It was a survival program.

960
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:10,168
Do you remember what you sang?

961
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:11,536
- Back then?
- Yeah.

962
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,504
Do you know this song?
It was called "Pillow."

963
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,572
"Pillow"?

964
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:18,276
<i>I slowly drift off to sleep</i>

965
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:20,545
<i>Cradled by your arm</i>

966
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:23,448
<i>Love found me with such ease</i>

967
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:25,917
<i>And embraced me</i>

968
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:27,018
It was a song like that.

969
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:29,854
How smoothing.

970
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:31,956
You know, I came in first...

971
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,191
with that song.

972
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,194
It's funny to compliment
an artist on their singing ability, but...

973
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,663
Still, not all artist are great singers.

974
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:40,465
Not every artist blows you away.

975
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:41,666
Su Young, look at this.

976
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,501
(Impressed)

977
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:44,736
I've become an expert.

978
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:46,671
It's working.

979
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:47,772
You're good.

980
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:53,378
(With his skill boosted,
now a crepe master you can count on.)

981
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:56,781
(Starts to layer 13 sheets of crepe)

982
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,283
(Whipped cream)

983
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:01,536
(Whipped cream)

984
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:06,491
(Key ingredient that binds each layer,
helping the texture and flavor)

985
00:39:06,924 --> 00:39:12,063
(One crepe, one layer of cream...
and repeat endlessly.)

986
00:39:13,698 --> 00:39:15,033
There's no end to this.

987
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,335
So, you do that and...

988
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,004
If I cut it in half and stack them,

989
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:21,973
we get 30 layers of crepe.

990
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:27,645
(Get the layered crepes
onto the cutting board.)

991
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:30,882
Kyung Ho, could you cut it
into perfect thirds?

992
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:31,916
Are you good at things like that?

993
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:33,084
You want me to do it?

994
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:34,552
Can you do it?

995
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:35,720
I'm the same as you.

996
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:38,323
(Cozy moment
of cutting the crepe cake together)

997
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:40,024
There's no going back.

998
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,661
(Focusing until the end)

999
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:44,796
I'm curious to see the cross-section.

1000
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:50,368
(Layer by layer,
softly stacked to perfection)

1001
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:55,573
(26 layers)

1002
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,241
Whoa, hey.

1003
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:58,810
That's amazing.

1004
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,244
(39 layers)

1005
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:01,846
Impressive.

1006
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:04,449
The viewers are going to want to try this.

1007
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:05,550
Exactly.

1008
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:08,786
(A 39-layer pandan crepe)

1009
00:40:08,786 --> 00:40:11,789
(Finishing it off
with some sweet cocoa powder)

1010
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:14,225
(Sweet whipped cream
fills every layer of the crepe.)

1011
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:15,493
Look at that dripping. It's insane.

1012
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,229
(Go up 39 flights of crepe layers.)

1013
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:20,865
(And you'll be greeted by a dusting
of sweet cocoa powder on the roof.)

1014
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:25,203
(Kihyun's Ryu-cipe
Pandan Crepe Cake Feat. Bruneian Honey)

1015
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:26,404
(Pandan Crepe Cake)

1016
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:27,010
(1. Mix pandan and milk.)

1017
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:28,373
(2. Mix the batter (4 eggs, 160g cake
flour, 2g sugar, 50g butter) and milk.)

1018
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:30,141
(3. Cook thinly over low heat. / 4. Layer
with whipped cream and sprinkle cocoa.)

1019
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:33,411
(Next is Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe,
Double S Fire.)

1020
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:34,646
It's done.

1021
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:37,248
Right, I haven't made the sauce yet.

1022
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:38,683
No, I was going to use that as the sauce.

1023
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,419
(Double S Fire's key component)

1024
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:42,720
This is sambal, right?

1025
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:48,693
(Spicy chilies stir-fried in oil)

1028

(Adding the Korean spice!
Garlic and red pepper powder)

1029
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,908
(An exotic heat born
from the spicy flavors of two countries.)

1030
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:06,144
(Next, I have to...)

1031
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:07,879
Move.

1032
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:08,880
(Scurries)

1033
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,981
Move.

1034
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,082
Move?

1035
00:41:11,683 --> 00:41:14,218
(Last night, while cooking
their Ryu-cipe dishes...)

1036
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:16,020
Director, one second.

1037
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,222
(Director, please move.)

1038
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:20,992
Shouting "One second" while shooting
shows just how passionate he is.

the passion for cooking from Kihyun.)

have been added to the wok...)

Shall we give the wok a good spin?

1047
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:45,083
Go for a spin.

1048
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,451
Good.

1049
00:41:46,985 --> 00:41:49,253
(Get ready for this.)

1050

(I need to get this on camera.)

(Is this how it's supposed to be?)

1052
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,598
Wait a second.

and stuff like that.

(What we were expecting)

1055
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:09,841
(In reality...)

1056
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:11,542
This isn't what I was thinking of either.

1057
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:14,912
(Bursts into laughter)

1058
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:17,882
(Here goes nothing.)

1059
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,519
(Are the vegetables stuck to the wok?)

1060
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,720
Why isn't this working?

1061
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,989
The wok isn't hot enough.

1062
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:27,825
You need to add the oil to a sizzling wok,
then add the vegetables.

1063
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,627
That's how you get the fire.

1064
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:33,164
Jeez.

1065
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:36,801
Cooking is hard. It is hard.

1066
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:40,238
(As expected, he always keeps me busy.)

1067
00:42:40,638 --> 00:42:43,708
This was not the reaction I was going for.

1068
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:44,942
"Wow."

1069
00:42:46,678 --> 00:42:50,415
I want some "wows" too, like Kihyun!

1070
00:42:53,618 --> 00:42:54,752
Everything okay?

1071
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:56,020
I don't think so.

1072
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,589
(Cooking Fairy is upset.)

1073
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:03,494
Want me to teach you how to use it?

1074
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:06,064
This is how you're supposed to practice.

1075
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:09,500
There you go. You're good.

1076
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:12,570
Yes, pulling
is more important than pushing.

1077
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:16,274
You're not throwing it up.
You're pulling it.

1078
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:19,143
(Pulling)

1079
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:20,578
If you practice this,
you'll get better quickly.

1080
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:22,747
If you know how to use the wok,

1081
00:43:22,747 --> 00:43:24,749
you can flip the ingredients
without crushing them.

1082
00:43:25,116 --> 00:43:28,753
(Intensive practice)

1083
00:43:32,457 --> 00:43:33,758
Why?

1084
00:43:33,758 --> 00:43:35,660
Kyung Ho looks so funny from the back.

1085
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:37,362
Hey,

1086
00:43:37,362 --> 00:43:38,563
from the front, I'm crying.

1087
00:43:39,931 --> 00:43:41,566
(Dying of laughter)

1088
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:44,869
(Cannot even make a noise)

1089
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:47,805
Stop it now.

1090
00:43:48,206 --> 00:43:49,841
- That was fun.
- Was it? Good.

1091
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:55,747
(Next, the key ingredient
for Double S Fire, shrimp)

1092
00:43:55,747 --> 00:43:56,881
That looks yummy.

1093
00:43:57,615 --> 00:43:59,350
It'll be better to blanch the squid first.

1094
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,385
It'll get watery.

1095
00:44:00,385 --> 00:44:01,819
Right, I should've done that.

1096
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:03,021
Can someone boil some water quickly?

1097
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:05,423
Hey, who are you ordering?

1098
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:08,993
(Scrambling)

1099
00:44:08,993 --> 00:44:10,028
Move.

1100
00:44:12,864 --> 00:44:13,931
I should've blanched the squid.

1101
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:15,900
Why was I fooling around?

1102
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:20,605
(Just blanch the squid for 30 seconds
so that it doesn't become tough.)

1103
00:44:21,005 --> 00:44:25,109
(After 30 seconds,
straight into the sauce)

1104
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:28,579
(Here comes the torch.)

1105
00:44:28,813 --> 00:44:30,248
Awesome.

1106
00:44:30,882 --> 00:44:33,951
(Let's go for that smoky aroma.)

1107
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:40,024
(Adding a bold, smoky flavor
with a blowtorch)

1108
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:44,429
(A torch in one hand
and a wok in the other hand)

1109
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:48,299
(Fueled by attention,
the wok keeps working.)

1110
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:50,902
(Feeling good)

1111
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:51,903
Anyway,

1112
00:44:51,903 --> 00:44:53,304
look how far I've come.

1113
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:57,041
It sort of looks like...

1114
00:44:57,342 --> 00:45:00,044
It's like agwi-jjim (braised monkfish),
but also like stir-fried squid.

1115
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:01,179
(Looking insane)

1116
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:05,516
(Good work)

1117
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:09,020
(Finish off with a drizzle of sesame oil.)

1118
00:45:11,789 --> 00:45:12,490
(Gulp)

1119
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:13,691
I'm so hungry.

1120
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:14,759
My mouth is watering.

1121
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:17,862
Kihyun always says the nicest things.

1122
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:19,330
That looks good.

1123
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,832
It really looks delicious.

1124
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:26,237
(Smoky aroma adds a burst of flavor
in every bite.)

1125
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:31,009
(Kyung Ho's Ryu-cipe
Double S Fire (Squid and Shrimp on Fire))

1126
00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:32,210
(Double S Fire)

1127
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,275
(1. Cook 3T sambal, 3T sugar,
1T garlic, 3T red pepper powder in a pan.)

1128
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:34,012
(2. Add 1/2 scallion, 1/2
onion, 2 Cheongyang peppers.)

1129
00:45:34,012 --> 00:45:35,059
(3. Add cleaned shrimp and squid,
stir-fry quickly to evenly coat.)

1130
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,980
(4. Sear the outside
with a torch for that smoky finish.)

1131
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,115
The shrimp...

1132
00:45:38,816 --> 00:45:39,984
That startled me.

1133
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:43,321
What a performance.

1134
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:45,056
This is a heavy one.

1135
00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:46,557
If not, it'll mess up the blade.

1136
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:48,126
(A seafood so tough
you need a cast-iron knife?)

1137
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:49,761
This was definitely caught today.

1138
00:45:50,028 --> 00:45:51,462
It was freshly caught.

1139
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:53,531
(Key ingredient
for Su Young's Ryu-cipe, sea bass)

1140
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:56,834
I was thinking about what to do
with this fish,

1141
00:45:56,834 --> 00:46:00,438
then got the idea from the fried tofu dish
we had at lunch.

1142
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:03,708
Hey, this is so good.

1143
00:46:04,976 --> 00:46:06,544
That tofu dish was divine.

1144
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:07,879
(Su Young's top pick
Crispy Soy Bean)

1145
00:46:07,879 --> 00:46:10,481
Drying and frying tofu?
That's way above my skill level.

1146
00:46:10,481 --> 00:46:12,650
There's no time.
It'll take too long.

1147
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,719
So, I fried the fish...

1148
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,487
I fried it covered in starch powder,

1149
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,189
then pour my sauce over it.

1150
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:21,225
Crunchy texture
with a sauce using soy sauce.

1151
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:22,460
(The perfect combo of crunch,
sweet-savory sauce, and sea bass.)

1152
00:46:23,795 --> 00:46:27,265
(Su Young's Ryu-cipe
Sweet and Savory Fried Sea Bass)

1153
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:29,200
Su Young, so what are you doing to do?

1154
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,002
- Are you frying it or what?
- I'm going to fry it.

1155
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,274
(Covered in corn starch,
it goes into the hot oil)

1156
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:39,477
(Why we're using corn starch)

1157
00:46:39,477 --> 00:46:41,378
(The layer of starch
traps the moisture.)

1158
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:44,182
(So, the inside stays juicy,
and the outside gets crunchy.)

1159
00:46:46,117 --> 00:46:47,318
Goodness, Su Young.

1160
00:46:48,086 --> 00:46:49,420
That looks amazing.

1161
00:46:50,288 --> 00:46:53,925
(Flip the sea bass once.)

1162
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:55,927
The smell is so good.

1163
00:46:55,927 --> 00:46:59,631
(Baste with hot oil
while frying to ensure even doneness.)

1164
00:46:59,964 --> 00:47:02,600
(While the sea bass is frying...)

1165
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,803
(Olive oil?)

1166
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:10,775
(What is he making?
He added some minced garlic.)

1167
00:47:10,775 --> 00:47:15,013
The fried tofu dish was so unique
due to the rough, crispy...

1168
00:47:15,546 --> 00:47:19,317
garlic... garlic...

1169
00:47:20,018 --> 00:47:21,919
That texture
and the sweet and savory flavor.

1170
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:23,688
Those two factors
really worked well together.

1171
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:26,658
I realized that when it's crunchy...

1172
00:47:26,658 --> 00:47:30,061
while sweet and savory, you're brain
will be hit with pure dopamine, no doubt.

1173
00:47:30,061 --> 00:47:31,829
So, I tried to recreate that.

1174
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:37,402
(Garlic turning golden and crisp
in the oil.)

1175
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:42,140
(While the garlic is frying,
Su Young scoots over to the side.)

1176
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,075
I'm contemplating if I should add onions.

1177
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:46,177
(Searching)

1178
00:47:48,146 --> 00:47:50,281
(Crisp)

1179
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:54,786
I thought you were looking for
an ingredient.

1180
00:47:55,987 --> 00:47:57,155
I'm hungry.

1181
00:47:57,956 --> 00:47:59,290
That does look good.

1182
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,591
I have no energy.
This is good.

1183
00:48:00,591 --> 00:48:02,860
(Recharging with an apple)

1184
00:48:03,561 --> 00:48:05,897
(Meanwhile, the garlic
has turned golden brown.)

1185
00:48:05,897 --> 00:48:07,332
It looks fluffy.

1186
00:48:07,899 --> 00:48:09,000
Here.

1187
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,135
(Time to test if it was fried correctly)

1188
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:12,303
Crispy, right?

1189
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:13,638
It's crispy, but...

1190
00:48:13,638 --> 00:48:15,206
It sort of tastes burnt.

1191
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:16,441
- It does?
- Yeah.

1192
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:18,042
It sort of tastes burnt.

1193
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:19,477
- It does?
- Yeah.

1194
00:48:20,011 --> 00:48:22,080
That's not good.
It shouldn't have a burnt taste.

1195
00:48:23,147 --> 00:48:26,617
(It tastes burnt?)

1196
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:30,388
The garlic tastes a bit burnt to me.

1197
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:31,689
But I'm not sure.

1198
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:33,124
- It's not burnt. It's sweet.
- Is it?

1199
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:34,425
It's just a bit bitter.

1200
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:38,296
It tastes burnt to me.

1201
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,798
The bitterness...
Yeah, I get what you mean.

1202
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:42,400
It tastes a bit...

1203
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,568
It has that bitterness.

1204
00:48:44,636 --> 00:48:46,337
I tried to make it crispy,
but it turned bitter.

1205
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:48,172
Why is it so bitter?

1206
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:49,874
(Garlic burnt
from quick frying over high heat.)

1207
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:52,076
What are you going to do?

1208
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:54,112
(Su Young is deep in thought.)

1209
00:48:54,412 --> 00:48:55,713
I don't think I can use this.

1210
00:48:56,581 --> 00:48:59,150
(Did Mr. Eo Nam Seon just mess up
for the first time?)

1211
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,685
It's upsetting,

1212
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:03,021
but let's dump this.

1213
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:05,923
- You're dumping it?
- We can't eat it. It's too bitter.

1214
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:08,393
This is bad.
I shouldn't be fooling around right now.

1215
00:49:09,494 --> 00:49:11,763
That happens to you too, huh?

1216
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,466
I was too naive, thinking I could
just toss in garlic and fry it.

1217
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:17,835
I underestimated it.

1218
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:22,073
What do I do? I messed up.

1219
00:49:23,975 --> 00:49:28,980
I cooked the garlic too long
for the crunch, so now it's too bitter.

1220
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,083
If that worked out,
I could've felt more relaxed,

1221
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:34,285
but after a major failure,

1222
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:36,254
I got nervous, and I could feel
the blood rushing to my head.

1223
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:40,491
Even the best make mistakes.

1224
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:41,726
(Ryu-GPT's brain in full gear)

1225
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:43,661
There's a ready-made product
for crispy garlic.

1226
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:45,730
I think I need to use that.

1227
00:49:47,365 --> 00:49:49,901
(Searching)

1228
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:50,969
We don't have it?

1229
00:49:51,235 --> 00:49:53,604
(Ryu-GPT frantically searches
for something.)

1230
00:49:54,072 --> 00:49:57,942
(Ryu-GPT's solution
is to use breadcrumbs?)

1231
00:49:57,942 --> 00:50:00,011
I kept thinking about what to do,

1232
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:02,080
and there's this thing used a lot
by Western chefs.

1233
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,715
They sprinkle it on pasta too.

1234
00:50:03,715 --> 00:50:05,616
What could that be? Breadcrumbs.

1235
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:06,784
They use breadcrumbs.

1236
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:10,922
I thought that if I fried the breadcrumbs
and made it crunchy,

1237
00:50:10,922 --> 00:50:12,824
it would stay like that until tasting.

1238
00:50:12,824 --> 00:50:15,259
So, I switched the recipe on the spot.

1239
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:16,661
(Ryu-GPT's lightning-fast brain
saves the failed dish.)

1240
00:50:17,095 --> 00:50:20,431
(Stir-fry the breadcrumb
in a pan without oil.)

1241
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:23,201
(Cook it first
to get rid of the moisture.)

1242
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:26,304
(You need to add olive oil
so that it doesn't get soggy.)

1243
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:31,809
(There's no room for a second failure.)

1244
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:35,747
(1T of salt, 1T of sugar)

1245
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:38,316
Gosh, the smell...

1246
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,418
It smells super nutty.

1247
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:46,391
(Finished frying breadcrumbs
to replace garlic flakes)

1248
00:50:47,158 --> 00:50:48,426
Whoa, what is that?

1249
00:50:48,426 --> 00:50:49,827
Those are flakes. Try some.

1250
00:50:51,162 --> 00:50:52,630
We don't have any flour, so...

1251
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:55,533
- That's hot.
- Yeah, it's hot.

1252
00:50:58,236 --> 00:50:59,370
Yummy.

1253
00:50:59,704 --> 00:51:00,838
Did you add salt?

1254
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:02,440
- Yeah, I added salt and sugar.
- It's good.

1255
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,908
I thought that by itself
should taste good too.

1256
00:51:03,908 --> 00:51:05,109
It's good, Su Young.

1257
00:51:10,448 --> 00:51:13,618
(Prepares a giant dish for plating)

1258
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:15,420
I should take out the fish.
It's been going for too long.

1259
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:20,591
(Time to plate
the nicely browned fish on the giant dish)

1260
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:23,227
Goodness.

1261
00:51:23,728 --> 00:51:25,697
(Arrange the breadcrumbs beside the fish.)

1262
00:51:25,697 --> 00:51:26,998
This is a proper dish.

1263
00:51:26,998 --> 00:51:29,567
(Arrange the breadcrumbs beside the fish.)

1264
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:33,838
There should be a head.
I should've brought the head too.

1265
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:36,307
But because the head is missing,
it's sort of working in another way.

1266
00:51:36,307 --> 00:51:37,475
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1267
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:40,211
I'm going to make the sauce now.

1268
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,950
(Attention!)

1269
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:48,019
(Perfect for any fried dish)

1270
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:50,488
(Super simple sweet and savory sauce
made with only five ingredients)

1271
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,791
(One scoop each
of ginger and garlic for extra zing)

1272
00:51:54,759 --> 00:51:57,395
(Add olive oil.)

1273
00:51:57,729 --> 00:51:59,931
(1T of soy sauce)

1274
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:04,402
(7 dollops of oyster sauce)

1275
00:52:04,669 --> 00:52:07,739
(One more thing)

1276
00:52:07,972 --> 00:52:11,709
(Fiery aroma)

1277
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:14,646
(So this was
how you were supposed to do it...)

1278
00:52:16,347 --> 00:52:21,019
(Super simple sweet and savory sauce
made with only five ingredients)

1279
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,553
I'll pour the sauce now.

1280
00:52:25,523 --> 00:52:28,626
This looks absolutely insane.

1281
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,595
You need to watch out.

1282
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:33,197
Everyone step away except for me.

1283
00:52:34,265 --> 00:52:35,366
Move.

1284
00:52:37,435 --> 00:52:40,138
Yes.

1285
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:46,911
One more scoop of the oil.

1286
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:48,980
This will boost the flavor.

1287
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,948
(A scoop of hot oil
to deepen the savory taste)

1288
00:52:50,948 --> 00:52:52,083
Done.

1289
00:52:53,985 --> 00:52:54,770
(Sweet and Savory Fried Sea Bass
1. Score, cover in corn starch, fry.)

1290
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:55,486
(2. Fry breadcrumb without oil,
add olive oil, 1T sugar, salt)

1291
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:57,122
(3. Plate the fish and breadcrumbs.
4. Make the super simple sauce.)

1292
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:58,489
(5. Pour the sauce
on the fish, then a scoop of hot oil.)

1293
00:52:59,023 --> 00:53:01,192
(Ryu-dishes are done
for their second day in Brunei.)

1294
00:53:01,192 --> 00:53:02,560
As we do this more and more...

1295
00:53:04,028 --> 00:53:05,096
Let's try it.

1296
00:53:05,096 --> 00:53:07,231
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1297
00:53:07,932 --> 00:53:09,033
The shrimp looks good.

1298
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:10,401
Look at this squid.

1299
00:53:11,736 --> 00:53:13,004
It looks tasty.

1300
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:15,807
(A fail-proof combination
of sambal and seafood)

1301
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,910
The smell? Total pass.

1302
00:53:26,084 --> 00:53:29,053
How did you succeed again?

1303
00:53:29,387 --> 00:53:30,655
It tastes like a restaurant dish.

1304
00:53:31,189 --> 00:53:34,659
- Kyung Ho, it's like...
- Yeah?

1305
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:36,594
Think about opening a restaurant.

1306
00:53:36,594 --> 00:53:38,429
You should. It's delicious.

1307
00:53:38,429 --> 00:53:39,731
Thank you.

1308
00:53:39,731 --> 00:53:40,865
No, I mean it.

1309
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:42,800
It's got that sharp, spicy kick.

1310
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:45,069
The heat is definitely there.

1311
00:53:45,637 --> 00:53:48,172
And that touch of sweetness at the end?
Just perfect.

1312
00:53:48,473 --> 00:53:49,741
This is kind of insane.

1313
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:52,810
(A perfect harmony
of mild heat and subtle sweetness)

1314
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:55,279
Why do I feel like something is missing?

1315
00:53:55,279 --> 00:53:56,814
- You could season it more.
- Yeah?

1316
00:53:56,814 --> 00:53:59,851
You could, but I like it right now.

1317
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:01,486
I think I could add
more heat and more salt.

1318
00:54:01,486 --> 00:54:03,154
Yeah, you could do that,

1319
00:54:03,154 --> 00:54:04,956
but this is why I like home cooking.

1320
00:54:04,956 --> 00:54:09,661
(I like this as is.)

1321
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:10,762
It's really good.

1322
00:54:10,928 --> 00:54:12,230
I didn't add salt.

1323
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,732
(It's so good that it's hurting my head.)

1324
00:54:14,732 --> 00:54:17,468
My mother used to make spicy braised squid
for me when I was a student.

1325
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:18,836
This reminds me of that.

1326
00:54:18,836 --> 00:54:20,204
- Really?
- It's so good.

1327
00:54:20,204 --> 00:54:21,739
You're giving me too much credit.

1328
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:25,176
We're familiar with braised squid, right?

1329
00:54:25,176 --> 00:54:26,878
So there's a level of expectation,

1330
00:54:26,878 --> 00:54:28,279
but you've surpassed it.

1331
00:54:28,279 --> 00:54:29,547
Thank you.

1332
00:54:29,547 --> 00:54:30,982
The shrimp is good,
but the squid steals the show.

1333
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:32,884
(Creeps in)

1334
00:54:33,217 --> 00:54:35,486
(Eyes saying, "Go on, have a bite.")

1335
00:54:36,154 --> 00:54:37,388
It's incredible.

1336
00:54:40,325 --> 00:54:41,559
Oops, some dropped.

1337
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:45,363
(Nervous)

1338
00:54:46,364 --> 00:54:48,032
- It's good, right?
- It's good.

1339
00:54:48,032 --> 00:54:49,534
Did you see his eyes?

1340
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:50,835
(On cloud nine)

1341
00:54:50,835 --> 00:54:53,071
- That's what I mean.
- He didn't have any expectations.

1342
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:57,809
I feel like the camera director
is becoming a part of our family.

1343
00:54:57,809 --> 00:54:58,977
It's seriously good.

1344
00:54:58,977 --> 00:55:00,912
Thank you, everyone.

1345
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,148
- So tasty.
- It's perfect.

1346
00:55:04,148 --> 00:55:05,283
Really?

1347
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:06,584
I could finish this by myself.

1348
00:55:06,584 --> 00:55:07,585
Thank you.

1349
00:55:07,685 --> 00:55:09,220
Now let's try your dish.

1350
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,521
I don't think I can beat this in taste.

1351
00:55:10,722 --> 00:55:12,323
I'm sorry the plate is so big.

1352
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:16,628
Su Young, this is like a piece of art,

1353
00:55:16,995 --> 00:55:19,464
but I have no choice
but to be honest with you.

1354
00:55:19,464 --> 00:55:21,099
Of course.

1355
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:22,967
I know you've praised my dish,

1356
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:26,104
but I'm going to give my honest opinion
for the viewers watching.

1357
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:27,972
Look at that flesh.

1358
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:30,308
A piece of this goes on top.

1359
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:31,776
(Even at a glance,
the flesh looks thick and juicy.)

1360
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,845
This is the crunchy part.

1361
00:55:33,845 --> 00:55:34,946
Have it together.

1362
00:55:34,946 --> 00:55:36,214
Eat it together like this...

1363
00:55:36,547 --> 00:55:37,615
with the sauce.

1364
00:55:37,615 --> 00:55:39,951
I didn't get to season the fish much.

1365
00:55:40,718 --> 00:55:42,353
(Sniff)

1366
00:55:42,353 --> 00:55:45,556
This subtle sweetness is very similar
to the tofu dish we had earlier.

1367
00:55:45,556 --> 00:55:47,792
- It has that smell.
- I was thinking of that while cooking.

1368
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:52,330
(The sweet and savory sauce
is reminding them of the fried tofu dish.)

1369
00:55:57,835 --> 00:56:02,640
(Furrowed brows)

1370
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,175
This is so luxurious.

1371
00:56:04,175 --> 00:56:05,376
Su Young, this is a luxurious dish.

1372
00:56:06,844 --> 00:56:09,547
(Kyung Ho, Su Young's harshest critic,
also takes a bite.)

1373
00:56:09,547 --> 00:56:11,649
The sauce isn't too salty,
so be generous with it.

1374
00:56:14,652 --> 00:56:15,720
It's good.

1375
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,155
(Electrifying)

1376
00:56:18,656 --> 00:56:21,225
This is so annoying, Su Young.

1377
00:56:21,225 --> 00:56:23,928
How did you get that texture right?

1378
00:56:23,928 --> 00:56:25,330
It's crunchy, right?

1379
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,298
What did you add?

1380
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:29,267
- Breadcrumbs.
- Breadcrumbs?

1381
00:56:29,267 --> 00:56:31,302
I stir-fried it in oil first...

1382
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:33,638
so that it doesn't get so soggy.

1383
00:56:33,638 --> 00:56:37,175
The white flesh from the fish,
the savory soy sauce flavor,

1384
00:56:37,175 --> 00:56:39,610
and plus, the crunchy texture...

1385
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,980
I need to have this
with the sauce, though.

1386
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,815
Yeah, you do. It's like rice.

1387
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:45,116
The seasoning is perfect together.

1388
00:56:45,116 --> 00:56:46,918
(A perfect harmony of flavors
that echoes in your mouth)

1389
00:56:46,918 --> 00:56:49,787
The combination creation is so good.

1390
00:56:49,887 --> 00:56:50,989
(Did I hear that right?)

1391
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:53,257
- The combination...
- The combination creation?

1392
00:56:53,257 --> 00:56:55,159
The combination creation is so good?

1393
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:56,294
Were you trying to make it rhyme?

1394
00:56:57,095 --> 00:56:58,630
It's a flavor I've never had before.

1395
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,599
I think you've recreated about 80%
of the flavor from that dish.

1396
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:03,701
It's time for dessert.

1397
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:05,470
- Shall we eat it?
- Yeah.

1398
00:57:05,903 --> 00:57:07,772
We even have a dessert. How perfect.

1399
00:57:13,277 --> 00:57:15,146
It had time to rest in the fridge.

1400
00:57:15,146 --> 00:57:16,881
So many layers.

1401
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:18,449
How many layers are here?
Let's count.

1402
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,518
One, two, three...

1403
00:57:20,518 --> 00:57:22,820
It's probably 39 layers.

1404
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,888
That's a lot.

1405
00:57:23,888 --> 00:57:25,556
I made about 12 or 13 crepes.

1406
00:57:25,556 --> 00:57:27,392
Then, I've stacked three of them.

1407
00:57:27,392 --> 00:57:28,760
So, 39 layers.

1408
00:57:30,428 --> 00:57:31,562
It's not falling apart.

1409
00:57:31,562 --> 00:57:34,999
It won't fall apart. It won't

1410
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:38,836
The way it cuts feels quite nice.

1411
00:57:38,836 --> 00:57:40,571
Yeah? Is it satisfying?

1412
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,242
Look at that dripping. It's insane.

1413
00:57:45,343 --> 00:57:46,544
So fancy.

1414
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:50,515
(Creamy whipped filling
oozing through the crepe layers)

1415
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:53,084
Should I dip it in the honey now or later?

1416
00:57:53,084 --> 00:57:54,419
Try the first bite as is.

1417
00:57:54,419 --> 00:57:55,653
As is?

1418
00:57:55,653 --> 00:57:57,488
- I'll be honest.
- Be honest.

1419
00:57:58,623 --> 00:58:01,259
It's quite firm.

1420
00:58:01,259 --> 00:58:02,627
It is.

1421
00:58:04,095 --> 00:58:05,163
(A nerve-racking moment.
How will his pandan crepe cake taste?)

1422
00:58:05,163 --> 00:58:06,764
As if smashing a board with a karate chop.

1423
00:58:06,764 --> 00:58:08,399
(A nerve-racking moment.
How will his pandan crepe cake taste?)

1424
00:58:11,636 --> 00:58:12,870
(Pfft)

1425
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:16,641
You should drizzle some honey.

1426
00:58:16,641 --> 00:58:17,642
(That's what I thought too.)

1427
00:58:17,642 --> 00:58:18,810
Should I drizzle some honey?

1428
00:58:19,077 --> 00:58:20,144
You need the honey.

1429
00:58:20,144 --> 00:58:21,379
You do need the honey.

1430
00:58:22,914 --> 00:58:25,450
(You sort of need the honey.)

1431
00:58:25,783 --> 00:58:29,721
It felt like I was adding too much sugar
to my dishes these days,

1432
00:58:30,088 --> 00:58:31,589
so I kept strictly to the recipe,

1433
00:58:32,223 --> 00:58:33,424
but instead of eating crepes,

1434
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:39,263
I feel like I'm eating
a fish cake right now.

1435
00:58:39,263 --> 00:58:41,032
(Oh, Kihyun...)

1436
00:58:41,032 --> 00:58:43,101
I couldn't bring myself to say it,

1437
00:58:43,101 --> 00:58:44,235
so thank you for saying it.

1438
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:45,470
(Where has the sweetness?
It's become a pandan fish cake.)

1439
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,705
I guess It should've made them thinner.

1440
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,974
It needs sugar.

1441
00:58:51,976 --> 00:58:52,977
(Slipping)

1442
00:58:52,977 --> 00:58:54,679
I'll drizzle some honey for you.

1443
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:56,047
The honey is slipping away.

1444
00:58:58,082 --> 00:58:59,350
I'll just drizzle it on the cake.

1445
00:59:00,451 --> 00:59:01,786
The honey slips away, look.

1446
00:59:01,786 --> 00:59:03,021
It's like waterproof.

1447
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:04,922
It's like waterproof.

1448
00:59:04,922 --> 00:59:06,324
(Dizzy)

1449
00:59:06,324 --> 00:59:07,859
You made a waterproof cake.

1450
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:10,461
- Why is it like that?
- See? It's gone.

1451
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:12,463
(It was supposed to bring the sweetness.)

1452
00:59:13,431 --> 00:59:16,834
(How does it taste with honey?)

1453
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:19,270
(Confused)

1454
00:59:19,837 --> 00:59:21,172
Does it need more whipped cream?

1455
00:59:21,706 --> 00:59:23,875
What the cream layer was thicker?

1456
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,143
I can't really taste the cream.

1457
00:59:25,143 --> 00:59:27,245
I should've been more generous
with the cream.

1458
00:59:27,245 --> 00:59:29,247
(Mission failed to revive the sweetness)

1459
00:59:29,247 --> 00:59:30,748
Could you bring the cream?

1460
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:31,716
Let's try adding more cream.

1461
00:59:31,716 --> 00:59:33,484
Then, the taste might change.

1462
00:59:33,484 --> 00:59:36,254
It's only your first attempt.

1463
00:59:36,254 --> 00:59:38,056
I think it'll be better with more cream.

1464
00:59:38,056 --> 00:59:39,123
It's firm.

1465
00:59:39,123 --> 00:59:40,358
(Will the fresh cream
be able to revive the sweetness?)

1466
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:41,726
There you go.

1467
00:59:44,228 --> 00:59:45,496
Hey, the cream...

1468
00:59:45,496 --> 00:59:47,065
(It was the cream.)

1469
00:59:47,665 --> 00:59:49,033
Now, it's crepe cake.

1470
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,835
That was wrong on my part.

1471
00:59:52,303 --> 00:59:54,205
It's the same once it's in your mouth.
We can just have them separately.

1472
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:55,907
We can just have more cream like this.

1473
00:59:56,774 --> 00:59:58,309
(Execution)

1474
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:00,078
Here we go.

1475
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:07,185
(Getting everywhere)

1476
01:00:07,518 --> 01:00:09,854
(Was that on purpose...?)

1477
01:00:09,854 --> 01:00:10,922
Give it to me.

1478
01:00:13,591 --> 01:00:14,993
Su Young, I'll gain more weight.

1479
01:00:14,993 --> 01:00:16,694
(So what?)

1480
01:00:16,694 --> 01:00:18,162
Get some waterproof honey on it.

1481
01:00:18,162 --> 01:00:20,398
(I should've added more whipped cream.)

1482
01:00:20,398 --> 01:00:21,566
You need to have it together.

1483
01:00:28,339 --> 01:00:30,875
It's good, right?

1484
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:34,579
I'll spray some for you here.

1485
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,248
No, no.

1486
01:00:37,248 --> 01:00:39,083
- We need that much?
- That's too much.

1487
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:41,185
(Venting rage through whipped cream)

1488
01:00:41,452 --> 01:00:42,353
It's doesn't need this much. It's fine.

1489
01:00:42,353 --> 01:00:43,721
Since I've added more cream...

1490
01:00:45,056 --> 01:00:46,557
Who wants to try it?

1491
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:49,327
You need to take this too.

1492
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:51,229
This.

1493
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:52,330
(Nom)

1494
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:53,998
You can spray it as much as you want.

1495
01:00:54,832 --> 01:00:57,535
(How is it?)

1496
01:00:57,769 --> 01:00:59,137
An eraser?

1497
01:00:59,137 --> 01:01:01,939
(A taste review no one saw coming)

1498
01:01:01,939 --> 01:01:03,174
An eraser.

1499
01:01:04,075 --> 01:01:06,911
Hey, that's a bit harsh.

1500
01:01:06,911 --> 01:01:08,112
An eraser.

1501
01:01:08,346 --> 01:01:10,214
I think I'm going to start
avoiding pandan.

1502
01:01:11,516 --> 01:01:12,583
Pandan is hard.

1503
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:14,619
- Pandan is messing with your pan-gent.
- Pandan is hard.

1504
01:01:16,955 --> 01:01:18,556
It's not a problem for us to pan-iced.

1505
01:01:18,556 --> 01:01:20,024
(Kihyun's pandan crepe cake
was hard to pan-gent until the end.)

1506
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:21,993
Let's try this.

1507
01:01:21,993 --> 01:01:24,929
(The three boys VS Brunei's genius chefs)

1508
01:01:25,229 --> 01:01:26,664
(Brunei strikes first
with stunning dishes.)

1509
01:01:26,664 --> 01:01:28,232
Look how creative they are.

1510
01:01:28,466 --> 01:01:30,468
This is bad. This is a crisis.

1511
01:01:30,468 --> 01:01:32,370
What do we do about the food
we've prepared?

1512
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,038
Let's not just leave it as is.

1513
01:01:34,038 --> 01:01:35,273
Let's rework it.

1514
01:01:35,673 --> 01:01:39,077
(The boy's counterattack begins.)

1515
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:44,015
(We will show you the taste of Korea.)

1516
01:01:44,682 --> 01:01:45,984
This is it.

1517
01:01:46,384 --> 01:01:47,418
What do I do?

1518
01:01:47,418 --> 01:01:50,455
(A tense moment of judgment)

1519
01:01:50,455 --> 01:01:51,856
Why?

1520
01:01:51,856 --> 01:01:52,991
I can't look.

1521
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:54,993
(How will the fierce battle
of the cooking end?)

1522
01:01:55,126 --> 01:01:56,694
(Time for the third location)

1523
01:01:56,828 --> 01:01:58,630
Sicily.

1524
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,765
(An island of Italy, Sicily)

1525
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,501
(Full of local dishes
and fresh ingredients)

1526
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:05,303
They say it's a heavenly table.

1527
01:02:05,303 --> 01:02:06,804
I feel like everything
will taste good here.

1528
01:02:06,804 --> 01:02:07,805
(Welcome to a heavenly table.)

1529
01:02:07,805 --> 01:02:09,774
- Pasta started from here.
- Amazing.

1530
01:02:09,774 --> 01:02:10,675
So, we should try some pasta.

1531
01:02:10,675 --> 01:02:12,276
We must try it.

1532
01:02:12,276 --> 01:02:14,345
(Taste and learn about pasta
in its birthplace.)

1533
01:02:15,213 --> 01:02:19,450
(The three boys have improved
since the last time.)

1534
01:02:20,685 --> 01:02:23,388
(Showcasing top-tier cooking in Sicily)

1535
01:02:23,988 --> 01:02:25,290
How is everyone so good?

1536
01:02:26,724 --> 01:02:29,494
You wanted to taste the Ryu-cipes, right?

1537
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:30,528
(If you want to taste...)

1538
01:02:30,528 --> 01:02:31,462
(Brunei's Ryu-cipes...)

1539
01:02:31,462 --> 01:02:33,264
The three boys will go to you.

1540
01:02:33,264 --> 01:02:35,264
(Go now!
The Brunei Ryu-cipe Pop-up)

1541
01:02:33,831 --> 01:02:35,733
(Go now!
The Brunei Ryu-cipe Pop-up)

1542
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:39,470
A dash of uniqueness we learned
gets added to a familiar flavor.

1543
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:40,638
A dash.

1544
01:02:41,005 --> 01:02:43,741
Once you try it,
you'll keep making it at home.

1545
01:02:44,509 --> 01:02:46,611
(Where's the Brunei Ryu-cipe Pop-up?)

1546
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:49,447
- Come to meet the three boys.
- Come.
