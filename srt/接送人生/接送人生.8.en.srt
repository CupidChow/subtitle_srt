No.

00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:23,495
Let's talk outside.

10
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:26,491
Why would I?

11
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:27,975
What is this?

12
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,135
- What is it?
- What is it?

13
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:33,331
Move.

14
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:35,335
I think that's a seven.

15
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:40,775
My goodness.

16
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:43,571
Isn't that the number seven?

17
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:45,374
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:46,770
Are you crazy?

19
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:48,775
Then what is this?

20
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:50,931
Why did you have

21
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:53,491
two balls in your bag?

22
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:55,895
Do I have to explain that to you?

23
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:57,495
Of course.

24
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:02,455
What are you doing?

25
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:05,535
Director, listen.

26
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:08,291
Watch this.

27
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:11,135
Director. Don't mind it.

28
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:12,811
There was a misunderstanding.

29
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:14,615
- I'll take...
- A misunderstanding?

30
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,051
You think this is a misunderstanding?

31
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:18,375
You two.

32
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,055
Let's have a moment together.

33
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:32,851
That looks like the parking lot

34
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,495
at Myeongseong Elementary School.

35
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,055
What happened?

36
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:38,891
It's not a big deal.

37
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:40,251
I can explain it to you.

38
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:41,775
Is that how you want to play?

39
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:43,891
You think that's the only evidence?

40
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:46,255
Will you stop, both of you?

41
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:49,291
This isn't Myeongseong.

42
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:51,055
This is Big Parker.

43
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:53,811
What happened at
Myeongseong Elementary School

44
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:56,175
stays between you.

45
00:01:56,954 --> 00:01:58,694
Sure.

46
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,091
But what if the admissions corruption

47
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:03,051
at Myeongseong Elementary
is proven to be true?

48
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:04,575
What are you going to do then?

49
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,295
If that's true,

50
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,815
you'll have to leave this academy.

51
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:12,615
Ma'am.

52
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:14,491
How could you...

53
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:16,331
For Big Parker's dignity,

54
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:18,015
there is no option.

55
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:20,575
- I will discharge him.
- No.

56
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:23,331
Nothing's been revealed yet.

57
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:26,015
I'm busy. I have to go.

58
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:31,455
Wait.

59
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:33,254
What do you want?

60
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,335
Please let it slide.

61
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:39,171
If Claire moves to Class A,

62
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:40,815
I'll take care of everything.

63
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:43,015
You know who I am.

64
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:45,695
Class A's curriculum,

65
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,735
and every class teacher's information.

66
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:51,051
I'll give you everything you want.

67
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:53,255

Number 17.

76
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,334
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,895
I'll remove the dean immediately.

78
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:28,171
What are you doing?
Apologize to her already.

79
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:29,575
Yes.

80
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:31,890
I'm sorry, ma'am.

81
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,651
I'll cancel Lee Min-ho's admission,

82
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,890
and accept Hong Seo-yoon.

83
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,051
But sir...

84
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:41,135
Then now she's the only one left.

85
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,255
I'm heading to the police station now.

86
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:46,415
Ma'am, wait.

87
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:50,771
Seo-yoon will be attending this school.

88
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,051
If the school appears in the media,

89
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,735
for a disgraceful event like this,

90
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:56,535
it won't do any good for either of us.

91
00:04:57,515 --> 00:04:59,851
That's right. If this gets out,

92
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,334
it'll be the end of Myeongseong.

93
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:04,135
Right, Ms. Lee?

94
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:16,615
Ms. Lee.

95
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,775
It's all my fault.

96

Please

97
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,615
help Min-ho.

98
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,095

99

100

because of me...

101
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:48,334
Can you at least help
him go to another school?

102
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:50,375
Please.

103
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,735
I beg you.

104

Please.

105
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:06,615
Okay.

106
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:10,095
But

107
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:12,695
make sure this doesn't cause any harm

109
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:17,215
Of course.

110

Why can't he go there?

111
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:27,491
What happened to his school isn't enough,

112
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,135
now he has to find a new academy?

longer than three months.

114

Aren't you worried about Min-ho?

00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:38,055
That's why I'm saying this.

116
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:42,375
No academy is better than
Big Parker in Daechi-dong.

117
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:44,055
Still.

118
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,851
This is your fault.

119
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,615
Min-ho didn't do anything wrong.

120
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:49,855
Let him keep going there.

122

123
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,175
What?

124
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,735
Can you give Mommy a hug?

125
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,055
Only for a second.

126
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:34,455
I still appreciate it.

127
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:38,895
You're all I have.

128
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:46,215
Are you patting me?

129
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:50,615
I thought you were hugging
me only for a second.

130
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:52,931
I'm only doing it

131
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,895
because I always did it.

132
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,015
Then

133
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,775
can you stroke me too?

134
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:06,535
Are you happy now?

135
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:12,655
Just a little bit more.

136
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,415
That's too long.

137
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:26,295
Grandma did it for me too.

138
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:31,935
Did she?

139
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:33,611
Yes.

140
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:37,055
So let's tell her to come now.

141
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:40,295
So she can pat,

142
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:41,895
and stroke...

143
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,455
Seo-yoon.

144
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:47,455
Yes?

145
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:50,895
She doesn't need to come anymore.

146
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:53,055
You have Mommy.

147
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:55,535
From now on,

148
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:58,975
I'll stay next to you.

149
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:03,375
But you have to go to work.

150
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,655
Not anymore.

151
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,135
Why not?

152
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,415
From now on,

153
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,614
I'll look after you.

154
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:17,535
I'll drop you off at preschool every day,

155
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:21,335
and I'll take you to the academy too.

156
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,215
I missed out on so much of your life

157
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:28,055
because I was busy with work.

158
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:30,815
Now, I'll be there for everything.

159
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:36,895
You're going to be late. Let's go.

163

I know it's tough, but this is wrong.

164
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:53,775
You know

165
00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:56,575
this is when everyone quits.

166
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:58,614
What?

167
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,295
I have to get her ready
for elementary school,

168
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:04,175
and she has to go to more academies.

169
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,695
What about your career?

170
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,415
You loved working as a marketer.

171
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:12,451
You felt like dying

172
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:13,691
when you had to skip meals and run around.

173
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:15,410
Then when a new product was released,

174
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,535
you were happy as if
it were your own child.

175
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:19,215
Yes.

176
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:21,215

178
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:25,055
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:26,895
I'll get going now.

180
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,255
Ms. Lee.

181
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,614
I'm sorry, Ms. Han.

182
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:06,015
Why aren't you coming home, Dad?

183
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:08,815
Right?

184
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,335
You want me at home, right?

185
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:12,775
Yes.

186
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:14,331
Okay.

187
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:16,051
I'll stay next to you

188
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,055
no matter what.

189
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:30,931

But I couldn't just ignore

191
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,375
the pile of dirty dishes.

192
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,055
- I was...
- Okay. Leave.

193
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,215
What about dinner? Did you have dinner?

194
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,135
I only asked you to watch Seo-yoon.

195
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:45,135
I didn't ask you to worry about me.

196
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:46,530
Leave.

197
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:48,530
Okay. I'll leave.

198
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,215
What about Mother?

199
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:52,854
It's none of your business.

200
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:56,331
I said I'll leave,

201
00:11:56,355 --> 00:11:59,335
but you should still pay her a visit.

202
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:00,975
I won't see her anymore.

203
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:02,575
What?

204
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:03,851
What are you talking about?

205
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,335
You won't see your mom?

206
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:10,095
Why do you care?

207
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:12,175
It's between me and my mom.

208
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,651
When will we go there?

209
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:32,495
Eventually.

210
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:39,575
Seo-yoon, you're the best!

211
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,335
My darling.

212
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:42,891
Such a cutie!

213
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:44,691
Dad, put me down now.

214
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:45,971
I feel dizzy.

215
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,775
No, I won't.

216
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:21,295
Claire's mom. Hi. This way.

217
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:25,255
This way.

218
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:27,331
Here?

219
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,491
Of course.

220
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:30,855
Sit down.

221
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,495
You look like a different person today.

222
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:40,015
Congratulations.

223
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:42,255
Claire's now in Class A.

224
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:46,371
This is the schedule
Class A mothers shared.

225
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:47,735
Take a look.

226
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,503
(December Reading List)

227
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:55,499
(Essay Program)

228
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:56,870
(Language, math, science road map)

229
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,411
(Hockey, figure skating,
jump rope schedule)

230
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:02,015
Have your children

231
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:03,771
been doing all this?

232
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:04,931
Of course.

233
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:06,691
Claire's now in Class A.

234
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,415
She should too.

235
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:10,375
Of course.

236
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,411
Tell me anything,

237
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,535
and I'll help you.

238
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:17,775
She's right. You should get used to it.

239
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,375
Yes.

240
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:25,131
- She's here.
- My goodness.

241
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,855
How shameless.

242
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:29,655
What an eyesore.

243
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:32,891
How can she show up here?

244
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,975
How funny. I knew she wasn't ordinary.

245
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:37,375
I can't believe it.

246
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:43,975
Anyway, how did it go with Myeongseong?

247
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,495
It all worked out.

248
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:48,971
Claire will be going to that school.

249
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:51,695
That's great.

250
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:53,855
Then

251
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:55,975
what about Tommy?

252
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,135
Tommy is...

253
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:03,491
Oh, no.

254
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:05,735
Where will Tommy go then?

255
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:07,931
Will she pay them off?

256
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:09,171
Or threaten them?

257
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:11,055
That's her specialty...

258
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:14,011
How scary.

259
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:15,771
Why are you glaring at me like that?

260
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:17,771
I'm only asking out of curiosity.

261
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:20,171
I can't even ask a question?

262
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:21,971
Why do you ask?

263
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:23,815
Rumors spread fast in this town.

264
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,655
We'll soon hear about it.

265
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,411
Today's essay theme is

266
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:51,975
violent video games should be banned.

267
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,331
Write your opinion in
the form of an essay

268
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:58,455
with an introduction, body, and conclusion.

269
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:00,575
Now begin.

270
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:35,415
I expected Class A to be so much fun,

271
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:37,291
but it's boring.

272
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:39,051
Seo-yoon, what about you?

273
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,971
I find it boring too.

274
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:42,971
Do you want to visit our grandmas?

275
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,291
Yes.

276
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:45,775
What do you want to eat?

277
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,135
- Mom.
- Hello.

278
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:52,411
Tae-rin.

279
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:54,451
In Class A, you can't play

280
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:56,615
in the lounge during the break.

281
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:58,855
- Why not?
- Look at the other kids.

282
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:03,295
You have to prepare for your next class.

283
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,971
Grandma said...

284
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:10,095
I should rest during the break.

285
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,615
As much as I can.

286
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:14,971
At the time, you were in Class B.

287
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,731
Now, you're in Class A.

288
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:19,295
Then I want to go back to Class B.

289
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:22,335
Why would you?

290
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:25,251
Don't you know how hard
it was to get you here?

291
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:26,811
Why would you go back to Class B?

292
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:28,295
Tae-rin.

293
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:29,895
Grandma.

294
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:31,571
Aren't you on break?

295
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:32,691
Why didn't you come?

296
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:33,971
Because...

297
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:36,691
Hello. I'm Claire's mom.

298
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:38,931
Yes, I know.

299
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:41,090
They're now in Class A.

300
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:42,330
They can't play during break time

301
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,895
like they did in Class B.

302
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:49,015
If you say so.

303
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:51,895
Go back in.

304
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:54,735
But...

305
00:17:58,075 --> 00:18:00,011
She reminds me of Tommy's mom.

306
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:01,895
I was thinking the same.

307
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:04,971
Anyway, Grandma. It
hasn't even been a day yet,

308
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:07,055
but I don't like it.

309
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:08,775
I agree with you.

310
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:10,371
Hurry up and clean Table 10.

311
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:11,371
Yes.

312
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:12,971
Two ox bone soups for Table Six.

313
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,011
Yes.

314
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:16,375
Hello. This way.

315
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,895
Here you are.

316
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,571
Enjoy.

317
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,295
- Hello.
- Thank you.

318
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:22,611
Excuse me. Soju, please.

319
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,090
Soju. The same one?

320
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:25,411
- Yes.
- Jae-man.

321
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,691
- Yes.
- They're ready to order.

322
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:28,575
- Okay.
- Two ox bone soups.

323
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:32,455
Oh, no.

324
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:35,135
Mom, I'll be right back.

325
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:37,451
Where are you going? We're busy.

326
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:38,850
Where else would I go?

327
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:40,495
I'm going to cook for Jung-eun.

328
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:43,095
That little...

329
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:46,491
Hey.

330
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,255
You're home. I bet you're exhausted.

331
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:52,615
What on earth are you doing?

332
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,895
I thought I told you to get lost.

333
00:18:55,195 --> 00:18:56,251
Got it.

334
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,371
I was only going to make dinner.

335
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:00,251
Keep this up, and I'll
change the lock pass code.

336
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:01,531
I heard you the first time.

337
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:04,211
All I made was this hot
and spicy kimchi stew,

338
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:06,171
and Seo-yoon's favorite rolled eggs

339
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,654
with dried laver and ham.

340
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:11,291
Wash up already.

341
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,935
Seo-yoon, wash your hands.

342
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,215
What is it?

343
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:19,174
What?

344
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:25,931
Dad,

345
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:30,215
Mom deleted Grandma's number.

346
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:33,335
She did that?

347
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,135
I hate her.

348
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:37,891
Got it, Seo-yoon.

349
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:40,371
I'll save her number again.

350
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:41,775
Are we good, then?

351
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:45,055
Can't you bring Jinny over?

352
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:48,174
I miss her.

353
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:51,931
Seo-yoon, why are you crying?

354
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:54,895
Hold on a second.

355
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,375
Let me see.

356
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,375
Here. That's your grandma's number.

357
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:07,414
Seo-yoon,

358
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,895
don't hate your mom too much.

359
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:11,895
She has it rough, that's all.

360
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:14,135
Can I call her?

361
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:17,055
Of course, you can.

362
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:18,491
And I'll talk to your mom

363
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:20,735
about this ordeal with your grandma.

364
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,055
Thanks.

365
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,215
Seo-yoon, where are you?

366
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:27,174
Let's go.

367
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:29,011
Wipe your tears.

368
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:30,335
Okay.

369
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:35,434
(Grandma)

370
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,380

373
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:04,059

<i>The phone has been turned off,</i>

00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:13,491
<i>and you'll be redirected to voice mail.</i>

376
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:15,615
<i>Record your message after the beep.</i>

377
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:19,815
You said you were like the genie,

378
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:22,651
and that you'd come

379
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:24,414
whenever I called.

380
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:28,055
Why won't you pick up?

381
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,895
You're mean, Grandma.

382
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:43,414
Pinkru.

383
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:47,015
I miss Grandma.

384
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:51,055
Can't you let me see her?

385
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:53,095
Please.

386
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:55,575
It's my wish.

387
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:11,579
(Calls)

388
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:14,236
(Mom)

389
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,255
I'm afraid this was in vain.

390
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:54,131
I have nothing to say.

391
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:56,335
Why haven't you been answering the phone?

392
00:22:57,315 --> 00:23:01,095
I told you not to contact me.

393
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:04,775
What are you doing here all alone?

394
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:09,654
Come with me.

395
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:13,651
Let me say this once again.

396
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,255
- I...
- You

397
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:19,095
are someone I cherish.

398
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,215
Yoon Ji-a.

399
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,654
That's the person you are.

400
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,055
You said you wanted to go to Chapel Hill.

401
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:36,174
I can't go. You should head back.

402
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:42,335
I'll send you the departure date.

403
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:48,015
And I'll

404
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:50,255
be waiting.

405
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:12,695
Goodness, I almost died waiting for you.

406
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:15,615
Where were you and what took you so long?

407
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:33,415
Why did you turn your phone off?

408
00:24:35,035 --> 00:24:37,455
Life has been too hectic for me.

409
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:39,375
This is me looking back on myself.

410
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:42,535
How's Seo-yoon?

411
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,211
She's doing well, of course.

412
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,291
Your daughter and son-in-law

413
00:24:46,315 --> 00:24:48,251
have been taking her to
the academy and then some.

414
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:50,655
Seo-yoon's doing well too.

415
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,575
I'm glad to hear that.

416
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:54,211
Are you really going

417
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:55,531
to let Professor Lee walk off like that?

418
00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:57,371
It's hard to know when he'll be back.

419
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,571
I have my kids.

420
00:24:58,595 --> 00:25:00,051
I can't possibly leave them.

421
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:01,575
What about them?

422
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:02,971
They're busy with their own lives,

423
00:25:02,995 --> 00:25:04,051
so why should we constantly

424
00:25:04,075 --> 00:25:05,171
be at their beck and call?

425
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:06,615
Go with him.

426
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:20,291
Mom, I don't want to go in.

427
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:22,015
I don't want to go to class.

428
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:24,371
What do you mean, you won't go to class?

429
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:26,691
The kids make fun of me,

430
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:29,375
for getting kicked out of Myeongseong.

431
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:30,895
Also,

432
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:33,655
they call you a liar.

433
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:35,775
Who said that?

434
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,295
Jason and Annie.

435
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:42,255
I don't want to take classes here.

436
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,175
Min-ho.

437
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:48,535
Just focus on your classes.

438
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:51,895
You're to get a perfect
score on the term test today.

439
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:53,775
Got it?

440
00:26:02,915 --> 00:26:04,735
Seo-yoon, why aren't you going in?

441
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,895
Classes aren't fun.

442
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:11,731
Why do you keep doing this?

443
00:26:11,755 --> 00:26:13,775
It only upsets me.

444
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,735
Head inside. Go on.

445
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:20,655
Go.

446
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:27,615
Seo-yoon.

447
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:29,455
I'll get going.

448
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,135
- Claire's mom, over here.
- Hey.

449
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,895
- Hello.
- Hello.

450
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,091
Would you like some coffee?

451
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:49,575
No, I'm good.

452
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:52,335
Sorry about this.

453
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:56,095
Hey, Mr. Kim.

454
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:57,651
Jung-eun, where are you?

455
00:26:57,675 --> 00:26:59,891
<i>Where else? I'm at Seo-yoon's academy.</i>

456
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:00,891
Get to the office.

457
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:02,295
TR's CEO is asking for you.

458
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:05,575
TR's CEO showed up?

459
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:08,291
Don't ask me.

460
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:10,371
<i>Director Yoon told me a second ago.</i>

461
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,895
<i>Anyway, just get here.</i>

462
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:13,655
Sir,

463
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:16,571
I quit, remember?

464
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:17,771
<i>I'm no longer...</i>

465
00:27:17,795 --> 00:27:19,651
It hasn't been processed yet!

466
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:21,735
You're still on this team, so get here.

467
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:25,455
I'm sorry, sir.

468
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:27,375
<i>Are you kidding me, Jung-eun?</i>

469
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,375
Unbelievable.

470
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,375
Claire, what are you doing?

471
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:50,175
You should be writing.

472
00:27:52,915 --> 00:27:54,895
Twenty minutes remaining.

473
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:02,291
Jung-eun, my gosh!

474
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,051
I knew you'd come. I'm glad you're here.

475
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:07,015
Why does the CEO of TR want to see me?

476
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:08,535
Exactly.

477
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:11,095
Why is TR's CEO asking for you?

478
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:12,931
You must've flirted a lot

479
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:15,131
when you were only
told to set up a meeting.

480
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:16,815
Why you...

481
00:28:18,315 --> 00:28:20,535
Everyone. Come on in.

482
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:24,295
Meet the CEO of TR.

483
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:39,415
It's good to see you in this setting.

484
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,295
I'm Oh Hye-won.

485
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:45,855
- Tae-rin's mom?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

486
00:28:46,035 --> 00:28:47,851
I'm Deputy Director Ha Sa-na

487
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,535
of Aaes' Strategic Planning Team.

488
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,855
It's not exactly our first encounter.

489
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:55,171
Sorry?

490
00:28:55,195 --> 00:28:56,815
Ms. Lee, don't just stand there.

491
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:01,375
Right, I'm Lee Jung-eun.

492
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,371
Now, let's all take our seats.

493
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:05,971
Director, I'm sorry but...

494
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,251
Goodness. Ms. Lee, I'm sorry.

495
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:10,455
I called her here when she's on leave.

496
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:11,935
Mr. Kim, please.

497
00:29:12,715 --> 00:29:14,895
That was neglectful on my part.

498
00:29:15,035 --> 00:29:16,491
I put you out

499
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:18,295
unaware of her situation.

500
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:21,451
- I apologize.
- But...

501
00:29:21,475 --> 00:29:23,651
Actually, I'm in charge of the TR project,

502
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:25,375
so you can talk to me.

503
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:27,175
I'm not sure about that.

504
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:30,335
I'd rather work with those
who are sharp and clever.

505
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:33,051
Is that so?

506
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,251
Then we'll put someone else in charge.

507
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:35,815
Ms. Lee will take over.

508
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:37,971
The company

509
00:29:37,995 --> 00:29:41,455
has high expectations
about the project with TR.

510
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:42,771
Right.

511
00:29:42,795 --> 00:29:45,971
The decision didn't come easy for us at TR.

512
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:49,375
However, we put our trust in the ability

513
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:50,731
of Ms. Lee.

514
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,316
(Collaboration Proposal)

515
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:55,691
I'm Senior Manager Lee Jung-eun

516
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:57,091
from Aaes' Marketing Team.

517
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:59,895
I have a document for the CEO of TR.

518
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:03,095
Pardon?

519
00:30:03,155 --> 00:30:04,615
Can you

520
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:06,695
please pass it on?

521
00:30:08,715 --> 00:30:11,015
Wait.

522
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:13,015
Excuse me.

523
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:20,575
Let's work on this together,

524
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:22,375
Ms. Lee.

525
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:28,855
I'm truly sorry,

526
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:31,895
but I can't work on this project.

527
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:36,695
I only came here today to tell you this.

528
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,895
Mr. Kim, really?

529
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:41,055
Jung-eun, come on.

530
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:43,295
Ms. Lee!

531
00:30:43,595 --> 00:30:45,095
<i>You quit?</i>

532
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,495
But we at TR

533
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:51,135
made this decision
because of our faith in you.

534
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:53,971
Who will spearhead
this project without you?

535
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:55,211
Even without me,

536
00:30:55,235 --> 00:30:57,735
the project will run smoothly.

537
00:30:58,475 --> 00:30:59,855
By the way,

538
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:03,095
has Tae-rin easily adjusted to Class A?

539
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,615
Tae-rin quit the academy.

540
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:08,731
Sorry?
What can I do when it's not what she wants?

541
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:11,335
What can I do when it's not what she wants?

542
00:31:13,395 --> 00:31:16,251
You let Tae-rin drop out
of Class A at Big Parker?

543
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:19,055
Seo-yoon must enjoy being in Class A.

544
00:31:20,355 --> 00:31:21,971
Yes, of course.

545
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:23,535
It wasn't easy getting in.

546
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:27,051
Seo-yoon has a test today,

547
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:28,535
so I'll get going.

548
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:32,015
Are you really going to give this up?

549
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:35,175
Can you honestly say you won't regret it?

550
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:43,575
I'd rather do right as Seo-yoon's mom now.

551
00:31:53,475 --> 00:31:56,931
Mom, you must've missed me a whole lot.

552
00:31:56,955 --> 00:31:59,211
This has never happened before.

553
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:00,371
- Tae-rin.
- Yes?

554
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:02,331
Do you want me to take
you to your classes

555
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:03,491
like the other moms?

556
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:04,691
I'm fine.

557
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,011
I'm fine as well.

558
00:32:06,035 --> 00:32:08,731
Be the CEO that you are.

559
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,571
We're doing fine by ourselves.

560
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,215
- Right.
- Right.

561
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:15,531
Even if you get upset with me

562
00:32:15,555 --> 00:32:16,771
about being the only one

563
00:32:16,795 --> 00:32:18,251
whose mom didn't drive her to classes,

564
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:19,451
I won't bat an eye.

565
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:21,171
Sure. I'm good.

566
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:23,451
If I could choose, I'd
choose Grandma any day.

567
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:24,775
Nice.

568
00:32:24,915 --> 00:32:26,091
See?

569
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:28,171
Don't think about getting between us,

570
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:30,171
and do your job.

571
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:31,531
Got it.

572
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:33,611
I'll get back to the office, then.

573
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:35,735
Sure. See you later at home.

574
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:39,215
- Earn a lot!
- Earn a lot!

575
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:43,691
Why don't we go to a dry sauna,

576
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:44,851
and scorch our backs?

577
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,131
We had something cold,

578
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:47,731
so scorching our backs sounds good.

579
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:49,415
Eat up, then.

580
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:11,175
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:14,135
I don't think I can go with you.

582
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:17,575
I'm

583
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:20,175
going back to the hospital.

584
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,775
I'm the happiest when I work there.

585
00:33:29,435 --> 00:33:31,055
I respect

586
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:33,015
your decision.

587
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:37,935
When

588
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,855
will you be back?

589
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,255
I'm not sure.

590
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:45,255
I'll know once I get there.

591
00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:47,455
I'll wait.

592
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,895
I'll wait for you here,

593
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:55,695
so travel safely.

594
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:07,135
I'll do my best to return
as soon as possible.

595
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:38,705
(Friday, December 27)

596
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:41,183
(Princess Seo-yoon)

597
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:45,815
<i>Grandma, where are you?</i>

598
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:48,254
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

599
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:50,655
<i>Please help me.</i>

600
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:55,294
<i>Jinny, where are you?</i>

601
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:56,771
<i>Come quickly.</i>

602
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,055
Big Parker in Daechi-dong, please.

603
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:01,375
<i>Grandma, I miss you.</i>

604
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:11,015
Where's my pencil?

605
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:14,055
Tommy.

606
00:35:14,235 --> 00:35:16,571
You took my pencil again, didn't you?

607
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:18,815
- No.
- As if.

608
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,655
It was here a second
ago, but now it's gone.

609
00:35:23,595 --> 00:35:26,215
- Don't!
- Move.

610
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:33,815
You... I'm telling my mom.

611
00:35:35,555 --> 00:35:37,135
Mom!

612
00:35:52,474 --> 00:35:53,851
Nicely done.

613
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,131
Mom!

614
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:57,095
Hey, my son.

615
00:35:57,675 --> 00:35:59,095
What's wrong?

616
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:04,095
Did something happen?

617
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:08,215
Tommy stole my pencil again.

618
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:10,135
What?

619
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,294
What do you mean, Jason?

620
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,251
How many times must I say you saw wrong?

621
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:15,491
He saw wrong?

622
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:17,251
As if.

623
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,450
Jason, you wait here.

624
00:36:19,474 --> 00:36:21,495
I'll check in person.

625
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:24,575
Stop right there.

626
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:27,095
Stop!

627
00:36:28,745 --> 00:36:30,125
Stop right there.

628
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:32,645
Stop!

629
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:37,278
Tommy.

630
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:39,317
Tommy?

631
00:36:39,618 --> 00:36:40,993
Where's your pencil case?

632
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:42,114
Is it here?

633
00:36:42,138 --> 00:36:43,638
Let me see it.

634
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:47,438
- Is this it?
- That's my pencil case!

635
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:49,554
- Let go.
- Ma'am.

636
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:51,394
Why are you doing this to Min-ho?

637
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,398
Claire, let go of my hand.

638
00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:55,837
Why are you acting up today?

639
00:36:57,218 --> 00:36:58,797
What is the meaning of this?

640
00:36:59,537 --> 00:37:00,714
Did you push me?

641
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:01,914
I asked what you were doing!

642
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:03,114
Yell louder, why don't you?

643
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,194
Mom.

644
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:05,394
- What is it?
- Stop this.

645
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,278
- You little thief.
- Hurry.

646
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:09,878
I take it you must be scared.

647
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:11,954
The mom steals someone else's spot

648
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:14,078
while the son steals from a classmate.

649
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:16,878
- How is that normal?
- What?

650
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:19,638
Why? Am I wrong?

651
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:21,998
We can check.

652
00:37:25,698 --> 00:37:28,194
See? Jason was right.

653
00:37:28,218 --> 00:37:29,354
Just in case,

654
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:31,718
I had his name engraved on it.

655
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:34,518
Are you still saying Jason saw wrong?

656
00:37:34,658 --> 00:37:36,118
Where's your proof?

657
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:38,394
How can you be sure
Tommy put that in there?

658
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:40,714
Wasn't this found in Tommy's pencil case?

659
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:41,794
Mom.

660
00:37:41,818 --> 00:37:43,473
Something's wrong with Min-ho.

661
00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:45,274
Call Grandma.

662
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:46,874
- Look at this.
- No way.

663
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,114
Why? Yap again, why don't you?

664
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:51,513
Say that my Jason isn't smart enough.

665
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:53,794
This time around, I won't let it slide!

666
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,434
Mom, hurry.

667
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:57,554
Call Grandma.

668
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,034
Do you think Big Parker
could have gotten this far

669
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:00,674
- without Tommy?
- I'll go check on him.

670
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:03,034
You used to cling onto us like a leech.

671
00:38:03,058 --> 00:38:04,634
But what did you just call us?

672
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:05,958
- A leech?
- Tommy.

673
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:08,234
- Are you all right?
- I've been so patient with you!

674
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:09,598
Tommy's mom.

675
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:12,398
- Tommy, are you okay?
- Min-ho.

676
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:15,358
- What's wrong, Min-ho?
- Sit down.

677
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:17,513
- Min-ho.
- Oh, no.

678
00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:19,394
Min-ho. Are you all right?

679
00:38:19,418 --> 00:38:21,434
Has this happened to Tommy before?

680
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,238
No, this has never happened before.

681
00:38:23,497 --> 00:38:24,797
Mom.

682
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:27,718
I feel sick.

683
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:31,114
Min-ho, what's wrong?

684
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:32,598
Min-ho, wake up.

685
00:38:35,658 --> 00:38:37,118
<i>Grandma.</i>

686
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:40,438
Seo-yoon.

687
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:41,874
What's wrong? Did something happen?

688
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:43,074
- Wake up, Min-ho.
- Please help us,

689
00:38:43,098 --> 00:38:44,114
- Grandma.
- Min-ho!

690
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:46,234
- We must take him to
the hospital.- Min-ho is sick.

691
00:38:46,258 --> 00:38:48,558
- Come to the academy now.
- No!

692
00:38:49,378 --> 00:38:50,718
Min-ho?

693
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:53,797
My gosh. I'm already on my way.

694
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:56,038
Seo-yoon. Hang in there a bit.

695
00:38:56,218 --> 00:38:58,274
Min-ho.

696
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:00,797
Wake up, Min-ho.

697
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:02,718
My gosh.

698
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:11,274
Grandma has to be here.

699
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:13,317
Grandma should be here.

700
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:16,358
How could she come here?

701
00:39:16,578 --> 00:39:18,394
He went to the hospital.
So he should be okay.

702
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:19,513
No.

703
00:39:19,537 --> 00:39:22,638
Grandma has to help him.

704
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,758
Min-ho.

705
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:33,513
Wake up.

706
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,794
Min-ho.

707
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:38,234
Min-ho. What's wrong?

708
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:40,594
Min-ho.

709
00:39:40,618 --> 00:39:42,513
Yes. You're tired.

710
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:44,314
You're exhausted. It's okay, Min-ho.

711
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,354
It's okay, Min-ho.

712
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:47,874
You're going to be okay, Min-ho.

713
00:39:47,898 --> 00:39:50,034
Min-ho. Look at me.

714
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:51,358
Min-ho.

715
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:53,274
Do you remember how you, Seo-yoon,

716
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:55,317
and Tae-rin went on a trip together?

717
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:02,473
<i>We played with soap bubbles that day.</i>

718
00:40:02,497 --> 00:40:04,478
<i>We rode the swing.</i>

719
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:06,398
<i>We also played rock-paper-scissors.</i>

720
00:40:07,778 --> 00:40:09,794
<i>We also fed alpacas, right?</i>

721
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:11,158
Right?

722
00:40:12,658 --> 00:40:14,874
Min-ho. Why don't we try this together?

723
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:16,238
Breathe.

724
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:19,638
Try it.

725
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:21,358
Excellent. One more time.

726
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:24,358
Great job.

727
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:27,158
Excellent job, Min-ho.

728
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:30,878
Well done, Min-ho.

729
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,274
Stars...

730
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:36,638
Oh, right.

731
00:40:36,978 --> 00:40:39,078
Let's go and look at
the stars with Seo-yoon.

732
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:42,918
I don't want to study at the academy.

733
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:46,317
You got it.

734
00:40:47,138 --> 00:40:50,198
If you don't want to
do it, you don't have to.

735
00:40:50,258 --> 00:40:52,797
No more academies.

736
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,638
Get a taxi quickly.
Let's go to the hospital.

737
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:56,993
Okay.

738
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:59,598
All right. Let's get up now.

739
00:41:06,618 --> 00:41:07,714
There.

740
00:41:07,738 --> 00:41:09,797
Watch your head.

741
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:11,398
All right.

742
00:41:11,578 --> 00:41:12,998
Thank you.

743
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:56,198
Jinny!

744
00:41:57,658 --> 00:41:58,998
Seo-yoon!

745
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:09,558
Stop!

746
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:22,598
Oh, no.

747
00:42:30,778 --> 00:42:32,438
Seo-yoon!

748
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:34,878
Mom!

749
00:42:35,698 --> 00:42:37,758
Mom...

750
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,118
Oh, no!

751
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:42,558
Mom!

752
00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:43,993
Seo-yoon.

753
00:42:44,017 --> 00:42:46,158
Seo-yoon!

754
00:42:48,978 --> 00:42:50,317
Honey!

755
00:42:51,537 --> 00:42:53,158
Jung-eun. My gosh.

756
00:42:53,497 --> 00:42:55,354
Are you all right?

757
00:42:55,378 --> 00:42:57,034
Are you hurt?

758
00:42:57,058 --> 00:42:58,837
I heard your mother was there too.

759
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:00,634
Jung-eun.

760
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:02,598
Look at me. Get yourself together.

761
00:43:03,258 --> 00:43:05,718
Where's Seo-yoon? Is Seo-yoon okay?

762
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,598
She's okay.

763
00:43:08,178 --> 00:43:09,718
But my mother...

764
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:11,554
- What?
- How could this happen?

765
00:43:11,578 --> 00:43:12,674
This was so sudden.

766
00:43:12,698 --> 00:43:15,078
- Oh, no. My goodness.- What do I do?

767
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,634
What about my mom?

768
00:43:16,658 --> 00:43:18,473
What will I do if something happens to her?

769
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:20,638
Don't think like that.

770
00:43:20,738 --> 00:43:22,354
Jung-eun, she's going to be fine.

771
00:43:22,378 --> 00:43:23,837
Okay? Don't worry.

772
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:45,958
Mom. You saved Seo-yoon.

773
00:43:51,138 --> 00:43:52,678
Seo-yoon is fine.

774
00:43:57,418 --> 00:43:59,678
So you need to wake up too.

775
00:44:08,058 --> 00:44:10,317
Wake up, please.

776
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,008
(Authorized Personnel Only)

777
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:19,820
(Intensive Care Unit)

778
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:14,473
(I got a new BFF today.)

779
00:45:14,497 --> 00:45:15,998
<i>BFF.</i>

780
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:19,678
<i>I got a new BFF today.</i>

781
00:45:20,098 --> 00:45:21,794
<i>Best friend forever.</i>

782
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:23,118
<i>Jinny.</i>

783
00:45:23,378 --> 00:45:25,837
<i>Jinny is my grandmother.</i>

784
00:45:26,218 --> 00:45:28,358
<i>She's my first best friend.</i>

785
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:35,118
<i>First place.</i>

786
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:38,998
<i>I won first place in the speech contest.</i>

787
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:42,958
<i>I gave the trophy to Mom as a present.</i>

788
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:44,874
<i>Mom was happy</i>

789
00:45:44,898 --> 00:45:46,754
<i>- becausel can move...</i>
- You can keep this.

790
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:47,874
<i>To Class A now.</i>

791
00:45:47,898 --> 00:45:50,678
(Preparing for the contest was hard.)

792
00:45:52,378 --> 00:45:53,758
<i>Shots.</i>

793
00:45:54,138 --> 00:45:57,797
<i>Jinny and I went to the
hospital and got a shot.</i>

794
00:46:01,138 --> 00:46:04,158
<i>I must have done very
well on the exam today.</i>

795
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:05,954
<i>So Jinny,</i>

796
00:46:05,978 --> 00:46:08,837
<i>Min-ho's grandpa, and I had a party.</i>

797
00:46:09,738 --> 00:46:12,558
<i>I got a Pinkru doll as
a present, my favorite.</i>

798
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:18,438
I couldn't do any of these for her.

799
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:23,198
My mother did everything for her.

800
00:46:27,938 --> 00:46:31,358
<i>Grandma won't come back now.</i>

801
00:46:32,258 --> 00:46:33,914
<i>Mom</i>

802
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:36,678
<i>deleted Grandma's number too.</i>

803
00:46:36,938 --> 00:46:38,874
- Why are you deleting Grandma's number?
<i>- What if...</i>

804
00:46:38,898 --> 00:46:41,038
- Why?
<i>- Jinny doesn't come back?</i>

805
00:46:41,618 --> 00:46:43,837
<i>What if she never comes back?</i>

806
00:46:44,698 --> 00:46:46,758
<i>I want to see her.</i>

807
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:49,438
<i>But I can't remember her number.</i>

808
00:46:49,578 --> 00:46:51,038
<i>I miss Jinny,</i>

809
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:53,797
<i>so much.</i>

810
00:46:55,618 --> 00:46:57,118
I...

811
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:03,797
took your best friend away from you.

812
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:13,118
Seo-yoon.

813
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:16,714
Where's Grandma?

814
00:47:16,738 --> 00:47:18,198
Are you all right?

815
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,238
I hate you, Mom.

816
00:47:20,418 --> 00:47:23,398
I don't like you. Go away, Mom.

817
00:47:31,738 --> 00:47:33,078
Seo-yoon...

818
00:48:05,858 --> 00:48:07,398
You should get some rest.

819
00:48:08,658 --> 00:48:10,438
I'll watch Seo-yoon.

820
00:48:11,537 --> 00:48:12,837
I'll go,

821
00:48:12,978 --> 00:48:15,598
and get some of my mom's clothes.

822
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,718
My gosh. It's you, Jung-eun.

823
00:48:28,898 --> 00:48:30,234
How have you been?

824
00:48:30,258 --> 00:48:32,797
I heard your mom was
going to move in with you.

825
00:48:33,298 --> 00:48:35,518
You're such a kind daughter.

826
00:48:35,978 --> 00:48:37,834
Pardon? What do you mean?

827
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:39,074
She put the house on the market

828
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:40,718
because she was moving in with you.

829
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:43,837
But still. It'd be a waste to sell it now.

830
00:49:45,258 --> 00:49:46,558
Mom...

831
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:52,758
Why would you care about our money problems?

832
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:56,358
Were you going to sell this house,

833
00:49:57,658 --> 00:49:59,038
and give me the money?

834
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:04,678
I was mean to you. Why would you care

835
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:08,158
if I end up on the street?

836
00:50:13,098 --> 00:50:15,598
<i>This is how you always are.</i>

837
00:50:16,738 --> 00:50:18,398
Don't you see my scars?

838
00:50:19,418 --> 00:50:21,678
You can't even see that
your daughter is hurting,

839
00:50:21,898 --> 00:50:24,318
so who are you to treat others?

840
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:26,438
You know,

841
00:50:27,498 --> 00:50:29,078
living as your daughter

842
00:50:31,138 --> 00:50:33,238
has been painfully challenging.

843
00:50:35,418 --> 00:50:36,798
Don't call

844
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:39,078
either me or Seo-yoon.

845
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:49,794
I take everything back.

846
00:50:49,818 --> 00:50:52,634
I didn't mean any of it. I was lying.

847
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:54,238
I was lying to you.

848
00:50:54,938 --> 00:50:57,678
So please wake up.

849
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:01,998
Please...

850
00:51:04,338 --> 00:51:05,638
Mom...

851
00:51:18,218 --> 00:51:19,714
<i>- Jung-eun.</i>
- Yes?

852
00:51:19,738 --> 00:51:21,118
<i>Mother...</i>

853
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,400
Mom.

854
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,160
Are you all right?

855
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,240
What about Seo-yoon?

856
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,040
She's okay.

857
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,160
What about my daughter, Jung-eun?

858
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,680
She's not okay.

859
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,000
I thought

860
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,720
my heart was going to explode and kill me.

861
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,720
I...

862
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,040
made things difficult for my daughter again.

863
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,280
Don't say that.

864
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,040
Mom.

865
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,560
I'm sorry.

866
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,160
Why are you sorry?

867
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,000
I put my daughter through a lot.

868
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,440
She loves you so much. But I...

869
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,920
I had no idea you did everything for her.

870
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,760
They were all the things
I wanted to do for you.

871
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,480
When you were growing up,

872
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,680
I missed out on doing
so many things for you.

873
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,120
I know it's late, but I'm sorry.

874
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,000
I know I always held you back.

875
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,720
If it weren't for me...

876
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,480
I lived for you.

877
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,080
Without you,

878
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,360
I couldn't have lived.

879
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,280
Mom...

880
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,480
Could you help me up?

881
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,396
Already? It's too soon.

882
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,040
It's okay. Help me up.

883
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,080
Wait.

884
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,880
Hold on.

885
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,160
Slowly.

886
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,840
When did my daughter grow up,

887
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,160
and become a mother too?

888
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,000
Right.

889
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,800
In no time,

890
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,320
I became a mother too.

891
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,400
My daughter.

892
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,120
I'm sorry that you had
to grow up on your own.

893
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,480
I realized it after raisingSeo-yoon.

894
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,320
I'm sorry I couldn't understand you
all these years.

895
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,440
But I hope you won't hate me too much.

896
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,760
Jung-eun.

897
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,560
Do you hate Seo-yoon?

898
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,200
Not even for a second.

899
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,520
Same here. Not even for a second.

900
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,760
Mom, thank you,

901
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,120
for raising me.

902
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,960
Don't be sick.

903
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,320
I'm not sick.

904
00:56:04,672 --> 00:56:06,722
(Hanguk University Hospital)

905
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,600
If you're here to see me, come in.

906
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,636
Hello, Min-ho.

907
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,480
Hello.

908
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,120
I'm sorry, Ms. Yoon.

909
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,600
Look at my nails.

910
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,960
Your nails grew a lot.

911
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,520
Min-ho.

912
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,880
Min-ho has been going to therapy.

913
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,040
We came to thank you.

914
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,000
Min-ho and I came together.

915
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,040
Thank you for coming.

916
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,280
What about my dinosaurs?

917
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,236
I ought to paint them on your nails!

918
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,880
I'll do that very soon.

919
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,880
Thanks to you,

920
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,480
Min-ho's condition is improving.

921
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,760
Do me a favor.

922
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,520
Sure.

923
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:24,360
I promised to take Min-ho to see the stars.

924
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,880
You need to take him instead.

925
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,320
Min-ho.

926
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,396
Won't it be better if you
see the stars with her?

927
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,160
Yes! I'd like that.

928
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,160
Keep the promise.

929
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,880
I will.

930
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,000
I will keep my promise too.

931
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,560
Let me hold your hand.

932
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,640
You too, Min-ho?

933
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,000
I'm not cold.

934
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,200
Yes, you are. You could catch a cold.

935
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,916
What about you, Mom?

936
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,360
You said you hated me.

937
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,676
So you wouldn't mind if I caught a cold,

938
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,760
and started coughing, right?

939
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,920
Put the scarf back on.

940
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,880
You don't hate me anymore.

941
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,840
You must love me so much.

942
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,560
I like Grandma more.

943
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,476
Grandma is a great listener,

944
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,480
and does everythingl ask.

945
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,640
I'm sorry.

946
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,400
From now on, I'll listen to what you say.

947
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,156
And I'll always ask you first

948
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,160
what you want to do.

949
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,160
I can promise you that.

950
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,600
- Really?
- Of course.

951
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,720
Seo-yoon.

952
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,720
What should we do with
Myeongseong Elementary?

953
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,716
Do you want to attend that school?

954
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,796
No.

955
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,960
Can I not go to Myeongseong?

956
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,196
You got it.

957
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,200
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

958
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,720
Then it's settled.

959
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,320
Okay!

960
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,760
Mom.

961
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,080
The truth is...

962
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,200
I never hated you.

963
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,320
I know that.

964
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,120
You thought I wouldn't know that?

965
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,116
Here.

966
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,676
I've been keeping it with me every day,

967
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,560
so I could give it to you.

968
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,280
A letter?

969
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,760
Hong Seo-yoon.

970
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,480
You really love me!

971
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,956
You don't give out pink
hearts to just anyone.

972
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,320
Right?

973
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,240
Thank you.

974
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,680
Me too.

975
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,480
It's snowing.

976
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,400
Gosh, it's snow.

977
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,640
It's snow.

978
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,839
(10 months later)

979
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,640
I love the scent of Product 081.

980
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,316
The product came out very well.

981
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,440
We'll start acceptingpre-orders for
these online.

982
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,360
Sounds good.

983
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,156
Thank you so much for your hard work.

984
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,676
I knew it was the right decision

985
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,640
to trust you and do this project with you.

986
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,036
By the way,

987
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,560
thank you for talking me out of quitting.

988
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,756
I still feel sorry for my daughter that...

989
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,476
I can be her mom only half the time.

990
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,716
Oh, dear.

991
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:14,680
Kids will grow up just fine together.

992
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,436
Our mothers were busy too.

993
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,200
But we grew up all on our own.

994
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,320
That's true.

995
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:39,840
(Welcome back, Ms. Yoon Ji-a.)

996
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,480
My goodness, her and her nagging.

997
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,076
Don't worry. I won't be late.

998
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,276
I'm on my way now.

999
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,920
<i>Did you really leave?</i>

1000
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,920
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

1001
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,360
I'm sorry, Jung-eun.

1002
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,000
I completely forgot about
an old promise I made.

1003
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:01,480
<i>"A promise"?</i>

1004
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,560
<i>What do you mean, all of a sudden?</i>

1005
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,360
I'll be slightly late. See you later.

1006
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,640
What if she kicks you
out because you're late?

1007
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,640
Let her kick me out.

1008
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:28,240
I have someone to be with now.

1009
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,080
Is this

1010
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,360
a good enough answer?

1011
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,200
It is more than enough.

1012
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,240
Seo-yoon.

1013
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,236
You can't see the stars yet.

1014
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,236
You must wait until the sun goes down.

1015
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:06,040
It's okay. I'm good at waiting.

1016
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,680
You must have waited for
me like this every day.

1017
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,040
I only wait for things I like.

1018
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,360
Imagine how happy I'll be
to see them after waiting.

1019
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:22,956
You're right.

1020
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,680
You're so smart.

1021
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,400
Done.

1022
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,800
- I see stars.
- Stars!

1023
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,436
What do you think?

1024
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,596
Dad's the best, isn't he?

1025
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:35,920
- I'll do it.
- Seo-yoon!

1026
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,080
- You're here.
- Jinny!

1027
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,800
What took you so long?

1028
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,360
Are you scolding me? I just got here.

1029
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,036
What about me?

1030
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,280
My gosh. My beautifulJi-a.

1031
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,000
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1032
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,920
Jung-eun.

1033
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,880
You'll never be alone now.

1034
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,560
Of course not.

1035
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,200
Even so,

1036
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:08,480
stay by my side for a very long time. Okay?

1037
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:09,756
Of course.

1038
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,640
I'll be glued to you.

1039
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,240
Be glued.

1040
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,960
Me too. I want to be glued to you too.

1041
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,800
- My gosh.
- You should join us.

1042
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm here too.

1043
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,636
What do you want to do, Seo-yoon?

1044
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,520
The stars.

1045
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,476
- The stars aren't out yet.
- Are you that happy?

1046
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,636
Gosh, this is very nice.

1047
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,200
- It's nice, right?
- Yes.

1048
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,800
All right.

1049
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,400
Let's take a picture together.

1050
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,996
- Another one? Okay.
- Yes.

1051
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,320
Seo-yoon.

1052
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,840
One, two, three.

1053
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,156
All right. Let me take one with you too.

1054
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,169
One, two, three.

1055
01:04:47,193 --> 01:04:51,926
(Thank you for watching "Mother and Mom.")

1056
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,436
(We thank Son Jong-hak and Nam Kee-ae...)

1057
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,031
(for their special appearances.)

1058
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,517
(Mother and Mom)

1059
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:08,480
Our preschool days were the best days.

1060
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,916
My goodness. Time flies, doesn't it?

1061
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,596
Look at us all grown up.

1062
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,960
We're now in elementary school.

1063
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:17,396
I didn't grow that much.

1064
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,396
Did you grow taller again?

1065
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,316
- Yes.
- Yes.

1066
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,876
Hi, guys.

1067
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,956
- Hi, teacher.
- Hi, teacher.

1068
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,760
How's school going?

1069
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,920
- Gosh, you know how it is.
- Gosh, you know how it is.
