(Congratulations Grand Award)

8
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:17,492
What's that?

9
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:19,212
That's huge.

10
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:20,972
Put that here.

11
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:22,351
Good. Come here.

12
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,591
- Is it hot? - Here.

13
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:24,915
Oh, hot.

14
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:26,390
So hot.

15
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:28,231
There it goes.

16
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:29,871
When did you get the rice cake?

17
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,751
Thank you for your work.

18
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:33,831
Mom, this isn't a festival.

19
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:36,835
Why didn't you put up a banner?

20
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:38,997
- I already ordered one. - What?

21
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:40,517
I'm going to put it up outside.

22
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,081
Mom.

23
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,157
Did you order the biggest one?

24
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,797
Seo-yoon's favorite color is pink.

25
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:46,277
Are you sure it's pink?
Of course. It's pink.

26
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:47,117
Of course. It's pink.

27
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,397
She got pink for you.

28
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:50,837
Congratulations, Seo-yoon.

29
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:53,076
I'm so proud of you.

30
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,517
Grandma, feed me.

31
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,841
Do you want some?

32
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,841
Okay.

33
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:03,361
Okay.

34
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,477
Congratulations.

35
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:06,757
Gosh.

36
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:09,797
Jae-man, you've made it in life.

37
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:10,757
Thanks to Jung-eun,

38
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:12,877
you got a smart daughter.

39
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,876
Yes, I've made it.

40
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,236
Congratulations.

41
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,037
- Are you happy? - Not just happy.

42
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:19,801
I could fly.

43
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,957
Everyone's excited thanks to you,
right?

44
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,281
Yes.

45
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,681
Let's pop champagne on a day like
this.

46
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:33,157
- Gosh. - Be careful.

47
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,316
This is my first time.

48
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,640
Thank you.

49
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:37,437
Do you mean it?

50
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:39,397
Where did the Lee Jung-eun who
yelled at me...

51
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,596
at the competition hall go?

52
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,997
Where did she go?

53
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,601
I don't know who that is.

54
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,641
She placed first thanks to you.

55
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,401
- Thanks. - You're my boss.

56
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:52,437
You placed first because you were
good, right?

57
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:53,477
Right?

58
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:57,001
You were amazing today. You were
the best.

59
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:59,677
Mom, are you happy that I placed
first?

60
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:01,321
Of course.

61
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,681
You're so cute.

62
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,064
(Grand Award)

63
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,841
Cool.

64
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,877
You can keep this.

65
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,361
It's my gift for you.

66
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:16,036
(Grand Award)

67
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:18,916
- Don't eat too much. - Okay.

68
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,281
Seo-yoon.

69
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:22,317
You're now in Class A.

70
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,957
Yes, now I'm in the same class...

71
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:26,401
with Tae-rin and Tommy.

72
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:28,597
Just like how you did in the speech
contest,

73
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:30,240
you can beat Tommy, right?

74
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,161
What? Beat Tommy?

75
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:36,721
One second.

76
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:40,841
Hello?

77
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,081
Really?

78
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,117
Yes, I'm on my way.

79
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:46,317
You're leaving?

80
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:47,637
Where are you going?

81
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:49,237
You're leaving? Where are you
going?

82
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,397
- I have to go. - Seriously?

83
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,476
We're eating without you then.

84
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,117
Sure. Go ahead.

85
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,481
Bye.

86
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,601
I brought the trophy.

87
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:13,481
Where's Min-ho?

88
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,601
His math tutor is coming soon.

89
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:18,761
He's getting ready for it.

90
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,957
Let me give this to Min-ho before I
leave.

91
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:24,361
Father.

92
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:26,761
He doesn't need it.

93
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,841
You can take it with you.

94
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:34,241
Are you saying it's useless unless
it's first place?

95
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:36,441
Yes.

96
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:39,397
How can you say that when you saw
how hard Min-ho...

97
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:40,841
Father.

98
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:43,641
This is a battlefield.

99
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,521
It's better to move on...

100
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:48,157
from failure as soon as possible.

101
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:49,837
Did you just say failure?

102
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:50,997
The boy who always placed first...

103
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,801
placed second for the first time.

104
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:55,157
If that's not failure, what is?

105
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,961
Min-ho is only seven.

106
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:01,081
Is that what you think?

107
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:05,401
You can stop...

108
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,081
giving him rides.

109
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,361
Thank you for your work until now.

110
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:13,361
Hi, Dad.

111
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,241
How did Min-ho do?

112
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:20,477
Actually...

113
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,801
What?

114
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:25,921
Didn't he win the Grand Award?

115
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:29,921
The contest was hectic today.

116
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:32,361
Some weirdo suddenly showed up.

117
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,561
- He missed... - Hey.

118
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:37,561
We need to talk.

119
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,081
Grandpa.

120
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:01,521
Min-ho.

121
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,681
You were amazing today.

122
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:09,961
What?

123
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,561
Who placed first?

124
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,721
Not Tommy but Claire?

125
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:17,000
Did Claire really place first?

126
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:20,880
How could that happen?

127
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,281
Okay. Bye.

128
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,201
What's going on?

129
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:30,357
Does that mean Claire's moving to
Class A?

130
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:33,641
Mom, is Claire in Class A too?

131
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:35,561
- Yes! - "Yes"?

132
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:39,317
Jason, that's not going to happen.

133
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,556
But even if that happens,

134
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,521
don't think about hanging out with
her, okay?

135
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,401
Why not? I like her.

136
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,361
What do you like about a kid in
Class B?

137
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,361
You don't even know her.

138
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:54,957
She's pretty.

139
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,676
I like her because she's pretty.

140
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,361
Oh, my gosh.

141
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,401
Jason.

142
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,117
Don't you hang out with her.

143
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:03,157
Don't even talk to her.

144
00:06:03,181 --> 00:06:05,601
It's up to me. Tease-ya.

145
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,441
Gosh, that brat...

146
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,721
Jason, put that pencil away.

147
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:15,157
If you lose it, you'll be in big
trouble.

148
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:16,481
Put that away.

149
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:22,880
I'm giving this to Claire later.

150
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:30,917
Hi.

151
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:33,001
Ji-suk.

152
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:34,637
Is there really something in the
market?

153
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,361
That's not all.

154
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:37,997
This is awesome. Don't be
surprised.

155
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,361
What is it?

156
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:43,117
Today, Seo-yoon...

157
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,841
placed first in the speech contest.

158
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:47,397
- First place? - Yes!

159
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:48,797
Tommy placed second.

160
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:50,797
And Seo-yoon placed first!

161
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,197
Finally, she's moving...

162
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,081
to Class A at Big Parker.

163
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,357
Seo-yoon is?

164
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,081
Yes! I'm telling you.

165
00:06:58,181 --> 00:06:59,757
I just got a call...

166
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:01,677
that there's a unit available at
Gongnam Apartment.

167
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,641
So I called you right away.

168
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,037
Hey, do you want to visit...

169
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,237
Divine General one more time?

170
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,237
He was pretty good.

171
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,121
- About my mom's incident too. -
Well...

172
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,601
I'm kind of busy.

173
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:15,521
Are you? Something wrong?

174
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,557
I thought you were close...

175
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:20,721
to the realtor.

176
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:23,841
I was going to ask you to put in a
good word for me.

177
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,761
Sorry, I didn't know you were busy.

178
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:28,757
I have to go.

179
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,877
I'll see you later.

180
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,277
Okay. Bye.

181
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:32,961
- I'll call you. - Okay.

182
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,161
Excuse me.

183
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,241
- Oh, hello. - Hi.

184
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,517
Is there just one on the market?

185
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,957
Yes.

186
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:45,717
It's kind of old,

187
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:48,677
but it's been maintained well.

188
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,001
Yes, I can tell.

189
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,357
Thank you so much.

190
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,877
It's on the ninth floor.

191
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:54,757
It's the best floor.

192
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:56,237
This way.

193
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:57,997
Every minute counts.

194
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:00,121
You shouldn't miss it.

195
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,397
I just put it on the market. That
was fast.

196
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,557
Oh, you already know.

197
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,877
Besides, it's 25 pyeong.

198
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,917
I ran here as soon as I got the
call.

199
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:12,037
Right. It's getting crazy...

200
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,237
near the new school year, right?

201
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:15,317
I actually have someone else...

202
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:16,917
coming later.

203
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:17,997
Where?

204
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:19,481
Jeil Real Estate.

205
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,521
You said you'd leave it to us only.

206
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:27,881
I'll take it.

207
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:29,757
You don't want to look around?

208
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:30,997
It's neat.

209
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:32,077
What's there to see?

210
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:34,157
Also, we only have one girl.

211
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,077
We don't have any dogs or cats.

212
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:38,197
And we don't plan to have any in
the future either.

213
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:40,361
That's great.

214
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:41,881
But...

215
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:43,601
you know the unit's for sale.

216
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:46,557
Sorry? You're selling?

217
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,997
I thought it was a lease.

218
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,797
Actually...

219
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,637
my daughter's getting married next
year.

220
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:52,997
I almost forgot.

221
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:55,157
So I called right away and put it
up for sale.

222
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:58,280
Oh, did I forget to call you?

223
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,801
What?

224
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,041
Then how much is the sales price?

225
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,237
Oh, it's the realtor again.

226
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:05,237
How did they know?

227
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:06,561
One second.

228
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,601
- What should we do? - Hello?

229
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,481
Yes.

230
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:13,321
You're here already?

231
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,160
But...

232
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,841
Give me one second. Okay.

233
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:19,997
I'm sorry.

234
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:21,477
They were supposed to come later,

235
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,561
but they're already in front of the
building.

236
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,521
I'll take it.

237
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:29,121
I'll sign the contract.

238
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:31,877
What? You signed the contract?

239
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,157
Today?

240
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,300
It's in Gangnam. The price won't go
down.

241
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:35,956
It's in Gangnam. The price won't go
down.
It's a good school district.

242
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,157
It's a shorter commute for us.

243
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:39,521
Why not go there?

244
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:43,280
Since when...

245
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,477
were you so decisive?

246
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,001
I thought you agreed to move to
Gongnam.

247
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,437
Yes, I agreed.

248
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:51,801
But...

249
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:55,357
I'm saying we need to be realistic.

250
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:57,121
Gangnam...

251
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,757
It's great, but...

252
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:01,400
we have to worry about the budget.

253
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:03,881
Did you think I missed that?

254
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,557
You thought about that already?

255
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:09,956
First, we're selling this house.

256
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,717
Cash in our pension.

257
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,117
Max out our loans from work.

258
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,677
Except for Seo-yoon's insurance,

259
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,677
cancel pension savings and our
insurance contracts.

260
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,397
Then we only need 300 million won.

261
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,801
To make up for that...

262
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:22,001
You have a storefront.

263
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:23,961
We can sell that.

264
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:28,641
But...

265
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,361
Gosh.

266
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:33,717
It's under my name,

267
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:36,601
so why are you considering that?

268
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:38,361
What?

269
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:41,601
We were planning to use that for...

270
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:45,441
Did you mess with it already?

271
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:47,041
What do you mean?

272
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:50,877
Listen.

273
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,477
What about our later years?

274
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,956
We bought it...

275
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,237
to provide for us when we get old.

276
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:57,641
How can you...

277
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,117
Jung-eun.

278
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:03,517
I want to keep that unit for you.

279
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,157
To me, you are...

280
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:08,637
my highest priority.

281
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:09,961
You know that, right?

282
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:13,117
Thank you, but...

283
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:15,681
my highest priority is Seo-yoon.

284
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,280
You saw it too.

285
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,397
(Grand Award)

286
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:22,521
She beat Tommy.

287
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,321
She beat Tommy, the number one at
Big Parker.

288
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:28,761
Seo-yoon's pulling it off.

289
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:33,041
I'm going to do my best for her.

290
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,037
(DY Coins)

291
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:40,277
Gosh.

292
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:43,277
If Jung-eun finds out, I'm dead.

293
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:45,117
How come this coin never goes up?

294
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,521
Always going down...

295
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,836
(Jackpot)

296
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,521
A jackpot.

297
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,357
Yes, a jackpot.

298
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,397
Forty million...

299
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:56,717
Not 40 million.

300
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,001
Twenty million. Yes.

301
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,277
At least five million.

302
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,961
Dang it.

303
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,637
One billion?

304
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:10,961
One billion.

305
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:12,601
Twelve.

306
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:15,081
Twelve.

307
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:17,121
Twelve.

308
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:22,001
Twelve. Eight...

309
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:25,836
Jackpot,

310
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,641
my foot.

311
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:29,357
What?

312
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,797
(Jackpot)

313
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,157
"Never change"?

314
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:33,397
Why won't it change?

315
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,597
Why? Why won't my life change?

316
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,160
Hey. Get lost.

317
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:41,397
I heard Claire placed first.

318
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:42,317
Really?

319
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:43,437
What about Tommy?

320
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:44,881
He placed second.

321
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:46,561
Really?

322
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:53,917
Seo-yoon's mom was so happy
yesterday.

323
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,557
Did you celebrate yesterday?

324
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:56,597
Yes.

325
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,157
Seo-yoon's grandma threw a party.

326
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:00,477
It was a big one.

327
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,677
Good job.

328
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:05,157
We had a party too.

329
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,321
Tae-rin's mom...

330
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,121
What's going on?

331
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,397
They're making such a huge fuss...

332
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,721
over a single award.

333
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,037
Tell me about it.

334
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:23,961
So cheap and tacky.

335
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:29,397
They seem to know we're talking
about them.

336
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:30,797
Yes.

337
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,637
By the way, what is up with that...

338
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:36,081
old and moldy stench?

339
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:37,997
Exactly.

340
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:40,521
Nursing home alert.

341
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,397
Refreshing.

342
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:44,837
Good.

343
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:46,201
Try?

344
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,361
It's nice.

345
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,037
Would you shut your mouth...

346
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,361
- and be quiet? - Oh, my gosh.

347
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:01,637
What did you just say?

348
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:02,837
What?

349
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:05,477
You were talking in English until
now.

350
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,877
Why are you suddenly playing dumb?

351
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:09,677
Did you spend money and time to
learn...

352
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,517
so you can gossip?

353
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,717
Besides, why are you wearing
sunglasses...

354
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,437
inside?

355
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:16,837
Are you going to a ball?

356
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:19,441
Did you get double eyelids or
something again?

357
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,441
"Again"?

358
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:24,281
Don't you know fashion?

359
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:27,517
It's not because I can't speak
English.

360
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,121
But I don't want to speak in
English. Please...

361
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:35,241
shut up!

362
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:36,557
Oh, my gosh.

363
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:38,757
What are you doing? Have some
manners.

364
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:40,077
What?

365
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:42,441
Have some manners?

366
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:47,997
I see you have a few memorized...

367
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,641
lines up your sleeve,

368
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:53,837
but what you did just now was...

369
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:55,721
absolutely rude.

370
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:00,601
Do you understand what I'm saying?

371
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:05,317
I knew it.

372
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:07,841
She only picked up one phrase.

373
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:10,321
How vulgar.

374
00:15:10,981 --> 00:15:14,081
Why not? Keep talking in English.

375
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:16,761
That's all you memorized?

376
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:20,401
Granny here seems totally fazed.

377
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:21,717
Look at her.

378
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:23,561
She's sweating like a pig.

379
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:25,561
That's it.

380
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:28,481
You have crossed the line.

381
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:36,921
Enough is enough.

382
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,157
If you don't have the courage to
say that...

383
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,321
to my face in Korean,

384
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:45,281
then keep your mouth shut.

385
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:47,881
Everyone here gets it.

386
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,881
What if the children hear you?

387
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,121
What a day.

388
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,081
Let's go.

389
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,521
Wait for me.

390
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:09,077
When I was watching a movie,

391
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,357
I knew that was it.

392
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:12,437
I told my daughter to write it
down...

393
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:13,997
and memorized it.

394
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:15,597
Were you able to tell?

395
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,481
You were great.

396
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:21,241
Really? How was my pronunciation?

397
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:22,761
Good.

398
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:26,161
My goodness.

399
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:30,237
How are you so good at English?

400
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:31,637
I'm not good at all.

401
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:32,637
Of course, she's good.

402
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,397
No wonder Claire won the Grand
Award.

403
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:37,321
My goodness. Did you teach her?

404
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,841
Not just English.

405
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:43,077
She worked as an art therapist...

406
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,437
until recently at a university
hospital.

407
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:46,917
I see.

408
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:49,545
(Ji-a)

409
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:59,077
(Ms. Yoon)

410
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,441
Yes.

411
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:04,321
This is how I should start.

412
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:07,081
Unfortunately,

413
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:09,881
as of today...

414
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,561
What if it's only unfortunate for
me?

415
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,361
That would be awkward.

416
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,881
Due to...

417
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:37,636
an unavoidable reason...

418
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,357
(Message from Ji-a)

419
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,200
You're late today.

420
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:43,561
Aren't you coming?

421
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:02,797
Due to an unavoidable reason,

422
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:05,281
I won't be giving Min-ho rides
anymore.

423
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,361
What's wrong?

424
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:10,841
Who is it from?

425
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:12,801
Well...

426
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:15,641
That's...

427
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,037
Are you really going to...

428
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,841
accept them in Class A?

429
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,401
Are you crazy?

430
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,521
Right?

431
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,997
It's a mess in the academy...

432
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,876
after the speech contest.

433
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,601
What are you going to do?

434
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:37,077
If you just say no,

435
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:38,396
they won't listen.

436
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,677
Of course not.

437
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,437
That's what I'm saying.

438
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:43,437
They won't walk out on their own.

439
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:45,881
We'll have to make them leave on
their own.

440
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,881
That way,

441
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,797
they won't cause any problems.

442
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:51,200
Right.

443
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:53,477
But last time I noticed...

444
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,717
she was a handful.

445
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:57,396
She was showing off big time...

446
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,361
for winning a single award.

447
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,561
What an eyesore.

448
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:05,761
Still, it's the benefit.

449
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:09,801
Whose side are you on?

450
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,917
They're on the same side,

451
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:14,876
so she can't stand to hear it.

452
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,037
No, Ms. Song. What I mean is...

453
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,396
From now on, you don't have to join
us...

454
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,041
at the moms' meeting for Class A.

455
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:22,720
No.

456
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:25,761
It was my mistake.

457
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:27,717
Did you say you worked at the same
company...

458
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,561
as Claire's mom?

459
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,881
Yes.

460
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:33,636
Are you pretending to be nice...

461
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,161
or are you being a fool?

462
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,517
You quit your job for your child...

463
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,521
so you could give her rides to the
academy.

464
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,597
And only after winning a prize in a
speech contest,

465
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:44,561
her child is going up to Class A.

466
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:46,841
Don't you feel it's unfair?

467
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,441
You need to intervene quickly...

468
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,761
and nip problems in the bud.

469
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:58,517
I forgot. I brought a cake on my
way.

470
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,797
Shall I go to the kitchen...

471
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:02,437
and cut some for you?

472
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,117
I can do that.

473
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:06,797
You can stay here.

474
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:08,681
All right, then.

475
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:14,720
What are you doing?

476
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:16,521
You should go and help her.

477
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:21,321
Okay.

478
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,121
Excuse me. Can you clean this up?

479
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:30,041
Okay.

480
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:34,801
Goodness.

481
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:44,881
Huh?

482
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,957
What's this?

483
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:52,401
Did she throw this away?

484
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:53,117
(Top Excellence Award)

485
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,481
She's unbelievable.

486
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,617
(Myeongseong)

487
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:09,081
Number seven, please.

488
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,837
- Number seven. - Really?

489
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:13,521
Let me take a look.

490
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,761
I saw it was seven.

491
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:22,241
Why is this ball here?

492
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:48,906
(Jung-eun)

493
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,727
(Jung-eun)

494
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,291
Today, Seo-yoon...

495
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:02,453
placed first...

496
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:04,257
in the speech contest.

497
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:06,137
Tommy placed second.

498
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:08,297
And Seo-yoon placed first!

499
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:11,373
Finally, she's moving to Class A at
Big Parker.

500
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,835
(Jung-eun)

501
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:22,177
No.

502
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:25,498
She said she'll make Seo-yoon...
go to Gongnam Elementary.

503
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:45,046
Where are you going this early?

504
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,762
Did I wake you up?

505
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:50,326
You should get some more sleep.

506
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:53,517
Where are you going?

507
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:55,677
Well, it's...

508
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:00,277
I'll go and be a devoted son today.

509
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:03,237
What did you say?

510
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,556
It's nothing.

511
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,397
Don't worry.

512
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:09,757
See you.

513
00:23:11,897 --> 00:23:13,197
Honey...

514
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:21,397
Hey...

515
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:32,943
(Madam Shin's Gukbap)

516
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,793
(Grand Award Winner Hong Seo-yoon, )

517
00:23:40,817 --> 00:23:43,751
(Madam Shin's Granddaughter)

518
00:23:55,857 --> 00:23:58,517
I heard you have more customers
these days.

519
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:00,232
Don't get me started.

520
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,433
I'm so busy standing here in the
kitchen all day.

521
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:02,993
You must not even have time to
count all your money.

522
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,917
Shall I go and count it for you?

523
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,593
Counting money is my only joy.

524
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:07,633
I've counted it already.

525
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:09,712
Don't forget to boil that meat
thoroughly.

526
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:11,633
Don't worry. I finished it.

527
00:24:11,657 --> 00:24:13,197
Gosh, it's hot!

528
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,877
Look at you.

529
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,556
Are you okay?

530
00:24:17,017 --> 00:24:18,153
Come on.

531
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:19,833
Are you worried about me?

532
00:24:19,857 --> 00:24:21,157
Don't get me wrong.

533
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:22,712
I called you to help me out here,

534
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,113
and you'll be useless if you hurt
your hand.

535
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:25,837
How sweet.

536
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:28,077
Goodness.

537
00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:31,073
Mom, you know...

538
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:32,472
I have no money.

539
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:33,837
What?

540
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:36,073
I can tell what you are up to.

541
00:24:36,097 --> 00:24:37,712
You really have no money?

542
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:39,472
No, not for you.

543
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:41,997
Then how about for Seo-yoon?

544
00:24:42,217 --> 00:24:43,553
Why would that child need money
from me?

545
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:46,113
See? You only know how to make
money.

546
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:48,593
You have no idea what's going on in
the world.

547
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,193
- What? - Mom.

548
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:53,437
Do you know how much money you need
to raise a child?

549
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:55,353
You need money because you're
greedy as a parent.

550
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:56,472
Don't think about following other
parents...

551
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:57,833
and doing what they do.

552
00:24:57,857 --> 00:25:00,277
Seo-yoon is a genius!

553
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:02,913
You were called a genius too, when
you were little.

554
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:03,953
Stop exaggerating.

555
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:05,113
Seo-yoon entered the speech
contest...

556
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,073
and won the Grand Award.

557
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:09,077
That's why you hung the banner
here!

558
00:25:09,256 --> 00:25:10,677
That's true.

559
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:12,637
So how much do you need?

560
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,793
I need 300 million won for now.
Then...

561
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,273
- Hey! - You surprised me.

562
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:17,673
You're out of your mind.

563
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:19,473
You don't have to leave me...

564
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:20,833
an inheritance later.

565
00:25:20,857 --> 00:25:23,633
Can't you lend me some money when I
need it?

566
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,753
My goodness, you punk.

567
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:27,473
It's like you're wishing me...

568
00:25:27,497 --> 00:25:28,593
dead now!

569
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:30,073
What are you saying?

570
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:32,593
Stop talking nonsense and get out!

571
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:34,233
Yes, I will get out.

572
00:25:34,257 --> 00:25:35,797
You can just give me the money.

573
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:37,113
I can't.

574
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,353
300 million? I can't believe it.

575
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:39,353
Then you can give it in
installments.

576
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:40,433
You can give me 10 million won 30
times.

577
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:41,353
How about that? Isn't it a good
idea?

578
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:42,797
Let go of my hands.

579
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:44,313
Close your mouth and work, or
leave!

580
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:45,877
My gosh.

581
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:48,153
I'm not going to see you again!

582
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:50,313
How come I have a son like you?

583
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:51,553
Goodness gracious.

584
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:52,953
- Ma'am! - What?

585
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:54,753
- Old lady. - How dare you!

586
00:25:54,777 --> 00:25:56,033
I'm not your son anymore.

587
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:57,393
I'm not going to say goodbye.

588
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,637
Look at you.

589
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:01,197
Hey!

590
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:12,673
Hello. How are you?

591
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,513
- How are you? - What brings you
here?

592
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:17,157
I was just passing by.

593
00:26:17,537 --> 00:26:19,193
How is your business?

594
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:20,393
Great. Thanks to you.

595
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:22,077
Everything is perfect.

596
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:23,273
Congratulations.

597
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:24,313
I have customers.

598
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:25,793
- Please excuse me. - Sure.

599
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,877
Welcome.

600
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:32,317
This shop isn't mine anymore.

601
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:34,317
The bank owns it now.

602
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:37,513
Gosh, I must have been crazy.

603
00:26:37,537 --> 00:26:39,877
It's all because of the coin!

604
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:43,357
Gosh, I'm going to lose this too.

605
00:26:44,377 --> 00:26:46,877
If Jung-eun finds out, she'll file
for divorce.

606
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,877
Ms. Lee.

607
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:51,677
Please take care of this.

608
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:53,397
By the way,

609
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,637
did you apply for the loan?

610
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,713
Now, I'm a resident of Gongnam-
dong.

611
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:00,073
I don't need to register my address
falsely.

612
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:01,513
Oh, my.

613
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,233
Is the marketing plan for our new
product...

614
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:04,953
proceeding all right?

615
00:27:04,977 --> 00:27:06,273
I'll finish it by next week.

616
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:07,873
- Min-hee. - Yes.

617
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:09,273
Did you send the data of customer
reviews?

618
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:11,113
Yes, I sent it to your email.

619
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:12,193
Okay.

620
00:27:12,217 --> 00:27:14,877
Ms. Lee, you need to handle the TR
case quickly,

621
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:16,953
but we take precedence. Don't
forget that.

622
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:19,597
Of course, I understand.

623
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,957
Why? Do you need to leave?

624
00:27:22,097 --> 00:27:25,397
It's a very important day.

625
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,833
There's a get-together for Class
A...

626
00:27:26,857 --> 00:27:28,397
at Seo-yoon's academy.

627
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:40,397
Why isn't anyone coming?

628
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:44,237
Gosh.

629
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:55,397
Goodness.

630
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:57,397
Oh, gosh.

631
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,597
Are you here for the get-together
for Class A?

632
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,677
Yes, and who are you?

633
00:28:12,897 --> 00:28:14,593
I'm Seo-yoon's mom...

634
00:28:14,617 --> 00:28:15,793
I mean Claire's mom.

635
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:17,117
I see.

636
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:19,433
Nice to meet you.

637
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:21,193
I'm Tae-rin's mom.

638
00:28:21,217 --> 00:28:23,557
I've heard a lot about you from
Tae-rin.

639
00:28:24,097 --> 00:28:25,517
Same here.

640
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:27,997
Please sit here.

641
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:29,753
Excuse me?

642
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:32,717
This area is for moms in Class A.

643
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,077
I see.

644
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:36,073
Is there a separate area for each
class?

645
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:37,397
Yes.

646
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,033
It stings.

647
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:42,997
Gosh, really.

648
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,837
The static gets worse...

649
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:46,473
during the winter.

650
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:47,793
This is new. You can have it.

651
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:49,553
Thank you.

652
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:51,277
It's a very good product.

653
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:55,677
Actually, I'm a marketer at Aaes.

654
00:28:55,737 --> 00:28:57,833
For skincare products, rather than
my company,

655
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,517
TR produces better items.

656
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,677
I heard you're a working mom too.

657
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,877
Right.

658
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:08,717
To be honest,

659
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:10,717
I slept only four hours last night.

660
00:29:10,977 --> 00:29:12,877
I feel so tired now.

661
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:15,597
Goodness. I see.

662
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,917
I also have a lot of work to do
these days.

663
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:19,353
I'm darn busy...

664
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:21,157
that I'm not in my right mind.

665
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:44,782
What are you talking about, Ms.
Song?

666
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:47,222
She can't just join Class A like
that.

667
00:29:47,882 --> 00:29:49,698
The benefit of winning the speech
contest...

668
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:52,102
only applies to skipping the level
test for Class A.

669
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:54,338
You didn't say that before.

670
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:56,258
Children who fall behind in every
class...

671
00:29:56,282 --> 00:29:57,942
can't stay in Class A.

672
00:29:58,642 --> 00:29:59,938
"Fall behind"?

673
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:01,742
Who's falling behind? Seo-yoon?

674
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,222
Are you not confident?

675
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:04,578
That's nonsense.

676
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,422
She didn't win the Grand Award by
luck.

677
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,022
Then,

678
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:10,942
you can give it a try.

679
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:26,298
So, what do we need to do?

680
00:30:26,322 --> 00:30:28,738
First of all, get your child
vaccinated for the flu.

681
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:29,778
(Mission to enter Class A, flu
shot)

682
00:30:29,802 --> 00:30:32,218
With many children in the same
classroom,

683
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:33,538
they become prone to infections.

684
00:30:33,562 --> 00:30:35,062
That's right.

685
00:30:35,122 --> 00:30:36,258
In addition,

686
00:30:36,282 --> 00:30:38,902
both of you meet many people,

687
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:40,662
being working moms.

688
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,342
You're right.

689
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:46,778
To keep our children healthy,

690
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:48,102
I can do that.

691
00:30:53,162 --> 00:30:54,862
All right, I will.

692
00:30:55,322 --> 00:30:57,018
And what else do I need to do?

693
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,018
Go to a large hospital...

694
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,498
and get her psychologically tested.

695
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:00,658
(Mission 2 to enter Class A,
psychological test)

696
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:02,938
If your child can't focus in class,

697
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,498
other students in Class A...

698
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:06,458
will suffer.

699
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:07,698
She's right.

700
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:09,338
Right before entering elementary
school,
children are totally sensitive.

701
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:10,902
Children are totally sensitive.

702
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:14,542
But a psychological test within two
weeks?

703
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:16,178
Even if I make an appointment now,

704
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:17,618
I will have to wait at least a
month.

705
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,582
We all did that, Jung-eun.

706
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:22,342
If you can't do it,

707
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,062
you'd better give up.

708
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:33,018
All right, I will do it.

709
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:34,018
Are we done now?

710
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,382
No, not yet.

711
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:37,422
The most important one remains.

712
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:40,338
The Lucid children's intelligence
test.

713
00:31:40,362 --> 00:31:41,698
(Mission 3, Lucid children's
intelligence test)

714
00:31:41,722 --> 00:31:42,658
Pardon?

715
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:45,102
If she's within the top one
percent, we'll accept her.

716
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:48,582
But Tommy is within the top 0.1
percent!

717
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:50,702
We can cut her some slack.

718
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:53,182
She won the Grand Award, after all.

719
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:59,142
Why? Don't you think she can make
it?

720
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:01,258
If you don't think she can,

721
00:32:01,282 --> 00:32:03,538
she needs to take the level test.

722
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:04,862
Not at all.

723
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:06,498
She will take the Lucid test.

724
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:09,498
She needs to take the test...

725
00:32:09,522 --> 00:32:10,938
at the gifted academy we designate.

726
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,178
These days, there are so many
gifted academies...

727
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:15,498
that we can't trust the test
results.

728
00:32:15,522 --> 00:32:16,942
That's what I'm saying.

729
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,258
When children take the test at
those places...

730
00:32:18,282 --> 00:32:19,818
and get a good result,

731
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:21,898
people believe that their
children...

732
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:23,942
are actually gifted.

733
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:28,982
So where's this place?

734
00:32:29,042 --> 00:32:30,782
CM Gifted Academy.

735
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:34,142
We can trust that institution.

736
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:36,378
I will make an appointment...

737
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:38,182
so that she can take the test.

738
00:32:38,642 --> 00:32:40,862
But it should be done within two
weeks.

739
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:44,022
Doing it within two weeks...

740
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:47,422
I mean, so soon?

741
00:32:48,282 --> 00:32:49,822
How about you?

742
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,778
I will take this opportunity to get
her tested.

743
00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:55,138
I'm also curious...

744
00:32:55,162 --> 00:32:56,862
about Tae-rin's test result.

746

this time.

747
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:11,982
Of course.

I wish you good luck.

749

750
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:31,822
Sure.

751
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:34,302
Don't you think Seo-yoon can make
it?

752
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:37,182

before.

753
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:39,222

754

760
00:34:00,242 --> 00:34:02,938
But now she needs to take the Lucid
test for children.

761
00:34:02,962 --> 00:34:05,618

762
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:07,542

She said...

765
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:13,218
she'd make an appointment for you.

766
00:34:13,242 --> 00:34:14,378
My daughter can't take the test...

767
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:15,978

preparation.

768
00:34:16,002 --> 00:34:18,222
Joining Class A depends on the
result.

769
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,378
I think, for practice,

770
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:21,898
she needs to take the test...

771
00:34:21,922 --> 00:34:23,782
at another gifted academy.

772
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:26,662
Do we need to do that?

773
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:28,218

list...

774
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:29,742

That's enough.

782
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,742
She's saying she doesn't want to
accept Seo-yoon.

783
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:50,182
Why are you obsessed with Class A?

784
00:34:51,642 --> 00:34:53,982
Seo-yoon did such a great job.

785
00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:56,018
And you're saying I just have to
give up?

786

of these?

several days...

ahead.

opportunity.

Why are you quitting, not her?

811
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:18,178
I will get a new job soon.

812

first,

Why, because of someone I don't
even know,

can't I go to the school I want?

00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,462
What's the earliest date available?

930
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:01,622
What? Really?

931
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:03,861
Both of them tomorrow?

932
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,662
Yes! It's possible.

933
00:43:06,242 --> 00:43:07,542
Okay.

934
00:43:07,882 --> 00:43:09,182
Okay.

935
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:15,142
Where are you?

936
00:43:15,242 --> 00:43:17,622
Where else? The academy.

937
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:19,942
Seo-yoon has her gifted academy
exam tomorrow.

938
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:21,818
Tomorrow?

939
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:23,258
You said it's in two weeks!

940
00:43:23,282 --> 00:43:24,537
I think we should do a practice
run,

941
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,577
just in case.

942
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:28,458
It's a bit far, so she needs to
head straight there...

943
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:29,782
after the academy.

944
00:43:29,922 --> 00:43:31,858
I'll send you the location.

945
00:43:31,882 --> 00:43:33,462
And how about the hospital?

946
00:43:34,162 --> 00:43:36,378
I'm going after the academy.

947
00:43:36,402 --> 00:43:38,861
You are? Thanks so much.

948
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:42,138
I'm both loved and hated a dozen
times a day.

949
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,982
Come on.

950
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:45,861
Love you.

951
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:51,222
Let's go.

952
00:43:52,122 --> 00:43:53,422
There.

953
00:43:55,522 --> 00:43:56,778
Bye.

954
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:58,258
Bye, Tae-rin.

955
00:43:58,282 --> 00:43:59,858
- Bye. - It must be a busy day
today.

956
00:43:59,882 --> 00:44:01,942
- Good luck. - Thanks.

957
00:44:02,882 --> 00:44:04,182
What?

958
00:44:04,762 --> 00:44:06,502
Look who it is!

959
00:44:11,162 --> 00:44:12,537
Hello.

960
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:14,098
- Hello. - Hello.

961
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:16,057
I heard you got fired from your
driving duty,

962
00:44:16,081 --> 00:44:17,338
so what brings you here?

963
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:20,702
I think Tommy's mom already fetched
him.

964
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:23,622
I happened to be in the area,

965
00:44:24,322 --> 00:44:26,302
and I was just walking past the
building...

966
00:44:26,561 --> 00:44:29,062
- when I saw... - I see.

967
00:44:29,482 --> 00:44:31,338
You happened to pass by the
building...

968
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:33,542
just when we were coming out.

969
00:44:35,802 --> 00:44:37,262
Goodness.

970
00:44:37,402 --> 00:44:38,858
I have plans,

971
00:44:38,882 --> 00:44:40,861
so we should get going, Tae-rin.

972
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:44,458
Have a good time, you two.

973
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:45,658
Let's go.

974
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:47,498
- Bye, sis. - Bye.

975
00:44:47,522 --> 00:44:48,818
- Let's go. - Bye, Tae-rin.

976
00:44:48,842 --> 00:44:50,342
Bye.

977
00:44:50,962 --> 00:44:52,858
We should get going too.

978
00:44:52,882 --> 00:44:54,182
Right.

979
00:44:54,882 --> 00:44:56,298
I am sorry,

980
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:58,822
but I need to take Seo-yoon
somewhere.

981
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:00,702
Right.

982
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:05,742
Where are you going? May I tag
along?

983
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:07,338
Sorry?

984
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:09,618
I have nothing to do now, you see.

985
00:45:09,642 --> 00:45:11,818
Are you bored?

986
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,142
Yes.

987
00:45:13,402 --> 00:45:15,858
I'm a little bored, honestly.

988
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,942
We're going to the hospital.

989
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:19,302
Hospital?

990
00:45:20,442 --> 00:45:21,818
Are you unwell?

991
00:45:21,842 --> 00:45:23,422
No, not me.

992
00:45:24,002 --> 00:45:26,942
Seo-yoon has a psychological exam
today...

993
00:45:27,242 --> 00:45:29,302
at the hospital I used to work at.

994
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:33,062
I'll drive you there.

995
00:45:35,642 --> 00:45:37,782
I'm a great driver.

996
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:39,861
I have...

997
00:45:40,802 --> 00:45:42,262
plenty of time as well.

998
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,138
What plans do you have?

999
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:47,818
When did we start having secrets?

1000
00:45:47,842 --> 00:45:49,702
I have no plans.

1001
00:45:49,762 --> 00:45:52,698
It was just me knowing the right
time to leave.

1002
00:45:52,722 --> 00:45:55,418
Did you forget what I told you last
time, Tae-rin?

1003
00:45:55,442 --> 00:45:57,858
You've got to know when to stay and
when to get out.

1004
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:58,978
Did you already forget?

1005
00:45:59,002 --> 00:46:01,298
But wasn't it too deliberate?

1006
00:46:01,322 --> 00:46:03,942
People should be honest!

1007
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:05,418
Seo-yoon and Min-ho...

1008
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:08,698
Girl, did you hear anything I just
said?

1009
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:11,858
What do you know when you haven't
even lived 10 years?

1010
00:46:11,882 --> 00:46:14,537
Why would you bring up age right
now?

1011
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:16,458
I'm turning 70 soon, you see.

1012
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,818
I'm a solid seven.

1013
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,218
Goodness gracious me.

1014
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:22,818
Who raised you?

1015
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:25,418
Who do you think? It was you, of
course.

1016
00:46:25,442 --> 00:46:27,782
Aren't you proud you raised me
well?

1017

(Hanguk University Hospital)

1018
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:35,302
You're going to draw a house, a
tree, and a person now.

1019
00:46:35,402 --> 00:46:36,978
Let's start with the house. How
does that sound?

1020
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,381
Okay.

1021
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:58,057
Doctor, I think I drew it wrong.

1022
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,418
Can I erase it and try again?

1023
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:02,222
Just draw however you want.

1025
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:33,302
You're here, Dr. Yoon.

1026
00:47:35,282 --> 00:47:37,057
Thank you, Director.

1027
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:38,422
No problem at all.

1028
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:40,418
There's a big gap in the art
therapy studio...

1029
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:42,542
with you gone.

1030
00:47:43,162 --> 00:47:44,702
I'm sorry.

1031
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:46,618
I've heard...

1032
00:47:46,642 --> 00:47:48,498
that Su-chan is doing much better,

1033
00:47:48,522 --> 00:47:49,978
and his mom's been calm.

1034
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:51,901
That's a relief.

1035
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:53,662
That brings me to ask you...

1036
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:55,978
You should come back.

1037
00:47:56,002 --> 00:47:58,102
Your position is still available.

1038
00:47:58,282 --> 00:47:59,782
Right.

1039
00:48:00,322 --> 00:48:01,537
Well...

1040
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:03,422
Take your time to think about it.

1041
00:48:03,962 --> 00:48:05,582
I'll be waiting.

1042
00:48:21,202 --> 00:48:24,142
What's on your mind? Just do it.

1043
00:48:24,842 --> 00:48:26,381
Do what?

1044
00:48:26,842 --> 00:48:28,542
I overheard earlier.

1045
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:30,901
Right.

1046
00:48:32,002 --> 00:48:33,818
It's something you love, right?

1047
00:48:33,842 --> 00:48:35,582
Why hesitate?

1048
00:48:36,442 --> 00:48:39,381
It's Seo-yoon's exam tomorrow.

1049
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:41,342
I can't just quit.

1050
00:48:41,402 --> 00:48:42,778
If you don't have time,

1051
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:44,178
I'll pitch in with the rides.

1052
00:48:44,202 --> 00:48:46,698
I will drive you and Seo-yoon.

1053
00:48:46,722 --> 00:48:49,218
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

1054
00:48:49,242 --> 00:48:51,542
Now that I'm on break, I have a lot
of free time.

1055
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:53,542
Call me anytime.

1056
00:48:59,642 --> 00:49:01,342
Why are you looking at me like
that?

1057
00:49:03,842 --> 00:49:05,582
You just reminded me of something.

1058
00:49:06,002 --> 00:49:07,302
Sorry?

1059
00:49:08,802 --> 00:49:10,462
I used to have someone like you...

1060
00:49:10,842 --> 00:49:13,342
who would talk to me like you,
Professor.

1061
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:18,537
I am sorry. I shouldn't have said
it.

1062
00:49:18,561 --> 00:49:19,861
It's okay.

1063
00:49:22,601 --> 00:49:24,222
I actually forgot about it,

1064
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:31,258
but thanks to you, I remembered
something good.

1065
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:32,662
Thank you for that.

1066
00:49:40,442 --> 00:49:42,378
I completely forgot about Seo-
yoon's vaccination!

1067
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:43,982

1069
00:49:53,522 --> 00:49:55,422
- Mom. - You're home.

1070

You're back.

1071
00:49:56,802 --> 00:49:58,742
You're home early.

- Well done. - Seo-yoon.

1073
00:50:01,362 --> 00:50:03,218
Seo-yoon, you have the exam
tomorrow,

1074
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:05,298
so let's study a little...

1075
00:50:05,322 --> 00:50:06,858
before dinner, okay?

1076
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:09,458
What are you doing, making her
study after a flu shot?

1077
00:50:09,482 --> 00:50:11,058
Can't you see she's exhausted?

1078
00:50:11,082 --> 00:50:12,502
Let her rest.

1079
00:50:13,002 --> 00:50:14,902
Stop it, Mom.

1080
00:50:16,762 --> 00:50:18,182
She's fine, see?

1081
00:50:18,402 --> 00:50:20,138
Just a little bit, all right?

1082
00:50:20,162 --> 00:50:22,782
But I want to watch Pinkru.

1083
00:50:22,962 --> 00:50:25,538
We'll watch it later, okay?

1084
00:50:25,562 --> 00:50:27,858
After the exam is over, we'll watch
it. Okay?

1085
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:29,778
I feel dizzy though.

1086
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:31,102
You feel dizzy?

1087
00:50:31,482 --> 00:50:33,178
Is it serious, Seo-yoon?

1088
00:50:33,202 --> 00:50:34,618
No, just a little bit.

1089
00:50:34,642 --> 00:50:36,018
Goodness.

1090
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:37,618
See? I told you this would happen
if you pushed her.

1091
00:50:37,642 --> 00:50:39,062
This isn't for me, you know.

1092
00:50:41,282 --> 00:50:43,338
Goodness, no.

1093
00:50:43,362 --> 00:50:44,498
Don't say that.

1094
00:50:44,522 --> 00:50:47,542
She can get dizzy, you know.

1095
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:49,698
Princess, let's go lie down.

1096
00:50:49,722 --> 00:50:51,982
Daddy will make it go away.

1097
00:50:52,522 --> 00:50:54,222
- Let's go. - Hey...

1098
00:50:54,362 --> 00:50:56,582
Let's go to your room.

1099
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:01,542
But she needs to prepare.

1100
00:51:06,082 --> 00:51:08,058
Seo-yoon, was it a tiring day?

1101
00:51:08,082 --> 00:51:09,382
It was.

1102
00:51:09,682 --> 00:51:11,222
Let's get some sleep then.

1103
00:51:11,282 --> 00:51:12,658
You should rest well...

1104
00:51:12,682 --> 00:51:14,218
so you're ready for your exam
tomorrow.

1105
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:16,618
Getting good rest is important,

1106
00:51:16,642 --> 00:51:18,138
especially during these growing
years, you know?

1107
00:51:18,162 --> 00:51:19,658
Only then will you be able to stay
focused.

1108
00:51:19,682 --> 00:51:20,778
Okay?

1109
00:51:20,802 --> 00:51:23,142
- Okay. - Good night.

1110
00:51:26,002 --> 00:51:27,342
Goodness.

1111
00:51:27,482 --> 00:51:30,742
I wish I could just sleep like
this, too.

1112
00:51:31,562 --> 00:51:33,502
Today's vaccination record.

1113
00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:36,578
Goodness.

1114
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:38,290
(Vaccinated)

1115
00:51:47,002 --> 00:51:48,578
Gosh.

1116
00:51:48,602 --> 00:51:50,978
She was such a pretty baby.

1117
00:51:51,002 --> 00:51:52,702
Are you saying she's not pretty
now?

1118
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:56,662
She's just as pretty now, of
course.

1119
00:51:57,002 --> 00:51:59,538
But she's even prettier when she's
not sick. Right?

1120
00:51:59,562 --> 00:52:01,542
- Thank you for taking her today. -
Wait.

1121
00:52:02,082 --> 00:52:03,938
Are you saying it's my fault she's
sick?

1122
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:06,382
Well, isn't it?

1123
00:52:08,002 --> 00:52:10,822
That's not it, you know.

1124
00:52:10,882 --> 00:52:13,458
Anyway, at least one mission is
complete.

1125
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:14,538
Wait, no!

1126
00:52:14,562 --> 00:52:16,582
The psychological exam too. We got
two done.

1127
00:52:17,082 --> 00:52:18,582
Two done.

1128
00:52:18,642 --> 00:52:20,062
Well done.

1129
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:23,822
You're here?

1130
00:52:23,922 --> 00:52:26,182
I'll be right down. I'll take the
elevator.

1131
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:28,262
Yes, Tae-rin's mom.

1132
00:52:29,002 --> 00:52:30,342
Okay.

1133
00:52:35,002 --> 00:52:36,542
"Tae-rin's mom"?

1134
00:52:37,082 --> 00:52:39,338
You really didn't have to come all
the way here.

1135
00:52:39,362 --> 00:52:41,422
I could've just sent these to you.

1136
00:52:42,002 --> 00:52:43,538
Come on, you went through a lot to
get these.

1137
00:52:43,562 --> 00:52:45,502
I can't just take them for free.

1138
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,458
And...

1139
00:52:48,482 --> 00:52:51,702
thanks for the hand cream last
time.

1140
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:56,782
Goodness, this is a lot.

1141
00:53:00,562 --> 00:53:02,742
Does she really need to go through
all of these?

1142
00:53:03,002 --> 00:53:05,182
Seo-yoon already started.

1143
00:53:05,522 --> 00:53:06,578
Already?

1144
00:53:06,602 --> 00:53:08,302
We're on a tight schedule.

1145
00:53:08,762 --> 00:53:11,062
Goodness, Ms. Lee?

1146
00:53:13,562 --> 00:53:15,698
So, not a business meeting.

1147
00:53:15,722 --> 00:53:17,582
Looks like you have plenty of free
time.

1148
00:53:21,202 --> 00:53:24,022
Not your business. Can you go now?

1149
00:53:24,522 --> 00:53:26,582
What even is all this?

1150
00:53:27,002 --> 00:53:28,902
You've got your hands in a lot of
things.

1151
00:53:29,082 --> 00:53:30,578
By the way, you do realize your
meeting...

1152
00:53:30,602 --> 00:53:32,422
with the TR CEO is coming up,
right?

1153
00:53:32,802 --> 00:53:34,978
Yet here you are, sitting around
with another mom...

1154
00:53:35,002 --> 00:53:36,302
during office hours.

1155
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,578
I told you.

1156
00:53:38,602 --> 00:53:41,658
I'll get the meeting done before
the deadline.

1157
00:53:41,682 --> 00:53:45,142
Sure, sure. Whatever you say,
Senior Manager Lee.

1158
00:53:45,282 --> 00:53:46,862
Please make it happen.

1159
00:53:54,762 --> 00:53:56,542
Sorry about that.

1160
00:53:57,642 --> 00:53:59,182
She's quite rude.

1161
00:54:00,442 --> 00:54:02,462
Yeah, I can tell.

1162
00:54:03,122 --> 00:54:05,022
She also looks like she sucks at
her job.

1163
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,502
You're right.

1164

1166
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:21,182
I heard your exchange program got
approved.

1167
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:22,498
Did you see the email?

1168
00:54:22,522 --> 00:54:23,822
Yes.

1169
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:25,702
I'm looking at it now.

1170
00:54:25,882 --> 00:54:27,262
Congratulations.

1171
00:54:27,762 --> 00:54:29,102
Thanks.

1173
00:54:38,602 --> 00:54:41,142
Goodness, I'm late.

1174
00:54:42,962 --> 00:54:43,898
Seo-yoon, hurry.

1175
00:54:43,922 --> 00:54:45,618
We need extra time since it's our
first visit.

1176
00:54:45,642 --> 00:54:47,898
- Should we run? - Let's run!

1177
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:49,058
See you later!

1178
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:50,582
Bye!

1179
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:53,422
- Bye! - Bye!

1180
00:54:54,122 --> 00:54:55,862
We should get going too.

1181
00:54:56,962 --> 00:54:58,262
What?

1182
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:00,382
Oh, dear.

1183
00:55:09,002 --> 00:55:12,102
Who are you looking for with that
lovesick face?

1184
00:55:16,282 --> 00:55:18,058
Goodness gracious me.

1185
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,742
Watching him is painful.

1186
00:55:48,962 --> 00:55:50,538
Goodness.

1187
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:53,422
There's a person passing. Wait,
will you?

1188
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:00,742
Seo-yoon, are you okay?

1189
00:56:00,842 --> 00:56:02,142
Yes.

1190
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:09,502
Darn it!

1191
00:56:11,282 --> 00:56:12,378
This is so annoying.

1192
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:14,182
Too annoying.

1193
00:56:18,402 --> 00:56:19,458
Get out.

1194
00:56:19,482 --> 00:56:21,022
I'm scared.

1195
00:56:21,642 --> 00:56:23,942
It's okay, sweetie.

1196
00:56:24,362 --> 00:56:25,618
Get out!

1197
00:56:25,642 --> 00:56:27,342
Let's talk.

1198
00:56:28,162 --> 00:56:29,898
- Seo-yoon. Don't get out. - Darn
it.

1199
00:56:29,922 --> 00:56:31,578
- Lock the door, okay? - Won't you
get out?

1200
00:56:31,602 --> 00:56:32,902
Okay.
Get out of the car!

1201
00:56:33,362 --> 00:56:34,662
Get out of the car!

1202
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,378
I knew it.

1204
00:56:42,242 --> 00:56:44,138
Stay home if you can't drive.

1205
00:56:44,162 --> 00:56:45,938
Are you colorblind?

1206
00:56:45,962 --> 00:56:47,058
Didn't you see the green light?

1207
00:56:47,082 --> 00:56:49,138
You have to drive forward when it's
a green light!

1208
00:56:49,162 --> 00:56:50,542
Green light!

1209
00:56:51,402 --> 00:56:52,858
There was a pedestrian.

1210
00:56:52,882 --> 00:56:54,538
What was I supposed to do, run her
over?

1211
00:56:54,562 --> 00:56:56,218
This lady just doesn't get it!

1212
00:56:56,242 --> 00:56:57,538
I'm in a darn hurry!

1213
00:56:57,562 --> 00:56:59,578
I'll kick you!

1214
00:56:59,602 --> 00:57:01,218
I will just...

1215
00:57:01,242 --> 00:57:02,538
What are you doing?

1216
00:57:02,562 --> 00:57:03,898
What am I doing?

1217
00:57:03,922 --> 00:57:05,578
I will just hit you right in the
neck...

1218
00:57:05,602 --> 00:57:06,942
What?

1219
00:57:11,282 --> 00:57:12,858
- Move your car. - Who are you?

1220
00:57:12,882 --> 00:57:14,502
Let go of me.

1221
00:57:15,122 --> 00:57:17,178
- Are you okay? - I am not okay!

1222
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:18,902
Let go of me!

1223
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,822
Move your car, I said!

1224
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:23,542
Amazing!

1225
00:57:30,654 --> 00:57:33,342

special appearance.)

percent within two weeks!

1236
00:58:25,362 --> 00:58:26,298
I am sorry.

1237
00:58:26,322 --> 00:58:27,338
What happened?

1238
00:58:27,362 --> 00:58:28,338
What did the doctor say?

1239
00:58:28,362 --> 00:58:29,862
Jung-eun, seriously.

1240
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,618
Please give her one more chance. I
beg you.

1241
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,902
Is she out of her mind?
