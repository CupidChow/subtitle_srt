(Supported by Ministry of Science and
ICT and Korea Communications Agency)

00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:11,508
(All places, organizations, characters,
incidents,)

00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:12,588
(and backstories in this drama are
fictitious.)

5
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:13,708
(Child actors were accompanied by family...)

6
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:14,951
(and were kept safe.)

7
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:17,283
What?

8
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:19,783
I can't stand it anymore...

9
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:23,118
(Episode 2)

10
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:25,459
- Mom! - Are you crazy?

11
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,059
Why did you hit me?

12
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,939
You should be apologizing for what you did.

13
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,263
How dare you say so?

14
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:32,983
How do you feel getting hit in the back?

15
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:35,739
You should feel what we felt. That's poetic
justice.

16
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:36,983
Don't you think?

17
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:38,743
She's right.

18
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:41,263
How feisty.

19
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,183
My goodness.

20
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:46,543
I was wondering who was making such a
fuss.

21
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:48,939
She hit me.

22
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:50,343
Really?

23
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,219
Was it you?

24
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:58,219
This nanny met all my requirements.

25
00:00:58,243 --> 00:00:59,943
So I made an offer.

26
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:01,899
Take a look at this,

27
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:03,983
and tell me if there's anything you want to
add.

28
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,019
I'll give you extra 500,000 won to your
current salary,

29
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:08,579
and 50 percent more for overtime.

30
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:10,583
I guess you prefer cash for a holiday gift,
right?

31
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:13,663
You poached my kid's nanny,

32
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,579
- and you call that a job offer? - What?

33
00:01:15,603 --> 00:01:17,903
It's not like you made a contract for life.

34
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,619
You should know as a working mom.

35
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:22,979
People change jobs for better terms.

36
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:24,463
I'm sure you've seen that many times.

37
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:27,263
She can change jobs,

38
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:29,943
but she needs to give me some time.

39
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:31,979
We're both parents.

40
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:33,543
How inconsiderate is this?

41
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:34,943
Stop it.

42
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,019
They talk without much thought.

43
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:38,463
It's a waste of time to talk with them.

44
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:41,059
Like mother, like daughter.

45
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,863
Gosh.

46
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:46,459
Poor you.

47
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:47,742
Oh, my.

48
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:50,783
Like mother, like daughter?

49
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:54,859
Kids are in class here.

50
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:56,543
What on earth are you doing here?

51
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,462
Who are you now?

52
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:00,459
Mom.

53
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:02,619
You should stop.

54
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:03,779
What's wrong with you?

55
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:05,099
Move over.

56
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:06,343
What do you want?

57
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:09,459
Do you know where you are?

58
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:11,183
How dare you make a noise?

59
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:21,183
Ju-hee?

60
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:25,543
Ju-hee?

61
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:28,583
Right?

62
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,583
Song Ju-hee.

63
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,462
Do you know her?

64
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:42,623
You got the wrong person.

65
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:51,823
She says she's not her.

66
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:54,303
You're right.

67
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:57,063
I got the wrong person.

68
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:06,583
- Excuse me. - Yes?

69
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:08,059
If you needed a nanny,

70
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,543
you should have told me.

71
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:12,259
Ms. Song, that's not what happened...

72
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:14,343
I will recommend you a good nanny,

73
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:15,979
so let this one go.

74
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:17,383
Are you sure?

75
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:20,783
Excuse me. Wait a minute.

76
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:24,059
You should have given her a good
explanation.

77
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,663
How could you let this happen?

78
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:28,779
You don't have to come anymore.

79
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,143
What?

80
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:32,099
Hey, you!

81
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:33,299
Hey, you?

82
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:34,899
Didn't you hear her? The kids are in class
now.

83
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,503
You shouldn't raise your voice here!

84
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,623
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

85
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:42,143
What's wrong with these people?

86
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:43,899
Gosh.

87
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,543
How annoying!

88
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,063
Ms. Song, wait for me.

89
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:08,783
Who's Ju-hee?

90
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:11,379
I got the wrong person. Forget it.

91
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:13,183
Are you sure you got the wrong person?

92
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:14,943
Try to remember.

93
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:17,463
I got the wrong person, okay?

94
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:20,823
It's a bummer.

95
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:22,419
If you were acquainted with her,

96
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:24,943
you could pull a few strings for Seo-yoon.

97
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,903
- What do you mean? - She could have been
saved.

98
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:30,623
That woman is a lifesaver in Daechi-dong.

99
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:33,299
Her son, Tommy, is the top student here.

100
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:34,579
That's why everyone tries so hard...

101
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:36,299
to find favor in her eyes.

102
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:37,619
It's an academy where kids study.

103
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,503
Look what you've done.

104
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,623
She can take care of herself when she
grows up.

105
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:45,383
Dr. Yoon,

106
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,499
turn your head,

107
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,539
and look over there.

108
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:51,579
(English and math)

109
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:52,619
(Information session)

110
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:54,023
Can you see it?

111
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:57,019
She can take care of herself when she
grows up?

112
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,379
Meanwhile,

113
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:00,898
those who go to academies in this
neighborhood...

114
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:02,662
will be far ahead of her.

115
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:04,219
If we stop here,

116
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:05,659
she needs to catch up...

117
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:08,102
a lot more to study.

118
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:09,778
You're looking for a nanny, right?

119
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:10,982
What?

120
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:13,423
Of course, I am.

121
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:15,943
I need to look for a nanny.

122
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,579
Aren't you going?

123
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:20,102
Don't forget your meals.

124
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:45,299
Hello, this is Seo-yoon's mom.

125
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:46,459
Yes.

126
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,623
Are you available today?

127
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:53,223
Okay. I'll pay you for the interview
and transportation.

128
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:21,219
Please don't approach me. Not here.

129
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:23,539
No, not here.

130
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,699
My goodness. This is driving me crazy.

131
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:28,783
Somebody help me, please.

132
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,423
Excuse me.

133
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:35,863
This is insane. Why does it have to be me?

134
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:38,663
May I sit here?

135
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,343
Sure.

136
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,463
Are you here to pick up your grandchild?

137
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,819
This is my first time.

138
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,663
I'm here to pick up my granddaughter.

139
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:56,063
She's Seo-yoon in Class B.

140
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:59,259
I heard she's called Claire here.

141
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,543
Yes, I saw you earlier.

142
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,423
Thud.

143
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:06,223
This is how you hit Seo-yoon's nanny.

144
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:08,663
I see.

145
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,543
That's...

146
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:12,903
I shouldn't have done it.

147
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,183
I can understand.

148
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,983
I'm...

149
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:19,739
Tae-rin's grandma. Our granddaughters are
best friends.

150
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:21,103
It's nice to meet you.

151
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:23,663
You're Tae-rin's grandma.

152
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,939
I came to the right place.

153
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,459
It's amazing you decided...

154
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:29,983
to come and sit here in front of me.

155
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:31,463
I know.

156
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:34,539
By the way, how did you end up doing this?

157
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:35,499
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:37,859
- Since when did you do it? - Excuse me?

159
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:40,699
Taking care of your grandchild is not easy at
all.

160
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:42,219
I don't recommend it.

161
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,219
You shouldn't have set your foot in this.

162
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,183
What can you do about it now?

163
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,299
This is temporary.

164
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:51,459
That's how everyone starts doing it.

165
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:53,939
Listen to me carefully now.

166
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:55,499
Taking your grandchild to and from
academies...

167
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:56,659
is something you shouldn't have started...

168
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:57,659
in the first place.

169
00:07:57,683 --> 00:08:00,183
But you already started it, so you can't help
it.

170
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:01,899
You need to make your daughter...

171
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:04,183
give it up on her own.

172
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:06,339
- Yes. - In my case,

173
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:07,899
not to take care of my grandchild,

174
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:10,983
I've tried everything I could.

175
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:13,579
Can you give me an example?

176
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:16,259
As you can see, my dialect is fluent.

177
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:18,979
So I taught Tae-rin my dialect...

178
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:21,379
thinking it would astonish her mom.

179
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:24,459
I guess Tae-rin didn't have a talent for a
dialect.

180
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:25,659
You're wrong.

181
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:27,863
Since I taught her my dialect...

182
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:32,382
My pumpkin.

183
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:35,502
How did the level test go?

184
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:37,659
Her English speaking...

185
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,699
is so excellent.

186
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:43,263
However, her grammar is just a little...

187
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:46,459
Grandma, this teacher is a bit like the thing.

188
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:49,699
- In what way? - She's so cute.

189
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:52,859
But what does the word you said mean?

190
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,143
It means you're a bit like the thing.

191
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,663
Don't you understand?

192
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:58,659
We would love to have her...

193
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:01,219
Everyone said...

194
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:04,423
that she was so cute.

195
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:07,619
Who knows?

196
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:08,859
You could teach Seo-yoon a dialect too.

197
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,259
Do you know one?

198
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,263
I don't know how to speak a dialect.

199
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:16,819
I can teach her English, though.

200
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:19,699
English. I see.

201
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:20,739
Your daughter intentionally made you...

202
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:22,419
sit your granddaughter.

203
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:24,463
You should keep doing this.

204
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:26,502
I guess we'll meet every day.

205
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:29,303
I have a job.

206
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:34,459
Can you recommend any other solution?

207
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:37,058
To shock my daughter,

208
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,178
I intentionally taught Tae-rin...

209
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,622
how to play flower cards.

210
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:45,699
All right!

211
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:47,303
What's this?

212
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:51,298
Great!

213
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:54,499
Oh, my. You're sweeping everything.

214
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:55,459
Two.

215
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,739
She wasn't good with numbers,

216
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,499
You're ruined.

217
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:02,659
but she learned addition and multiplication
so fast.

218
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:03,979
Three go!

219
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,979
She shouted, "Three go."

220
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:08,178
Her mother didn't understand how I felt...

221
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:10,823
and asked me when I taught her math.

222
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,899
That's how I'm in charge of bringing her...

223
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:16,502
to and from the academies.

224
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:18,459
It's insane.

225
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:23,023
But I really have to do this just for a while.

226
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:24,579
I mean it.

227
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,583
No parents can win their children.

228
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:28,259
Isn't she your real daughter?

229
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:29,983
She is my daughter.

230
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:33,543
Still, I'm going to do this only for a while.

231
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:37,459
That's what everyone thinks at first.

232
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:38,743
However...

233
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:41,622
Grandma!

234
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:43,183
Jinny!

235
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,659
Jinny? What does that mean?

236
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:48,703
That's my English name.

237
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,259
Are you done with your class already?

238
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,539
No, it's a break.

239
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:54,619
Grandma, didn't you bring some rice punch?

240
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:55,779
I'm thirsty.

241
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:58,663
Do you think I didn't bring it? I have rice
punch.

242
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:01,339
Grandma, give me apple juice.

243
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:02,819
Apple juice for Seo-yoon.

244
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:05,263
Let's see what I got.

245
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:07,583
Eggs.

246
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:11,063
I have eggs, rice punch,

247
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:14,223
and apple juice for Seo-yoon.

248
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:16,263
Do you want some tomatoes?

249
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:19,298
Eat some tomatoes too. What's this?

250
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:21,863
Look. What do you want to have?

251
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:29,023
Your home is far from the academy.

252
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:31,622
I should have checked it earlier.

253
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:32,699
That's...

254
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:34,979
It's hard to find a parking spot in Daechi-
dong,

255
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:37,699
and there's a serious traffic jam at this hour.

256
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:38,619
You need to reserve a public parking lot...

257
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:39,899
near the academy...

258
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:42,023
if you want me to take this job.

259
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:43,783
Yes, I'll do that.

260
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:46,983
If you work for my family,

261
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:50,619
you can buy cosmetics at the employee
discount rate.

262
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,579
You can get a 40 percent discount...

263
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:53,263
for family restaurants and cafes too.

264
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:55,819
- That's nice. - Isn't it? So...

265
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:57,743
So how much do I get paid?

266
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,023
That's...

267
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:07,663
I think I can give you 2,500,000 won.

268
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,579
Ma'am, I'm sorry...

269
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:18,383
My child, compared to other kids, is very
gentle.

270
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,779
She's not picky with food,

271
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:21,139
so it's so easy to take care of her...

272
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:23,583
Still, a kid is a kid.

273
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,539
It takes much more effort than you think...

274
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,863
to take care of kids.

275
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:31,383
Then...

276
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:34,423
may I ask how much you want?

277
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:39,663
It's because I'm in a pressing situation.

278
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:44,223
I hope we can negotiate your salary a bit.

279
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:45,863
I'm sorry,

280
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,543
but I'll take a rain check on that.

281
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,903
Well...

282
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,783
A rain check?

283
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,223
When?

284
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,383
After Seo-yoon has grown up?

285
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:14,663
I'm sorry for what happened in the academy
today.

286
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:16,743
I heard about it.

287
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,503
Does apologizing solve everything?

288
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:21,419
You must have looked down on Big Parker...

289
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:23,663
to bring someone like her.

290
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,699
I'll take responsibility...

291
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,343
not to let this happen again with Claire's
family.

292
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:30,423
How can you take responsibility?

293
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,583
We can let her leave.

294
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:35,423
We need to strangle an initiative at birth.

295
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,619
Ms. Song, I'm asking you.

296
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:39,819
As you know, Claire waited for several
years...

297
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:42,503
to take the level test and enter Big Parker.

298
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:44,859
If she gets kicked out now, where can she
go?

299
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:46,819
She can go to somewhere on her level,

300
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:49,623
like any academy in her neighborhood.

301
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,023
You also provided the cause for what
happened today.

302
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:56,143
Can you hear yourself?

303
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:58,503
I'm the victim.

304
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:01,863
I need to get a new nanny too.

305
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:04,859
Ms. Lee goes to work, so she would hardly
come...

306
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:06,539
to the academy.

307
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:07,979
She's looking for a new nanny,

308
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:09,059
and her mother will take care of Claire...

309
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,343
in the meantime.

310
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:13,463
What's the name of Claire's grandmother?

311
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,619
I don't know,

312
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:24,103
but I heard that she's an art therapist at a
hospital.

313
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,143
She also worked at a school before.

314
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:41,143
If it happens again,

315
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:43,943
it won't be just a warning.

316
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,979
Of course, I understand. Thank you, Ms.
Song.

317
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:50,943
What? Are you going to let her come to the
academy?

318
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:56,703
Ms. Song!

319
00:14:57,923 --> 00:15:00,339
- Wait for me! - Take care.

320
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:01,623
Ms. Song!

321
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:03,983
Lee Jung-eun, you owe me big time.

322
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,112
(Jung-eun)

323
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:14,539
Hello, Ji-suk.

324
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:17,783
Lee Jung-eun! Are you out of your mind?

325
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:19,983
I'm sorry, Ji-suk.

326
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:22,743
It's totally my fault.

327
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:26,383
Who'd expect Ms. Song to appear at that
moment?

328
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:29,343
If I did, I would be a lunatic. Don't you think
so?

329
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:31,183
No, ma'am.

330
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:34,579
It's scarlet series in 900...

331
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:37,783
and currant series starting with 68, a red
color.

332
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:39,823
What is she saying?

333
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:43,503
Ms. Jeong, what are you saying now?

334
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:47,623
I asked you so many times to check it.

335
00:15:47,883 --> 00:15:49,183
I can't believe this.

336
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,859
I get it. I won't ever go near the academy
again.

337
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:56,183
I promise.

338
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:58,859
You're a true friend.

339
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:00,463
Thank you, Ji-suk.

340
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:06,863
I'll never forget what you did for me.

341
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,139
I know how hard you work, Ms. Jeong.

342
00:16:10,163 --> 00:16:13,339
But you know we have a tight schedule.

343
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:14,543
What is it?

344
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:15,779
It's nothing.

345
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:17,783
What is it? Is Mr. Kim there?

346
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:20,303
You're going through a lot.

347
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:23,339
Don't mention it.

348
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:24,863
Is he gone yet?

349
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,263
I forgot.

350
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:29,223
Ms. Song asked me about your mom.

351
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,423
What?

352
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:35,143
Ms. Song asked you about my mom?

353
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:37,223
Jung-eun.

354
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:39,103
What?

355
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:40,943
What? Hello?

356
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,743
Tell me now.

357
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,663
Don't you have any idea?

358
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:49,503
I said I don't.

359
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:51,663
I asked my mom, but she said she didn't
know her.

360
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:54,023
That's strange.

361
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:55,979
Ms. Song isn't someone...

362
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,459
who'd tolerate something like that.

363
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,743
I guess so.

364
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:01,059
Come on.

365
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,903
There's no chance my mom had met Ms.
Song before.

366
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:06,303
There's not a possibility.

367
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,063
Are you sleepy? Do you feel tired?

368
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:16,783
No, I'm not tired at all.

369
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,623
I'm so happy that I'm with you, Seo-yoon.

370
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:21,942
I'm so excited too.

371
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:24,823
You're excited.

372
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:26,903
I'm in big trouble.

373
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,819
Let's listen to the music.

374
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:30,063
Music?

375
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:33,379
Seo-yoon, how about we play a game?

376
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,219
Okay. What's the game?

377
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:38,459
The one who closes eyes and goes to sleep
first wins.

378
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:39,659
What do you think? It's easy, isn't it?

379
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,098
I've played it with Dad before.

380
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:44,983
I don't want to sleep. Let's just say I lost.

381
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,503
You've played it already.

382
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:52,463
Then turn on the music you want to listen to.

383
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:53,863
All right.

384
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:58,013

390
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:22,463

391
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,463
Right?

392
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:27,503
Song Ju-hee.

You must have been tired.

400
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:26,539
Do you know how many times...

401
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:28,182
I listened to this song today?

402
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:32,863
My cell phone ringtone is "Gem of Stars"
too.

403
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:36,103
What is it?

404
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:38,699
We woke you up. I'm sorry.

405
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:41,422
- I want to go to the bathroom. - Okay.

406
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:44,699
Please don't leave.

407
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:47,419
Can't we live together?

408
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:50,303
When we see each other again tomorrow,
it'll bring us another joy, right?

409
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,942
My sweetheart.

410
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,743
Go now.

411
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:57,499
Just staying with her today...

412
00:19:57,523 --> 00:19:59,499
made you forget about your mom?

413
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:00,659
You see?

414
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,063
This is who I am.

415
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,539
What kind of nanny...

416
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:07,739
will Seo-yoon like more than you?

417
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:09,263
So, how about...

418
00:20:09,603 --> 00:20:10,939
What?

419
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:12,263
Whatdoyoumean?

420
00:20:12,403 --> 00:20:14,179
How about you care for her...

421
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:15,459
Then, what about the hospital?

422
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:17,579
What about the kids in there?

423
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:19,379
I know. I know what you mean, but...

424
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:20,783
I'm leaving!

425
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:22,939
Darn, please.

426
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:24,139
How can you be like this...

427
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:25,983
when she likes you this much?

428
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:29,739
Okay! You don't need to do that.

429
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,303
I didn't expect it either anyway.

430
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:33,823
You scared me!

431
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:36,098
Are you already leaving?

432
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:38,379
It'd be great if you stayed here a little longer.

433
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,379
Enough.

434
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,139
I mean...

435
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,139
Mother, take care!

436
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:45,103
Thanks a lot!

437
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,459
Honey, baby, Jeong-eun!

438
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,983
How could you raise your voice when we
request...

439
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:56,459
Forget it. You take care of this matter.

440
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:59,103
What do you mean by that?

441
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:00,659
Don't you see it?

442
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:02,579
My mom refused it, and we couldn't find a
nanny.

443
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:04,023
Then, who's next?

444
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:07,459
What's this? You mean my mom? Are you
serious?

445
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,339
No way!

446
00:21:09,363 --> 00:21:12,103
Then, will our Seo-yoon go around alone?

447
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:15,219
You call your mom yourself.

448
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:18,059
Now is the time to talk nice and gentle.

449
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,659
But...

450
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:21,263
Honey. Jeong-eun!

451
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:30,942
Gosh.

452
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:33,098
What made you come here this early
morning?

453
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:34,419
You followed me even to the market.

454
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:36,139
I was worried that you would struggle...

455
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:37,618
in this cold weather.

456
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:39,103
Wait a second.

457
00:21:39,642 --> 00:21:42,139
The chives look so fresh!

458
00:21:42,163 --> 00:21:43,463
Look at this.

459
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:46,703
It looks...

460
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,899
- pretty good. - Yes.

461
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,979
I'll take five bundles of chives...

462
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:51,618
- and three napa cabbage. - I got it.

463
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,579
- Please put them here. - Yes. No problem.

464
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,983
Thank you.

465
00:21:55,363 --> 00:21:56,623
Hey,

466
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:58,543
how Seo-yoon is doing?

467
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:01,182
It seemed she was shocked.

468
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:03,139
I felt this was the time...

469
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,459
the family should stay...

470
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:06,779
with her.

471
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,463
Sure. Family is the best!

472
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:13,063
That being said,

473
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:16,343
how about you take off work for now...

474
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,743
and take care of her?

475
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:20,059
What?

476
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,419
That was it! I wondered what made you here.

477
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:24,219
Stop your nonsense!

478
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:25,618
Just leave if you're going to keep saying
that!

479
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:28,139
Mom, please.

480
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:29,942
Don't you need radish?

481
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,263
Seo-yoon, are you eating it?

482
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:36,459
Mom, you should dry the tray...

483
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:37,858
before putting it in my bag.

484
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:39,379
You forgot it yesterday.

485
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:41,098
Really? Oh, my.

486
00:22:41,122 --> 00:22:42,343
I'm sorry.

487
00:22:42,483 --> 00:22:43,743
Let's see.

488
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:46,783
I must've been crazy. I'm sorry.

489
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:53,339
Today, I did.

490
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:54,983
I checked it just now.

491
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:57,618
Seo-yoon, by the way,

492
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,103
did you memorize the script for the speech
competition?

493
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:02,823
No, not yet.

494
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,543
Aren't you supposed to make the speech
today?

495
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:12,463
"By the people,

496
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:14,259
of the people,

497
00:23:14,283 --> 00:23:16,823
shall not perish from the earth."

498
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,942
How about practicing it with me this
evening?

499
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:23,543
Mom, I'm late!

500
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,583
Yes, you are! I got it.

501
00:23:25,963 --> 00:23:27,259
We're late.

502
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:28,259
We're late again.

503
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:31,419
Mom, it hurts! Please do it gently.

504
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,983
Gosh, your hair is...

505
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,703
Your hair grows so fast.

506
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:39,663
Seo-yoon,

507
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:42,223
instead of a nanny,

508
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:43,699
it's better...

509
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,823
if your grandma takes care of you, right?

510
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:47,463
Then,

511
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,819
you should directly appeal to your
grandma...

512
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:52,339
It is, but Grandma also works.

513
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:53,779
Like you.

514
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:55,583
I'm fine, Mom.

515
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,098
But the thing is, I'm not fine.

516
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:01,259
Let's go! We're late!

517
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:02,543
Get dressed!

518
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:04,103
Let's go!

519
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:06,299
Hurry up!

520
00:24:06,323 --> 00:24:07,703
We're late!

521
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,739
It's a picture of a rainy day.

522
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,583
Where are you going with your umbrella?

523
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:22,663
Then,

524
00:24:22,843 --> 00:24:25,618
when you want to tell me later,

525
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,823
please let me know, Su-chan.

526
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:34,663
Su-chan, come out. Time to go to the
academy.

527
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:36,743
Ma'am,

528
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:40,743
how about you wait until he finishes his
painting?

529
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:44,703
I take care of my son's business.

530
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:47,063
Park Su-chan!

531
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:52,863
Hurry up!

532
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:54,863
What's wrong with you?

533
00:24:56,523 --> 00:24:57,939
What are you going to do...

534
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,579
if he's rushed to the emergency room again?

535
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:00,903
What?

536
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:02,983
Are you a doctor or something?

537
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,539
Just helping in the emergency room once...

538
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:06,383
made you a doctor?

539
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:07,823
Park Su-chan!

540
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:13,423
I... I won't go...

541
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:15,543
to the academy.

542
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:19,103
What?

543
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:20,783
Park Su-chan.

544
00:25:21,163 --> 00:25:22,903
What did you say?

545
00:25:23,283 --> 00:25:24,583
Come over here.

546
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:26,139
Please!

547
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:27,743
Let's talk outside.

548
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:30,263
There are many kids here.

549
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,663
Come on out.

550
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,783
What did you say to my son?

551
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,099
What if he gets a lower score in the next
exam?

552
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:47,703
If you keep behaving like this,

553
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,459
I'll have to report your case as child abuse.

554
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,423
What? "Child abuse?"

555
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:57,539
Are you crazy? Say that again!

556
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:58,863
Yes.

557
00:25:59,003 --> 00:26:01,183
I'm not a doctor or anything.

558
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:03,819
I'm telling you this as a mom.

559
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:05,583
This is absolutely abuse!

560
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:08,903
To make you feel satisfied...

561
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:12,259
Do you even know his condition?

562
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:13,623
You...

563
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:15,783
Do you think I'll just let this slice?

564
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,419
I'll post what you said...

565
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,859
on all of the hospital bulletinboards.

566
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,183
Do it.

567
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:22,499
I'll report it as child abuse.

568
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:25,783
Sure. Give it a try.

569
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:28,343
I won't just sit back and do nothing.

570
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:34,623
Park Su-chan, get up.

571
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:36,863
Get up.

572
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,383
Move.

573
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:43,663
Hurry up.

574
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,663
Why a gloomy face?

575
00:27:05,843 --> 00:27:07,619
Ms. Ha requested me to have a list of 10
people...

576
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,979
for TR representatives within today.

577
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,463
Ha Sa-na requested that?

578
00:27:12,843 --> 00:27:15,019
Almost no one knows about TR
representatives...

579
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:16,543
in our field.

580
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:18,619
We haven't even seen faces,

581
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:20,383
so how can we get contacts?

582
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:22,059
She said I must have good contacts with
others...

583
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,099
as I'm a marketer.

584
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:24,619
She wanted to get the list within today.

585
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,143
She must be crazy.

586
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:28,419
Why did she hand over her own work...

587
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:30,023
to another department?

588
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:32,139
This brat...

589
00:27:32,163 --> 00:27:34,019
- Please. - You're dead now.

590
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:35,379
Please, stop.

591
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,459
No way.

592
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:39,299
Please, don't step up in this matter, Ms. Lee.

593
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,099
I will...

594
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:42,783
- That brat... - Please sit down.

595
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:44,663
I'll handle this matter.

596
00:27:45,403 --> 00:27:46,783
If that's the case...

597
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:49,659
You have business cards from the last
conference.

598
00:27:49,683 --> 00:27:51,299
- Toss them to her! - Oh, I see.

599
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:52,659
She just threw some work.

600
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:54,179
You should also simply toss it, Ms. Han.

601
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,863
- That sounds like a good idea. - That rude
woman...

602
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:01,943
What is this?

603
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,623
Everything is red.

604
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:06,783
It's the draw lots of Myeongseong
Elementary School.

605
00:28:06,883 --> 00:28:09,343
There's a jinx that...

606
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:10,979
if I carry red stuff,

607
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:12,539
it brings me luck.

608
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:15,583
But I think they went too far.

609
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:19,303
Are you really going to wear this tacky...

610
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:22,903
What did you say?

611
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:26,739
Ms. Han,

612
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:28,379
being a mom means...

613
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:30,903
never feeling ashamed.

614
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:33,952
It will end before lunchtime, right?

615
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:34,979
(12 entered Myeongseong Elementary
School.)

616
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:36,339
(37 entered Hanseon Foreign Language
High School.)

617
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:37,663
Oh, my.

618
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:39,059
So cool!

619
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,419
(56 entered Changseong Science High
School.)

620
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:42,254
(48 entered Hanguk University.)

621
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:43,458
It's amazing!

622
00:28:47,003 --> 00:28:48,299
Ten minutes for a consultation.

623
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:50,019
- Who's first? - Me...

624
00:28:50,043 --> 00:28:52,543
Oh, it's so shiny!

625
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,859
You look younger than the deity of the
baby...

626
00:28:55,883 --> 00:28:57,219
and your skin is brighter...

627
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:58,859
than that of Taoist Fairy.

628
00:28:58,883 --> 00:29:00,663
You're very sharp.

629
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,543
Your child's date of birth?

630
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:05,259
Here.

631
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:07,623
Hong Seo-yoon.

632
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,503
Do you think...

633
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:15,539
she can enter Myeongseong Elementary
School?

634
00:29:15,563 --> 00:29:17,103
Let's see.

635
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:20,899
Born on May 20, theYearoftheGoldenDog.

636
00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:22,194
(Myeongseong Elementary School)

637
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:23,943
Gosh.

638
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:25,303
Oh, my!

639
00:29:25,523 --> 00:29:27,139
You graduated from Myeongseong
Elementary School?

640
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:28,099
Imightnotlookit,

641
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:29,179
butIwent to school in Daechi-dong.

642
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:30,139
From Myeongseong...

643
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:31,743
to Hanguk University majoring in English.

644
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,739
That's why...

645
00:29:33,763 --> 00:29:36,103
I can predict one's future even in the IVY
league.

646
00:29:36,363 --> 00:29:37,739
No way American deities can speak Korean,
right?

647
00:29:37,763 --> 00:29:38,739
You're funny.

648
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:40,179
Would they use a translator?

649
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:41,299
A person like me at this level...

650
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,143
can only mention the IVY league!

651
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,900
She will enter.

652
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,900
"Enter?"

653
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,936
She's going to enter the school!

654
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,660
Even if I die here, I've nothing to regret.

655
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,700
Why die now? It's just the beginning.

656
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,500
You should pull yourself now!

657
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,056
A slight mistake can cause a big problem.

658
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,300
Sorry?

659
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,940
It's foggy! I can't see it clearly.

660
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,980
You should offer a devoutprayer.

661
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,420
A devoutprayer?

662
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,616
You mean performing an exorcism or
something?

663
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,056
Should Idanceonthebladeofthestrawcutter...

664
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,940
in this harsh weather?

665
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,180
You should do a devout prayer as a mom!

666
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,176
What should I do?

667
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,500
Write it down.

668
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,220
The Toad Rock in Mount Buram.

669
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,056
Go back and get the biggest piece of taffy.

670
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,300
Put it on the rock and pray sincerely.

671
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,460
Of course, I should.

672
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,016
But there's no use going alone.

673
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,936
Go as a two and pray twice as much.

674
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,980
Does that mean I should go with my
husband?

675
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,056
Why?

676
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,020
No. I should go, no matter what.

677
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,976
General, please read my daughter's fortune
too.

678
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,220
This is my daughter So-ra's date of birth.

679
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,936
It says she enters Myeongseong too.

680
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,180
Oh, my!

681
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,500
It's so good for you.

682
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,740
Thank you so much, General.

683
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,980
Done? Next.

684
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,700
Wait!

685
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,296
Just one more.

686
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,416
What is it?

687
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,376
I'm urgently looking for a nanny.

688
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,180
Where should we go to find the best one?

689
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,256
You don't need to find one.

690
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,740
The precious person is reaching out to you.

691
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,620
Really?

692
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,456
I'm here!

693
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,780
This way!

694
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,500
Take a seat.

695
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,620
- You came early. - Yes, I did.

696
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,776
I thought about it at home,

697
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,776
and I didn't even ask your name.

698
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,536
I'm not talking about Jinny or Jenny or
something.

699
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,936
- It's Yoon Ji-a. - Yoon Ji-a?

700
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,340
That's such a pretty name!

701
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,216
They're acting up again.

702
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,136
Sorry?

703
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,300
No, don't worry. Ignore it.

704
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,856
I thought you weren't good at reading the
air...

705
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,136
as you looked a bit stubborn.

706
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,820
Is it right? You don't know what's going on,
right?

707
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,460
Am I...

708
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,496
being ostracized or something?

709
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,500
Oh, you know it. That's it!

710
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,540
You, Ms. Yoon Ji-a, fought...

711
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,176
severely against Jason's mom,

712
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,176
who is always with Tommy's mom.

713
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,140
Everyone's wary of Tommy's mom. That's
why.

714
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,776
If they ask you something,

715
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,980
they may be marked by Tommy's mom.

716
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,896
Marked by Tommy's mom?

717
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,856
Yes.

718
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,816
Even the director of this academy can't
contradict her.

719
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,020
It's like a mouse in front of a cat.

720
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,780
I'm just worried about Seo-yoon.

721
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,180
And that government of the people,

722
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,060
by the people, for the people,

723
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,376
- shall not perish from the earth. - Stop!

724
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,980
Claire, time is up.

725
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,300
Next time, let's be a bit quicker!

726
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,656
Try to finish within the time, okay?

727
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,696
Okay.

728
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,260
Still, well done.

729
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,700
All right. Go take a seat.

730
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,740
Everybody, let's give a round of applause to
Claire!

731
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:55,580
- Teacher? - Yes?

732
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,180
Why did you say Claire did a good job?

733
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,980
We all saw that she went over the time limit!

734
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,496
Speaking that slowly...

735
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,340
- will disqualify her! - That's right!

736
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,620
Stop making a mess and take care of your
business.

737
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,980
I saw you speak terribly!

738
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,100
Who teaches whom now?

739
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,696
What? Darn, you are wrong!

740
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,896
- Are you sure you're done? - Yes, I'm
finished!

741
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,460
English only, kids!

742
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,496
Okay. Now everybody, let's...

743
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,056
Do you think it makes sense...

744
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,056
that kids are involved in adults' arguments?

745
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,376
So, at first, I also thought...

746
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,296
about turning over tables...

747
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,500
and leaving with my Tae-rin.

748
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,016
But the thing is,

749
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,580
this place is so good at teaching English...

750
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,896
to kids.

751
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,576
What's the point of improving English only?

752
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,696
Their characters are--

753
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,776
Do you commute...

754
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,020
from the traditional Cheonghak-
dongVillage?

755
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,816
Sorry?

756
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,096
You look stylish,

757
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,820
but what you say is very old-school.

758
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,860
Am I?

759
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,020
I've never heard of that before.

760
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,580
Your age makes you be like that, then.

761
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,940
Let's keep things quiet, okay?

762
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,536
Son! Mom's here. Where are you?

763
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,576
- Mom. - Yes?

764
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,856
I lost the pencil you bought me yesterday.

765
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,935
The red one.

766
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,380
Oh, my gosh! Do you know how much it
was?

767
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,180
By the way, Jason. Why did you just come
out?

768
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,700
You should be with Tommy!

769
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,736
It's a break time.

770
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,656
That's why!

771
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,696
You should be with Tommy and get along
well!

772
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,496
Go back to the class!

773
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,460
Back to class! Quick!

774
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,256
It's so annoying!

775
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,020
- What? - I hate it!

776
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,380
This place is amazing, isn't it?

777
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,540
Yes, indeed.

778
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:09,820
Lee Min-ho.

779
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,496
It's okay to skip things,

780
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,176
but you should eat salmon every day.

781
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,980
That's good for your brain development.

782
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,415
And regarding the speech practice,

783
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,180
I'll join you and watch.

784
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,700
Why aren't you answering?

785
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,500
Lee Min-ho!

786
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,376
How many times have I told you not to bite
your nails?

787
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,580
What would others think if they see you?

788
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:45,201
(Myeongseong Elementary Parent
Representative)

789
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,935
Hello, ma'am. How have you been?

790
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,096
We're going to play golf...

791
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,136
with the members of Myeongseong mothers.

792
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,296
Can you spare time?

793
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,415
Tomorrow?

794
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:55,380
Why? You can't?

795
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,296
Of course, I can.

796
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,656
Then, let's meet at the club lounge.

797
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,980
I'll see you tomorrow, ma'am.

798
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,415
Mom, then what about the academy?

799
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,176
Can I skip it tomorrow?

800
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,700
What are you talking about? Why would you
skip it?

801
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,580
That won't happen.

802
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,940
Hello.

803
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,660
Hey, Professor Kim.

804
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,980
This weekend?

805
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,856
What's the point of going alone...

806
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,660
for the couples' meeting?

807
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,060
I'm planning to go fishing.

808
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,580
Okay. See you.

809
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,340
Father, it's me.

810
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,820
Oh, yes.

811
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,256
I'd like to ask you a favor.

812
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,779
A favor? What is it?

813
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,336
I have an important appointment tomorrow.

814
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,256
If you can spare time,

815
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,460
can you drive Min-ho to his academy?

816
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,380
Tomorrow afternoon?

817
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,256
Sure.

818
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,900
Luckily, I only have classes in the morning.

819
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,180
- Thank you so much.- Don't mention it.

820
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,816
I haven't seen him for a while. So, it's a good
chance.

821
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,136
Please help pick him up tomorrow.

822
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,259
Okay. Take care.

823
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,900
It is the principle, which promises a state...

824
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,580
in the selfish pursuit of power,

825
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,140
to disregard its treaties and its solemn
pledges,

826
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,900
which sanctions the use of force,

827
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,820
or threat of force, against...

828
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,140
soverei...

829
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,140
Lee Min-ho.

830
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,100
Pull yourself together.

831
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:51,259
You made a mistake again there. Do it again!

832
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,336
Soverei...

833
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,700
Lee Min-ho!

834
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,896
How many times has it been?

835
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,340
Pull yourself together!

836
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,016
You know the competition will happen soon,
right?

837
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,415
Yes, I know.

838
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:10,779
You know, but he can only do this much?

839
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,259
I apologize.

840
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,100
Forget it.

841
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,739
I'll ask you one thing.

842
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,860
Can you make sure he wins first place or
not?

843
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,980
I'm sure he can, ma'am.

844
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,900
You said you were sure.

845
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:28,739
Yes.

846
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,220
Lee Min-ho.

847
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,060
I'll check it again tomorrow.

848
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,500
So, pull yourself together and focus. You got
it?

849
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,220
Okay.

850
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,380
(Min-ho's schedule)

851
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,056
(Disciplinary Committee)

00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,340
Song Ju-hee.

853
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,576
Don't say anything.

854
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,438
(Theft of writingsupplies)

855
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,616
That this nation, under God, shall have...

856
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,900
a new birth of freedom,

857
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,096
and that government of the people,

858
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,220
by the people, for the people...

859
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,696
Seo-yoon. You're out of time.

860
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,660
You must finishin time.

861
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,696
I know that.

862
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,616
But I can't seem to finish in time.

863
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,056
You told me to enunciatethe words.

864
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,415
Yes, enunciatingthe words is great.

865
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:22,096
But you must also finish in time.

866
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,176
Mom. Can't I do this tomorrow?

867
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,216
No.

868
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,140
What do you mean? The competitionis next
week.

869
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,736
I don't want to do it because I'm not good at
it.

870
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,376
That's why we're practicingtogether.

871
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,376
Right?

872
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,940
All right. Let's try again.

873
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,296
Chin up. Look at me.

874
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,420
I said I didn't want to do it today.

875
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,256
Seo-yoon.

876
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,536
I said I didn't want to do it.

877
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,820
But why won't you listen to me?

878
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,420
Seo-yoon.

879
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,336
Don't you want to join Class A?

880
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,256
Let's try it one last time. I promise.

881
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,140
This will be the last time.

882
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,220
- Seo-yoon, give it to me. - What are you
doing?

883
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,415
Let's stop for today and go for a walk
instead.

884
00:41:58,439 --> 00:42:00,256
- Bring your jacket. - Okay!

885
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,580
You're not going out this late at night.

886
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,380
She must finishpracticingit tonight.

887
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,176
I'm ready now!

888
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,336
Let's go!

889
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,940
What?

890
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,420
Come on!

891
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,420
Good grief!

892
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,900
I'll put a snowmanin your drink.

893
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,940
Ta-da.

894
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,820
How is it? Is it good?

895
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,259
Yes.

896
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,739
Mom also likes chocolate.

897
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,140
What do you like,Seo-yoon?

898
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,340
You like chocolate,Pinkru... And what else?

899
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,576
Jinny.

900
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,500
What? That's me.

901
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,620
Well,

902
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,096
but the Genie is the lamp fairy.

903
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,256
You can call me wheneveryou need me.

904
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,900
Then I'll pop up like the Genie.

905
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,896
Does it mean we can come here...

906
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,616
and stargazewheneverI call you?

907
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,500
You must like stars then.

908
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,336
My gosh. You're just like your mother.

909
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,536
Your mother loved...

910
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,536
stargazingwhen she was a child too.

911
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,380
I'll do everythingMom likes.

912
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,900
I want to win an award at the
competitiontoo.

913
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,580
Seo-yoon.

914
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,660
It doesn't matter...

915
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,136
if you win an award at the competitionor not.

916
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,455
Your mother will love you all the same.

917
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:24,455
But still. If I win first place,

918
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,940
Mom will be happier.

919
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,500
But it's too hard.

920
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,656
And that government

921
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,176
of the people, by the people,

922
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,736
for the people,

923
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,496
shall not perish...

924
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,980
Oh, my. I sound like a man! It's not fun at all,
right?

925
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,420
Right. I hate it.

926
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,576
I'll tell you what. Let's win first place.

927
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,060
But let's have fun at the same time.

928
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,576
How?

929
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,180
Well, let's abort this boringspeech first.

930
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,020
Let's make the script interesting.

931
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,576
Is that allowed?

932
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,739
Of course, it is.

933
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,060
But under one condition.

934
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,220
You can't tell your mom about it.

935
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,096
Okay. It's our secret.

936
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,176
Great.

937
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,136
Starting today, this will be our practice spot.

938
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,940
We'll do it at our secret spot. What do you
say?

939
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,380
Sounds good.

940
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,900
What?

941
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:39,779
My gosh.

942
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,816
This is your favoritering.

943
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,896
That's right.

944
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,016
Now, we're BFFs.

945
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,536
BFFs?

946
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,296
Best friends forever!

947
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,056
Yes!

948
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,020
And this is the secret spot of BFFs.

949
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,100
I won't tell anyoneabout it.

950
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,580
Same here. I keep it a secret too.

951
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,300
Let's take off your jacket.

952
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,935
What did you two do?

953
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:19,136
What do you think? We practicedtogether.

954
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,420
We decided to practice the speechtogether.

955
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,580
Really?

956
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,820
You're goingto help her with the
speechcompetition?

957
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,660
You don't trust me?

958
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,500
No. I do. But...

959
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,580
So I'll do it.

960
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,700
Really?

961
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,380
You can't back out of this later.

962
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,136
Your mother is happy, isn't she?

963
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,660
- Yes! - Right?

964
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,656
Of course.

965
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,536
I'll check it right away and call you back.

966
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,580
Yes, thank you. Bye.

967
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:54,460
Who in the world taught you to work like
this?

968
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,816
Did you think throwing me a few
businesscards...

969
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,576
would make me think you were competent...

970
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,220
and let it slide?

971
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,020
I'm sorry, Ms. Ha.

972
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,376
That's not it.

973
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,935
- How dare you talk back to me? - Come on.

974
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:07,380
What's this about?

975
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,376
It's nothing,sir.

976
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,296
I was talking to Ms. Han from Marketing...

977
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,896
regarding the TR project.

978
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,259
Ms. Han?

979
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,455
I see. You're the one...

980
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:18,900
who volunteeredto join the project.

981
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,736
You must be busy with your tasks from
Marketing.

982
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,935
Right.

983
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:27,380
She's such a motivatedemployee, sir.

984
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,415
I see. How's the meeting with the CEO
going?

985
00:46:31,439 --> 00:46:34,176
Actually,we were justtalkingabout that.

986
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,776
Ms. Han will find a way to contact the CEO...

987
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,460
beforeshe gets off work.

988
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,100
It seems the juniorswant to work with you.

989
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,736
It's great to see that.

990
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,816
I'll report to you...

991
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,536
the momentthe meetingis scheduled.

992
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,496
Sure. Thanks.

993
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,779
Have a good day.

994
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,100
Hello.

995
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:57,749
(Ms. Lee. Try these. I hope you win. Be a
winner.)

996
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,700
Good luck with Myeongseong Elementary
School.

997
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,940
- See you tomorrow. - Okay.

998
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,256
Ms. Lee. Try these on. I hope you win.

999
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,900
Be a winner.

1000
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,860
You're late.

1001
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,380
Yes, I'm a bit late.

1002
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,856
Your child isn't even enrolled in our school.

1003
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,776
How could you be late--

1004
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,820
Forget it. I must have had too high an
opinion of her.

1005
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,580
I'm sorry,ma'am.

1006
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,380
Ms. Park.

1007
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,820
Hello.

1008
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,496
I'm Park Jin-yi.

1009
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,020
My gosh. It's Park Jin-yi.

1010
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:46,176
What's going on, Ho-gyung?

1011
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,336
Ms. Park will be joiningyou...

1012
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,300
on the fieldtoday.

1013
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,656
I had to coordinatethe scheduleat the last
minute,

1014
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,935
so I was late.

1015
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:53,935
I'm sorry.

1016
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:55,660
Gosh, don't worryabout that now.

1017
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,980
I look forward to hittingthe course with you.

1018
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,455
How thoughtfulyou are.

1019
00:49:01,479 --> 00:49:03,256
Let me formallyintroduce you.

1020
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,336
Her son, Min-ho, will soon enroll in our
school.

1021
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,180
Her name is Song Ho-gyung.

1022
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,576
- Good shot. - Oh, my.

1023
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,660
- Good shot. - Good shot.

1024
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:46,045
(Full)

1025
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,376
Oh, no.

1026
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,740
There's no availableparkingspot here.

1027
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,140
- Are you Tommy's grandpa? - What?

1028
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,736
Oh, yes.

1029
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,576
I'll show you where to park.

1030
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,940
What?

1031
00:50:04,478 --> 00:50:06,974
(No Parking)

1032
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,740
The top floor is Class A where Tommy
studies.

1033
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,580
I see.

1034
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,380
- This way. - Thank you.

1035
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,580
To disregard...

1036
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,020
its treaties and its solemn pledges,

1037
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,020
which sanctions the use of force,

1038
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,500
or threat of force,

1039
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,500
against the...

1040
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,980
soverei...

1041
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,860
Soverei...

1042
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,980
Lee Min-ho.

1043
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,940
Pull yourself together.

1044
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,860
You made a mistake again there.

1045
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,980
How many times has it been?

1046
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,820
Pull yourself together!

1047
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,820
Okay, Tommy. Take a seat.

1048
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,740
All right. Class is dismissed. See you
tomorrow.

1049
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,980
- Thank you, Sarah. - Thank you, Sarah.

1050
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,220
Lee Min-ho.

1051
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,260
Min-ho.

1052
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,980
Grandpa.

1053
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,460
You forgot your backpack.

1054
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,020
You shouldn't bite your nails.

1055
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,300
Don't touch me!

1056
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,540
Grandpa, you're mean. I hate you.

1057
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,016
No, Min-ho.

1058
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,936
I didn't think you'd--

1059
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,780
Who are you?

1060
00:52:32,342 --> 00:52:34,162
Who are you?

1061
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:38,335
Did you make Min-ho cry?

1062
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:39,815
Are you a bad guy?

1063
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,655
No, I was...

1064
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:43,459
Excuse me.

1065
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:47,299
Now we're the same height.

1066
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:48,899
We're the same, right?

1067
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,175
Yes.

1068
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:52,619
Let's get up. It's time to go home.

1069
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,179
Sorry.

1070
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:01,459
I forgot to introduce myself.

1071
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:03,295
Nice to meet you.

1072
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:05,575
My name is Yoon Ji-a.

1073
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,135
Hello. My name is Lee Min-ho.

1074
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:09,815
Hi, Min-ho.

1075
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,859
She's my grandma. Isn't she pretty?

1076
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,259
Yes.

1077
00:53:13,439 --> 00:53:15,899
Oh, how nice.

1078
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:23,379
What is that supposed to mean?

1079
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:26,699
Nothing, you're pretty.

1080
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:28,979
You're beautiful.

1081
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,499
I know.

1082
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:32,615
Here.

1083
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:35,139
You shake hands when you meet someone
new.

1084
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:42,699
Nice to meet you.

1085
00:53:44,879 --> 00:53:46,179
Min-ho.

1086
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:50,415
I'm a really good painter.

1087
00:53:50,439 --> 00:53:55,499
So I want to give you my painting as a gift.

1088
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,619
Will you accept it?

1089
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,055
A gift?

1090
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:02,375
Yes, she means it. Say you'll accept it.

1091
00:54:02,399 --> 00:54:03,819
Let's get up.

1092
00:54:04,279 --> 00:54:06,299
Good boy.

1093
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:12,019
Do you need help getting up, sir?

1094
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:15,819
No, I can get up on my own.

1095
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:19,259
Good job.

1096
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:21,299
Let's go.

1097
00:54:22,919 --> 00:54:25,179
It sounds like a compliment.

1098
00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:29,219
Maybe not.

1099
00:54:36,279 --> 00:54:38,619
How can you draw with that?

1100
00:54:38,879 --> 00:54:41,459
Like this. What do you think? Pretty, right?

1101
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,819
On nails?

1102
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,699
Maybe I'll do that later.

1103
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:52,259
Then...

1104
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:55,579
do you want to draw on your grandpa's nails
first?

1105
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:57,779
Give me your hand.

1106
00:54:58,279 --> 00:55:00,419
- What? - Your hand.

1107
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,419
But...

1108
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:09,419
Seo-yoon, brown.

1109
00:55:11,919 --> 00:55:13,299
Thank you.

1110
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,859
I want to try it too.

1111
00:55:46,399 --> 00:55:47,415
Really?

1112
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:49,699
Then I'll start on you first.

1113
00:55:50,879 --> 00:55:52,219
Give me your hand.

1114
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,255
Can you draw a dinosaur too?

1115
00:55:58,279 --> 00:55:59,855
Of course.

1116
00:55:59,879 --> 00:56:02,375
I'm good at drawing dinosaurs.

1117
00:56:02,399 --> 00:56:03,735
Check this out.

1118
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:05,259
Seo-yoon, green.

1119
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:14,895
Here.

1120
00:56:14,919 --> 00:56:17,339
Let's draw a dinosaur.

1121
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,139
Min-ho.

1122
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:50,219
Your nail is too short to draw everything.

1123
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:52,899
If you come back with longer nails next
week,

1124
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,339
I can draw the whole dinosaur.

1125
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,775
Grow your nails,

1126
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,619
so we can draw a cool dinosaur.

1127
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,019
What do you say?

1128
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:11,179
Can you do it?

1129
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:14,259
Yes, I can do it.

1130
00:57:19,919 --> 00:57:22,939
It's my favorite, but I'll give it to you.

1131
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:26,379
You're so lucky.

1132
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,859
Nice.

1133
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:32,459
I like it.

1134
00:57:32,879 --> 00:57:34,379
Do you like it that much?

1135
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:38,815
No, I meant--

1136
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:40,579
You seem to like it so much.

1137
00:57:55,919 --> 00:57:57,139
Min-hee.

1138
00:57:57,439 --> 00:57:58,695
Is Ms. Han out for work?

1139
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:00,695
No, Deputy Director Ha wanted to see her.

1140
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:02,179
So she went to the rooftop terrace.

1141
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:09,459
I told you to find it before today.

1142
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:11,299
Did you not take me seriously?

1143
00:58:11,439 --> 00:58:12,455
Not at all.

1144
00:58:12,479 --> 00:58:15,455
I called everyone today.

1145
00:58:15,479 --> 00:58:18,415
You called them? But you couldn't find it?

1146
00:58:18,439 --> 00:58:19,739
Is that it?

1147
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:22,219
Is that how the marketing team does their
job?

1148
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:25,299
Who taught you to work like that?

1149
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:26,899
Who else?

1150
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,935
It was me. What are you going to do about
that?

1151
00:58:29,959 --> 00:58:31,135
Ms. Lee.

1152
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:33,375
- Let me go. - Don't be a jerk.

1153
00:58:33,399 --> 00:58:35,895
File the work officially with respect.

1154
00:58:35,919 --> 00:58:37,255
Then I'll get it done for you.

1155
00:58:37,279 --> 00:58:39,215
So stop harassing Ms. Han, got it?

1156
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:41,019
Have you lost your mind?

1157
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,739
Let me go!

1158
00:58:44,623 --> 00:58:45,805
(We'd like to thank Son Jong-hak, Kim Tae-
hun,)

1159
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:47,119
(Miram, and Park Jin-yi for their special
appearance.)

1160
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:21,486
(Mother and Mom)

1161
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:23,615
Why would Director Yoon want to see me?

1162
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:25,455
Who would accept someone who got fired...

1163
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,259
- after assaulting her superior?- Gosh.

1164
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:29,175
How dare an art therapist...

1165
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,139
act up?

1166
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:33,699
Seo-yoon, you can trust Mommy.

1167
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:36,139
Hey. That's bad luck!

1168
00:59:37,919 --> 00:59:39,499
Jung-eun, have some taffy.

1169
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,255
Are you crazy?

1170
00:59:41,279 --> 00:59:42,819
Do you still call yourself a dad?

1171
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:45,215
If Seo-yoon can get into Myeongseong
Elementary,

1172
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:46,859
I'd do anything.

1173
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:48,739
- Seven.- Really?
