00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:10,633
(Mother and Mom)

(Supported by Ministry of Science and
ICT and Korea Communications Agency)

00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:14,309
(All places, organizations, characters,
incidents, )

00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,469
(and backstories in this drama are
fictitious.)

5
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:16,508
(Child actors were
accompanied by family...)

6
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:17,650
(and were kept safe.)

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,493
(Episode 6)

8
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:22,113
What would you have done without me?

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,882
I know.

10
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:25,602
Thank you.

11
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:30,322
Why are there cars stopped on the road?

12
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:33,718
That's Seo-yoon's car.

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,838
The light changed.

14
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:36,638
Then move forward.

15
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:37,962
Seriously.

16
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,078
What are you doing?

17
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:41,278
What am I doing?

18
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:42,878
I will just hit you right in the neck...

19
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:44,202
What?

20
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:47,078
Move your car.

21
00:00:47,102 --> 00:00:49,162
Who are you? Let go of me.

22
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:51,558
- Are you okay? - I am not okay!

23
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:53,602
Let go of me!

24
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:55,842
Move your car, I said!

25
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:57,922
Amazing!

26
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:02,362
Are you all right?

27
00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:04,722
- You... - Behind you.

28
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:06,598
- Seriously. - Hey.

29
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:08,798
Look here.

30
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:10,478
Okay.

31
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:12,357
What are you doing? Are you taking pictures
of me?

32
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:13,518
Why are you taking pictures of me? What
are you doing?

33
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:16,722
What else? It's for proof of assault.

34
00:01:16,862 --> 00:01:18,238
I didn't lay a hand on them.

35
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:19,758
You were close.

36
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:21,482
Go on with what you were doing.

37
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:25,038
Prosecutor Lee? It's me.

38
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,638
How many years in prison do you get...

39
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:29,318
for beating people?
But I didn't hit anyone.

40
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:29,638
But I didn't hit anyone.

41
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:30,798
I see.

42
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:34,038
It depends on whether it's
assault or special assault?

43
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:35,078
Okay.

44
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:37,078
It's just one bald guy with no tools.

45
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:38,678
Is that just assault?

46
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:40,318
What's the maximum time he'd get?

47
00:01:40,342 --> 00:01:41,838
But I didn't hit them.

48
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:43,878
Gosh, when you reach this age,

49
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:46,438
my bones just break from touching.

50
00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:48,682
It aches even from the wind.

51
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,438
Okay.

52
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:52,242
I see.

53
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:53,957
It takes eight weeks for me to recover...

54
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,882
even from a touch.

55
00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:58,802
When did I touch you?

56
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,118
I have to go. Bye.

57
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:03,762
- I'm off. - Hey.

58
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:12,202
He's running away as fast as he can.

59
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:17,278
Nice timing.

60
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:18,678
Perfect?

61
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:21,397
Good. That was awesome.

62
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,002
- Tae-rin. - Seo-yoon.

63
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:25,682
Tae-rin.

64
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:28,122
Mi-chun.

65
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:29,838
You know someone in the prosecution?

66
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:30,918
This?

67
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,198
This number is not in service.

68
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:33,522
What?

69
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,517
Anyway, are you okay?

70
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,397
Yes, you were amazing.

71
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:40,918
That scared me big time.

72
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:42,802
You were impressive.

73
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:46,042
I'm glad we got here on time.

74
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:48,442
You must've been shocked.

75
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,278
I will take the wheel now.

76
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:52,558
Come with me.

77
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:54,398
Go.

78
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:56,158
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

79
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:57,682
Tae-rin, let's go.

80
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:07,158
Hello. How can I help you?

81
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,318
We're here for the Lucid Test.

82
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:11,042
It's Hong Seo-yoon and Min Tae-rin.

83
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:12,518
The teacher will be here soon.

84
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,202
- Please wait. - Okay.

85
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,162
I'm your counselor Lee Yong-ho.

86
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:25,718
- Hello. - Hello.

87
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:27,678
Who's Tae-rin that made an appointment
today?

88
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:29,322
That's me.

89
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:30,518
Nice to meet you.

90
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,682
- Ready to come with me? - Yes.

91
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:34,122
This way.

92
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:35,842
Hong Seo-yoon?

93
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:39,402
- Yes. - Shall we?

94
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:43,278
Seo-yoon, just relax.

95
00:03:43,302 --> 00:03:44,758
Nothing to be afraid of.

96
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:46,122
You can do it, right?

97
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:48,522
I'll see you later.

98
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:50,722
This way.

99
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:59,878
Can you match what you see in the picture?

100
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:01,242
Yes.

101
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,041
Stop.

102
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,882
Good job.

103
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:26,602
This is amazing.

104
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:28,402
Stop.

105
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:34,562
Can you draw what you see?

106
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:36,242
Yes.

107
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,278
Now, can you draw that again...

108
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:50,842
from memory?

109
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,242
Sorry?

110
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:55,921
Okay.

111
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:11,342
Well done. Bye.

112
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:12,642
Well done. Bye.
Bye.

113
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,882
- Good job, Tae-rin. - Bye.

114
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:17,562
Grandma.

115
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:20,838
Seo-yoon, was it hard?

116
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,402
It was okay.

117
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:24,882
I had so much fun.

118
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:28,002
Seo-yoon, didn't you enjoy it?

119
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,962
Are you sure that was a test, Grandma?

120
00:05:32,142 --> 00:05:34,642
Then I want to take it again next time.

121
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,318
Sure. If you want, take it again.

122
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:39,962
It's all coming from your mom's pocket, not
mine.

123
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:42,322
Let's go.

124
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:47,882
She must be very tired.

125
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,157
She must've been nervous...

126
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:51,762
to deal with a new counselor.

127
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:55,678
You should get some sleep too.

128
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:57,522
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

129
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,762
How can I sleep when you're driving?

130
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:04,838
You don't trust my driving skills?

131
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:06,438
That's not it.

132
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,798
Do you want me to make a U-turn here?

133
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:10,678
I trust you.

134
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:13,122
So please keep going straight.

135
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:17,442
Yes, I'll keep going straight.

136
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:29,602
Why did you look at my hands?

137
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:30,998
Something on my hands?

138
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,522
No.

139
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:36,198
You don't wear a ring?

140
00:06:36,222 --> 00:06:38,282
Do you have any allergies?

141
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:39,918
No, I don't have any.

142
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,122
It's bothersome when I'm working.

143
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,682
I see.

144
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,642
Excuse me.

145
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,158
Yes, Jung-eun.

146
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:53,518
How did Seo-yoon's test go?

147
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:54,678
Do you have the result?

148
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:55,718
What's the score?

149
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:57,798
Slow down. Let's talk at home.

150
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,118
Seo-yoon's sleeping.

151
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:00,558
Did she not do well?

152
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:02,242
What was her score?

153
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:07,598
Grandpa, I need to use the restroom.

154
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,962
Jung-eun, I'm driving. I have to go.

155
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:12,002
What?

156
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,042
Did she not do well on the test?

157
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:17,722
That's not good.

158
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:21,798
Thank you for everything today.

159
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:23,362
Bye.

160
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:26,802
Can I have my key back?

161
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:29,402
But my job is not done yet.

162
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,918
Sorry?

163
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,122
I need to drive you home.

164
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:35,122
I'll wait for you.

165
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,678
It's cold. You should get going.

166
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:40,082
No, I'll wait.

167
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:44,602
Then give me just 10 minutes.

168
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:46,802
See you soon.

169
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:49,602
Bye, Seo-yoon.

170
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,842
Wait here.

171
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:58,802
- Hi. - Hi.

172
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:00,442
Hi, Seo-yoon.

173
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:02,438
I'm tired, Dad.

174
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:04,842
I'm going to sleep.

175
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:06,518
She must be tired.

176
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:07,518
Let her sleep.

177
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,678
Where's Jung-eun?

178
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:10,802
She's not home yet.

179
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,558
Yes?

180
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,482
Where are you? Seo-yoon's home.

181
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:27,002
I'm coming up. I'm in the parking lot.

182
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:49,117
- Hi. - What's the score?

183
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:50,518
- Read it. Bye. - Bye.

184
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:51,997
Wait.

185
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:53,117
You need to tell me before you go.

186
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:53,342
It's all written in there.

187
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:54,843
It's all written in there.
Bye.

188
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,321
Don't go. Wait.

189
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,238
(1st Mock Test Result, Top 2 percent)

190
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:00,722
Two percent?

191
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:02,598
Are you sure it's her test result?

192
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:03,638
- What? - Are you sure it didn't get mixed
up?

193
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:06,042
Doesn't that mean she's a genius?

194
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:08,882
She got 0.8 percent when she was five.

195
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:10,358
Did she?

196
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,842
The counselor was a man.

197
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,842
I think she was a bit scared.

198
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:16,722
A man?

199
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,242
The counselor?

200
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:20,678
The counselor matters for the Lucid Test.

201
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:22,122
But why...

202
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:23,678
This isn't good.

203
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:25,398
We never know who her counselor's going
to be.

204
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:27,997
We might as well make her take it a few
more times...
until she gets used to it.

205
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:29,482
A few more times?

206
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,598
Hey. This isn't a driving test.

207
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:34,558
I told you.

208
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:37,238
She must be within the top one percent in
two weeks.

209
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:38,958
We should make her memorize the
questions at least.

210
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:40,358
That's insane.

211
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:42,358
You think that will make her score go up...

212
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,038
when she doesn't even know the answer?

213
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:45,318
What else can I do?

214
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:47,002
We don't have time.

215
00:09:47,222 --> 00:09:48,638
Whatever.

216
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,802
I'll make another appointment for tomorrow.

217
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:52,478
Can you help me out a little more?

218
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:54,558
Do what you want, but I'm never doing it
again.

219
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:55,958
No, I can't do it. Seriously...

220
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,598
What do you mean, you can't?

221
00:09:57,622 --> 00:09:58,877
You said you'd help me.

222
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:00,201
Seriously.

223
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,402
- Bye. - Where are you going?

224
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:10,201
Did something happen?

225
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:13,082
Why do you ask?

226
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,522
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

227
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:19,762
It's frustrating.

228
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,042
Then...

229
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:25,398
this is the wrong direction.

230
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:26,722
Pardon?

231
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:28,722
Where are we going?

232
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,321
Seo-yoon.

233
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:39,522
Did you have a long day?

234
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,522
Should we stop?

235
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:53,242
What am I doing to a seven-year-old?

236
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:58,718
(Grand Award)

237
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,642
She's already doing so great.

238
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:04,321
No. Don't be weak.

239
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:07,682
Gosh.

240
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:11,435
Do you like your destination?

241
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:13,514
Yes, I like it.

242
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,395
I finally feel like I can breathe.

243
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:20,875
I was really frustrated earlier.

244
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:24,715
What was so frustrating?

245
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:27,795
The test today.

246
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,430
It was an IQ test.

247
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:30,751
It wasn't the SAT.

248
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,831
But just because the score was low,

249
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:34,591
Jung-eun said she should take the test
again.

250
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,471
Do you think that makes sense?

251
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,715
I'm a child psychotherapist.

252
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:42,195
I never expected my daughter to do that.

253
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,315
It's frustrating.

254
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:47,634
Then you should tell her.

255
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:49,911
I would've done that already if she was a
stranger.

256
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:52,151
No matter how much I tell her...

257
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:53,430
to stop taking the IQ tests...

258
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,911
I regret saying I'd watch her daughter.

259
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:57,595
Perhaps I should just...

260
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,835
I got too worked up, didn't I?

261
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,634
I'm sorry. I didn't
realize what I was doing.

262
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:07,071
No, I don't mind.

263
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:08,271
When you're angry,

264
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:11,435
feel free to vent to me.

265
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:15,995
And...

266
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:18,595
here.

267
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:24,231
It's embarrassing.

268
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:25,955
I look ugly, don't I?

269
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:29,951
You were so funny that day.

270
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,515
Were you that scared?

271
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:32,511
No.

272
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:35,075
I can't stop talking when I'm with you.

273
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:47,551
So? Do I look like him?

274
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:50,875
No, he was way skinnier and scarier than
you.

275
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:54,155
I can't lose weight immediately.

276
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:58,155
Hong Seo-yoon. You brat. Stop.

277
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,035
So? Do I look scary now?

278
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:01,795
What do you think?

279
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:03,871
Right.

280
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:05,631
Nothing would scare
the little Lee Jung-eun.

281
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:07,515
Good. Let's pretend I'm scary.

282
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:10,151
Now, draw the line...

283
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:11,951
as I show you.

284
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:12,991
Okay?

285
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:14,551
Here. This one.

286
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:16,235
Try to draw this.

287
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:27,431
I see. Good job.

288
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:29,195
Next...

289
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:31,471
try to remember what you just drew...

290
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:34,671
as much as you can...

291
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:36,035
and draw it again.

292
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:50,151
Dad.

293
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:52,751
What? Is something wrong?

294
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,355
You're...

295
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:58,111
telling me the answer.

296
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:00,355
What? Did I?

297
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:03,435
That's my girl.

298
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:05,715
You're very honest. Good job.

299
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,511
Plus 10 points.

300
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:10,475
- Yes! - Yes!

301
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:13,896
Seo-yoon, are you doing well?

302
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:16,012
Yes.

303
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:18,572
I'll go and wash my face. I'm tired.

304
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:19,896
Okay.

305
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:21,692
How far did you get? Is she any good?

306
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:24,012
Yes, we tried.

307
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:25,416
And...

308
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:28,572
it's not as good as...

309
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:30,376
- I feel bad for her. - What?

310
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,456
Is this all?

311
00:14:33,436 --> 00:14:35,736
This is crazy.

312
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:37,936
Go. I better take over.

313
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:39,656
Go inside.

314
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:41,216
Put these on.

315
00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:46,816
What are these?

316
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:49,496
The university admissions system is
changing again.

317
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,816
It changes every year.

318
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,496
How will it change when our children go to
university?

319
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:03,696
What if they pass out?

320
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:05,972
They'll give up soon.

321
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:08,456
Gosh, grannies.

322
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,936
- Grandma. - Grandma.

323
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,052
Yes. You're here.

324
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,692
Are you that tired?

325
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:21,576
Wait until you reach my age.

326
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:26,176
Didn't you say you're getting tested again
today?

327
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:27,572
We'll get going first.

328
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:29,052
See you tomorrow.

329
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:30,132
Bye.

330
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:31,372
Bye, Seo-yoon.

331
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,936
- Bye. - Bye. We're going to hang out for a
bit.

332
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:38,936
Cool.

333
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:40,856
What is all this?

334
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:43,372
Grandpa, can I have that?

335
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:46,892
Of course. Eat all you want.

336
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,496
- Thank you. - Hop in.

337
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,896
So? Do you like it?

338
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:02,136
Yes, I like it.

339
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:04,016
I told you.

340
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:07,976
I'm in charge of driving you from now on.

341
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,776
Hop in.

I'm okay.

348
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,896
Aren't you tired from taking the test?

349
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,252
What was the hardest?

350
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:30,132
I don't know. Can I go sleep now?

351
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,936
Sure.

352
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:34,732
Seo-yoon, next time,

353
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:37,692
you have to do a little better than this.

354
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:39,096
Can you do it?

355
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:41,812
Are you saying I did bad again?

00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,612
What do you mean, bad?

It's great.

359
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,412
Right? You're the best.

360
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:52,532
But...

361
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:54,492
But what?

362
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:55,852
But you placed first...

It says 1.4, right?

367
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:08,492
Is this the same?

368
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:11,016
Does this mean I placed 1.4?

369
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:14,976
Yes, you placed 1.4.

370
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:18,892

00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:26,252
You're tired. Go.

375
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:28,256
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

376
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,496
Cut it out, will you?

377
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:36,056
Okay.

378
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,132
Look at this.

379
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:41,416
Seo-yoon can do it if she tries.

380
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,336
She scored 1.4 right away.

381
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,332
I made an appointment at one more place...

382
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,936
I'm not doing it.

383
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:49,692
I can't do it anymore.

384
00:17:49,716 --> 00:17:52,616
Don't be like this.

385
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:57,135
Just until she gets into Class A. Please?

386
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,132
You can sleep here tonight.

387
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:00,412
Stop it.

388
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:01,692
- Let's sleep together tonight. - Stop it.

389
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:03,096
- Let's sleep. - Whatever.

390
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:10,776
So? Did you find the TR CEO?

391
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:16,092
This is no time to be idle.

392
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:17,532
Don't worry.

393
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,296
Why would I worry about you?

394
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,252
You're the legendary Lee Jung-eun...

395
00:18:21,276 --> 00:18:23,012
that turned everything into a hit with your
touch.

396
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,176
I'm sure you'll do a good job.

397
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,652
Both the president and the director are...

398
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,135
looking forward to it.

399
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:30,252
But the greater their expectations,

400
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,412
the more disappointed they will be.

401
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:32,772
What are you going to do?

402
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:34,372
If you can't find the
CEO before the deadline,

403
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:36,336
it's all your responsibility, you know?

404
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:38,612
An incompetent marketer...

405
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:40,816
who can't even get started.

406
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:45,256
That will make you a legend in a way too.

407
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,296
Do your best, Jung-eun.

408
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,892
Deputy Director Ha's determined.

409
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,016
She looks like she wants the TR Project to
fail.

410
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:01,571
She's trying to...

411
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:03,576
put the blame on you.

412
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:05,895
I'll get it done.

413
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:11,656
Seo-yoon's test is starting soon.

414
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:15,772
You'll have to wait for about 20 minutes.

415
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:16,926
(In session)

416
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:24,563
(The 3rd mock children's intelligence test)

417
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,135
All right.

418
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:29,816
Can you draw it again, as you remember?

419
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,216
Okay.

420
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:40,536
Look at these numbers.

421
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:45,296
Say the numbers you just saw in order.

422
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,736
Okay.

423
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:50,936
99, 8, and 25.

424
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:52,732
Now, can you say the numbers in the
opposite order?

425
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:56,256
25, 8, and 99.

426
00:19:57,116 --> 00:19:58,732
Depending on the child's condition,

427
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:01,092
the test result can vary.

428
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,176
That's what I'd like
to tell you in advance.

429
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,296
Yes, I understand.

430
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:07,416
Is her result...

431
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,852
not good?

432
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,176
No.

433
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:13,496
Seo-yoon is...

434
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,051
in the top one percent, which means...

435
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:18,775
she's one of the smartest children.

436
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:27,176
I'm in the top one percent!

437
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:30,375
Great. You worked hard.

438
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,736
Congratulations, Seo-yoon.

439
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:36,496
You worked hard too.

440
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,816
It's a happy day.

441
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:42,932
How about having a party?

442
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:45,135
Yes, let's have a party.

443
00:20:47,075 --> 00:20:49,296
Let's do it. Please.

444
00:20:57,636 --> 00:21:00,736
This is wonderful!

445
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:02,856
Thank you.

446
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:06,216
Don't be surprised yet. This is just the
beginning.

447
00:21:06,356 --> 00:21:08,652
Seo-yoon, let's get inside.

448
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:10,216
Go in!

449
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,332
Jinny, you can make a wish with me.

450
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:17,736
Can I?

451
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:19,736
- Yes. - Thank you.

452
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,576
You even brought a camera?

453
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:33,932
Sure.

454
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:36,895
One needs to make thorough preparations
for everything.

455
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,776
Seo-yoon, what did you wish for?

456
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:44,732
I wished that I could do well on the actual
test...

457
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:46,776
as I did today.

458
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,496
Mom will be happy then.

459
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,096
Seo-yoon,

460
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:02,336
this is for you!

461
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:04,416
Oh, my!

462
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:09,252
Goodness.

463
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:12,256
This is the Pinkru that I wanted to have.

464
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:15,696
Jinny, thank you!

465
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:20,176
Seo-yoon, you've worked hard.

466
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:22,936
Seo-yoon,

467
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:26,776
there's one more present for you outside.

468
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:31,132
What do you think this is?

469
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:32,571
Oh, my!

470
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:34,652
You can see the stars with this, right?

471
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:36,972
This is how you see the stars using this.

472
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:38,696
Your eye goes here.

473
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:41,932
Turn this with your hand...

474
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:44,336
to adjust the focus.

475
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:46,811
- I think I can see the stars. - Do you?

476
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:48,252
- Do you see them? - Yes!

477
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:51,296
Which star are you looking at?

478
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,576
Thank you.

479
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:58,895
I prepared a present for you too.

480
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:16,976
This is a Christmas gift for you.

481
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:19,976
Already?

482
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:22,256
Soon, as an exchange professor,

483
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,416
I'm going to Chapel Hill.

484
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,336
Do you remember the clock tower...

485
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:30,811
on campus?

486
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:31,972
Of course.

487
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:34,136
I miss that place around this time of the
year.

488
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:37,096
I want to visit it again.

489
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:40,652
Do you think that place is still the same?

490
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:42,096
Come with me...

491
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:43,776
and check it out for yourself.

492
00:23:45,236 --> 00:23:47,416
I have to go there soon.

493
00:23:51,156 --> 00:23:53,176
Are you really going there?

494
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:54,972
When?

495
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:56,336
Would you like...

496
00:23:56,996 --> 00:23:58,336
to go with me?

497
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:04,012
That's...

498
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:06,176
As a Christmas gift for me,

499
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:08,336
I want you...

500
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:11,135
to give me an answer.

501
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:14,656
I'll be waiting.

502
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:18,776
Well...

503
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:23,696
I...

504
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:29,811
Jinny, Mom is almost here.

505
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,456
Let's go now.

506
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:33,656
Yes, we should go.

507
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:43,292
Seo-yoon, you're the best!

508
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,412
Goodness, Seo-yoon.

509
00:24:44,436 --> 00:24:46,656
I told you you can make it.

510
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:48,096
My darling.

511
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:49,692
Such a cutie!

512
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:51,652
They're so happy.

513
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:52,612
See?

514
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:54,612
It's all because of my help.

515
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:56,252
What? I'm speechless.

516
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:57,492
Who do you think prepared for the test with
her...

517
00:24:57,516 --> 00:24:58,812
every morning?

518
00:24:58,836 --> 00:24:59,972
"Prepared"?

519
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:01,612
You played with her.

520
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:04,372
That's how I educate her as a dad.

521
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:07,252
I think I have to publish a book.

522
00:25:07,276 --> 00:25:09,572
The title will be, "How to raise a gifted
child."

523
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:10,692
I did my share too.

524
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:13,176
"How to be a gifted child's mom."

525
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:15,452
Dad, put me down now.

526
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:16,612
- No. - I feel dizzy.

527
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:18,292
No, I won't.

528
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,776
Oh, my goodness.

529
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:27,416
Thank you, Ji-a.

530
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,136
We only have the last test left.

531
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:32,056
I will count on you till the end.

532
00:26:32,236 --> 00:26:33,576
I love you.

533
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:36,191
(Jung-eun)

534
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:16,866

(Jung-eun)

536
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:32,692
Where are you?

537
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:34,656
I'm in front of her preschool.

538
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,332
So far, it's all been practice.

539
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:38,336
Today, it's the real thing, you know.

540
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:40,052
If she doesn't get nervous,

541
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,052
she'll be in the top one percent, no matter
what.

542
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,532
Arrive at the academy early.

543
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:43,852
If the counselor doesn't seem right,

544
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:46,056
request to change to another one. Do you
get it?

545
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:50,932
I'll call you when Seo-yoon goes in to take
the test.

546
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:52,416
Bye.

547
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:06,332
I'm sorry that I asked you to meet me.

548
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:07,532
I know you're busy.

549
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:09,656
You must be worried about Tae-rin.

550
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:11,136
What's her result?

551
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,416
She's in the top 1.2 percent.

552
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:15,532
I think she'll do better for today's test.

553
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:16,856
How about Seo-yoon?

554
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:19,296
Do you want to see this?

555
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,216
Let me see.

556
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:27,092
(Lucid Children's Intelligence Test)

557
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:28,496
Top one percent?

558
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:30,212
Seo-yoon will be accepted then.

559
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:31,492
Don't worry.

560
00:28:31,516 --> 00:28:33,296
Tae-rin will do well on the test too.

561
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:35,816
That's right.

562
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:37,492
You mentioned...

563
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,736
the TR case earlier. How is it going?

564
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:41,976
Not good.

565
00:28:42,236 --> 00:28:45,256
But I tend to try until I get things done.

566
00:28:46,956 --> 00:28:48,692
To be honest,

567
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:50,692
I'm now curious...

568
00:28:50,716 --> 00:28:52,336
who the CEO of TR is.

569
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:53,776
Why?

570
00:28:54,196 --> 00:28:55,856
It frustrates me.

571
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,136
Frustrates you? What do you mean?

572
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:03,176
I'm asking because I'm curious.

573
00:29:03,756 --> 00:29:06,452
TR's key marketing strategy...

574
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:08,732
is charity. That's all good.

575
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:10,492
But wouldn't it be nice
if it could cooperate...

576
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:12,012
with a large company like Aaes...

577
00:29:12,036 --> 00:29:14,292
and expand its size?

578
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:16,372
It would be nice,

579
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:17,532
but do you think it's possible?

580
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,016
Well,

581
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:20,896
I guess I haven't told you yet.

582
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,972
Once, using the charity marketing strategy,

583
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,012
I hit the highest sales record...

584
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:28,256
and donated 10 percent
of the total profits.

585
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:31,656
How much were the profits again?

586
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:36,452
While someone like that exists here,

587
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:38,416
the CEO doesn't even consider a meeting.

588
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,256
That frustrates me. Do you understand?

589
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:45,496
You're right. That CEO is unbelievable.

590
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,372
Hello.

591
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:54,816
How have you been?

592
00:29:55,956 --> 00:29:58,576
The other day, you said you would never
visit me again.

593
00:29:59,236 --> 00:30:01,612
Today, I'm here not as your son Hong Jae-
man.

594
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:03,216
I'm here for business.

595
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,976
Business? What business do we have in
common?

596
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:08,532
Mom, do not settle for making small money.

597
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,452
Let's make big money together.

598
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,372
If you're talking about home shopping, you
can leave.

599
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,292
Leave while I'm talking to you nicely.

600
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:15,252
Come on.

601
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,812
Jackpot Ox Bone Soup in Yeongdeungpo...

602
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:18,092
also started to sell food on
a home shopping network.

603
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:18,476
You have no idea,

604
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:19,972
You have no idea,
but you can earn enough money...

605
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:21,492
to build a building soon. So...

606
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:23,572
I earn enough money here.

607
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:25,252
You can go and make big money.

608
00:30:25,276 --> 00:30:28,016
Don't just keep turning me down.

609
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,376
Who is it?

610
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:31,564
(Hwangseok Sundae Soup owner)

611
00:30:34,196 --> 00:30:36,372
Mom, take a look at this before we talk.

612
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:39,216
Look at this, and then tell me.

613
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:41,856
I can't believe this.

614
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,412
How could you use a photo like this?

615
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:44,732
Leave now!

616
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:47,172
Come on. You need
to look at this in detail...

617
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:48,616
Gosh.

618
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:49,976
Leave!

619
00:30:52,756 --> 00:30:55,132
Next time, we'll meet as moms of Class A.

620
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:56,896
I like the sound of that.

621
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:59,376
Oh, you know what?

622
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:01,412
At Big Parker, no working mom...

623
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:03,172
has been able to get
their child into Class A.

624
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,612
We're the first.

625
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:05,936
Is that true?

626
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:08,252
Actually, Sophie's mom...

627
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:10,372
was my colleague, but she quit her job...

628
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:11,812
to focus on her child.

629
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,936
Only after that did Sophie advance to Class
A.

630
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:16,092
But we...

631
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:18,176
made it while working.

632
00:31:18,716 --> 00:31:20,376
I guess you're right.

633
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,736
- See you. - Bye.

What is this regarding?

637
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:33,532
I can't reach Mr. Hong.

638
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:35,252
I received a certification
of mail contents.

639
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:37,696
Pardon? Certification of contents?

640
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:39,212
Isn't it a delivery mistake?

641
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:40,572
No, it isn't.

642
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:42,576
It was sent to Mr. Hong.

That's it. Go up. All right.

647
00:31:56,276 --> 00:31:58,892
Yes. Just keep going up like this.

everything...

Hello, Jung-eun. What's up?

652
00:32:09,236 --> 00:32:11,132
The store received a
contents-certified mail.

653
00:32:11,156 --> 00:32:12,212
What is it about?

654
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:14,292
Wh-What did it receive?

655
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:15,212
From where?

656
00:32:15,236 --> 00:32:16,656
From a bank.

657
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:18,816
That's...

658
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:24,452
I guess I forgot to pay the interest.

659
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,812

660
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:28,692
It's only been overdue for a few days...

661
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,332
and they sent a contents-certified mail for
that?

662
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:32,456
- I'll go and tell those punks...
- Interest?

00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,216

What?

665
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:39,932
I told you to put the store on the market.

And you got a loan?

00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:45,216
Well, it's...

668
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:47,776
Not the store, but a loan.

669
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,376
Is it an intracorporate loan?

670
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:53,136
What are you talking about?

00:32:53,676 --> 00:32:54,852

00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:32,416
I need to take the test.

742
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:35,576
How can you take the test when you're this
sick?

743
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,332
If I fail the test,

744
00:36:37,356 --> 00:36:40,296
Mom will be upset.

745
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:43,896
Seo-yoon, what are you saying?

746
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,252
It's all right.

747
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:48,616
I'll explain to Mom.

748
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,736
You can take the test next time.

749
00:36:52,195 --> 00:36:53,612
Really?

750
00:36:53,636 --> 00:36:55,096
Of course.

751
00:36:55,636 --> 00:36:56,975
Right now,

752
00:36:57,276 --> 00:36:59,576
the test doesn't matter.

753
00:37:00,076 --> 00:37:01,816
Seo-yoon matters more.

754
00:37:02,396 --> 00:37:03,896
Do you understand what I mean?

755
00:37:04,276 --> 00:37:05,576
Yes.

756
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:19,256
Why isn't she picking up?

757
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,645
(Hwangseok Sundae Soup)

758
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:26,532
What did you do with that money?

759
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:28,012
Jung-eun, calm down.

760
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:29,776
- I can explain. - Hey!

761
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:31,772
Do you think I can calm down now?

762
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:34,056
- Tell me now! - Okay.

763
00:37:35,076 --> 00:37:37,336
Jung-eun, don't pinch my ears!

764
00:37:38,396 --> 00:37:41,052
You idiot, seriously!

765
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:42,376
What?

766
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:44,132
Seo-yoon is sick?

767
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:45,495
What's wrong?

768
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:48,252
My goodness. No wonder.

769
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:49,651
I thought it was strange...

770
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,896
that she wasn't here yet.

771
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:54,656
Yes, Tae-rin went in to take the test.

772
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:56,532
The kid matters more.

773
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:58,096
The test isn't important.

774
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:02,536
Then shall I go in and explain what
happened?

775
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:05,736
Then we can't help it.

776
00:38:08,156 --> 00:38:10,656
Don't wait for her, and
proceed with the test.

777
00:38:17,316 --> 00:38:19,576
Class A is out of her league indeed.

778
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,376
Don't you know what day today is?

779
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:29,892
It's the real test day for Seo-yoon's Lucid
test.

780
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,176
Do I have to come all the way here because
of you?

781
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:34,492
I'm sorry.

782
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:37,136
I'm stressed out today already.

783
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,216
Make sure...

784
00:38:39,715 --> 00:38:41,696
you bring that money.

785
00:38:42,675 --> 00:38:45,656
I can get it all back next week. I mean it.

786
00:38:46,836 --> 00:38:48,216
Are you sure?

787
00:38:49,756 --> 00:38:50,812
Of course.

788
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:53,456
Everything will be settled next week.

789
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:55,495
Then,

790
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:56,772
until next week,

791
00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:58,892
don't even think about coming into the
bedroom.

792
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,656
Jung-eun!

793
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:07,216
Yes, Mother.

794
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:10,176
What?

795
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:11,736
The ER?

796
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:13,882
(Emergency Center)

797
00:39:16,836 --> 00:39:17,972
Seo-yoon!

798
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:19,336
Okay.

799
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:22,132
What happened?

800
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:23,456
What did the doctor say?

801
00:39:23,996 --> 00:39:25,572
Stress-induced vomiting.

802
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,096
Stress? From what?

803
00:39:28,156 --> 00:39:29,252
The academy. The test.

804
00:39:29,276 --> 00:39:30,736
How can she not be stressed?

805
00:39:31,356 --> 00:39:33,536
I knew she was barely holding it together.

806
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,492
Is she okay now?

807
00:39:36,516 --> 00:39:38,336
She got an injection and fell asleep.

808
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:44,056
So she missed the test?

809
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:46,936
You...

810
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,216
The kid was burning up...

811
00:39:49,276 --> 00:39:51,056
and throwing up. She was sick.

812
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:53,132
I should've forced her to take it?

813
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:54,452
Jung-eun, seriously?
I'm not saying you should've forced her.

814
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,456
I'm not saying you should've forced her.

815
00:39:56,715 --> 00:39:59,412
But you could have at least explained the
situation.

816
00:39:59,436 --> 00:40:00,812
Jung-eun, we're in a hospital.

817
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:02,456
Can you not? Look at Seo-yoon.

818
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:06,171
I should call CM Gifted Academy now.

819
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,052
- Don't... - Mom.

820
00:40:08,076 --> 00:40:09,452
Are you okay, Seo-yoon?

821
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:10,936
Daddy's here.

822
00:40:10,996 --> 00:40:12,456
I'm sorry.

823
00:40:12,715 --> 00:40:15,936
I'm sorry I got sick, Mom.

824
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:18,852
Don't say that. You don't need to apologize
for that.

825
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:20,292
It's okay.

826
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:22,132
Right. Don't say that.

827
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:23,936
Why would you be sorry?

828
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:31,292
Yes, this is CM Gifted Academy, right?

829
00:40:31,316 --> 00:40:33,292
I'm calling about Hong Seo-yoon's test
today.

830
00:40:33,316 --> 00:40:35,332
She had a medical emergency.

831
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:37,132
Is there any chance she could take it
tomorrow?

832
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:39,452
Yes, I know it's over.

833
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:42,336
Can't she take it tomorrow?

834
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:44,975
I'm begging you. Please.

835
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:47,176
I'm begging you.

836
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:51,656
Yes.

837
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:54,736
Okay.

838
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:01,176
Gosh, what do we do?

839
00:41:01,796 --> 00:41:03,096
What do we do?

840
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:05,176
What do we do?

841
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,336
Mom.

842
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:09,616
Yes?

843
00:41:10,956 --> 00:41:12,212
I'm sorry.

844
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,656
No, sweetheart.

845
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:16,612
Don't say that.

846
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:18,296
Take Seo-yoon home.

847
00:41:18,516 --> 00:41:19,816
Okay.

848
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,576
Goodness.

849
00:41:29,396 --> 00:41:31,616
This is all because of my daughter-in-law.

850
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:35,456
I sincerely apologize.

851
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:38,656
Professor, there's no need for you to
apologize.

852
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,292
I should meet her now...

853
00:41:40,316 --> 00:41:42,132
and put her in her place...

854
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:44,576
No, don't.

855
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,651
I saw everything that happened to Seo-yoon
today.

856
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:49,212
You really expect me to
just sit back and do nothing?

857
00:41:49,236 --> 00:41:52,052
Just let it go.

858
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,412
I can't do that.

859
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:55,296
For my daughter-in-law's own good too,

860
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:57,292
I can't ignore this.

861
00:41:57,316 --> 00:41:58,736
Professor, please...

862
00:41:59,356 --> 00:42:02,376
don't confront your daughter-in-law.

863
00:42:02,516 --> 00:42:04,256
I'm asking you.

864
00:42:25,516 --> 00:42:26,612
Hello?

865
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:29,696
This is Yoon Ji-a.

866
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,130
It's been a while since we've met one-on-
one.

867
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,650
Just get to the point.

868
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,609
I want Seo-yoon moved to Class A.

869
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:10,010
And why would I do that?

870
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,206
Winning the speech contest was
supposed...

871
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,569
to guarantee her a spot in Class A.

872
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,846
Seo-yoon and Jung-eun...

873
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,850
worked hard for it.

874
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,050
I gave her a chance, didn't I?

875
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,170
I heard she didn't take the test.

876
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,206
The test didn't even
matter in the first place,

877
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,730
and you know it.

878
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,890
Move her up, as you promised.

879
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:46,809
Are you anxious...

880
00:43:48,149 --> 00:43:49,929
to meet me in person, Ju-hee?

881
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:54,488
Don't call me that.

882
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,365
(Song Ju-hee)

883
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,569
What do I do now, Ms. Yoon?

884
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,889
If people find out about it,

885
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:11,885
I will drop out.

886
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:14,129
Drop out from school?

887
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:15,684
You're in ninth grade.

888
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:17,164
You can't just quit.

889
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:18,365
It's better than having everyone know.

890
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,525
I should just leave.

891
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:21,968
Don't worry.

892
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:23,845
I will take care of it.

893
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,045
But you're leaving school...

894
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:27,289
because of me.

895
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:29,205
I stole.

896
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:30,809
I should be the one leaving.

897
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:43,649
I'll protect you,

898
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:47,249
but you have to promise me one thing.

899
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:53,169
No matter how tough things get,

900
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:56,805
you can't take things from people...

901
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:58,209
ever again.

902
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:00,008
Can you promise me that?

903
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:02,329
Yes.

904
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:06,729
Even if I'm gone, you need to continue the
treatment.

905
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:26,049
I'm no longer Song Ju-hee.

906
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:29,529
I'm Song Ho-gyung.

907
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:37,929
I keep the promises I make.

908
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:42,729
There's nothing for you to be afraid of.

909
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:47,929
This time,

910
00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:52,609
I'm asking you for a favor.

911
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:02,249
Jung-eun,

912
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:05,605
did you have to act
like that at the hospital?

913
00:47:05,629 --> 00:47:07,369
Seo-yoon was right there.

914
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,164
My child was sick.

915
00:47:10,188 --> 00:47:12,609
Do you think I wasn't upset?

916
00:47:12,668 --> 00:47:14,449
Of course, I was.

917
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:18,008
But you only ever see half of things.

918
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:20,045
We had an opportunity, you know.

919
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:22,085
Do you think opportunities like this come
easily?

920
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,965
Seo-yoon worked so hard for this.

921
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:25,529
You saw it.

922
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:28,209
And now it's all going to waste?

923
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:31,609
You can resent me all you want.

924
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:35,008
As long as Seo-yoon can get ahead,

925
00:47:35,668 --> 00:47:37,209
I'll do whatever it takes.

926
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:39,769
Gosh.

927
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:42,209
That darn Class A.

928
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:47,729
Stay out of it.

929
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:50,329
Just get the money.

930
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:52,488
Don't stand in her way.

931
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:59,249
Ms. Lee, you're not heading home?

932
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:01,008
You go ahead.

933
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:02,938
(Marketing Team 1)

934
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:04,329
Lee Jung-eun.

935
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:08,405
Mr. Kim, we should go first.

936
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:09,729
Come on.

937
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:12,209
Let's go.

938
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:22,405
The Grand Award goes...

939
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:24,965
to Hong Seo-yoon!

940
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:26,365
- Yes! - Who? Seo-yoon?

941
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:27,769
The Grand Award?

942
00:48:28,229 --> 00:48:29,684
(Grand Award)

943
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:31,409
Tommy placed second.

944
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:33,529
And Seo-yoon placed first!

945
00:48:33,668 --> 00:48:35,085
Finally, she's moving...

946
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:36,525
to Class A at Big Parker.

947
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:38,045
Top one percent?

948
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:40,008
Seo-yoon will be accepted then.

949
00:49:04,996 --> 00:49:09,272
(Smart video doorbell)

950
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:13,209
Have a seat.

951
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:16,609
What brings you all the way here?

952
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:24,329
Ms. Song.

953
00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:27,249
Please give Seo-yoon one more chance.

954
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:29,685
What do you think you're doing?

955
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:31,649
I'll do whatever you ask. Anything.

956
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:33,849
If she doesn't make it this time,

957
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,205
I'll accept whatever you decide,

958
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:36,485
whether it's demoting her to Class C...

959
00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:38,809
or making her quit entirely. So...

960
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:41,849
Please give her one more chance. I beg you.

961
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:43,649
Please.

962
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:52,595
Please.

963
00:50:02,129 --> 00:50:03,549
Lift your head.

964
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:09,029
Lift your head. I will give her a chance.

965
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:17,189
You will?

966
00:50:18,609 --> 00:50:20,789
I'll put it to a vote with
the Class A parents.

967
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:23,109
Pardon?

968
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:28,629
What do you mean by that?

969
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:31,425
I will move her up to Class A.

970
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:33,149
The vote is just a formality.

971
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:38,225
Thank you so much.

972
00:50:38,249 --> 00:50:39,949
Thank you, Ms. Song.

973
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:42,229
I really appreciate it.

974
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:47,709
Tell your mom...

975
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:50,469
that I kept my promise.

976
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:52,629
"Promise"?

977
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:06,389
Did you meet with Tommy's mom yesterday?

978
00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:09,065
I did. Why?

979
00:51:09,089 --> 00:51:11,589
She suddenly agreed to move Seo-yoon up!

980
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:14,109
What did you say to her?

981
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:16,629
And what did she mean about a "promise"?

982
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:18,669
Right.

983
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:22,309
I went to Tommy's mom and told her...

984
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:25,065
it was all my fault that
Seo-yoon missed the test.

985
00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:26,145
That I messed everything up.

986
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:28,105
I begged her to move Seo-yoon up...

987
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:29,869
to Class A.

988
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:32,389
You did?

989
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,029
It was you!

990
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:38,749
Thank you so much, Mom.

991
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:41,105
I'm so touched.

992
00:51:41,129 --> 00:51:42,429
Gosh.

993
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,265
A vote?

994
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:52,109
Yes. Seo-yoon's moving up to Class A.

995
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:55,105
I guess people aren't as bad as they seem.

996
00:51:55,129 --> 00:51:57,589
Tommy's mom acted like she'd never budge,

997
00:51:57,769 --> 00:51:59,629
but in the end, she's giving us a shot.

998
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:03,429
Does that mean Seo-yoon is officially in
Class A?

999
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:04,945
Basically.

1000
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:07,109
Tommy's mom already agreed.

1001
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:10,265
That's one vote in our favor. Then there's
you.

1002
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:11,949
So that's two votes.

1003
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,025
Even if Jason's mom and Annie's mom...

1004
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,509
vote against us,

1005
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:18,829
the tiebreaker is still Tommy's mom.

1006
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:22,189
Which means Seo-yoon is in.

1007
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,349
You really think...

1008
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:28,185
the other moms will just let this slide?

1009
00:52:28,209 --> 00:52:29,985
So what if they don't?

1010
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:32,029
Tommy's mom made the call.

1011
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,265
Once Seo-yoon's in,

1012
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:37,149
we'll all be in the same class.

1013
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:39,189
I might as well go ahead and meet them.

1014
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,309
Give me their contact info.

1015
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:46,465
After what happened with the babysitter
mess,

1016
00:52:46,489 --> 00:52:49,509
you think we're close enough to meet up?

1017
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:52,869
I never got to apologize properly.

1018
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:55,349
Forgive me. It's long overdue.

1019
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:57,349
I sincerely apologize for it.

1020
00:52:57,889 --> 00:52:59,585
What made you apologize now?

1021
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,425
Seo-yoon will join Class A...

1022
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,749
after the vote, you know.

1023
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:05,505
So I just wanted to get in touch...

1024
00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:07,425
and introduce myself properly before the
vote.

1025
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:08,505
You know.

1026
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:09,829
A vote?

1027
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:12,709
Let's be good friends from now on.

1028
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:16,665
I've honestly never seen a kid...

1029
00:53:16,689 --> 00:53:18,145
as smart and adorable...

1030
00:53:18,169 --> 00:53:19,869
as Annie. She's like a little doll.

1031
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:24,305
And of course, with a mom as beautiful,

1032
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,629
how could she not be?

1033
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:29,705
And I hear she's just...

1034
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:32,425
the sweetest. Everyone says it.

1035
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:33,749
Well,

1036
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:35,865
I suppose she does take after me.

1037
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:37,189
Of course.

1038
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:40,149
It's obvious she's totally her mother's
daughter.

1039
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:42,989
Right, my Annie is...

1040
00:53:46,729 --> 00:53:48,185
Wait.

1041
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:51,145
So you're telling me Tommy's mom actually
said...

1042
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:52,745
we will decide it through a vote?

1043
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:53,985
Yes,

1044
00:53:54,009 --> 00:53:55,309
she said so.

1045
00:53:56,009 --> 00:53:58,305
How on earth did your daughter manage...

1046
00:53:58,329 --> 00:53:59,945
to pull one over...

1047
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:01,785
on Tommy's mom?

1048
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:03,949
Seemed like Class A was never going to
happen.

1049
00:54:04,209 --> 00:54:06,149
And now there's going to be another vote?

1050
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:07,665
That's what they're saying.

1051
00:54:07,689 --> 00:54:09,065
Why would they take a vote?

1052
00:54:09,089 --> 00:54:11,105
Whenever they see us,

1053
00:54:11,129 --> 00:54:13,105
they roll their eyeballs...

1054
00:54:13,129 --> 00:54:15,069
like this, you know.

1055
00:54:15,129 --> 00:54:17,749
There's no way those wenches would agree
to it.

1056
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,425
Alright, everyone. That's it for today.

1057
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:43,825
We will circle back around and go over...

1058
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:45,265
the answers next class.

1059
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:47,465
Good job today, and we will see you
tomorrow.

1060
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:49,509
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1061
00:54:54,809 --> 00:54:56,109
What?

1062
00:54:56,809 --> 00:54:58,949
That's my pencil.

1063
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:05,189
Mom!

1064
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,225
My little cutie pie.

1065
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:08,225
Mom!

1066
00:55:08,249 --> 00:55:10,709
My son! Come here.

1067
00:55:13,049 --> 00:55:15,589
Tommy stole my pencil.

1068
00:55:16,249 --> 00:55:17,549
What?

1069
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:19,909
What did you just say, Jason?

1070
00:55:20,649 --> 00:55:22,185
Tommy did what?

1071
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:23,589
Excuse us.

1072
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:27,069
What did you say, Jason?

1073
00:55:27,209 --> 00:55:29,149
Tommy's pencil case...

1074
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:31,709
had one just like mine.

1075
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:35,305
You must've been mistaken.

1076
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:37,909
No! It's mine!

1077
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:41,025
I even bit it,

1078
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:43,589
and Tommy's has the same mark!

1079
00:55:44,969 --> 00:55:46,949
Is it really yours, Jason?

1080
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:50,669
Are you absolutely sure?

1081
00:55:53,649 --> 00:55:55,109
Jason's mom.

1082
00:55:56,329 --> 00:55:58,585
How did you educate your kid?

1083
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:01,105
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1084
00:56:01,129 --> 00:56:02,745
How dare he make up...

1085
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:04,429
such nonsense about my Tommy?

1086
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:07,505
It's a misunderstanding, ma'am.

1087
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:09,269
I let your kid into Class A...

1088
00:56:09,729 --> 00:56:11,145
even though he barely made the cut,

1089
00:56:11,169 --> 00:56:12,989
and this is how you repay me?

1090
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:15,869
Is he even thinking straight?

1091
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:27,429
It's okay, Jason.

1092
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:29,505
It's okay.

1093
00:56:29,529 --> 00:56:31,625
Don't cry, Jason.

1094
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:33,269
But it really is mine.

1095
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:35,709
I'm not lying.

1096
00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:38,909
I know, I know. You're not lying.

1097
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:40,909
But isn't it possible...

1098
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:44,025
Tommy just has one that looks the same?

1099
00:56:44,049 --> 00:56:47,149
No, it's mine.

1100
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:48,669
I see.

1101
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:50,309
But...

1102
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:52,945
did you ask Tommy about it first?

1103
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:54,349
No.

1104
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:56,309
I didn't ask him.

1105
00:56:56,649 --> 00:56:59,029
Let's go ask Tommy first then.

1106
00:56:59,689 --> 00:57:02,509
He might have one that looks the same.

1107
00:57:03,209 --> 00:57:05,185
Or maybe he found it on the floor,

1108
00:57:05,209 --> 00:57:06,949
not knowing that it belonged to you.

1109
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:08,949
What do you think, Jason?

1110
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:11,349
Stop.

1111
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:13,789
Jason.

1112
00:57:14,649 --> 00:57:16,069
Come here, boy.

1113
00:57:34,439 --> 00:57:37,146
(We thank Kim Ki-moo for his special
appearance.)

1114
00:58:07,737 --> 00:58:11,184
(Mother and Mom)

1115
00:58:11,609 --> 00:58:13,265
Are you playing me?

1116
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,429
Go ask your mom.

1117
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:17,665
How can you date at your granddaughter's
academy?

1118
00:58:17,689 --> 00:58:19,505
With Tommy's grandfather too!

1119
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,305
Thanks to you, Mom, we were kicked out...

1120
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:23,425
not only from Class A, but from Big Parker.

1121
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:25,585
Do you plan to keep seeing Seo-yoon's
grandmother?

1122
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:27,629
You stay out of my business.

1123
00:58:28,489 --> 00:58:30,185
Why are you deleting Grandma's number?

1124
00:58:30,209 --> 00:58:31,509
Why?

1125
00:58:31,649 --> 00:58:33,105
I believe this is the ball you saw...

1126
00:58:33,129 --> 00:58:34,505
on the day of the vote.

1127
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:36,585
Do you still have business here?

1128
00:58:36,609 --> 00:58:38,385
You took Seo-yoon's place,

1129
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:39,829
and I'm here to get it back.
