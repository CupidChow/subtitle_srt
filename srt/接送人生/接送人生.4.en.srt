00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:17,478
we'll draw the last lot.

Really?

15
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:36,082
The last number is...

16
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:38,882
number 17.

17
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:42,642
No.

18
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:44,641
I clearly saw it.

19
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:47,282
It was number seven.

20
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,802
Here.

21
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:54,282
I'm number 17.

22
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,322
Hey.

23
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:01,718
Wait a minute.

24
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:03,638
- What? - What's she doing?

25
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:05,478
Is she crazy? How can it be seven?

26
00:01:05,502 --> 00:01:07,122
Let me take a look.

27
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,322
I saw it was seven.

28
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:13,798

00:01:16,982 --> 00:01:19,642

See? It's 17.

32
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,038
What a weirdo.

33
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:25,442
It can't be.

34
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:29,402

You've finally become...

43
00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:08,998
the official member...

45
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:13,002
It's all thanks to you, ma'am.

46
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:15,042
No need to thank me.

47
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:16,482

48
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:18,842

stop calling me ma'am?

50
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,878
Oh, about how we went...

51
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:27,238

Gosh, I don't know how people found out,

53
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:30,998
but everyone's praising...

54
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:33,238
about how I cast her.

55
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:36,562
I will soon schedule it again with her.

56
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:38,002
Good.

57
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:40,362

with you, Ms. Song.

60
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:48,162
She almost scared me.

I used to look for a forest like this...

every weekend...

73
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,682
and camp out with my daughter.

74
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,398
We talked all night long...

75
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,242

76
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:38,802
But after we returned to Korea,

77

my daughter was born in the USA.

82

I want to see the stars too.

98
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:30,958
Do you like watching the stars, Seo-yoon?

99
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:32,078
Yes.

100
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,718
Her mom used to love watching the stars...

101
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:34,877
when she was young.

102
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,558
She took that from her mom.

103
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:38,642
I know.

104
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:42,842
Then I will show you and Min-ho...

105
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,478

Hey, wait for me.

112
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:03,321
Wait.

113
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,518
Why not play with them?

114
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:14,321
Those two are having fun alone.

115
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,798
Don't you know why I'm here?

116
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:21,558
Because of the pain in your back?

117
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:23,558
Two's company, three's a crowd.

118
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,722
You need to know that.

119
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:29,242
How can you not know that?

120
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:31,201
"Two's company, three's a crowd?"

121
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:35,558
I mean,

122
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:38,682
I clearly saw it was seven.

123
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,602
Jung-eun, that's enough.

124
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,682
You checked it yourself.

125
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,881
That's why it's strange.

126
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:47,478
You saw things...

127
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:49,282
because you were desperate.

128
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:53,318
What am I going to do about Seo-yoon?

129
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:55,162
What else?

130
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,318
Are you going to be this down...

131
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:57,798
just because you didn't
get into Myeongseong?

132
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:59,882
Gosh, you're coming with me.

133
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:02,238
To where?

134
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,118
I was going to send my child to Gongnam...

135
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,842
if I didn't make it to Myeongseong.

136
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,362
One second.

137
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,082
Here it is.

138
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:13,838
Forget what you missed...

139
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:16,162
and put yourself on the
wait list in Gongnam-dong.

140
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:18,842
Gongnam-dong?

141
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:20,558
Are you telling me to move?

142
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:22,478
If you fail private school,
what other alternative...

143
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:24,122
do you have than public school?

144
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:26,322
Then it's got to be Gangnam.

145
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:30,002
Gongnam Elementary is as
good as most private schools.

146
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:31,238
Get moving first.

147
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,118
I'm not sure if there are
any houses available now,

148
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,562
but you have to move first.

149
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:36,918
- Okay. - I'll get my car.

150
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:38,242
Wait here.

151
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:42,722
Gosh.

152
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,602
I expected Myeongseong...

153
00:06:45,662 --> 00:06:47,642
to be my daughter's start line.

154
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,078
Hi.

155
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:01,882

157
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:08,962
About earlier...

158
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,962
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

159
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,078
Now I see that you have a habit...

160
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,842
of making a scene everywhere you go.

161
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:19,162
Pardon?

162
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:23,282
Do you want to stop going to Big Parker?

163
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:27,002
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:29,842
I'll never let that happen again.

165
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,162
(Myeongseong)

166
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,042
This is beautiful.

167
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:28,322
Oh, my.

168
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:31,442
Are you okay?

169
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:34,397
Oh, yes.

170
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:37,282
I'm just checking out the view.

171
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:43,002
One, two, three.

172
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,882
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

173
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,198
Don't run.

174
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:04,601
Okay.

175
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:08,318
- Grandma. - Yes.

176
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:09,998
Hey.

177
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:12,721
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

178
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:14,198
How fun was it?

179
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,838
- As big as the universe.
- It was so much fun.

180
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:17,162
Yes?
- Mi-chun. - Yes?

181

182
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:21,078
- Yes? - Yes.

183

186
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:26,962
Is everyone here?

187
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,397
- They're all here.
- I will show you the way.

188
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:32,562
Let's go. Come on.

189
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,322
Hurry.

190
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:37,802
Come in.

191
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:39,918
Cool.

192
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:42,638
Do you want to play bubbles outside?

193
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:43,558
- Yes. - Yes.

194
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,162
Come on.

195
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:46,762
Thank you.

196
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:49,678
- Thank you. - Take a look around.

197
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,318
- Thank you. - Nice.

198
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,362
Yes, thank you.

199
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:00,522
Freeze.

200
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:02,282
- Unfreeze. - Here.

201
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:05,721
What's this for?

202
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:08,402
Haven't you seen an apron before?

203
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:10,517
When you come to a place like this,

204
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,682
men are supposed to cook.

205
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:15,438
- I... - No.

206
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:18,601
You should sit down and rest over there.

207
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:21,242
Yes.

208
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:34,601
It's just one meal. Why
did you buy so much?

209
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:36,721
Then eat a lot.

210
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:43,438
Oh, how pitiful.

211
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:45,958
You look like you have
a sad story or something.

212
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:47,922
Is slicing the onion that sad?

213
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,122
Gosh, you should get some fresh air.

214
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:16,482
How sad your story is.

215
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:23,242
Oh, you're good at it.

216
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,122
Let me try.

217
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,116
(You did it.)

218
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:33,296
(Camera)

219
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:35,042
Here.

220
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:36,918
- Take a picture. - Take a picture.

221
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:38,718
Take a picture. Here.

222
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:39,998
- Look. - Hi.

223
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,478
You should try this. Yes.

224
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:43,242
- It's going up. - It's going up.

225
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:45,802
Can you take a picture of me?

226
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:48,202
I'll take a picture of you.

227
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:50,402
So pretty.

228
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,682
Good job.

229
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,402
My goodness.

230
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:06,402
See? Isn't that beautiful?

231
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:09,282
Yes, it's beautiful.

232
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,162
Grandma.

233
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:14,118
If Seo-yoon and Min-ho get married later,

234
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:16,562
do they become a family?

235
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:18,762
Seo-yoon and Min-ho?

236
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,838
They should wait for their turns.

237
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:22,558
Min-ho's grandpa and Seo-yoon's grandma...

238
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:23,882
should get married first.

239
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:27,122
What? Then only one couple?

240
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:30,118
They can both be couples.

241
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:32,758
They can be each other's in-laws.

242
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:35,282
Then it will be Seo-yoon and Min-ho.

243
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,962
Why do you have to say that?

244
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:41,838
Look.

245
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,438
They can all get married,

246
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,358
but if there can be only one couple,

247
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:46,998
then the grandma
should get the chance first.

248
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:48,478
But Grandma.

249
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:52,238
If you say that, I'm a little disappointed.

250
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:54,442
You already got married once before.

251
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:58,122
Then you should make
concessions to us children.

252
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:03,198
Oh, my gosh. Listen to your words.

253
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:05,402
I raised a tiger's baby, didn't I?

254
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,758
I have a point, don't I?

255
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:11,118
You do have a point, but think about it.

256
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:12,038
Here.

257
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:15,558
I lived alone longer than your whole life.

258
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,078
I don't care about that.

259
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:19,318
Since Seo-yoon and Min-ho met first,

260
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:21,442
they have my support.

261
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,842
Oh, how frustrating.

262
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:28,882
Jung-eun.

263
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:30,398
Hi.

264
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:31,798
(Gongnam Palace)

265
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:34,242
I guess Seo-yoon

266
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:38,282
should go to Gongnam Elementary School.

267
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,642
Of course.

268
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:47,798
It's Gongnam over Myeongseong.

269
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:49,038
Forget Myeongseong.

270
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,722
Tell them you refuse even if they beg you.

271
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:54,842
So what are you worried about?

272
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,802
Money.

273
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:00,362
This is in Gangnam.

274
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:03,278
Should I let my ladies...

275
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,478
live in Gongnam-dong?

276
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:08,002
Seriously.

277
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:12,362
By the way, Divine General that son of...

278
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,078
Be quiet.

279
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:17,638
Give me the address.
I'll send him to the divine.

280
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:19,402
- Seriously... - Stop it.

281
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:20,798
Still, he got the babysitter right.

282
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:23,758
Hey, he only got half
right. That's cheating.

283
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:25,038
What if you ordered
something from home shopping,

284
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:26,958
but you only got half of
it? Isn't that upsetting?

285
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:30,198
Even my work gives
a full refund in 15 days.

286
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:33,118
I'll get a refund today. So don't worry.

287
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:36,362

289
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,842
On the wait list.

290
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:43,642
Oh, yes. Wait for the
real estate. Let's go.

291
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:48,278
You sprained your ankle.

292
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,042
Does she have to get surgery?

293
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:51,398
Stay at the hospital for tonight,

294
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,082
and you can go home tomorrow.

295
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:54,882
And you should get a treatment.

296
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,882
You should've been careful.

297
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:05,638
I'm glad that we got into Myeongseong,

298
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:07,402
but who's going to drive Min-ho?

299
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:11,042
Father agreed to drive him for a while.

300
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,282
Dad?

301
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:15,882
But he's so busy. What's gotten into him?

302
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:21,482
- Nice. - Amazing.

303
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,278
Enjoy.

00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,122
- Thank you. - Thank you.

305
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:35,922
- This is really good. - Yes.

306
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:37,602
Even though I made it, it's good.

307
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:42,118
There are no houses available these days.

308
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,198

to find something available.

310
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:48,082
But...

311
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:51,438
there happens to be one house...

312
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:53,442
that's within Gongnam Elementary district.

313
00:15:54,222 --> 00:15:55,438
What's the condition?

314
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:57,042
Rent? Lease?

315
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:02,882
It's on sale. It's around
132 square meters.

316
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:05,558
That's too big.

317
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:08,202
There are only large homes here.

318
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:10,838
That leaves me no option.

319
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:13,038

all the real estate offices in this area.

324
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:23,402
If there's anything
available, call me. Okay?

325
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:26,602
What's wrong?

326
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:28,198
We have to hurry up.

327

smaller one available soon.

You feel different from Seo-yoon.

372
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:53,317
My arms are getting pumped up...

373
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,442
from a few pushes.

374
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:00,522
Just kidding.

375
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,242
You must be tired.

376
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:25,242
I have a name too.

377
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:29,042
Do you not remember it?

378
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,602
You said it was Lee Young-wook.

379
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:35,322
Just in case you forgot.

380
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:37,202
I remember it.

381
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:41,122
I'm honored, Ms. Yoon Ji-a.

382
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,042
Why did you go to North Carolina?

383
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:48,282
I went to graduate school there.

384
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:49,882
Oh, my.

385
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:53,122
Maybe we've run into each other.

386
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:55,962
Do you remember the clock tower...

387
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,438
in the campus?

388
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,518
Of course.

389
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,802
I miss that place around
this time of the year.

390
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,762
I want to visit it again.

391
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:06,682
I probably can't, right?

392
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:10,482
Do you think that place is still the same?

393
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:13,002
Check it yourself.

394
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:14,482
What?

395
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,562
Do you want to go check it together?

396
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,602
I have to go there soon.

397
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:24,202
As you can see, I'm busy.

398
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,398
When are you going?

399
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:29,882
If I tell you,

400
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:32,042
will you come with me?

401
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:35,882
Never mind.

402
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:38,762
I won't tell you when I'm leaving then.

403
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:39,958
My goodness.

404
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:42,922
You should go together.

405
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:46,802
I'm sleeping.

406
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:50,322
Gosh, I must be tired.

407
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:54,482
I'm talking in my sleep.

408
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:59,158
Are you sure we got everything?

409
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,358
Gosh.

410
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:03,401
No, you must be more tired from driving.

411
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:06,958
- We're here. - Yes.

412
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:08,798
Mi-chun, drive safe.

413
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:10,358
Yes, drive home safe.

414
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:12,558
- Bye. - Bye, kids.

415
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:14,398
- Bye. - Come on. Let's go.

416
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,758
- Bye. - Let's go home.

417
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:18,562
- Bye. - Bye.

418
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:20,678
- Bye. - Bye.

419
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:22,042
See you tomorrow.

420
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,401
Isn't she pretty?

421
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,482
Yes.

422
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:36,082
She's pretty.

423
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:41,161
Seo-yoon shines brightly.

424
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:44,042
Yes.

425
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:47,242
She shines brightly.

426
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:51,322
Oh, right, Min-ho.

427
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:52,758
If your mom asks...

428
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:55,641
I know it's a secret.

429
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,718
Yes, and...

430
00:21:57,742 --> 00:22:00,678
the pictures we took with
Seo-yoon's grandma...

431
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:03,958
I already sent them to your phone.

432
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:05,322
Did you?

433
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,682
Good job.

434
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:12,322
It's your dad.

435
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,442
What brings you to call me?

436
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:27,358
- Mom. - Seo-yoon.

437
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:29,482
Welcome home.

438
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,158
- What about dinner? - I already had it.

439
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:32,802
How did the draw go?

440
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:36,442
We decided to send her to Gongnam.

441
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:38,282
Gongnam?

442
00:22:38,662 --> 00:22:40,282
Isn't that in Gangnam?

443
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:43,362
Seo-yoon, I'm sorry.

444
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:46,758
You'll have to go to Gongnam
instead of Myeongseong.

445
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,962
Tae-rin's going to Gongnam too.

446
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:52,482
Yes! Do I get to go to school with Tae-rin?

447
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:54,158
Are you that excited?

448
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:55,678
Yes, I love it.

449
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:56,758
You're the best.

450
00:22:56,782 --> 00:22:57,837
Right?

451
00:22:57,861 --> 00:22:59,958
Mom chose your favorite school.

452
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:02,122
Mom's the best.

453
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,641
Seo-yoon.

454
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:08,678
What did you do with Min-ho today?

455
00:23:08,702 --> 00:23:10,038
We went on a cable car,

456
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:11,358
we saw alpacas,

457
00:23:11,382 --> 00:23:13,202
and we made bubbles.

458
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:16,158
Mom, we had so much fun today.

459
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:17,158
Really?

460
00:23:17,182 --> 00:23:19,198
Did you get close to Min-ho?

461
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:20,518
It's not that we got close.

462
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:22,317
We had always been close.

463
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:24,602
But I'm closer to Tae-rin.

464
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:26,322
Why?

465
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,478
Why are you closer to Tae-rin?

466
00:23:28,502 --> 00:23:30,918
You should stay closer to Min-ho.

467
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,638
Min-ho and I are close,

468
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,518
but I'm closer to Tae-rin.

469
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:36,998
Yes, I know.

470
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,558
But what I'm saying is,

471
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:41,317
you should get way closer to Min-ho.

472
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:44,878
Why do you only talk about Min-ho?

473
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:46,802
Okay. Then...

474
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:50,042
stay close to Tae-rin at school,

475
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:52,358
and only hang out with
Min-ho at Big Parker.

476
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:55,038
You must stay closer to Min-ho, okay?

477
00:23:55,062 --> 00:23:57,362
How can you say that to your child?

478
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:59,118
I'm leaving.

479
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:01,038
- Now? - Oh, Mother.

480
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:02,718
- You should sleep over. - Yes.
- You have to come back again tomorrow. - Yes.

481
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:02,998
- You have to come back again tomorrow.
- Yes.

482
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:04,518
You should sleep over.

483
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:06,442
Why sleep here when I have my own house?

484
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:08,438
Okay.

485
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:10,358
Call me when you get home.

486
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,438
Bye, Jinny. See you tomorrow.

487
00:24:12,462 --> 00:24:13,998
Bye.

488
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:16,242
Bye. Thank you.

489
00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:18,718
Seo-yoon, what's my English name?

490
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:20,358
Call me by my English name.

491
00:24:20,382 --> 00:24:21,438
- You? - Yes.

492
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:24,158
Ask Mom.

493
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,638
- Honey, what's my English name? - Yes?

494
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:28,122
Is it Leonardo DiCaprio?

495
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:31,318
I can't wait. What is it? Tell me.

496
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:32,358
Shush.

497
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:34,398
Jim. She said it was Jim.

498
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:35,358
Jim?

499
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:37,398
- Jim? I like it. - Yes.

500
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:38,962
Isn't that cool?

501
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:42,798
That means you're a burden.

502
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:45,118
- Oh, a burden? - Jim.

503
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:46,798
- Jim. - Let the burden show you...

504
00:24:46,822 --> 00:24:49,118
what it can do.

505
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:51,994
(Hanguk University Hospital)

506
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:26,086
(Santa)

507
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,936
(Ms. Yoon, I miss you and I love you.)

508
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,410
(Ms. Yoon Ji-a, the world's prettiest...)

509
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:57,118
When did they prepare this?

510
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:58,598
(Ms. Yoon, I miss you and I love you.)

511
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:01,202
(Ms. Yoon Ji-a)

512
00:26:06,502 --> 00:26:07,962
<i>Ms. Yoon.</i>

513
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:10,962
<i>Su-chan drew a rainbow
for the first time today.</i>

514
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,402
<i>Su-chan's improving.</i>

515
00:26:13,462 --> 00:26:15,282
<i>It's all thanks to you.</i>

516
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,322
<i>I hope you return.</i>

517
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:32,162
<i>Ms. Yoon.</i>

518
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,522
<i>I saw a rainbow today.</i>

519
00:26:35,742 --> 00:26:38,722
<i>I wanted to see it with you.</i>

520
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:42,602
<i>I was sad that you weren't here.</i>

521
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,442
<i>Let's see it together next time.</i>

522
00:26:48,022 --> 00:26:51,242
<i>I miss you, Ms. Yoon.</i>

523
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:02,602
Mom.

524
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:06,602
How is she? Is it bad?

525
00:27:08,382 --> 00:27:09,682
No.

526
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,562
I only fell, and this is what happened.

527
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:13,798
I'm sorry, Father.

528
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:15,802
Mom, are you okay?

529
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:17,362
It's not a big deal.

530
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,798
When you go to Myeongseong,

531
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:20,558
you have to do even better.

532
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:22,562
Starting with the upcoming speech contest.

533
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,482
Okay.

534
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:25,918
I heard you went to see Professor Hwang...

535
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:27,762
with Min-ho today.

536
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:29,162
What?

537
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:30,762
Yes.

538
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:33,042
Yes.

539
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:36,798
He praised...

540
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,522
how smart Min-ho was.

541
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:42,038
What now?

542
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:43,278
I'm in this condition.

543
00:27:43,302 --> 00:27:45,802
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

544
00:27:45,942 --> 00:27:49,762
Actually, I heard all
about driving kids today.

545
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:52,362
From Professor Hwang?

546
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:56,522
No, well...

547
00:27:57,822 --> 00:28:00,362
Oh, yes. Professor Hwang's...

548
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:02,678
daughter-in-law.

549
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:04,482
She told me.

550
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:08,082
Isn't Professor Hwang's daughter-in-law...

551
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:10,078
in the USA?

552
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:11,358
Right.

553
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:13,962
I heard she lives in San Jose.

554
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:16,762
Oh, yes.

555
00:28:17,982 --> 00:28:20,842
But it's the vacation season.

556
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:23,558
So she was...

557
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:26,198
Which sanctions the use of force,

558
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:27,958
or threat of force,

559
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:30,278
against the sovereignty...

560
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:33,082
and independence of other states.

561
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:36,758
What do you think, Mom?

562
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:40,802
I practiced it more than 100
times today with Grandpa.

563
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:43,278
- Thank you so much, Father. - Yes.

564
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:46,042
Practice makes it better.

565
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:48,798
Anyway, don't worry about driving him...

566
00:28:48,822 --> 00:28:50,482
and take care of yourself.

567
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:51,798
Bye now.

568
00:28:51,822 --> 00:28:53,558
Goodnight.

569
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:55,882
See you tomorrow, Grandpa.

570
00:28:56,582 --> 00:28:57,962
Bye.

571
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:14,859
(Sophisticated surgery
with cutting-edge technology)

572
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:16,121
What?

573
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:33,402
- Do you need help? - My goodness.

574
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:37,842
What are you doing here?

575
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:42,522
Have you been chasing me?

576
00:29:43,822 --> 00:29:45,638
I got a call that Min-ho's mom was hurt,

577
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:47,162
so I was stopping by.

578
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:48,922
Min-ho's mom?

579
00:29:49,062 --> 00:29:50,398
Is it bad?

580
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,798
Luckily, it's not serious.

581
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:54,122
By the way,

582
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:56,882
what brings you here at this hour?

583
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,776
(I wanted to see it with you.)

584
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,097
(I was sad that you weren't here.)

585
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:07,762
I worked here as an art therapist.

586
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,122
Today is my last day.

587
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:12,442
I stopped by to take my things.

588
00:30:13,902 --> 00:30:15,238
Now that I don't work here anymore,

589
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:16,918
I'm going to dedicate my time...

590
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,602
to driving around my granddaughter.

591
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:24,682
Why are you looking at me like that?

592
00:30:30,422 --> 00:30:33,482
Thank you for your work, Ms. Yoon Ji-a.

593
00:30:40,262 --> 00:30:43,642
Had I known in advance, I
would've brought you flowers.

594
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:47,802
It's a shame we only got
to know each other today.

595
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:50,282
Right?

596
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:54,118
Why don't I dedicate my time...

597
00:30:54,142 --> 00:30:55,762
to driving around my grandson too?

598
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:58,758
- Please give it to me. I can carry it.
- No.

599
00:30:58,782 --> 00:31:01,082
Please just tell me
which way you're going...

600
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:03,082
because that's where I'm going too.

601
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:06,602
You don't know which way I'm going.

602
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:10,442
It doesn't matter. That's where I'll go.

603
00:31:13,302 --> 00:31:16,282
I'll follow you carefully,
so I don't lose you.

604
00:31:22,262 --> 00:31:23,562
Wait.

605
00:31:29,902 --> 00:31:31,202
Father?

606
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:37,442
And who is that?

607
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:44,467
What do you think? Perfect, right?

608
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:47,627
You look so cool.

609
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:49,467
You're the best.

610
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:52,427
You know that I always do
my best at everything.

611
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,627
How would I have survived without you?

612
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:57,863
Actually, work has been
super stressful lately.

613
00:31:57,887 --> 00:31:59,263
Go to work now. You might be late.

614
00:31:59,287 --> 00:32:00,783
What time is it? I'm leaving.

615
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:03,063
- Be careful when you drive.
- Okay. Bye, Seo-yoon.

616
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,387
My goodness.

617
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:05,827
Jinny.

618
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:07,787
This is Mom.

619
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,347
Hey! How will she get into her office then?

620
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:12,787
Jung-eun!

621
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:15,583
I'll buy you a meal.

622
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:17,023
("Let the Natural
ComponentsSpeak for Themselves")

623
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:18,347
Yes.

624
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,347
You've met with the CEO of TR?

625
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:24,587
Yes. Give me the CEO's phone number.

626
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:30,827
Not the CEO. The CEO's secretary?

627
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:34,263
But still. If you saw the CEO from afar,

628
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,143
you must know how the CEO looks.

629
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,547
Just tell me...

630
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,747
- A woman? - A woman?

631
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:43,187
What else?

632
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,343
In her mid or late 30s?

633
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:49,983
(Woman, mid to late 30s)

634
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:51,427
What about her looks?

635
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:54,663
She's tall? I see.

636
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:55,743
(Tall)

637
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,743
What? A woman in her mid to late 30s.

638
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,827
And if she's tall at that too,

639
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:02,943
she's you.

640
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,267
Darn it.

641
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,987
- That's not enough to go on with. - Okay.

642
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,827
Thank you.

643
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,547
My goodness.

644
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:15,463
But we did learn something new.

645
00:33:15,487 --> 00:33:16,623
That the CEO isn't a man.

646
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:19,343
I actually figured that out earlier.

647
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:20,667
Hold on.

648
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:23,387
Lee Jung-eun.

649
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,907
You got a hunch, didn't you?

650
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:27,787
Tell me. What is it?

651
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:29,507
Aloe.

652
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,987
- Aloe? - Look.

653
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,427
The aloe Vera leaf juice.

654
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,627
This one also contains
aloe Vera leaf juice.

655
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:39,983
- What about that? - Most products use...

656
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:42,023
aloe veraextract...

657
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:43,303
because it's easier to store...

658
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:44,663
compared to the aloe Vera leaf juice.

659
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:46,863
And it can safely maintain the
effect of the extract.

660
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,187
But...

661
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,783
the fact that the aloe
Vera leaf juice is used...

662
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:53,386
She will need a lot more aloe.

663
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:56,547
Right. The products are
targeting kids and infants.

664
00:33:56,687 --> 00:34:00,067
And the CEO of TR is known to be picky.

665
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:04,943
I'm sure she'll
personally oversee the process...

666
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,547
of procuringthe raw ingredients.

667
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:11,183
Then we can just go
and search the aloe farms.

668
00:34:11,207 --> 00:34:12,507
Min-hee.

669
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:14,463
Search related posts about TR...

670
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:15,663
and aloe Vera leaf juice.

671
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,866
- Could you look through them?
- Yes, ma'am.

672
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:21,987
I knew you could do it.

673
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:25,507
Then what shouldl do?

674
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:27,987
Well, actually...

675
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,743
Okay. What is it?

676
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,467
Just tell me what it is. Go on.

677
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:36,507
You still live in Gongnam-dong, right?

678
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:41,147
Do you think we can declare
our residence under you?

679
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:45,387
Did you not get into
Myeongseong Elementary?

680
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:49,667
Yes or no?

681
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,743
There's no way I'd let you do that.

682
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:52,783
Darn it.

683
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:54,903
Come on. You could get us in big trouble.

684
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,627
If this goes south, you
could be convicted. Got it?

685
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:58,863
You could serve up to
three years in prison...

686
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:01,067
- or be fined up to 30,000,000 won.
- Whatever.

687
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:02,787
Don't even think about it.

688
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,267
Good grief.

689
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:07,987
Come on. That petty guy.

690
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:10,863
You just wait until we
get something concrete.

691
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:12,467
Hold on.

692
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:15,346
- I don't think that's it.
- Darn it. That's not it.

693
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:16,827
What's this?

694
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:19,027
What is it?

695
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,667
Look over here.

696
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:25,380
(Sun Aloe)

697
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:26,866
This logo...

698
00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:29,547
Right here. Check this out.

699
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:32,507
What is it?

700
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:33,582
(Woman, mid to late 30s, tall)

701
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:36,987
She does fit the description.

702
00:35:37,086 --> 00:35:38,627
Where is this place, Min-hee?

703
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:40,667
(Sun Aloe)

704
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:42,263
Keep scrolling.

705
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:43,743
- Get the phone number. Right here. - Gosh.

706
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,827
There it is. Bingo. We found it.

707
00:35:46,566 --> 00:35:47,623
My gosh.

708
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,343
Zero, zero, four...

709
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:51,346
Zero, zero, four, five, two, two, six...

710
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:52,827
Three...

711
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:54,386
Yes?

712
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:57,067
Hello?

713
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:02,987
"The person you have called
cannot answer the phone."

714
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,867
- Where is this place? - Darn it.

715
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:10,823
My goodness. You now look properly ready...

716
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:13,307
to drive around your granddaughter.

717
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:15,263
Didn't I tell you?

718
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,627
Having good gear to raise
and drive children is key.

719
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:26,067
That's it.

720
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,663
Just as expected. You
guys are learning quickly...

721
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,227
as you're both well-educated.

722
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:33,022
How's your daughter-in-law?

723
00:36:33,046 --> 00:36:34,903
She can see her doctor as an outpatient now.

724
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:37,022
Your daughter-in-law? As in Tommy's mother?

725
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:39,542
Yes, she hurt her ankle yesterday.

726
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:40,866
Is that so?

727
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:44,343
We all said goodbye at
the same time yesterday.

728
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:45,907
How did you know about that?

729
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:48,147
That's strange.

730
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:53,987
Mi-chun. Well, last night...

731
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,907
Why are you so flustered?
That's understandable.

732
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:04,143
My gosh. Where's my head at?

733
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:07,583
I must pay the tuition today. I forgot.

734
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:10,107
Oh, my. Time just flies by.

735
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:12,627
A month has gone by already.

736

Yes. It's the bell tower at ChapelHill.

on my way home last night.

740
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,542
I wanted to give you
something better than flowers.

741
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:44,187
So I gave it some thought.

742
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:47,067
I rememberedl had taken
a picture of the tower before.

743
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,427
I hope you like it.

Mind your business. Just keep walking.

752
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:27,143
You were secretly
peeking at something like a rat.

753
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,663
So I wondered if it
was anything interesting.

754
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:32,346
I wasn't peeking at anything. A rat?

755
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:35,707
It was just an expression. Bye then.

756
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:39,067
Good grief.

757
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:43,223

that Claire's grandmother is flirting...

00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,187
The next participant is...

918
00:47:50,086 --> 00:47:52,027
My gosh. She's pulling in.

919
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:55,827
- Is this her car? - Yes.

920
00:48:03,927 --> 00:48:04,983
Hello.

921
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,143
I'm Senior Manager Lee Jung-eun of Aaes.

922
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,067
You are the CEO of TR, aren't you?

923
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:10,427
TR?

924
00:48:11,127 --> 00:48:13,507
The name of my company is
called Beautiful Face.

925
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:14,987
Beautiful Face?

926
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:16,183
Not TR?

927
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:17,507
No.

928
00:48:19,527 --> 00:48:20,947
I'm sorry.

929
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:24,587
Please go inside.

930
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,707
Well, is this...

931
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:32,987
about the cosmetic brand for children?

932
00:48:33,046 --> 00:48:35,423
Yes. That's the one.

933
00:48:35,447 --> 00:48:38,343
My gosh, you should have told me then.

934
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:40,583
The CEO of that brand came by yesterday.

935
00:48:40,607 --> 00:48:41,907
What?

936
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:44,747
Sir, why are you only telling us that?

937
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:47,027
Then...

938
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:48,783
when will she come back?

939
00:48:48,807 --> 00:48:50,907
I wouldn't know.

940
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:53,583
Then can you give me her phone number?

941
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:54,983
Gosh, no.

942
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:56,903
What if I lose a client?

943
00:48:56,927 --> 00:49:00,383
Besides, I don't have
the CEO's phone number.

944
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:01,583
When she needs to come by,

945
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:03,542
her secretary or whoever that is...

946
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,022
gives me a call instead.

947
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:06,983
The CEO doesn't personally call me.

948
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:10,223
Then the next time you
get a call about her visit,

949
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:13,303
could you please call us too?

950
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:15,467
- Please. - Fine.

951
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:17,787
My gosh.

952
00:49:18,327 --> 00:49:19,423
Hey, let's go back for now.

953
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:20,663
Let's come back. We must hurry.

954
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:21,983
- Yes. Seo-yoon must be waiting.- Yes.

955
00:49:22,007 --> 00:49:23,503
Let's go back.

956
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,143

00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:27,467

must truly be our own.

962
00:49:52,567 --> 00:49:53,947
Thank you.

963
00:49:56,767 --> 00:49:59,987
- My gosh. She did well.
- Oh, my. She did a great job.

964
00:50:00,327 --> 00:50:02,387
I'm proud of Tae-rin.

965
00:50:02,887 --> 00:50:04,427

- All right. - You can do it.

972
00:50:25,927 --> 00:50:29,787

Hi, everyone. My name is Lee Min-ho.

977
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:49,263
In this grave hour,

978
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:53,467
perhaps the most fateful in our history,

979
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:59,427
I send to every household of my people,

980
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:06,307
which sanctions the use
of force, or threat of force,

981
00:51:06,687 --> 00:51:09,183
against the sovereignty...

982
00:51:09,207 --> 00:51:12,187
and independence of other states.

983
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:26,623
If one and all we keep
resolutely faithful to it,

984
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:29,223
- ready for whatever service...
- She's not here yet.

985
00:51:29,247 --> 00:51:32,503
I hope Mom definitely watches this.

986
00:51:32,527 --> 00:51:36,347
Then, with God's help, we shall prevail.

987
00:51:36,372 --> 00:51:37,712

988
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:41,587

Thank you, Father.

992
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,863
No, I didn't do anything.

993
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:53,103
Min-ho worked hard to practice this.

994
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:54,427

You can do it, Jung-eun!

Hi, everyone.

My name is Hong Seo-yoon.

1009
00:52:42,504 --> 00:52:46,444
The topic of my speech is "My Best Friend."

1010
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:49,240
- What did she say?
- Having a friend is so much fun.

1011

What happened?

1012
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,000
Did you change to the free topic?

1013
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:53,200
We live together.

- Why? - And sometimes...

What are you going to do?

1016

Watch how Seo-yoon
does first and talk again.

But they're best friends.

Don't you think Seo-yoon
is doing a very good job?

I also have a best friend.

- My best friend...

- is a doctor...
- She can't win an award with this.

1036
00:53:59,344 --> 00:54:03,724
But she left the hospital because of me.

I feel terrible she had
to leave her career.

1038

But it turned out for the better...

1039

We'll take a 15-minute break...

1052
00:55:04,744 --> 00:55:06,720
and announce the award winners.

1053
00:55:06,744 --> 00:55:08,044
Why?

1054
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:11,360
Why on earth did you change the script?

1055
00:55:11,384 --> 00:55:13,120
You should have asked me.

1056
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:15,044
If I had, would you have allowed it?

1057
00:55:15,464 --> 00:55:17,200
Didn't you see how Seo-yoon did it?

1058
00:55:17,224 --> 00:55:18,884
She was good.

1059
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,400
She was good.

1060
00:55:20,424 --> 00:55:22,800
But a free topic speech is scored low.

1061
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:24,240
I did my research.

1062
00:55:24,264 --> 00:55:26,600
I couldn't find anyone saying...

1063
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:28,080
a free topic speech is scored low.

1064
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:30,204
You'd know if you did your research.

1065
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:33,080
A free topic speech is rarely awarded.

1066
00:55:33,104 --> 00:55:35,804
There was only one winner two years ago.

1067
00:55:36,224 --> 00:55:38,164
Is winning an award that important?

1068
00:55:38,504 --> 00:55:39,920
It's enough if Seo-yoon speaks...

1069
00:55:39,944 --> 00:55:41,724
what she wants to speak with fun.

1070
00:55:42,744 --> 00:55:43,760
I told you.

1071
00:55:43,784 --> 00:55:46,560
She can join Class A
when she wins an award.

1072
00:55:46,584 --> 00:55:48,364
That's why she entered this contest.

1073
00:55:48,464 --> 00:55:49,844
Mom!

1074
00:55:50,464 --> 00:55:53,564
- Seo-yoon, you were great! - Seo-yoon.

1075
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:57,644
You did a wonderful job.

1076
00:55:57,864 --> 00:55:59,164
Seriously.

1077
00:55:59,464 --> 00:56:02,404
Now, we'll announce the winners.

1078
00:56:02,464 --> 00:56:04,564
First, the Excellence Award goes...

1079
00:56:05,624 --> 00:56:07,680
- to Min Tae-rin! - Goodness.

1080
00:56:07,704 --> 00:56:08,920
- What is it? - What? Me?

1081
00:56:08,944 --> 00:56:10,560
Did he call Tae-rin?

1082
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:12,480
Oh, my. Tae-rin, what's happening?

1083
00:56:12,504 --> 00:56:13,400
Goodness.

1084
00:56:13,424 --> 00:56:15,244
Oh, my goodness!

1085
00:56:15,424 --> 00:56:16,880
Go out quickly!

1086
00:56:16,904 --> 00:56:19,244
Go now. What's happening?

1087
00:56:20,384 --> 00:56:21,724

00:57:11,184 --> 00:57:12,564
Lee Min-ho?

1098
00:57:12,904 --> 00:57:14,284
Mom?

1099
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:16,884
Stay here. You don't need to go there.

1100
00:57:17,224 --> 00:57:19,404
Is Lee Min-ho here?

1101
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,484
He's here.

1102
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:23,920
Stand up, Min-ho. Let's go home.

1103
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:26,040
He won an award, though.

1104
00:57:26,064 --> 00:57:27,360
I'm sorry, Father.

1105
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:28,684
Come here.

1106
00:57:29,464 --> 00:57:30,764
Let's go.

1107
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:33,724
What's going on?

1108
00:57:33,824 --> 00:57:35,644
What's with that woman? She's strange.

1109
00:57:37,024 --> 00:57:39,724
- That's so rude. - What's the matter?

1110
00:57:42,384 --> 00:57:43,684
All right.

1111
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:46,844
Lastly, the Grand Award.

1112
00:57:47,424 --> 00:57:48,764
The Grand Award goes...

1113
00:57:49,264 --> 00:57:52,044
to Hong Seo-yoon!

1114
00:57:52,544 --> 00:57:53,760
Who? Seo-yoon?

1115
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:56,400
It's Seo-yoon.

1116
00:57:56,424 --> 00:57:57,920
- Go now. - Hurry.

1117
00:57:57,944 --> 00:57:59,160
Hurry.

1118
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,684
She's running.

1119
00:58:02,544 --> 00:58:04,164
Oh, my.

1120
00:58:06,824 --> 00:58:08,724
Mom, thank you.

1121
00:58:08,984 --> 00:58:10,800
You lost your temper only a moment ago.

1122
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:12,840
Forget what I said.

1123
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,800
Oh, my. Take her picture now.

1124
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,880
Great!

1125
00:58:15,904 --> 00:58:18,000
(Hong Seo-yoon)

1126
00:58:18,024 --> 00:58:20,164
She took first place!

1127
00:58:24,277 --> 00:58:26,800
(The 32nd Daily Times
English Speech Contest)

1128
00:58:26,824 --> 00:58:29,560
I'm sorry, Mom.

1129
00:58:29,584 --> 00:58:32,444
I'll do better next time.

1130
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:39,771
(Lee Min-ho)

1131
00:58:39,795 --> 00:58:41,364
(Grand Award)

1132
00:58:43,304 --> 00:58:44,604
Come here.

1133
00:58:51,184 --> 00:58:52,484
You're the best.

1134

(Grand Award)

1135
00:59:31,264 --> 00:59:34,872
(Mother and Mom)

1136
00:59:35,047 --> 00:59:36,947
What? A contract?

1137
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,343
<i>Gosh, if Jung-eun finds out about this,</i>

1138
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,103
<i>that will be my last day on earth.</i>

1139
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:43,667
<i>You're being late today. Aren't you coming?</i>

1140
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:45,463
<i>I heard you were selected
as an exchange professor.</i>

1141
00:59:45,487 --> 00:59:46,583
Congratulations.

1142
00:59:46,607 --> 00:59:49,463
Now, at last, she's in
Class A of Big Parker.

1143
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:52,063
Are you going to accept them in Class A?

1144
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:53,143
Have you gone mad?

1145
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:56,187
<i>You must nip a bud at an early stage.</i>

1146
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:58,783
I'm scared.

1147
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:00,503
Don't come out and lock the door.

1148
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:02,987
- Gosh, I'll just... - <i>What are you doing?</i>
