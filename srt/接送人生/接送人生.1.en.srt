00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:55,914
I turned the alarm off earlier.

Well, you seemed really tired.

00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:27,754

- Nanny! - Good morning, Seo-yoon.

33
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:32,438
Did you sleep well?

34
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,074
Nanny. Why are you here so early
today?

35
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:37,074
Your nanny came early as I have an
important matter...

36
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:38,638
to take care of.

37
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:40,954

working?

No.

39
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:45,558
Something much more important than
that.

40
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:49,194
Mommy will definitely get it for you
today.

00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:50,754

00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:32,998
If the road disappears,

189
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:35,798
I won't have to go to the academy.

190
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:39,838
You don't want to go to the academy,
do you?

191
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:43,638
Are you going to tell my mom?

192
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:45,718
No.

193
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,518
It's our secret.

194
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:52,114
Su-chan. Let's go.

195
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:53,638
It's time to go to your academy.

196
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:55,598
Ma'am.

197
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:58,318
Our class isn't over yet.

198
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:00,318
Park Su-chan.

199
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,034
- I'm starving. - What should we get?

200
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,638
Have you decided on a menu?

201
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:33,018

consumer...)

(Jae-man)

203
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:44,754
What is it?

204
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:46,194
How will we go today?

205
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:47,678
Go where?

206
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,798
Today's the memorial service.

207
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,118
I know.

208
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,114
For a working mom, weekday
memorial services

209
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:56,194
are like the trifecta of stress.

210
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,114
Exactly.

211
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:59,114
That's why Seo-yoon and I

212
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:00,713
will head over first and make jeon.

213
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:01,953
Just the jeon?

214
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:04,074
Listen. It's your family's memorial
service.

215
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,154
Got it?

216
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:07,194
Wait until I finish talking, okay?

217
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:08,914
Starting with jeon, I will prep
everything...

218
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,638
for the memorial service.

219
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:12,754
Did you have lunch?

220
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:14,398
Don't tell me you're skipping it.

221
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:18,438
I'm just staring at it.

222
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:20,714
Don't just have a quick gimbap lunch.

223
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:22,274
Eat something good. Something
healthy.

224
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:23,918
Something expensive. The most
expensive one.

225
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:25,958
Whatever.

226
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,918
See you later.

227
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,558
What? Darn it.

228
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:45,034
I can't believe myself.

229

(Aaes)

230
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:50,038
- Director Yoon. - Hey, Ms. Ha.

231
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:51,434
How about a cup of coffee?

232
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,958
Sure. Let's get some.

233
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:55,554
Thank you.

234
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:56,874
Did you see that? All that sucking up!

235
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:58,994
How can she let that sly fox fool her?

236
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:00,594
I won't ever put up with it.

237
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:01,914
She who?

238
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,518
My role model, Senior Manager Lee
Jung-eun.

239
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,998
She was a legend, making a hit of
everything she did.

240
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:11,434
But now? A senior manager for life,
working like crazy,

241
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,674
and never getting promoted.
Unbelievable, right?

242
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:16,354
Ms. Ha and Director Yoon are from
Hanguk University.

243
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,838
And Ms. Lee suffered a loss because of
it.

244
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,878
No way.

245
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:23,958
Exactly.

246
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,398
Ms. Lee...

247
00:13:31,098 --> 00:13:34,158
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

248
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:36,438
No.

249
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:38,638
Everything you said was true.

250
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:43,958
It's okay.

251
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:48,358
I should've acted all sly too.

252
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,358
"Director Yoon!"

253
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,398
Something like that?

254
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,758
It doesn't suit you. Don't do it.

255
00:13:58,018 --> 00:13:59,358
Is that so?

256
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:01,278
Oh, no. Ms. Lee.

257
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:04,118
- Your nose. - Your nose.

258
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:06,798

Okay, everyone.

262
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:24,154
Today, we'll play a game of completing
the sentences.

263
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:26,994
Rearrange all these jumbled words
here...

264
00:14:27,018 --> 00:14:29,074
to create two sentences.

265
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:30,114
- Okay? - Okay.

266
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:31,314
- Okay? - Okay.

267
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,314
- Okay. - One person...

268
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,718
from each team will run up here and
place one word.

269
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:38,158
- You ready? - Yes.

270
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:40,594

271
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:41,918
Go!

This team is now in the lead.

00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:50,794
Today, we're going to...

275
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:53,718
have a debate class on the topic of...

276
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:56,718
the necessity of zoos.

277
00:14:57,258 --> 00:15:00,198
So first, those who agree?

278
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:05,394
Let's start with Claire.

279
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:09,158
I think zoos are absolutely necessary.

280
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:10,918
Why do you think so?

281
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:14,594
That's because it allows us to observe
animals

282
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:16,194
so closely and safely.

283
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:17,558
All right.

284
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:20,558
How about those who disagree?

285
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,474
Stella.

286
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,118
Share your thoughts.

287
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:27,154
I think zoos are not necessary.

(Big Parker Pre-primary Class B)

289
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,514
That's because animals...

290
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,438
are not objects...

291
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:34,754
but precious lives.

(Today's Topic)

With each grade,

297
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:58,985
exams become a battle against time.

298
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,865
Especially with English essays,

299
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:04,385
save 30 seconds, you get into the Ivy
League.

Save 10 seconds,

301

it's SKY. You've probably heard of it
before.

To save those few seconds,

303
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,785
using cursive writing from a young age
is a must.

304
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:18,305
Since when did you have Tommy write
in cursive?

305
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:22,465
Tommy had a tutor since he was three.

say?

365
00:18:53,685 --> 00:18:56,385
Okay. You can become one.

366

But you still have to attend Hanguk

Doesn't she start school next year?

371
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:10,025
One of you two should stay at home.

372
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,381
How much longer will you let a nanny
take care of her?

373
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:14,221
Gosh, Mom.

374
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:17,261
You can't imagine how much our nanny
loves Seo-yoon.

375
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:19,465
- Right? - Good gracious.

376
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:21,221
She's still a stranger.

377
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,625
Seriously.

378
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:27,105
Where are you going?

379
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:34,985
Really. Why did the conversation end
up there?

380
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:38,025
Telling us to quit a perfectly good job?

381
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:40,141
She said one of us two.

382
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,785
Jung-eun. She's my mom. It's
obviously you...

383
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:47,420
Or maybe not.

384
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:48,825
I see.

385
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,305
I should quit then, right?

386
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,581
With what you earn, we can cover our
expenses...

387
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:54,981
and the cost for Seo-yoon's nanny...

388
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:56,661
as well as her classes?

389
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:57,985
Well...

390
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:00,585
Jung-eun, come on.

391
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:03,865
Of course your salary is vital to our life.

392
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:06,501
I can't believe my mom.

393
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,501
Next time, I'll make sure she doesn't
nag you--

394
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:10,501
Can you please just shut your mouth...

395
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,341
in front of your mother?

396
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:14,545
That's how you can help me.

397
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:17,345
To whatever she says, say that you got
it.

398
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:18,785
Got it?

399
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,145
Put Seo-yoon to bed, okay?

400
00:20:22,444 --> 00:20:23,785
I'm meeting someone.

401
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,345
At this late hour?

402
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:28,225
It's hardly for pleasure.

403
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:36,141
Where was it again?

404
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:38,221
Here it is.

405
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:39,545
There.

406
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,865
Choose one of the speeches.

407
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:49,145
Last year, So-ra...

408
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,945
This one. She won the excellence
award with that.

409
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:57,145
Ji-suk. Jeong Ji-suk.

410
00:20:57,605 --> 00:21:00,541
You know I love you, don't you?

411
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:02,385
With just your words?

412
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:05,861
- Thank you so much. - Oh, please.

413
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:09,141
I put her down for the elocution
competition,

414
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:11,420
but I don't want her to be humiliated.

415
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,665
As if that's even up for debate.

416
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:14,861
For winning any prize,

417
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:16,821
she'll automatically get into Class A.

418
00:21:16,845 --> 00:21:17,981
Since you entered her,

419
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:19,381
have her see it to the end.

420
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:20,625
Right.

421
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:22,025
By the way,

422
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:24,621
I heard Tommy was entering too.

423
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:26,705
- Yes. - What's he reciting?

424
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:28,221
"The King's Speech."

425
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,545
Unbelievable.

426
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:31,061
"The King's..."

427
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:33,621
As in the challenging speech from the
movie?

428
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:35,461
- That's the one. - Unbelievable.

429
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:37,821
Hey. He's a shoo-in for first place,

430
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:40,665
so only focus on winning any prize.

431
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:42,545
Sure.

432
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:45,345
Here's your beer.

433
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:51,381
Please enjoy.

434
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:52,701
- Thanks. - Thanks.

435
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:54,785
- Cheers. - Cheers.

436
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:11,545
Look how sweet they are.

437
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:15,465
Tell me about it.

438
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:18,785
I was once like that too.

439
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:20,145
Hey.

440
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:23,625
What can you do after motherhood?

441
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:30,585
Excuse me.

442
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:34,385
Don't you ever get married.

443
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:37,504
Stick to dating, okay?

444
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:39,781
You probably think...

445
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:42,221
marriage is all rainbows...

446
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:43,825
and butterflies.

447
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,625
It's bitter.

448
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:51,061
Only bitter.

449
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:53,744
- Hey. - It's disgustingly bitter.

450
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,461
You're drunk. That's enough.

451
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:57,981
Ms. Han, get me the pop-up store
schedule...

452
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,541
and budget by the end of this week.

453
00:22:59,565 --> 00:23:01,180
Sure. I'll meet with the partner
tomorrow...

454
00:23:01,204 --> 00:23:03,185
and have it done by this week.

455
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,461
Ms. Lee, our samples will be out
tomorrow,

456
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,301
so visit the Design Lab to check on
them.

457
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,545
Yes, sir.

458
00:23:10,444 --> 00:23:12,264
You'll both be working outside the
office tomorrow.

459
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:15,461
Be back by the 3 p.m. meeting.

460
00:23:15,485 --> 00:23:16,705
Yes, sir.

461
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:18,385
That's it for today's meeting.

462
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:21,665
What should we have for lunch?

463
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:25,825
By the looks of it, you had drinks last
night.

464
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:28,465
- How about a hangover soup? -
Sounds good.

465
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:30,465
Hangover soup?

466
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:33,061
Yangpyeong, Jeonju, or Cheongjin-
dong?

467
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:35,341
I'm good with them all.

468
00:23:35,365 --> 00:23:36,821
I drank heavily...

469
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:38,461
after the memorial service last night.

470
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:41,264
- Let's head out for now, Ms. Lee. -
Sure.

471
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:43,581
Go on. I'll catch up later.

472
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:45,345
- We'll order yours. - They're already
gone.

473
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:46,501
Unbelievable.

474
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,661
It's me.

475
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:49,101
Something urgent came up,

476
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,180
and I can't drive Seo-yoon around
today.

477
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:52,221
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:54,385
Hello? Hey.

479
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:01,465
What just happened out of the blue?

480
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:07,625
It's done.

481
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:09,264
What should I do next?

482
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:14,461
Right now? But I'm on the freeway.

483
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:16,221
Fine. I'm hanging up.

484
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:18,945
Why did the nanny suddenly cancel?

485
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,461
What's going on?

486
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:21,701
I said we should hang up.

487
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:23,145
Unbelievable.

488
00:24:42,485 --> 00:24:44,141
The receiver cannot be reached,

489
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:46,221
and you'll be transferred to voicemail.

490
00:24:46,245 --> 00:24:48,705
Of course. As if I can count on my
mom.

491
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:55,941
Ms. Hwang,

492
00:24:55,965 --> 00:24:57,945
enjoy the meal with Mr. Kim.

493
00:25:04,365 --> 00:25:06,465
Wait. Hold on!

494
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:11,305
Hey, it's Mom.

495
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:16,105
Oh, dear.

496
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:19,421
I'm sorry about this. Let's hurry.

497
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:20,741
Come on.

498
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:22,345
Bye, Seo-yoon.

499
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:25,225
Hop in.

500
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:31,825
Where is it? There.

501
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:44,465
Why is no one moving?

502
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:48,225
Mom, aren't we already late?

503
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:51,661
No, we'll arrive on time.

504
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:53,065
Don't worry.

505
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:58,025
There isn't decent parking around here
though.

506
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,585
Darn.

507
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,665
I was going to park there myself.

508
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:06,225
I'll pass for now.

509
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,105
Come on.

510
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:32,341
We have 10 minutes.

511
00:26:32,365 --> 00:26:34,301
You're to never let go.

512
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:35,901
- You got it? - Got it.

513
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:38,345
Let's go. There.

514
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:39,861
All right.

515
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:42,221
The mommy-coaster will now roll out.

516
00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:43,705
Hold on tight, Seo-yoon.

517
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:45,621
Mom, off we go.

518
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,865
Go!

519
00:26:53,205 --> 00:26:55,345
Run, Mom!

520
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:18,985
Just a second.

521
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,541
Mom, are you tired?

522
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:24,985
Gosh, no. I'm...

523
00:27:25,565 --> 00:27:27,745
I'm not tired at all.

524
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,505
Really?

525
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:31,585
Really.

526
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:36,305
It's up there, right?

527
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:39,185
Okay, off we go again.

528
00:27:39,445 --> 00:27:40,865
There we go.

529
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:43,941
Hold on tight. Off I go.

530
00:27:43,965 --> 00:27:45,185
Go!

531
00:27:50,725 --> 00:27:52,265
We're almost there.

532
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:54,065
It won't be long now.

533
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:13,901
Mom, we actually made it on time.

534
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,021
See?

535
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:17,141
There. We weren't late.

536
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:19,265
Head on inside, my daughter.

537
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:20,901
Fighting.

538
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:23,665
It's an F, not a P.

539
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:26,385
What? Oh, right.

540
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:30,065
F... Fighting with an F.

541
00:28:30,445 --> 00:28:31,745
There.

542
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:33,901
Go on in.

543
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:35,225
Mom.

544
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:38,181
I love that you drove me...

545
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:39,625
to class today.

546
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:42,265
Oh, good.

547
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:43,901
I was thrilled too.

548
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:45,545
Go on in. You don't want to be late.

549
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:48,065
- See you later. - Sure.

550
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:52,145
Would you like some water?

551
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:54,905
What? Oh, yes.

552
00:28:58,165 --> 00:28:59,705
Gosh, thank you.

The road to Class A.

557
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:24,425
Goodness.

558
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:26,625
Isn't this...

559
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:29,665
the textbook for Class A?

560
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:32,705
That's right. Class A for seven-year-
olds.

561
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:36,185
I'd like to get a copy too. Would that be
possible?

562
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:37,901
I'm sorry,

563
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:40,341
but we only have enough for those in
Class A.

564
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:43,501
Could you perhaps give me 10 minutes
with it?

565
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:45,261
I'll give it back right away.

566
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,545
Who may she be?

567
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:49,465
Tommy's Mom, hello.

568
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:52,105
Goodness!

569
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:54,625
You must be Tommy's mother.

570
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:56,221
I heard a lot about you.

571
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:58,665
Claire in Class B is my daughter.

572
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:03,461
I see you came from your work.

573
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:04,745
Sorry?

574
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:08,985
Right.

575
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:10,741
By the way,

576
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,465
Tommy will attend Myeongseong
Elementary, won't he?

577
00:30:12,605 --> 00:30:14,901
My Claire will attend that school too.

578
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:16,825
I'd love for them to be classmates.

579
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:20,985
Is this how you'll manage textbooks?

580
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:24,665
Don't you know Class A's books must
be confidential?

581
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:26,185

Yes, ma'am.

585
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:47,985
I just saw...

586
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:50,825
Tommy's mom getting in the elevator.

587
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:53,025
And?

588
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,461
Since you already got chewed out,

589
00:30:55,485 --> 00:30:57,585
can I take a peek at the Class A
textbook?

590
00:30:57,845 --> 00:30:59,101
Five minutes will do.

591
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,545
No, just a minute.

592
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:07,781
She could've bent the rules just this
once.

593
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:09,105
Unbelievable.

594
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:16,145
Yes, hello.

595
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:19,145
Can you work tomorrow?

596
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:23,145
What a relief! I'll see you tomorrow,
then.

597
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:28,665
What the...

598
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:38,265

599

My gosh.

600

A horse sleeps standing up...

601
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:06,865
so that it can be ready to run at any
time.

602
00:32:07,565 --> 00:32:09,621
Ducks sleep in a line.

603
00:32:09,645 --> 00:32:12,785
They keep one eye open...

604
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:45,945
Are you all right?

605
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:49,665
I have no idea how this day went by.

606
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:50,781
Goodness.

607
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:52,945
The day was a total wreck...

608
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:55,105
just because the nanny bailed on us.

609
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:58,025
Tell me about it. What on earth was
that?

610
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:01,345
Are you sure she'll be at work
tomorrow?

611
00:33:01,485 --> 00:33:02,945
- Right here. - Got it.

612
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:05,145
- We talked on the phone. - Right.

613
00:33:06,205 --> 00:33:07,381
- We should take this chance... - Yes?

614
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:09,065
to manage her better.

615
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:11,585
We'll give her a raise, so pitch in.

616
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:14,065
What? That's out of the blue.

617
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:16,705
By how much?

618
00:33:18,845 --> 00:33:20,665
Will 50 dollars be enough?

619
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,945
Is this pocket money for your niece?

620
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:32,945

623
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:44,061
I'm heading back to the office...

624
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:45,505
after checking the samples.

625
00:33:45,685 --> 00:33:47,425
Ms. Lee, have you had lunch?

626
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:48,945
Not yet. Why?

627
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:50,585
What do you say to pasta?

628
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:54,105
We'll have lunch as elegant working
moms today.

629
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:55,825
Count me in.

630
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:00,861
I love the mood of this place.

631
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:02,505
- Right? Aren't you glad you came? - I
am.

632
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:04,705
I thought I stepped into Italy.

633
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:07,105
I bet the food will be good.

634
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:17,025
It'll be my treat today.

635
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:18,745
Why?

636
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:21,384
Is it your birthday?

637
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:23,825
No, it's not a special day. Are you
against it?

638
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:25,585
Why would I be? I love it.

639
00:34:25,885 --> 00:34:28,025
I'll have a pricey dish.

640
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:32,305
Please enjoy.

641
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:35,785
That smells divine.

642
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:38,621
I'll enjoy, Ms. Han.

643
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:40,585

Didn't the nanny pick you up?

650

No, she didn't.

651
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:03,145
Darn, I'll be right there.

652
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:05,585

655
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:14,501
You remember the meeting, right?

656
00:35:14,525 --> 00:35:16,465
Yes, I'll be back before 3 p.m.

Ms. Lee, you need to get back right
now.

669
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:12,785
Why? I thought the meeting was at 3
p.m.

670
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,065

683
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,540
after barging in here like this?

684
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,741
I couldn't get in touch with the nanny,

685
00:36:58,765 --> 00:37:00,945
but I need to be back at the office.

686

This isn't the CSAT.

690

She'll soon be entering a competition.

692
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:13,825
Well, I can't help you.

693
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:20,065

trust in you.

Where is it?

715
00:38:13,845 --> 00:38:15,384
- Over there. - Right.

Seo-yoon, I'm sorry, but can you wait
here a moment?

719
00:38:25,645 --> 00:38:28,781
But I'll be late for class. I really
shouldn't.

721

What's going on?

730
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:55,381
Su-chan, do you recognize me?

731
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:57,705
Open your eyes. Do you know who I
am?

732
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:00,545
It's tough, isn't it?

733

Su-chan,

734
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:09,585
can you hear the rain?

735
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:11,384
- There. - What are you doing?

00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,425
Listen to the rain and open your eyes.

738
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,465
Repeat after me. Look.

739
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:24,105
Good job. Once more.

740
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:28,065
Good boy.

741
00:39:31,445 --> 00:39:33,265
Good job, Su-chan.

742
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:39,225
Doctor.

743
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:42,341
Is my Su-chan all right?

744
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:43,861
He was hyperventilating due to stress,

745
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:45,625
but he found his breathing again.

746
00:39:46,044 --> 00:39:48,065
- We'll keep an eye on him. - Thank
you.

747
00:39:48,925 --> 00:39:50,305
Thank you.

748
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,145
Su-chan.

749
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:56,425
I forgot Seo-yoon.

750
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:15,020
Hello?

751
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:17,381
Seo-yoon, where are you now?

752
00:40:17,405 --> 00:40:20,301
I took a taxi not to be late for the
academy.

753
00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:22,185
Please hurry.

754
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:24,825
Did you take a taxi alone?

755
00:40:25,765 --> 00:40:27,221
You shouldn't go alone.

756
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:29,225
You should have waited for me.

757
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:31,020
I worried about you.

758
00:40:31,044 --> 00:40:32,825
I'm sorry.

759
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:34,821
No, it's not your fault.

760
00:40:34,845 --> 00:40:35,861
I'm sorry.

761
00:40:35,885 --> 00:40:37,905
I'll take a taxi and follow you right
now.

762
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,821
Call me as soon as you arrive, okay?

763
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:42,384
Okay. Come quickly.

764
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:46,745
(Emergency Medical Center)

765
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:51,905
Big Parker Academy at Daechi-dong,
please.

766
00:41:01,564 --> 00:41:04,265
The package concept of this spring and
summer season...

767
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:07,945
should look simple and clean.

768
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:11,181
We need to differentiate from other
companies,

769
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:13,301
so you need to check out...

770
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:14,745
how other companies are doing.

771
00:41:15,245 --> 00:41:16,665
And, about this.

772
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:19,545
Have you all read this marketing
strategy proposal?

773
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:21,221
Yes.

774
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,661
I think it fully reflects...

775
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:26,025
the opinions of Gen Z,

776
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,341
but you know how boomers feel
alienated.

777
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:30,221
About consumers in their 40s and 50s,

778
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:32,221
we need to conduct more research.

779
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:33,425
For those...

780
00:41:37,605 --> 00:41:39,785
Hello? Yes.

781
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:43,585
What?

782
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:46,821
Seo-yoon hasn't come to the academy
yet?

783
00:41:46,845 --> 00:41:49,384
No, that can't happen. She surely went
with my mom...

784
00:41:51,285 --> 00:41:53,145
Excuse me. Hold on a second.

785
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:56,344
I'll call you back. Bye.

786
00:41:58,845 --> 00:42:01,035
(Mom)

787
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,701
The person you have called cannot
answer now....

788
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:16,545
Why isn't she getting the call?

789
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:21,182
(My Gem)

790
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:30,781
Your call has been forwarded...

791
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:32,941
to an automatic voice message system.

792
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:34,825
Please leave your message after the
beep.

793
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:39,985
(Nanny)

794
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,805
(Nanny has left the chat room.)

795
00:43:24,245 --> 00:43:28,625
(Mom)

796
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:41,825
Gosh, really.

797
00:43:42,925 --> 00:43:45,145
Please answer the phone!

798
00:43:48,365 --> 00:43:50,465
Jung-eun, what is it? What's wrong?

799
00:43:51,725 --> 00:43:53,344
Seo-yoon.

800
00:43:55,685 --> 00:43:57,465
Seo-yoon has disappeared.

801
00:43:58,285 --> 00:43:59,665
Seo-yoon? Why?

802
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:02,425
Ms. Lee!

803
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,145
What happened to Seo-yoon?

804
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:07,261
Calm down now.

805
00:44:07,285 --> 00:44:08,581
I reported to the police.

806
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,661
Jung-eun, get your act together.

807
00:44:09,685 --> 00:44:11,225
You might get in a traffic accident.

808
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:12,941
I traced her location,

809
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:14,465
and she seems to be in Daechi-dong
now.

810
00:44:15,685 --> 00:44:17,261
Something urgent came up,

811
00:44:17,285 --> 00:44:18,981
and I can't drive Seo-yoon around
today.

812
00:44:19,005 --> 00:44:19,941
Nanny hasn't come?

813
00:44:19,965 --> 00:44:21,261
No, she hasn't.

814
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:23,993
(Nanny has left the chat room.)

815
00:44:25,285 --> 00:44:26,585
The nanny!

816
00:44:26,885 --> 00:44:29,185
I think the nanny took her.

817
00:44:35,285 --> 00:44:36,625
Gosh.

818
00:44:36,725 --> 00:44:38,740
(Big Parker)

819
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:43,585
Yes, Ms. Lee.

820
00:44:43,925 --> 00:44:45,185
Yes.

821
00:44:45,605 --> 00:44:47,465
- Excuse me... - Seo-yoon hasn't come.

822
00:44:49,205 --> 00:44:51,901
Did you just say Seo-yoon?

823
00:44:51,925 --> 00:44:53,344
Hong Seo-yoon?

824
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:55,025
Hold on, Ms. Lee.

825
00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:56,665
Please take this call now.

826
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:01,461
Hello?

827
00:45:01,485 --> 00:45:04,065
Why aren't you answering the phone?

828
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:06,625
Seo-yoon has disappeared!

829
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:07,985
What?

830
00:45:40,285 --> 00:45:41,625
Goodness.

831
00:45:59,285 --> 00:46:00,545
Seo-yoon.

832
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:06,985
Seo-yoon.

833
00:46:12,525 --> 00:46:13,864
Seo-yoon.

834
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:25,864
Seo-yoon.

835
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:33,505
Seo-yoon.

836
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:47,225
Are you okay?

837
00:46:48,445 --> 00:46:49,785
Are you not hurt?

838
00:46:50,485 --> 00:46:51,825
Seo-yoon...

839
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:06,545
Hello.

840
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:10,225
Is this Hong Seo-yoon's parent?

841
00:47:10,805 --> 00:47:12,145
Who are you?

842
00:47:14,656 --> 00:47:16,876
Is this Hong Seo-yoon's parent?

843
00:47:17,456 --> 00:47:18,796
Who are you?

844
00:47:19,993 --> 00:47:21,609
I'm calling from Gongnam Police Patrol
Unit.

845
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:24,012
Are you not Hong Seo-yoon's parent?

846
00:47:24,073 --> 00:47:26,129
I'm Seo-yoon's mom.

847
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:27,849
How is Seo-yoon? Is she all right?

848
00:47:27,873 --> 00:47:31,052
She didn't have an accident, did she?

849
00:47:33,113 --> 00:47:34,693
Mom.

850
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:36,493
Seo-yoon!

851
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:43,061
(Police)

852
00:47:45,313 --> 00:47:46,532
Seo-yoon.

853
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:49,373
- Seo-yoon! - Mom!

854
00:47:49,473 --> 00:47:50,449
Seo-yoon!

855
00:47:50,473 --> 00:47:52,529
Where on earth have you been?

856
00:47:52,553 --> 00:47:54,728
You'll never know how much I was
worried.

857
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:56,973
Do you know how many times I called
you?

858
00:47:57,113 --> 00:47:59,449
I'm sorry, Mom.

859
00:47:59,473 --> 00:48:02,089
I was waiting for Grandma...

860
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:04,973
and took a taxi alone.

861
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:20,449
Let me get off here.

862
00:48:20,473 --> 00:48:22,333
You need to go further.

863
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:23,809
I know what's around here.

864
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,453
I've been here before with my mom.

865
00:48:25,513 --> 00:48:28,253
If I walk a bit more, it's my academy.

866
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:41,052
Where am I?

867
00:48:47,073 --> 00:48:48,453
Mom...

868
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,653
Excuse me, kid.

869
00:49:01,712 --> 00:49:03,052
Here you go.

870
00:49:05,313 --> 00:49:07,449
Because your daughter dropped her
phone,

871
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:09,453
the battery got disconnected.

872
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:10,769
I guess she thought it went out of
order...

873
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:11,809
Hong Seo-yoon!

874
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,009
I did it not to get late.

875
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:16,089
How can you take a taxi alone to go
there?

876
00:49:16,113 --> 00:49:20,333
You don't want me to be late for the
academy.

877
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:22,529
So I tried to go even if I was alone.

878
00:49:22,553 --> 00:49:23,893
My goodness.

879
00:49:27,273 --> 00:49:28,693
Seo-yoon!

880
00:49:32,993 --> 00:49:34,613
Seo-yoon, are you all right?

881
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,289
You say like you were worried.

882
00:49:37,313 --> 00:49:39,489
How come you let her stay on the
street alone?

883
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:40,689
I'm sorry, Jung-eun.

884
00:49:40,713 --> 00:49:42,489
It was an emergency.

885
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:43,569
Was it?

886
00:49:43,593 --> 00:49:45,089
What kind of emergency...

887
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:46,689
makes you desert your granddaughter
on the street?

888
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:48,133
Desert her on the street?

889
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:50,089
That's an exaggeration.

890
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,529
I asked you, and how come you let this
happen?

891
00:49:52,553 --> 00:49:53,929
I'm your daughter.

892
00:49:53,953 --> 00:49:55,009
No.

893
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,969
You neglected me taking care of other
people's kids.

894
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:59,369
What are you saying?

895
00:49:59,393 --> 00:50:01,733
Although you neglected me,

896
00:50:02,193 --> 00:50:05,293
you shouldn't have done that to Seo-
yoon!

897
00:50:05,473 --> 00:50:06,773
What?

898
00:50:07,473 --> 00:50:09,289
Don't cry. We're not fighting.

899
00:50:09,313 --> 00:50:10,573
Let her go.

900
00:50:10,873 --> 00:50:12,049
Lee Jung-eun!

901
00:50:12,073 --> 00:50:15,133
Now I won't leave Seo-yoon with other
people.

902
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,773
Other people?

903
00:50:17,353 --> 00:50:18,853
I will quit my job.

904
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:21,733
Quit your job? Because of your kid's
academy?

905
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:24,293
To imagine...

906
00:50:26,953 --> 00:50:29,533
how scared Seo-yoon must have felt
alone...

907
00:50:33,153 --> 00:50:34,533
I won't let her stay alone.

908
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:36,893
I will take care of her.

909
00:50:41,233 --> 00:50:43,533
- I'll take care of Seo-yoon. - No,
thanks.

910
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:45,053
No, thanks?

911
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:48,133
Don't be stubborn, and do as I say.

912
00:50:49,673 --> 00:50:51,693
I will give Seo-yoon a ride to the
academy.

913
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:54,093
Seo-yoon won't take a taxi alone
anymore.

914
00:50:54,753 --> 00:50:57,133
I will take a half day off and give her a
ride.

915
00:50:58,313 --> 00:51:00,889
So, either bring that crazy nanny
back...

916
00:51:00,913 --> 00:51:02,293
or get a new one.

917
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:08,493
All right?

918
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:13,653
Seo-yoon! Oh, hello.

919
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:17,453
Mother? Honey.

920
00:51:18,353 --> 00:51:19,613
Goodness.

921
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:34,917
(My Gem)

922
00:51:44,753 --> 00:51:46,733
Jung-eun, aren't you going to bed?

923
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:54,613
I'm sure what happened today shocked
Mother.

924
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,493
You can go to bed.

925
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:01,613
- Jung-eun. - Go to bed.

926
00:52:22,353 --> 00:52:24,293
I must be crazy.

927
00:52:28,873 --> 00:52:30,809
(Mom)

928
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:31,810
(Thank you.)

929
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:37,573
Mom, are you sleeping?

930
00:52:38,473 --> 00:52:40,213
Today, I made a mistake.

931
00:52:50,713 --> 00:52:52,413
I was too shocked.

932
00:53:00,713 --> 00:53:02,215
I'm sorry that I got angry at you.

933
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:04,672
(I'm sorry that I got angry at you.)

934
00:53:07,438 --> 00:53:09,578
(I'm sorry.)

935
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:26,133
Although you neglected me,

936
00:53:26,673 --> 00:53:29,733
you shouldn't have done that to Seo-
yoon!

937
00:53:34,163 --> 00:53:36,023
A mom doesn't know everything.

938
00:53:47,566 --> 00:53:49,502
Pick her up at 12:55 p.m.

939
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,502
Arrive at Big Parker by 1:55 p.m.

940
00:53:51,526 --> 00:53:52,826
You shouldn't be late.

941
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:55,666
What? Is this all?

942
00:53:57,486 --> 00:53:58,906
What a brat.

943
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:14,826
That won't happen.

944
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:19,826
What? Taking her to the academy?

945
00:54:21,086 --> 00:54:22,466
Come on.

946
00:54:22,606 --> 00:54:24,222
How could you ask her to do that?

947
00:54:24,246 --> 00:54:26,942
My goodness. I can't believe this.

948
00:54:26,966 --> 00:54:28,262
It's not easy for you, young people.

949
00:54:28,286 --> 00:54:29,342
What if your mother-in-law gets
exhausted?

950
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,862
What are you going to do then?

951
00:54:30,886 --> 00:54:32,586
What option do I have?

952
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:34,266
What option do you have? You punk.

953
00:54:52,006 --> 00:54:54,066
What shall we do now?

954
00:54:54,526 --> 00:54:56,026
We're moving.

955
00:54:57,326 --> 00:54:59,226
I want to move further.

956
00:55:00,206 --> 00:55:02,342
I will get off here.

957
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:04,462
I can get off here and run to the
academy.

958
00:55:04,486 --> 00:55:05,826
Here?

959
00:55:06,486 --> 00:55:08,146
Do you think you can do that?

960
00:55:13,006 --> 00:55:15,746
You're sure you can get off here?

961
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:17,622
What if you get lost again?

962
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:19,386
Do you see my academy ahead?

963
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:20,902
Calvin's grandma goes to the parking
lot

964
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:22,626
...in the department store.

965
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,582
You can go there too.

966
00:55:24,606 --> 00:55:26,626
I'll go in and wait.

967
00:55:26,806 --> 00:55:28,106
Seo-yoon.

968
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:32,142
Don't tell your mom that you got off on
the street...

969
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:33,902
I won't. Don't worry.

970
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:36,422
You dropped me off in front of the
academy. Right?

971
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:37,746
See you.

972
00:55:38,926 --> 00:55:40,946
Be careful.

973
00:55:41,206 --> 00:55:43,222
Be careful, Seo-yoon. Here you go.

974
00:55:43,246 --> 00:55:44,946
This is too heavy for you.

975
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,746
It's... Seo-yoon!

976
00:55:49,966 --> 00:55:54,546
My goodness. I get it. I'm moving.

977
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,266
It's farther than I thought.

978
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:04,306
How much do I have to hurry?

979
00:56:12,606 --> 00:56:13,946
Who's that?

980
00:56:14,286 --> 00:56:15,866
I've never seen her before.

981
00:56:16,726 --> 00:56:19,062
Why is she sitting there?

982
00:56:19,086 --> 00:56:20,102
- It's a seat for Class A.  - If the traffic

983
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,182
is the same on the way back,

984
00:56:21,206 --> 00:56:24,182
I'd rather leave my car on the street.

985
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:25,986
Only moms are allowed here.

986
00:56:40,886 --> 00:56:42,862
She looks like a grandmother.

987
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:44,226
A grandmother?

988
00:56:46,206 --> 00:56:48,786
I guess she has no idea.

989
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,066
Why are they so interested in me?

990
00:57:19,801 --> 00:57:21,741
She must be crazy.

991
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:27,981
Mom, it's me. Are you still in there?

992
00:57:33,001 --> 00:57:34,621
I'm in front of the academy now.

993
00:57:34,841 --> 00:57:36,857
Don't let Seo-yoon come out in the
middle.

994
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:39,501
You stand in front of her classroom.

995
00:57:39,921 --> 00:57:42,741
What would I do? I'll kill that woman.

996
00:57:55,921 --> 00:57:58,501
- Ms. Lee. - Are you out of your mind?

997
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:00,537
You disappeared without giving me
one phone call.

998
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,501
How shameless are you to come here
like this?

999
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:06,661
You should have received the call from
the kid.

1000
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:09,021
Why should I?

1001
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:12,381
Why?

1002
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,021
Why?

1003
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:17,977
I might have lost Seo-yoon, because of
you.

1004
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:20,017
What if she was not found?

1005
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,937
Why are you saying that to me?

1006
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:24,181
You're her mom. You're responsible for
what happened.

1007
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:25,581
What?

1008
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:27,617
I can't stand it anymore...

1009
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:28,901
Oh, my!

1010
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,741
- Mom! - Are you crazy?

1011
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:35,257
Why did you hit me?

1012
00:58:35,281 --> 00:58:37,297
You should be apologizing for what you
did.

1013
00:58:37,321 --> 00:58:38,581
How dare you say so?

1014
00:58:39,001 --> 00:58:41,181
How do you feel getting hit in the
back?

1015
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:43,897
You should feel what we felt. That's
poetic justice.

1016
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:45,141
Don't you think?

1017
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:47,661
Darn it.

1018
00:58:55,121 --> 00:58:56,601
(We'd like to thank Son Jong-hak and
Miram...)

1019
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:57,641
(for their special appearance.)

1020
00:59:28,374 --> 00:59:32,041
(Mother and Mom)

1021
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:34,897
Ju-hee, right?

1022
00:59:34,921 --> 00:59:37,381
You got the wrong person.

1023
00:59:37,681 --> 00:59:38,657
Jinny!

1024
00:59:38,681 --> 00:59:40,337
Your daughter intentionally made
you...

1025
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:41,257
sit your granddaughter.

1026
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:43,257
You should keep doing this.

1027
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:45,017
That's why I decided to do it.

1028
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,817
May I help you?

1029
00:59:46,841 --> 00:59:48,577
Taking Min-ho to and from the
academy.

1030
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:49,937
Are you sure, Father?

1031
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,737
Who are you?

1032
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:53,541
Are you a bad guy?

1033
00:59:53,681 --> 00:59:55,341
You must be very happy.

1034
00:59:55,441 --> 00:59:58,097
You'll help her with the speech
competition?

1035
00:59:58,121 --> 00:59:59,861
Let's win first place.
