ICT and Korea Communications Agency)

(All places, organizations, characters,
incidents, )

4
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:12,430
(and backstories in this drama are
fictitious.)

5
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:13,710
(Child actors were
accompanied by family...)

6
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:14,850
(and were kept safe.)

7
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:16,488
Min-hee.

8
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:17,943
Is Ms. Han out for work?

9
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,822
No, Deputy Director Ha wanted to see her.

10
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:21,546
So she went to the rooftop terrace.

11
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:25,867
Is that how the marketing team does their
job?

12
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:28,463
Who taught you to work like that?

13
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,183
Who else?

14
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:32,103
It was me. What are you going to do about
that?

15
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:33,183
Ms. Lee.

16
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:35,343
File the work officially with respect.

17
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:36,583
Then I'll get it done for you.

18
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:38,463
So stop harassing Ms. Han, got it?

19
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:40,307
Have you lost your mind?

20
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:43,547
What are they doing?

21
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:45,627
My goodness.

22
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:47,983
- Calm down. - Get out of my way.

23
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,423
It's okay. Let her go, Ms. Han.

24
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:50,743
Let's see what she does.

25
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,503
Lee Jung-eun.

26
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:53,943
You just made a big mistake.

27
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:55,503
Mistake my foot.

28
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:56,823
Who's the one who made a mistake?

29
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:59,507
We'll see about that.

30
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:05,907
Is she okay?

31
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:09,587
What was that about?

32
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:11,343
What just happened?

33
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,827
Fighting at work?

34
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,507
- That's ridiculous. - Unbelievable.

35
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:19,947
Are you okay, Ms. Lee?

36
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:22,627
Me?

37
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:27,107
What have I done?

38
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:29,947
Gosh.

39
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,267
So annoying.

40
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:37,907
Lee Jung-eun.

41
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:40,147
So that's how you want to play?

42
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,867
I won't forgive you.

43
00:01:47,738 --> 00:01:48,783
(Episode 3)

44
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,063
Be careful.

45
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:52,863
Can we go for ice cream with Min-ho?

46
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:54,986
Ice cream? Shall we?

47
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:57,423
Min-ho, do you want to come?

48
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:01,063
- Oh, my mom is... - Hey.

49
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,983
I will give your mom a call.

50
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,943
Let's get ice cream with them.

51
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:07,387
Really? Are you sure, Grandpa?

52
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:09,507
Let's go. I want to go with you.

53
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:13,307
May we join you?

54
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,143
Sure.

55
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,467
Let's go.

56
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:26,903
Why are you laughing?

57
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,463
Do I have something on my face?

58
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,907
I'm Elsa, and Jinny is Anna.

59
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:34,587
Are you Kristoff?

60
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,267
Who's that?

61
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:40,543
Anna's boyfriend.

62
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,107
Boyfriend?

63
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:45,463
No. Never.

64
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:47,467
I'm not her boyfriend.

65
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:50,227
You don't have to deny it that much.

66
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,187
I mean,

67
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:56,303
not yet.

68
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:57,867
Not yet?

69
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,743
We're just friends.

70
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,423
Like how you two are friends.

71
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:09,987
I see. Like me and him?

72
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,823
Grandpa, your hand.

73
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:14,147
What?

74
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,623
Today is your first day.

75
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:25,067
Try to be friends.

76
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,307
Grandpa.

77
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:36,827
Yes?

78
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:39,263
Since when did the word friends...

79
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:42,787
feel so sad?

80
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,787
Why is that sad?

81
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:46,947
Min-ho.

82
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:51,467
Everything starts as a friend.

83
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:53,947
What?

84
00:03:57,647 --> 00:04:00,067
Grandpa.

85
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:02,023
Yes?
Can you come pick me up tomorrow again?

86
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,787
Can you come pick me up tomorrow again?

87
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,507
Tomorrow again?

88
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:08,743
Yes.

89
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:12,427
I love it when you come to pick me up.

90
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,867
Did you have fun today?

91
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:16,223
So much.

92
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:18,783
So come pick me up again tomorrow.

93
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:21,427
Sure. I will.

94
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:30,547
Your hand.

95
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:33,067
But...

96
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:36,867
Boyfriend?

97
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:39,267
Not yet.

98
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:48,387
Am I losing my mind?

99
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:51,787
- What? - What? What was that?

100
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,503
You just said something.

101
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:58,507
No. I didn't say anything.

102
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,587
Seo-yoon, remember that song?

103
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:07,063
<i>Chiring chiring chiriring</i>

104
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:08,302
"The Star of Jewel?"

105
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,943
Yes, "The Star of Jewel."

106
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,023
Do you want to listen to that?

107
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,227
- Yes. Sounds good. - Okay.

108
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,027
<i>- Chiring chiring chiriring
- Chiring chiring chiriring</i>

109
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:22,023
<i>- Chiring chiring chiriring
- Chiring chiring chiriring</i>

110
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,863
<i>- The star of jewel - The star of jewel</i>

111
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:27,302
<i>Chant a spell with the magical song</i>

112
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,787
<i>Child abuse?</i>

113
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:30,827
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

114
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,223
How dare an art therapist...

115
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:34,823
act up?

116
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,739
(Hanguk University Hospital Pediatric)

117
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:38,783
I'm posting this...

118
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:40,427
on the hospital bulletin board.

119
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:45,427
We're home.

120
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,347
Father.

121
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,463
Thank you for everything today.

122
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:50,943
You're welcome.

123
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,667
I had a good time.

124
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:57,867
Oh, right.

125
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,223
I was thinking about...

126
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:03,067
giving Min-ho a ride tomorrow too.

127
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:04,907
Tomorrow?

128
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:06,223
No.

129
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,823
He has to get ready for his English speech.

130
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,307
I'll give him a ride.

131
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,587
Drive safe. Goodnight.

132
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,427
Oh, is that so?

133
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:19,147
Lee Min-ho, say goodbye to Grandpa.

134
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:22,107
Goodbye.

135
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,547
Okay, Min-ho.

136
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:26,707
Goodnight.

137
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:28,867
I'll see you later.

138
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,543
- Bye. - Bye.

139
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:32,867
Bye.

140
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:44,587
Lee Min-ho.

141
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:48,307
What are you hiding?

142
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,227
Show me.

143
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:57,507
Who did this to you?

144
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:59,427
What is all this?

145
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:01,983
Who did this?

146
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:03,383
Mom.

147
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:06,143
Lee Min-ho, get changed...

148
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,267
and review what you learned today.

149
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,747
Hurry.

150
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:33,743
Min-ho.

151
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,987
<i>Grandpa, you're a liar.</i>

152
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:40,343
Min-ho, I was...

153
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,747
Liar.

154
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:45,827
I can't draw a dinosaur anymore.

155
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:58,714
(Min-ho's Mom)

156
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:04,743

00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:05,863
Pinkru.

158
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,027
Oh, that was fast.

159
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:12,787
"What do I do when I'm happy?"

160
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,663
Well...

161
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:16,702
Three, two...

162
00:08:16,726 --> 00:08:17,983
Looking at your pictures.

163
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:20,187
- Really? - Of course.

164
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,507
"What's my favorite?"

165
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,023
Just one?

166
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,467
Three,

167
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,427
- two... - Mom.

168
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:32,463
What? What about Dad?

169
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:35,107
You said I could pick only one.

170
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,663
Let's say I lost.

171
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:40,587
It's still a game.

172
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:42,063
I won.

173
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,903
Yes, I'll grant your wish.

174
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:46,227
Well, my wish is...

175
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:49,582
for you to join the speech contest...

176
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:51,267
with your favorite story.

177
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:55,223
Can you make a different wish?

178
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:56,547
What?

179
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,383
You agreed to change the script...

180
00:08:58,407 --> 00:08:59,787
to something interesting.

181
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,427
BFF's pinky swear, have you forgotten?

182
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,146
Sorry.

183
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:08,023
But to place first,

184
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,343
I need to choose something hard.

185
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:11,867
I bet not.

186
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:14,906
- Really? - Yes.

187
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:19,223
Even if you give a speech on something you
really want,

188
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,026
you can still win first place.

189
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,507
Then I'll do that.

190
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,867
But we must win first place.

191
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,867
Seo-yoon.

192
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:32,827
Why do you want to place first that badly?

193
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:36,307
If I place first, Mom will be really happy.

194
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:38,743
She wouldn't worry about me either.

195
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,183
I even wrote a letter to give to Mom

196
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,547
if I won first place.

197
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:44,146
A letter?

198
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:48,987
I'll show you since we're BFFs.

199
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,467
Can I really read it?

200
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:00,227
Thank you.

201
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:08,867
<i>Mom, I'm having a good
time with Grandma every day.</i>

202
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:12,906
<i>I won't call you to come home early anymore.</i>

203
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,263
<i>I will study with Grandma...</i>

204
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:18,427
<i>while I wait for you.</i>

205
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:22,067
<i>And I will place first more often.</i>

206
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:23,987
<i>You don't need to worry about me.</i>

207
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:27,227
<i>Mom, I love you.</i>

208
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:33,467
<i>Mom, it rained so much today.</i>

209
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:38,146
<i>I got a little wet, but
I still made it home.</i>

210
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:42,787
<i>I studied hard waiting for you.</i>

211
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,507
<i>You don't need to worry about me.</i>

212
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,467
<i>I'm off to bed first. I love you, Mom.</i>

213
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:50,827
<i>Love, Jung-eun.</i>

214
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,507
You take after your mom.

215
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:08,587
Ms. Park, what brings
you to call me at this hour?

216
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:11,906
<i>Ms. Yoon, have you checked
the hospital bulletin board?</i>

217
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:13,427
No.

218
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,146
What about the bulletin board?

219
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:20,743

00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,783
<i>I've never seen a university

225
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,543

226
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,423

227
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,103

00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,267
You can't make it today?

232
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:58,906
Another cancellation?

233
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:03,747
They're going overboard over a single post.

(Hanguk University Hospital)

235
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,903
It seems there was a misunderstanding...

236
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:27,707
between you and Ms. Yoon.

237
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:31,147
I will apologize on behalf of the hospital.

238
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:32,787
A misunderstanding?

239
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,383
It seems like Ms. Yoon made a mistake.

240
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,987
We ask for your generous understanding.

241
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:42,987
Whether I understand or not depends on
how she behaves.

242
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,907
My apologies, ma'am.

243
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,187
What?

244
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,907
Is that it?

245
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:01,463
You were making a scene...

246
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:03,467
about how I was abusing my son.

247
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:05,187
"My apologies?"

248
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:06,703
I thought you were going to...

249
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:08,307
go on your knees or something.

250
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:12,547
Is that...

251
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:14,387
what you want?

252
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,863
Ma'am, please calm down...

253
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:18,187
Calm down?

254
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:21,027
Yes, I will calm down.

255
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:23,707
And I will delete the post.

256
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,067
But...

257
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,107
fire her in return.

258
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:35,343
For your information, my husband is a
journalist.

259
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,707
Social affairs journalist.

260
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:41,827
It'd help you make your decision, right?

261
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:45,387
Know your place.

262
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:47,747
Wearing a gown doesn't make you a doctor.

263
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,187
Ma'am.

264
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:53,383
She's been working
here for over 20 years...

265
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,543
and has never caused trouble before.

266
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:56,743
Wait.

267
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:59,027
What are you saying?

268
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:01,743
Are you saying she's someone...

269
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,463
who never caused trouble before,

270
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:05,747
and I'm the weird one?

271
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:08,223
No, that's not what I meant.

272
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,623
What the heck?

273
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:12,463
Are you stepping forward to defend her?

274
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:14,707
And you make me the bad person?

275
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:18,267
I don't want to hear it anymore.

276
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:22,023
Please wait, ma'am.

277
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,347
If I quit,

278
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,427
will that do?

279
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:28,107
Ms. Yoon.

280
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,387
That's what you want, isn't it?

281
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:36,947
Yes.

282
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:46,983
Sure, I will do that.

283
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:48,903
Ms. Yoon, wait.

284
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,227
But...

285
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,187
under one condition.

286
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,587
A condition?

287
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,867
You think you're in a situation to suggest
that?

288
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:59,707
She's still not reading the room yet.

289
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,747
I only ask for one thing.

290
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:05,027
In return for my resignation,

291
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:08,027
I want Su-chan to continue his therapy.

292
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:10,783
It's the therapy he must not miss,

293
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:12,427
not the academy.

294
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:18,307
If you give up on his therapy like now,

295
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,227
then...

296
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,307
I am going to report you for child abuse.

297
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:27,743
And the media where your husband works
at...

298
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,627
will be the first place I report it to.

299
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,067
What?

300
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:32,987
You still don't...

301
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,467
Thank you for everything.

302
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,987

If you quit like this, what about my child?

306
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,463
Don't worry too much.

307
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:05,063
Ms. Park loves children.

308
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:06,343
Still...

309
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:09,983
If anything happens to your son, give me a
call.

310
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,747
I'm willing to help you at any time.

311
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:13,747
Thank you.

312
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,787

313
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,867
Where's Ms. Lee?

314
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,507
- Ms. Lee? - Yes.

315
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:50,227
Ms. Lee.

316
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:52,307
What's the matter?

317
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:55,587
What?

318
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:13,507
Did Director Yoon want to see you?

319
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,627
I was on my way.

320
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:19,706
Follow me.

321
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,863
Why would Director Yoon want to see me?

322
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:38,983
You told me to do it.

323
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:40,543
I only did what you said.

324
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,747
- You think I'd do it?
- So what if you say no?

325
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:46,427
Do you want me to tell him what you did to
me?

326
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:49,027
Do you think he'd let you get away with it?

327
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:52,347
Jung-eun, you're not me.

328
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,307
You have no ties or connections in this
company.

329
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,627
You'll look funny though.

330
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:01,823
Who would accept someone who got fired...

331
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,667
after assaulting her superior?

332
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:08,706
I told you. You made a mistake.

333
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:12,227
For your information, I got a doctor's note
yesterday.

334
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:13,987
Do you understand it now?

335
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,987
Only I'd let it slide.

336
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,507
So you shouldn't have acted up.

337
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:21,263
Why bother pretending to look after a
junior...

338
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:23,267
when you can't even take care of yourself?

339
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:25,223
You were using your child as an excuse...

340
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:27,307
to be a chair warmer.

341
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:30,307
I never used my child as an excuse to put
my work off.

342
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,463
And I never made anyone else...

343
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,343
take over my work like someone.

344
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,227
Is that so? But who cares?

345
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:42,107
So keep your mouth closed and do as I say.

346
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:45,303
What did you just say?

347
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,147
It's dirty and crappy, isn't it?

348
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:50,827
But what can you do? You need this job.

349
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,147
You need this to raise
your child, don't you?

350
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:57,103
Your husband isn't doing well after he
transferred.

351
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:58,706
Do your best.

352
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,867
What are you doing? Director Yoon is
waiting.

353
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:09,987
Gosh.

354
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:18,103
Shoot.

355
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,587
- Bye.
- Bye.

356
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,267
Come in.

357
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:27,067
It's nice to see you together.

358
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:31,107
I heard you agreed to work on the TR
together.

359
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:34,067
Ms. Lee, I have high expectations.

360
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:36,827
Well...

361
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:38,783
Director Yoon, actually...

362
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:39,943
Oh, Director Yoon.

363
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,463
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can join...

364
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,463
Hanguk University alumni golf round
tomorrow.

365
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:45,787
Why not?

366
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:49,466
It's been a few days since my neck...

367
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,387
What about your neck? A neck pain?

368
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:53,503
I sprained it a bit.

369
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,587
And the doctor told me to rest.

370
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,903
Sorry, Ms. Lee.

371
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:58,587
I'll let you continue.

372
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,827
Yes. Right.

373
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:10,667
It's nothing.

374
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,303
The president is...

375
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:15,823
paying attention to this TR project.

376
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,387
So do your best.

377
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:19,547
Once this goes well,

378
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:22,307
you'll hear good news
at the end of the year.

379
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:23,543
Yes.

380
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,587
Ms. Lee, you have many connections.

381
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:28,303
Use all your connections...

382
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,027
to find the CEO of TR.

383
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:31,863
I beg your pardon?

384
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:33,703
Director Yoon, that's a great idea.

385
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:35,783
Then I'll focus on the cooperation
presentation.

386
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:37,267
Look at you.

387
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:40,387
Your teamwork is perfect already.

388
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:45,387
This is a good chance for your career.

389
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,583
You must seize this chance.

390
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:49,142
You're right, Director Yoon.

391
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,147
I'm sure Ms. Lee will pull it off.

392
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:52,547
Right?

393
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:05,622
I look forward to working with you,

394
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:08,867
the legendary Senior Manager Lee.

395
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:12,627
But you don't have much time.

396
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:19,307
This is crazy.

397
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:26,052
(Lee Young-wook)

398
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:32,147
<i>Grandpa, you're a liar.</i>

399
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:34,907
<i>Liar.</i>

400
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:38,946
<i>I can't draw a dinosaur anymore.</i>

401
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:52,303
Which sanctions the use of force,

402
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,503
or threat of force...

403
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:56,067
against the...

404
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:59,187
sover... - Stop.

405
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,027
Lee Min-ho.

406
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,347
What are you reading again?

407
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:07,063
It's a speech.

408
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,187
How can it be a speech if you stutter?

409
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:14,027
We need to talk.

410
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,027
It's me.

411
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:28,147
Find Min-ho a new speech tutor.

412
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:31,107
It doesn't matter how much it costs.

413
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:32,987
But...

414
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:35,027
make sure she's good this time.

415
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:37,147
Bye.

416
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,907
Ma'am.

417
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:42,107
Can you give me one more chance?

418
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,987
I'm in a tough situation to quit now...

419
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:46,747
One more chance?

420
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:48,946
Are you trying to ruin my son?

421
00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:51,747
Find someone for your level.

422
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:58,107
It ends here.

423
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:00,187
You're dismissed.

424
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:05,943
I only hired you for a
high price because...

425
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,187
you were becoming Myeongseong
Elementary teacher.

426
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,387
It was a waste of time.

427
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:39,667
Hello, Father.

428
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,227
I saw that you had a guest?

429
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:45,787
She was Min-ho's English speech tutor.

430
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:47,303
Don't mind her.

431
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:49,067
She's not coming here anymore.

432
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:52,503
Anyway, what brings you here?

433
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:53,827
Speaking of which,

434
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:56,547
by English speech,

435
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,867
you mean George VI's speech?

436
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:01,387
Yes, Father.

437
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:03,142
How did you know?

438
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,382
When I visited Min-ho's academy,

439
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:06,547
I saw him practicing.

440
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,706
I see.

441
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,827
You know...

442
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:14,263
English speech isn't just about memorizing.

443
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,946
But you also need to know the history,
situation,

444
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,503
and the speaker's habit...

445
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:21,107
and nature too.

446
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:24,423
No wonder you became...

447
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:25,703
the English literature professor.

448
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:27,787
And it's posh English.

449
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:29,667
Anyway,

450
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:32,703
you chose a very difficult text.

451
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:34,227
It won't be easy.

452
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,307
Right.

453
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,863
Someone like you...

454
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:40,667
should teach him.

455
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:44,787
Right.

456
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:47,467
Then...

457
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,027
do you want me to help him?

458
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:52,667
While driving him to the academy?

459
00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:55,263
Really?

460
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,587
Of course.

461
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:58,903
He's my grandson after all.

462
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:00,543
That's the least I can do for him.

463
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,107
Yes, please.

464
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:04,507
I'd appreciate it.

465
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:05,987
Sure.

466
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:09,023
When is the contest again?

467
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:11,943
Well, there isn't much time left.

468
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:13,827
The contest is next week.

469
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,547
Do you have the time for it?

470
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,467
Of course.

471
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:20,147
I'll make the time for it.

472
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:22,707
I appreciate it.

473
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:24,747
I'll bring you some tea.

474
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:36,107
Grandpa.

475
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:42,547
Yes.

476
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:51,063
Then are we going...

477
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:53,107
to practice English together?

478
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,187
No.

479
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,903
You're doing great.

480
00:25:57,927 --> 00:26:00,347
You don't need my help.

481
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:01,907
Really?

482
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:04,267
Really.

483
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:06,147
But...

484
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:10,387
if you relax a little bit,

485
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,507
you'll do even better.

486
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:15,387
Yes.

487
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:26,583
Grandpa, by the way.

488
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:27,703
Yes?

489
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:29,987
Are you going anywhere today?

490
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:33,663
Why do you ask?

491
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:37,147
Do I look better than usual?

492
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:39,907
Well...

493
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:41,867
Not so bad.

494
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,867
Who are you meeting?

495
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:47,943
No, I'm not meeting anyone.

496
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,387
Well, I'm just...

497
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,107
I think I know who it is.

498
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:56,027
You look great, Grandpa.

499
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,943
- Hello. - Hello.

500
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,547
Let's go.

501
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:02,383
Have a good day.

502
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:04,183
- Bye. - See you tomorrow.

503
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,747
Jinny.

504
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:10,787
Are you ill?

505
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:12,787
No.

506
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,987
I'm not ill at all.

507
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:18,827
Why?

508
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:20,663
That's not true.

509
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:22,543
You look strange today.

510
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:24,027
Normally,

511
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:25,863
you're like this,

512
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:27,427
but today,

513
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:29,587
you're doing this.

514
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,347
No, that's not it.

515
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,947
I was just thinking about something.

516
00:27:40,247 --> 00:27:42,383
Well...

517
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:43,827
Not this either?

518
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,983
Oh, my dear Jinny.

519
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:50,067
You'll be okay.

520
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:56,223
Seo-yoon, what was that?

521
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:57,543
Who taught you?

522
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:58,823
Mom.

523
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:01,027
She said you did that to her.

524
00:28:03,287 --> 00:28:05,067
She's right.

525
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,667
I used to do that.

526
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:11,667
- Seo-yoon. - Yes?

527
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:14,383
When Mom...

528
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:17,507
pats you like this,

529
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:19,223
does it make you feel better?

530
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,343
Of course.

531
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,903
Every time Mom pats me like this,

532
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:24,787
I can't ask for more.

533
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:26,583
Do you like that too? Yes?

534
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:27,783
Yes.

535
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,627
It cheers me up.

536
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:31,343
Thank you.

537
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:32,623
Really?

538
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:34,987
Then do you want to see what's next?

539
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:39,707
After patting, it's tapping.

540
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:41,267
Right?

541
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,667
Yes.

542
00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:49,627
Patting...

543
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:53,907
and tapping.

544
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,707
Seo-yoon.

545
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:12,983
- Tae-rin. - Hello.

546
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:15,587
Hey, you're early.

547
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:17,987
So? Did you decide to keep attending?

548
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:23,383
I just might.

549
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:25,547
- I'm glad you decided so.
- You're welcome.

550
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:27,587
Let's play with this.

551
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:30,183
Play quietly.

552
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:31,627
- Okay. - Okay.

553
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:37,023
Tae-rin was born abroad.

554
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:38,943
Her move to Korea last year was quite
sudden too.

555
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:41,183
- This is interesting. - She couldn't speak
Korean.

556
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:43,103
- She didn't have any friends either.
- This one.

557
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:45,107
It had been so tough on her.

558
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:47,663
She cried her eyes out all day.

559
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:50,547
That's why all of her nannies quit.

560
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:53,703
- My gosh, poor thing. - Let's check this
color.

561
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:56,507
Her mom came to me with the crying child in
her arms.

562
00:29:56,567 --> 00:30:00,267
She begged me to look
after her in her tears.

563
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:03,027
I couldn't bear to watch my daughter suffer.

564
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:05,103
So I ended up driving her around...

565
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:07,307
which I never thought l
would in my lifetime.

566
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:10,027
- That must've been a tough time. - Right.

567
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,703
With my help,

568
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:16,023
Tae-rin became a cheerful girl as you can
see.

569
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,787
And even her mother seemed happy.

570
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:20,427
That's my reward.

571
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:21,987
You see,

572
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,107
you love her to pieces.

573
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:26,143
But you'll keep questioning...

574
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,703
if you should keep doing this or not...

575
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:29,463
a dozen times every day.

576
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:32,427
Taking care of a child is no easy task.

577
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:34,143
You'd better brace yourself.

578
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,547
You must know since you raised your
daughter.

579
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:40,023
Luckily, my daughter had been independent...

580
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,787
ever since she was young.

581
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,427
Thanks to that, it wasn't much difficult for
me.

582
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:47,183
No children can grow up on their own.

583
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:48,987
She probably didn't say anything to you.

584
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:50,583
I bet she couldn't say anything...

585
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:52,783
because she could see her
mother working hard.

586
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,183
So she just stayed quiet. Oh, no.

587
00:30:54,207 --> 00:30:55,623
She must've looked after herself.

588
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,187
My goodness, poor thing.

589
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:58,983
For parents,

590
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:02,147
the saddest thing is when your child grows
up too fast.

591
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:09,667
Mr. Kim.

592
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,867
Must I do this just to keep my job here?

593
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,787
What did Director Yoon say?

594
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:22,467
My goodness. I can't believe him.

595
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:24,623
He's only listening to
that sly snake, Ha Sa-na.

596
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:28,187
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee. It's all my fault.

597
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,107
This is embarrassing.

598
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,867
Don't say I'm your role model.

599
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:40,467
Don't say that, Ms. Lee.

600
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:44,387
What's up with the mood? You know better.

601
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:46,427
Go and wrap up.

602
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,827
- What? - Let's grab a drink.

603
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:53,267
Yes. Let's go and grab a drink. Please?

604
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:54,623
"Please?"

605
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:55,703
I said we were grabbing a drink, so we will.

606
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:56,863
She has no say in this.

607
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:59,783
All right. Today, we're having a team
bonding workshop.

608
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:02,187
This is part of the
work. You must attend it.

609
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,507
Where's our youngest?

610
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:08,423
The youngest? Gosh, her name is Kang Min-
hee.

611
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:10,507
- Hey. Let's go. - Let's go, Ms. Lee.

612
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:13,187
- Ms. Lee, let's go. - My gosh.

613
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,983
Girls, let's go inside. The class will
begin soon.

614
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:21,307
- Okay. - Okay.

615
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:30,027
Jinny, you must wait here.

616
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:32,467
Of course. Go inside now.

617
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,067
Go on.

618
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,307
- Bye. - Yes, we'll get going.

619
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:42,947
What?

620
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,307
I've never seen him before.

621
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,147
- Hello. - Hello.

622
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,227
I'm here to give Min-ho a ride again.

623
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:04,107
We've got another poor soul joining us.

624
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:06,023
Pardon?

625
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:08,867
Nothing. I was mumbling to myself.

626
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:12,947
By the way, this chair isn't here to be
admired.

627
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:15,747
- I guess you can't see the chair. - Okay.

628
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:18,667
Excuse me then.

629
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,387
Where are you from? Who are you?

630
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,863
He's the grandfather of Min-ho from Class A.

631
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:27,707
Min-ho? Who's Min-ho?

632
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:30,707
- Tommy. - Tommy?

633
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:34,547
Tommy from Class A?

634
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:36,423
Gosh, it would've been a lot better...

635
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,703
if you told me sooner you were Tommy's
grandfather.

636
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,903
Am I not allowed to sit at this table?

637
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:43,067
No. It's not that.

638
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:46,503
You see, I'm the grandmother of Tae-rin from
Class B.

639
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,183
My name is Jang Mi-chun.

640
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:51,066
- This is... - Mi-chun, we've met.

641
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:57,147
Did I make a mistake, perhaps?

642
00:33:57,847 --> 00:33:59,227
No.

643
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:01,467
How old are you?

644
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,267
Pardon?

645
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:06,343
I turned 60 just this year.

646
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:07,667
Hold on a second.

647
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:10,623
I'm 65 years old. And he's 60.

648
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:11,947
You are...

649
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:15,623
Yes. I'm 59 years old.

650
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:17,227
My gosh. Perfect.

651
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:20,143
- You're single, right? - How did you know?

652
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:21,703
Are you in good health?

653
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,463
Yes, I am. I always exercise.

654
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:25,546
So I managed to stay away from the
hospital.

655
00:34:27,647 --> 00:34:29,787
You too, right? Aren't you single?

656
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,467
Yes.

657
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:35,703
I'm single. Yes.

658
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:38,187
Yes. I'm single too.

659
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:42,983
By the way, how come you didn't bring
anything?

660
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:45,307
And you only brought one bag?

661
00:34:46,246 --> 00:34:48,383
It appears to me that you have
underestimated...

662
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:50,867
the world of driving our grandchildren
around.

663
00:34:51,766 --> 00:34:56,143
It's not like I can write
out everything from A to Z.

664
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:58,423
Are we supposed to prepare things for them?

665
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:01,147
Do you think your ancestors raise your
children?

666
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:03,267
Never mind. You know what? Forget it.

667
00:35:03,807 --> 00:35:06,107
Instead of talking about this...

668
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,707
All right. Take a look.

669
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,663
You must carry tissues, the most basic item.

670
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:14,507
Wet wipes and dry tissue.

671
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:18,107
And if you can, when you wipe their mouths,

672
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:20,663
use a handkerchief instead of a tissue.

673
00:35:20,687 --> 00:35:23,463
That will be better on their skin, right?

674
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,143
When they come here after kindergarten,

675
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:28,103
those little munchkins must spend a long
time here.

676
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,427
This isn't everything.

677
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,383
We must drive them home after class.

678
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:33,507
But the traffic is awful as you know.

679
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:36,303
So those little ones will
get hungry, will they not?

680
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:37,827
They're in a growth phase too.

681
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:40,183
- You're right. - Hold on a second.

682
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,823
Going over just the basics...

683
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:43,463
will keep us up all night.

684
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:45,143
You know what?

685
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:47,183
Since we have to drive around our
grandchildren,

686
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:49,947
we should pick a day and have a workshop.

687
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:53,863
Well, I'm down for anything.

688
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:57,423
In that case, it will be
this Sunday at 9 a.m.

689
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,742
We'll meet at the
parking lot of the park...

690
00:35:58,766 --> 00:36:01,066
across from the academy. Okay?

691
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:02,747
Okay.

692
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:09,707
Sure. I guess I'll look
forward to learning from you.

693
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:11,507
Great!

694
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:15,383
Hang in there.

695
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,503
No matter how awful it is, you must hang in
there.

696
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:17,463
That's work.

697
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:19,423
Don't even say you'll quit. For whose
benefit?

698
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:20,823
He's right.

699
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:21,903
You must keep working to show her...

700
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:23,103
she can't take you down.

701
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:24,383
I'll keep it short.

702
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:26,586
Hang in there for the
sake of your daughter.

703
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,787
You said you wanted her to attend
Myeongseong.

704
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:31,387
Do you know how expensive the tuition is
these days?

705
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:33,066
What about her academy fees?

706
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:36,387
Do you think your husband can pay for all
that?

707
00:36:37,246 --> 00:36:38,586
But...

708
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,147
But what?

709
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:45,863
Darn it.

710
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:49,627
How am I going to find this CEO?

711
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:51,546
I'll find the CEO.

712
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:54,707
I like the spirit, Youngest.

713
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,827
I'll help you too.

714
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,783
You mean it, right? No backsies.

715
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:01,187
You can count on me.

716
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:04,187
I also get pissed off when someone comes
after my team.

717
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:07,227
Mr. Kim.

718
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:09,663
We'll comb through every inch of this
industry.

719
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:11,066
Then we'll find the CEO.

720
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:12,667
On that note,

721
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:14,787
how about a drink?

722
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:17,747
No.

723
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:19,103
You can't tolerate alcohol.

724
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:20,703
I can drink on a day like today.

725
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:22,943
- No. - I'll just clink my class with you.

726
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:23,983
- That's it, okay? - Yes.

727
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:26,507
- Cheers. - Cheers.

728
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:30,427
Seo-yoon, you can trust Mommy.

729
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:45,307
And this...

730
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:54,987
The Toad Rock in Mount Buram.

731
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,262
Go back and get the biggest piece of taffy.

732
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:59,303
Put it on the rock and pray sincerely.

733
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:00,179
(Divine General)

734
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,267
Are you coming?

735
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:10,187
Why are you taking so long?

736
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:12,427
Come out already.

737
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:14,627
Jung-eun.

738
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:17,066
Ta-da!

739
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:18,294
(Luck)

740
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:20,222
Have you gone mad?

741
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:21,663
You'll wear that to the mountain?

742
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:23,387
Yes. What do you think?

743
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,863
Hey. Going there an the utter sense of
devotion...

744
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,023
might not even be enough.

745
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:28,983
- You drive me crazy. - My gosh.

746
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:29,983
What?

747
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,503
You said red increased the chance of her
gettingin.

748
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,503
Hey, what do you think? Check out my
bottom.

749
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:37,066
- There's one on my bottom too. - Get
dressed now.

750
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:38,262
What? Are you getting excited

751
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:39,983
to check out my bottom after a while?

752
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:42,463
- What do you think? - Have you gone mad?

753
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,943
- Check this out, Jung-eun.
- You'll bring bad luck.

754
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,663
Big fortune. Small fortune.

755
00:38:46,687 --> 00:38:48,023
Big fortune. What do you think?

756
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:50,307
Hey. That's bad luck!

757
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:55,227
Are you all right?

758
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:58,907
Blood? Oh, no.

759
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:00,307
What?

760
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:01,623
No. Don't wipe it.

761
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:03,742
Jung-eun. Blood is red too. This is good.

762
00:39:03,766 --> 00:39:05,267
Stop going overboard.

763
00:39:05,447 --> 00:39:08,703
Jung-eun. Just trust me and follow my lead.

764
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:10,383
If I can send our daughter to Myeongseong
Elementary,

765
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:12,427
I can hike the mountain with you on my back.

766
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:14,463
My gosh.

767
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:17,467
- Okay? I'm a strong man! - Goodness.

768
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:19,623
Seriously.

769
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:21,387
You are driving me crazy indeed.

770
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:27,987
Jung-eun!

771
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:33,867
What? You can carry me on your back?

772
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:36,943
Call 911. Could you call an ambulance for
me?

773
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,742
You've got to help me
out. I really might die here.

774
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:39,983
Please.

775
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:41,903
Should I kill you on this mountain...

776
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:43,546
and offer you as a sacrifice?

777
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:46,023
Jung-eun. Abandon me.

778
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:48,066
Go ahead without me. It's okay.

779
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:49,543
I'll really kill you.

780
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:50,783
Come on.

781
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,387
If I could, I would already have done that.

782
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:56,187
The general told me
to bring you to the rock.

783
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,107
Come on, hurry up.

784
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:00,947
All right.

785
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:29,027
Come on.

786
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:37,627
My gosh.

787
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:42,787
Oh, my.

788
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,063
J-Jung-eun.

789
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:56,623
- My gosh. Seriously.- I'm dying here.

790
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,423
I can't do this. No.

791
00:40:58,447 --> 00:40:59,827
- The ToadRock. - Oh, my.

792
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,787
- Goodness. - Oh, dear.

793
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,827
No, I shouldn't waste time like this.

794
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,227
Honey, give me the bag.

795
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:29,027
There's taffy to help our daughter get in...

796
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:40,427
My gosh. Oh, my.

797
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,143
Hey.

798
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,303
Gosh, my blood sugar was crashing. I feel
alive now.

799
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:47,023
- Jung-eun. Have some taffy. - You...

800
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:48,507
- You... - It's sweet.

801
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:50,147
Did you just eat that?

802
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:52,667
Have you gone mad?

803
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,107
You really must have lost your mind.

804
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:58,703
Why would you eat that?

805
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:01,303
That taffy was supposed to help her get in!

806
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:03,583
I was going to put it on the rock!

807
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:05,222
That's why I brought it!

808
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:06,183
How will you fix this?

809
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,983
It's your fault if she doesn't get in!

810
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:09,423
Hey, if that was your plan,

811
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:11,987
you should have told me about it.

812
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:15,667
Hold on a second. This is taffy, after all.

813
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:18,147
- No... - I can put some saliva on it and do
this.

814
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:21,267
No, my taffy!

815
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,907
You!

816
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:24,983
You...

817
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:26,983
You go back down.

818
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:29,262
Go back down and buy me a new one.

819
00:42:29,286 --> 00:42:32,383
Hey! How do you expect me to go down and
come back?

820
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,143
I know that you're throwing a fit right now.

821
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,066
But be reasonable at least!

822
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:37,863
Then why did you eat this?

823
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:39,907
Why did you eat this taffy?

824
00:42:40,007 --> 00:42:42,143
Are you crazy? You dummy.

825
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,787
Do you still call yourself a dad?

826
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:45,947
You... Unbelievable.

827
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:47,867
Come on!

828
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,023
Hey.

829
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:51,303
Don't follow me.

830
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:52,343
Hey, Jung-eun!

831
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:55,503
If I ever do anything with you again,

832
00:42:55,527 --> 00:42:56,663
it means I've given up on myself.

833
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:58,063
You idiot!

834
00:42:58,087 --> 00:42:59,583
- Come on. - Jung-eun.

835
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:01,183
Unbelievable. Darn it.

836
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:02,262
Jung-eun.

837
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:04,267
Don't leave me alone here.

838
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:07,262
Hey, my legs are numb.

839
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:10,227
J-Jung-eun!

840
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:13,849
Wet wipes.

841
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:17,132
A handkerchief. Vitamins...

842
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,056
You're home early.

843
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,896
We're home.

844
00:43:22,276 --> 00:43:24,856
Mom. Do you know what that fool did?

845
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:29,896
Don't call your husband that.

846
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:32,572
Mother.

847
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:34,296
- You know, Jung-eun... - Be quiet.

848
00:43:34,516 --> 00:43:37,175
I'm going to divorce him. Don't stop me.

849
00:43:38,196 --> 00:43:40,056
Get up and help me go over this.

850
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:42,456
I don't know what it is. But later.

851
00:43:43,156 --> 00:43:45,052
I'm about to pass out now.

852
00:43:45,076 --> 00:43:47,172
I tried to pack as much as I could.

853
00:43:47,196 --> 00:43:49,936
But it's been so long. I can't seem to
remember a lot.

854
00:43:53,956 --> 00:43:55,296
What's all this?

855
00:43:55,996 --> 00:43:57,132
Are you going on a picnic?

856
00:43:57,156 --> 00:43:58,576
It's not for a picnic.

857
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,172
I'm packing things I'd need
when I drive Seo-yoon...

858
00:44:01,196 --> 00:44:02,896
between kindergarten and her academy.

859
00:44:09,156 --> 00:44:11,896
What did you just say?

860
00:44:13,396 --> 00:44:14,492
You asked me to look after her...

861
00:44:14,516 --> 00:44:16,216
until she started elementary school.

862
00:44:16,756 --> 00:44:18,492
What? Do you not want me to?

863
00:44:18,516 --> 00:44:19,976
- Nonsense.- Nonsense.

864
00:44:21,396 --> 00:44:22,816
I know we're a family,

865
00:44:23,436 --> 00:44:26,175
but you still have to pay me. You know that,
right?

866
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:28,896
Of course. We know that.

867
00:44:30,996 --> 00:44:33,252
This is amazing. He was spot on.

868
00:44:33,276 --> 00:44:34,412
The Divine General said...

869
00:44:34,436 --> 00:44:36,056
someone helpful would come our way.

870
00:44:36,116 --> 00:44:37,416
I see.

871
00:44:37,756 --> 00:44:39,496
This is so fascinating.

872
00:44:40,355 --> 00:44:41,696
What General?

873
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,256
No one.

874
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:45,776
But...

875
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:48,096
what about the hospital?

876
00:44:49,796 --> 00:44:51,135
You know,

877
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:53,492
both Seo-yoon and you need some help.

878
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:55,412
So I'll take a break for the time being.

879
00:44:55,436 --> 00:44:56,412
Why?

880
00:44:56,436 --> 00:44:58,016
Why are you asking me that?

881
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,175
I want to take a break too. Okay?

882
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:03,175
Are you...

883
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:05,016
- sick? - What?

884
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,652
W-What's wrong?

885
00:45:06,676 --> 00:45:08,012
I'm not sick.

886
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:10,132
If I'm sick, I'll go to the hospital.

887
00:45:10,156 --> 00:45:11,696
Why would I look after Seo-yoon?

888
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,412
Well, when I told you I wanted to quit my
job...

889
00:45:15,436 --> 00:45:16,892
to look after Seo-yoon,

890
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:18,296
you weren't so thrilled.

891
00:45:19,036 --> 00:45:20,572
You suddenly want to take a break?

892
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:22,696
So what?

893
00:45:23,276 --> 00:45:24,736
You don't want me to do this?

894
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:27,092
Did something happen?

895
00:45:27,116 --> 00:45:29,212
Nothing happened.

896
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:30,536
Nothing.

897
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:36,212
I'm taking Seo-yoon out for
something tomorrow.

898
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:38,135
Tomorrow? It's Sunday.

899
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:40,532
With whom? Where are you going?

900
00:45:40,556 --> 00:45:43,175
I want to get some fresh air with Seo-yoon.

901
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:46,616
Must I report to you about everything even
at my age?

902
00:45:46,756 --> 00:45:49,732
No. You don't have to do that.

903
00:45:49,756 --> 00:45:52,772
Once you start driving around Seo-yoon,

904
00:45:52,796 --> 00:45:54,331
you might be tired. So...

905
00:45:54,355 --> 00:45:55,896
Fine.

906
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:57,811
- Do you need anything? - No.

907
00:45:57,835 --> 00:45:59,372
Leave them here. I'm leaving now.

908
00:45:59,396 --> 00:46:01,732
- Why don't you sleep over? - You're
leaving?

909
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,331
Get home safely, Mother.

910
00:46:03,355 --> 00:46:05,416
Bye. Call me.

911
00:46:08,676 --> 00:46:11,096
This is amazing. No way.

912
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:12,856
How did this happen?

913
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:19,252
My gosh. We got a breather thanks to
Mother.

914
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,478
(Kanuda)

915
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:29,616
- You're about to fall asleep. - My gosh.

916
00:46:30,276 --> 00:46:32,252
This is so comfortable.
I almost fell asleep.

917
00:46:32,276 --> 00:46:33,532
Is that so?

918
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,331
Seo-yoon. Isn't this nice?

919
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:36,932
Yes. It's super nice.

920
00:46:36,956 --> 00:46:38,336
My gosh.

921
00:46:40,355 --> 00:46:42,412
By the way, what's this?

922
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:43,452
It looks interesting.

923
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:44,816
Right.

924
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:47,012
Ji-suk bought this for Sophie.

925
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:48,736
She said it was amazing.

926
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:51,132
So I decided to splurge and buy it too.

927
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:52,172
Excuse me.

928

930
00:46:56,076 --> 00:46:57,292
and one kids' pillow. We'll take this one.

931
00:46:57,316 --> 00:46:59,496
- Yes, ma'am. - Thank you.

932
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:01,252
Why are we buying three adult pillows?

933
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,212
Am I getting two?

934
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,056
No. One of them is for my mom.

935
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,331
Right. She's working so hard to help us.

936
00:47:07,355 --> 00:47:09,256

yesterday.

going for.

972
00:48:24,556 --> 00:48:25,856
Why?

973
00:48:27,316 --> 00:48:28,692
Does my outfit look weird?

974
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:31,736
Good grief. What will I do with this
gaudy outfit?

975

00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:05,817
Ji-suk was picked, and he said I'd too.

1101
00:55:05,841 --> 00:55:08,297
I will be picked for
the last slot, definitely.

1102
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:12,217
I will be picked. I will.

1103
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:13,821
- Please. - Oh, my.

1104
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:15,621
You got picked.

1105
00:55:15,881 --> 00:55:18,061
Thank you.

1106
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:20,781
Now, we'll draw the last lot.

1107
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:27,287
(Lottery for Admission)

1108
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:32,261
Please. Seo-yoon.

1109
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:39,821
It's beautiful.

1110
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:44,137
- It's pretty. - It is, right?

1111
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:45,177
You're flying.

1112
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:47,981
- Here we go. - Is it fun?

1113
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:52,581
I'm flying.

1114
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:54,457
It's fun.

1115
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:56,617
You should sit in this too.

1116
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:59,461

1117
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:04,421

Number seven. Seo-yoon.

1119
00:56:15,801 --> 00:56:17,101
Seven!

1120
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:22,501
Really?

1121
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,261
The last number is...

1122
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:28,621
number 17.

1123
00:56:34,681 --> 00:56:35,981
No.

1124
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:37,981
I clearly saw it.

1125
00:56:39,081 --> 00:56:40,621
It was number seven.

1126
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:44,181
Here.

1127
00:56:50,121 --> 00:56:51,581
I'm number 17.

1128
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,541
Number 17.

1129
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:57,261
Wait a minute.

1130
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:15,098

appearance.)

1132
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:51,057

1134

Thank you for your work, Ms. Yoon Ji-a.

1137

<i>It seems that Claire's grandmother</i>

1139
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:08,577

1140
00:58:08,601 --> 00:58:11,377
