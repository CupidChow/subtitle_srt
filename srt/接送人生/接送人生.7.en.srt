fictitious.)

00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:13,689
(Child actors were accompanied by family...)

6
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,943
(and were kept safe.)

7
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:18,558
Is it really yours, Jason?

8
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:20,558
(Episode 7)

9
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:23,298
Are you absolutely sure?

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,506
It's a misunderstanding, ma'am.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,750
Is he even thinking straight?

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,310
It's okay, Jason.

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,390
It's okay.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,350
Don't cry, Jason.

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,310
But it really is mine.

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,750
I'm not lying.

17
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,390
Jason.

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,990
Come here, boy.

19
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,590
But...

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,670
Ho-gyung.

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,590
There must've been a misunderstanding.

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,310
Let me talk to him first.

23
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,150
Is that okay with you?

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,985
You should meet Tommy...

25
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:20,470
What about my Tommy?

26
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,510
No, it's okay.

27
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,030
It's not your fault. It's okay.

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,746
Jason, say sorry to Tommy.

29
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,070
No.

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,746
Listen to Jason first and...

31
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,986
Mind your own business.

32
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,026
Hey.

33
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,110
Go say sorry.

34
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,990
Mom?

35
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,786
I was about to leave.

36
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,270
One second.

37
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,710
I'm really sorry.

38
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,066
I'll talk to Jason...

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,470
and make sure this never happens again.

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,470
I'm really sorry.

41
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,270
Hello.

42
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,386
Seo-yoon, are you okay now?

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,670
- Are you good now? - Yes.

44
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,190
- Grandpa. - Yes?

45
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,266
I want to take a picture with your camera.

46
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,630
One second.

47
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,226
Here. Turn it on.

48
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,025
Press this button.

49
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:13,270
Okay.

50
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,470
Have you seen Min-ho recently?

51
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,106
No, I haven't met him.

52
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,030
You should meet him more often.

53
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,350
Okay.

54
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,750
Let me take a picture of you.

55
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,550
- Okay. - Well...

56
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,066
Sure.

57
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,270
One, two, three.

58
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,186
You're like a photographer.

59
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,666
Let me see.

60
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,430
- It's Grandpa. - Nice.

61
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,070
I promised to look at the stars with Seo-
yoon.

62
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,066
Promise?

63
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,346
Nothing.

64
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,706
Say that again.

65
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,590
With whom? What did you promise?

66
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,470
Who was there? Grandpa and who?

67
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,710
Tae-rin's grandma and Seo-yoon's grandma.

68
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,666
When?

69
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,310
The day of the draw.

70
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,910
And?

71
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,430
What did Seo-yoon's grandma say?

72
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,986
Sorry?

73
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,630
She must've talked to Grandpa.

74
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,950
What did they talk about?

75
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,950
Lee Min-ho. Your hand.

76
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,710
Bring your phone.

77
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,750
Even I was angry about Jason.

78
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,586
Tommy must've been upset.

79
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,826
That's what kids are like.

80
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,750
I'm worried...

81
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:18,386
about how soft-hearted you are.

82
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,190
What are you trying to say?

83
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:22,390
The woman in Class B.

84
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,950
I heard her kid is moving to Class A.

85
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,426
Says who?

86
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,790
She said it with her own mouth.

87
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,506
Since when was it that easy...

88
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,426
to get into Class A at Big Parker?

89
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,910
Did she say that?

90
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,030
Her kid is moving to Class A?

91
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,066
It's not true. Right?

92
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,989
Did she not hear...

93
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,989
that she must leave if she doesn't get
enough votes?

94
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,030
- Really? - On the day of voting,

95
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,545
I'm going to show her.

96
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,830
Then I'll be against it for sure.

97
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,426
I thought you had become soft-hearted.

98
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,186
Do you know how surprised I was?

99
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,630
I was close.

100
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,626
All done.

101
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,109
Dang it.

102
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,785
What's wrong?

103
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,546
The TR proposal. Have you seen it?

104
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,986
Why would I?

105
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,586
We only need to make the meeting happen.

106
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,950
Right?

107
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,750
Gosh, what an eyesore.

108
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,706
- Is it that bad? - Don't pay attention to it.

109
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,546
If you read it, you won't be able to stand it.

110
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,826
It'll only give you more work.

111
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,466
You think I don't know Ha Sa-na?

112
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,066
I have no expectations of her.

113
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,910
Show me. I'll only read it.

114
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,746
I'm on cloud nine right now.

115
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,790
I should read it when I'm generous. Give it to
me.

116
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,150
Let me see.

117
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,510
Is this supposed to be a proposal?

118
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,070
Even if I find the TR CEO,

119
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,430
I could never show this.

120
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,506
First, send me the file.

121
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,790
Pardon?

122
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,350
Are you going to fix it?

123
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,750
If I feel like it.

124
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,390
- Okay. - Gosh, that woman...

125
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,305
(Madam Shin's Gukbap)

126
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,026
(Grand Award Winner Hong Seo-yoon, )

127
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,706
(Madam Shin's Granddaughter)

128
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,990
Gosh.

129
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,750
We're closed.

130
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,870
Mom.

131
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,990
What are you doing here at this hour?

132
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,950
Well...

133
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,350
Mom. Help me.

134
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,310
There you go again.

135
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,306
I've thought about it over and over,

136
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,910
and you're the only one I have.

137
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,030
What is it this time?

138
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,590
The money we saved to move to Gongnam
Apartment.

139
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,070
I lost it all.

140
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,106
What? How?

141
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,270
We were a little short, so I spent it all...

142
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,990
on...

143
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,626
cryptocurrency.

144
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,390
What? Cryptocurrency?

145
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,150
Gosh. You idiot.

146
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,266
You saw what I went through...

147
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,266
because of your father's money problems.

148
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,226
- I know. - Yet you're doing this to me?

149
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,506
My goodness.

150
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,026
Yes, I deserve it.

151
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,226
I deserve more. I'm crazy.

152
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,065
My goodness.

153
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:49,586
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,586
Can you help me out one last time?

155
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,185
Right now, we're about to lose the store.

156
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:55,466
We won't be able to move.

157
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,426
We'll have to live on the street.

158
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,866
I don't know.

159
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,509
No.

160
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,389
I did that for Jung-eun and Seo-yoon.

161
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,590
But it went under.

162
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,870
Don't think about hitting the jackpot.

163
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,626
You said it's for Jung-eun and Seo-yoon.

164
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,150
Then what can't you do?

165
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,110
Do what?

166
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,945
- Work here. - Mom!

167
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:20,945
Work here...

168
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:22,546
and save money.

169
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,026
No.

170
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,065
Then live on the street. It's your call.

171
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:28,750
But...

172
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,830
Mom!

173
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,150
But...

174
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,750
Look at Mommy.

175
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,350
So adorable.

176
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,226
Seo-yoon.

177
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,866
You'll be moving to Class A starting
tomorrow.

178
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,786
- Are you happy? - How?

179
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,185
I didn't take the test.

180
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,945
I took care of it.

181
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,986
Am I moving to Class A now?

182
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,590
Of course.

183
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,906
Mom, are you happy?

184
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,190
I'm very, very happy.

185
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,110
Now you and Tommy are both in Class A.

186
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,870
You worked very hard.

187
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,670
So cute.

188
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,070
- Good morning. - Jinny.

189
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,426
Seo-yoon.

190
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,826
Go pee before going to preschool.

191
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,230
Okay.

192
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,590
Where's Jae-man? Still in bed?

193
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,986
He went out early in the morning.

194
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,110
He's been busy avoiding me lately.

195
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,306
He leaves early in the morning...

196
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,590
and comes home late at night.

197
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,466
Did you fight again?

198
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,826
Oh, I don't know.

199
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,426
Today is an important day.

200
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,666
I don't even want to think about him. It's bad
luck.

201
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,269
Watch your mouth.

202
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,750
Okay.

203
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,386
You know what day it is today.

204
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,590
- There's voting. - Exactly.

205
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,626
Can you bring her psychological test
result...

206
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,666
after her academy?

207
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,350
Okay. Call me when you're done.

208
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,906
You had a tough time...

209
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,430
driving Seo-yoon around, Mom.

210
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,346
So let me give you a hug.

211
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,626
- Come here. - No thanks.

212
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,506
- Come here. - Stay away.

213
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,550
- Thank you. - I don't need it.

214
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,190
What are you doing?

215
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,230
Wait and see...

216
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,910
how this awful proposal changes.

217
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,350
I'll finish it before I leave tonight.

218
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,430
Nice.

219
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,630
It's a special day.

220
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,470
It'll be like an offering.

221
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,070
What? What day is it today?

222
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,269
You don't have to know.

223
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,466
Mr. Kim, Ms. Lee's showing what she's got.

224
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,986
Do you want to watch?

225
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,386
I'm sure she'll take care of it.

226
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,750
Keep it up.

227
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,746
Is everything all right with him?

228
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,986
I'm not sure.

229
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,710
He's returning from Director Yoon's office.

230
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,866
I'm Senior Manager Lee Jung-eun...

231
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,430
from Aaes' Marketing Team.

232
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,470
I have a document for the CEO of TR.

233
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,870
Pardon?

234
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,590
Can you...

235
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,550
please pass it on?

236
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,750
Wait.

237
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,870
Excuse me.

238
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,906
I couldn't meet the CEO.

239
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,426
I'll take responsibility for TR.

240
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,830
Are we good now?

241
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,706
Don't mess with my team.

242
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,586
How are you going to take responsibility?

243
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,630
Whether I have to take a break or quit,

244
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,030
I'll get out of your sight.

245
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,626
Isn't that what you wanted from the
beginning?

246
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,710
I never thought you'd run away.

247
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,710
Say whatever you want.

248
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,190
What?

249
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,150
You.

250
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,150
Have you ever wondered why it was so hard
to reach TR?

251
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,266
Did you think they'd meet you...

252
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,666
if you gave them a lame proposal in Aaes'
name?

253
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,426
Who said it was lame?

254
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,266
You think it's easy to persuade anyone...

255
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,586
in this field?

256
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,990
No desperation. No substance.

257
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,626
A proposal that only looks fancy on the
outside...

258
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,070
only for your performance?

259
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,866
I wouldn't read it either.

260
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,386
Watch your mouth.

261
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,670
Hey!

262
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,430
- Mommy. - Mom.

263
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,270
- Mom. - Mom.

264
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,910
I'm done.

265
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,346
They always come running during the break.

266
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,866
But how come they aren't here today?

267
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,150
I know.

268
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,986
I'll go find them.

269
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,546
No, don't worry.

270
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,546
Leave them. They'll come in due course.

271
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,870
Sit down.

272
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,430
Tae-rin.

273
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,546
Do you want to visit Class A together?

274
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,026
Why?

275
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,146
We'll be moving to Class A starting
tomorrow.

276
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,866
- Why bother? - Because...

277
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,310
I'm curious.

278
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,230
And Min-ho's there too.

279
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,710
Min-ho?

280
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,670
Oh, you want to see him.

281
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,026
Then you should've just told me.

282
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,706
No, that's not it.

283
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,390
No need to say it. Let's go.

284
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,146
Min-ho.

285
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,590
Don't.

286
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,470
It's break time. Come on.

287
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,830
I guess they can't talk in here.

288
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,710
Hey.

289
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,906
Are you allowed in here?

290
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,106
You'll get in trouble.

291
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,070
But it's recess.

292
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,510
Who cares? It's fine.

293
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,630
We're moving to Class A starting tomorrow.

294
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,350
Really? That's great.

295
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,626
Why is it so boring here during break time?

296
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,070
Let's go out and play.

297
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,506
Yes, let's go play with our grandmas.

298
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,186
Can I come with you?

299
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,750
Of course. Come with us.

300
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,346
You're holding hands.

301
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,150
- Hey. - Hey.

302
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,430
Mom?

303
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,510
Lee Min-ho. Where are you going?

304
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,150
Hello.

305
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,950
We're going to meet our grandmas.

306
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,550
Grandmas?

307
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,750
- Return to your seat. - Okay.

308
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,506
Is this your class?

309
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,666
- No. - No.

310
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,706
Return to your class.

311
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,030
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

312
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,550
How is...

313
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,510
Seo-yoon's test result?

314
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,550
Here it is. You should take a look.

315
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,990
This will be Seo-yoon's class from now on.

316
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,310
She has finally reached Class A.

317
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,186
Thanks to you, I got here too.

318
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,070
Tae-rin's supposed to be in Class A too.

319
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,030
She's a winner of the speech contest.

320
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,386
If they're going to move us, they should just
do it.

321
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,946
Why bother with a vote?

322
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,186
They said it was only a formality.

323
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,506
Don't worry about it.

324
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,830
Okay.

325
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,150
What's taking them so long?

326
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,910
I guess you haven't made up your mind yet.

327
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,750
Pardon?

328
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,826
I expected you to vote in favor.

329
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,350
What's that look on your face?

330
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,270
You don't want them, even though you're
friends?

331
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,910
No, that's not it.

332
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,226
If Mom's not greedy,

333
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,470
she can't secure her child's place.

334
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,270
Only four children can be in Class A.

335
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,829
And if Claire and Stella move up...

336
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,906
What...

337
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,946
What are you saying?

338
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,306
I'm saying anyone beneath Tommy...

339
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,550
can be changed.

340
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,186
If you plan to give Sophie's spot to Claire,

341
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,069
it won't matter though.

342
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,906
You know what?

343
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,710
They were waiting in Class A.

344
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,586
They're acting like...

345
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,150
they've already moved to Class A.

346
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,546
What's going on?

347
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,390
I thought it was only a formality.

348
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,030
Now, shall we begin voting?

349
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:27,110
Yes, let's get it over with.

350
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,350
She always gets on my nerves.

351
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,230
We'll count the votes, then.

352
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,710
Two are against it.

353
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,510
It's all right.

354
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,030
Things will get better from here.

355
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,030
It's two to one.

356
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,110
Only one vote remains.

357
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,309
If the vote is tied,

358
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,186
the casting vote...

359
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,750
will be mine as I'm the chairwoman.

360
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,430
- Of course. - One more thing.

361
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,910
Should Claire's mom lose this vote,

362
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,026
Claire won't just lose her spot in Class A...

363
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,069
but will be forced out of Big Parker.

364
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,390
But Tommy's mom...

365
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,950
What are you talking about?

366
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,309
Why? Don't you remember?

367
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,390
That's what you said.

368
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,550
I'll do whatever you ask. Anything.

369
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,710
If she doesn't make it this time,

370
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,985
I'll accept whatever you decide,

371
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,466
whether it's demoting her to Class C...

372
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,786
or making her quit entirely. So...

373
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,745
Please give her one more chance. I beg you.

374
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,069
Please.

375
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,186
Tommy's mom, that's...

376
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,950
What is it? Isn't that what you meant?

377
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,230
That's how I understood it...

378
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,990
and why I gave you your last chance.

379
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,829
Then, let's check the remaining vote.

380
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,030
It seems as though Jason's mom...

381
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,430
has issues with me.

382
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,750
Thank you, all.

383
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,190
As decided by the vote,

384
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,190
Claire will no longer study at Big Parker.

385
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,350
Stella's mom, what about you?

386
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,950
Forget it.

387
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,630
We're leaving too.

388
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,309
Of course. Now I know why Sophie's so
smart.

389
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,866
Jung-eun, wait.

390
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,069
- Let go of me. - Hear me out.

391
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,110
Shut it.

392
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,950
So what if I had voted yes?

393
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,950
She still wouldn't have gotten in.

394
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,309
Tommy's mom was against it anyway.

395
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,590
Still, how could you do this to me?

396
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,470
I never thought Claire would get this far.

397
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:10,829
I...

398
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,870
even quit my job to support So-ra.

399
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,266
But still, I only barely made it this far.

400
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,670
Why help me in the first place, then?

401
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,470
How can you be this cruel?

402
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,510
- Jung-eun. - Don't call me like that.

403
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,470
I'm disgusted to hear you say my name.

404
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,350
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,590
I'm sorry, Jung-eun,

406
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,190
but...

407
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,230
So-ra comes first.

408
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,309
I'm sure it's no different for you too.

409
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,626
So please... Just this once.

410
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,110
Just this once.

411
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,150
Are you playing me?

412
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,390
How does it feel to wake up from a dream?

413
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,870
What?

414
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,870
Did you think it'd be easy to climb up this
high?

415
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,510
You came to my house and begged...

416
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,870
which is why I gave you another chance.

417
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,546
You were delusional enough...

418
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,950
to dream of something bigger.

419
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,190
It was all in my head?

420
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,426
Why put it to a vote, then?

421
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,910
You should've just kicked me out then and
there.

422
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,270
Do you want to know why?

423
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,030
Now you know.

424
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,750
That's why Seo-yoon can't be in Class A.

425
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,590
- How... - Don't tell me...

426
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,590
you want us to be family or something.

427
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,630
I'd rather not be.

428
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,670
Then,

429
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,866
is my mother the reason Seo-yoon...

430
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,230
So I suggest...

431
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,030
you take this up with your mother.

432
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,550
Now, get out.

433
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,950
You, your daughter,

434
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,790
and Ms. Yoon.

435
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,350
Disappear from here.

436
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,070
"Ms. Yoon"?

437
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,190
Ju-hee?

438
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,790
Right?

439
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,910
Song Ju-hee.

440
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,470
Today,

441
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,226
I quit my job at the school.

442
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,910
Is it because of her?

443
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,630
Why are you quitting, not her?

444
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,670
Why, because of someone I don't even
know,

445
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,030
can't I go to the school I want?

446
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,630
Could it be...

447
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,110
Don't tell me it was you.

448
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,830
Song Ju-hee from Eunhae Girls' Middle
School.

449
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,990
That's you, isn't it?

450
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,270
Darn it!

451
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,896
(Mom)

452
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:38,835
Where are you?

453
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:41,439
I was just about to call you.

454
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:42,755
I have something to say,

455
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:43,999
so I'll see you at home.

456
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,439
No.

457
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,159
I'll come to you.

458
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:09,039
Seriously...

459
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:44,719
You got here early.

460
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:52,999
I have the report on Seo-yoon's mental state.

461
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:55,039
How is she?

462
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,119
It's not good.

463
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,155
Jung-eun,

464
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,479
it'll be best for her to quit the academy.

465
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:05,719
Why?

466
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:08,399
I discussed it with Dr. Park,

467
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,755
and Seo-yoon seems to have developed...

468
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:13,199
an obsession over her grades.

469
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,519
Remove her from all the extra classes for
now...

470
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:17,915
and let her get treated.

471
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:19,959
She'll get better with therapy.

472
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,719
Did something happen to you today?

473
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,879
Seo-yoon...

474
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,755
can't attend the academy anymore.

475
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,079
Why not?

476
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:37,999
Did she...

477
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:45,359
Did she not make it into Class A?

478
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:47,839
That's right.

479
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:49,959
She didn't make it.

480
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:54,995
It's for the better.

481
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,635
She can take a break...

482
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:57,795
and focus on getting better.

483
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,519
I'll do my best to help her.

484
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,319
Are you sure dropping out is for her own
sake?

485
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,515
Wh-What on earth are you saying?

486
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,359
How could you be in the dark?

487
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:13,639
Don't you know who caused this?

488
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,239
Jung-eun, use words I can understand.

489
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:19,399
Whatever.

490
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:21,399
Just like you did to me,

491
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,555
do whatever you please however you see fit.

492
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:26,195
Don't use Seo-yoon as an excuse!

493
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:27,799
As an excuse?

494
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:29,159
You...

495
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:37,395
I don't know why you're on my case,

496
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,875
but Seo-yoon's treatment is my priority.

497
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,155
How can you date at your granddaughter's
academy?

498
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,919
With Tommy's grandfather too!

499
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,919
- I... - Thanks to you, Mom,

500
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:50,075
we were kicked out...

501
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:51,835
not only from Class A, but from Big Parker.

502
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,279
Are you happy now?

503
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:56,359
So date all you want, darn it!

504
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:59,399
But...

505
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:02,195
Jung-eun.

506
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,399
Let me talk to Tommy's mom.

507
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:08,999
Gosh, no. Don't.

508
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:10,835
I can't believe I had you care for Seo-yoon...

509
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:12,279
after what you did to me.

510
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,279
I was out of my mind.

511
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,155
Was ruining my future not enough?

512
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,119
You had to ruin my daughter's too?

513
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:21,359
Lee Jung-eun.

514
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:23,959
Tommy's mom was that girl.

515
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,879
Song Ju-hee.

516
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:28,155
You quit your job because of her, and I
couldn't...

517
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:29,715
go to the foreign language high school!

518
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:31,159
Have you forgotten that?

519
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:33,039
How...

520
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:37,759
And now, you're doing the same to my
daughter.

521
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,639
Well, Ju-hee was ill at the time.

522
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:44,119
You...

523
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:47,399
This is how you always are.

524
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,959
Other kids are always your priority.

525
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:53,039
What about me, though?

526
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,159
What about my Seo-yoon?

527
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:57,999
Don't you see my scars?

528
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:00,759
You can't even see that your daughter is
hurting,

529
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:03,359
so who are you to treat others?

530
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,039
I...

531
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,959
You said...

532
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:11,399
You said you were all right.

533
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:16,479
Never have I been okay.

534
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:24,839
Is it over if I say I'm good?

535
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,719
How is it that you never asked me?

536
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:34,999
"Are you really okay?"

537
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:41,719
So that I wasn't a burden.

538
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:47,279
So that you'd have it easier as a single mom,

539
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:48,755
I didn't say anything.

540
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:50,279
Actually, I couldn't.

541
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:52,399
Not even once.

542
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:57,399
I'm done keeping it in.

543
00:31:57,939 --> 00:32:00,319
If things are rough, I'll say so.

544
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,999
Jung-eun.

545
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:05,759
I...

546
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,839
didn't know you were hurting, and I'm sorry.

547
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:13,319
As if a belated apology would do me any
good.

548
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:30,919
Even now, you won't ask me if I'm all right.

549
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,199
Today has been the roughest...

550
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:37,919
and the most painful day.

551
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:40,479
One where I'm closest to losing my mind.

552
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:43,959
You know,

553
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,519
living as your daughter...

554
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,719
has been painfully challenging.

555
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:54,239
Don't call...

556
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:56,719
either me or Seo-yoon.

557
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:19,159
Oh, no.

558
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:24,879
What do I do?

559
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:31,519
My gosh, what do I do?

560
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:37,999
Mom's the reason.

561
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,519
It's all her fault.

563
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:10,995
Ji-a.

564
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,479
- Goodness! - Sorry I'm late.

565
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,839
- Have a good one. - Sure.

568
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:47,639
Do you have any idea...

569
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,479
how scared I was that day?

570
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:56,555
Like always, I never said a thing.

571
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:57,999
(Mom, it rained a lot today.)

572
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:05,679
Mom,

573
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,999
it rained a lot today.

574
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,835
Although I got a bit wet,

575
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,719
I made it home just fine.

576
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:17,279
I studied hard while waiting for you too.

577
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:19,799
Don't worry about me.

578
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:22,159
I'm tired, so I'll go to bed first.

579
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,199
I love you, Mom. From Jung-eun.

580
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:54,479
Gosh.

Mom...

What do I do?

583
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:11,515
What now?

584
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:14,999
What have I done?

585
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:35,558
Father.

586
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:39,399
That is where Min-ho studies.

587
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:41,879
I'm worried others might find out.

588
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:45,315
I handled it on my end,

589
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:47,078
- so... - You handled it?

590
00:36:48,298 --> 00:36:49,435
Were you going to continue your
relationship...

591
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,835
with Seo-yoon's grandmother?

592
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:52,754
I didn't know it required your permission.

593
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,315
Don't you think about Min-ho?

594
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,035
You should ask yourselves that.

595

Father.

596
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:58,754
I'm his mother.

597
00:36:58,778 --> 00:37:00,919
Does he seem fine to you?

598
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:02,915
Because of the stress...

599
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:04,719
Academic stress...

600
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:06,759
is what everyone experiences.

601
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:10,279
You two...

602
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:15,639
Your only goal is to make him your prized
possession.

603
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:17,639
From here on out,

604
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:20,679
don't go to Min-ho's academy.

605
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,639
If that's what you want,

606
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,719
I'll do that.

607
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,519
In return,

608
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,598
you're to stay out of my business too.

609
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:40,078
- Father, please. - Father!

610
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:40,039
I had something to give back.

611
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:55,839
I can't accept this.

612
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:59,399
- Ms. Yoon... - I'm sorry.

613
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:05,319
Please...

614
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:09,239
Don't contact me.

615
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:27,999
You scared me.

616
00:39:28,419 --> 00:39:29,435
My goodness.

617
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:31,519
What are you doing with the lights off, Jung-
eun?

618
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:36,719
Get out of the house. I don't want to see you.

619
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,115
Jung-eun. Please hear me out.

620
00:39:41,139 --> 00:39:43,115
I'll take care of the money problem soon.

621
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:44,959
I'm going to raise Seo-yoon.

622
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,879
I don't need you or my mom.

623
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:52,279
So get out.

624
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:55,959
Dad.

625
00:39:57,379 --> 00:39:59,234
Seo-yoon. You must be scared. Come to
Daddy.

626
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:00,919
Don't call her.

627
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:02,999
Mom.

628
00:40:03,258 --> 00:40:05,439
Don't get in the way of her future. Get out
now.

629
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,119
Dad...

630
00:40:19,899 --> 00:40:21,239
My baby.

631
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:23,239
It's okay, Seo-yoon.

632
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:25,959
It will just be the two of us now.

633
00:40:26,379 --> 00:40:28,078
No, Mom.

634
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:30,119
I don't want that, Mom.

635
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:34,319
It will be all right.

636
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:38,234
I would have kicked you out too.

637
00:40:38,258 --> 00:40:39,155
It's not some chump change we're
talking about.

638
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:40,399
Oh, dear.

639
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:42,439
So 200 million won?

640
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:46,439
Why do I keep messing things up?

641
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,115
You're not so bad.

642
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:49,919
Gosh, you know how I am.

643
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,475
Hey.

644
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:57,199
But of all the juniorsl've trained, you are...

645
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,959
I'm what?

646
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:05,159
You're the kindest.

647
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:08,319
Gosh, you might not be the smartest worker.

648
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:09,795
But your wife and your daughter are...

649
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:11,279
the center of your world.

650
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:13,679
That's all wives need from their husbands.

651
00:41:15,258 --> 00:41:16,835
That's why I'm putting up...

652
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:18,475
with your drunk antics at this late hour...

653
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:20,679
even though you moved to a
different company.

654
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:22,955
Come here, you.

655
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:25,239
Gosh, stop it. That's gross. Sit back down.

656
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:27,319
Drink up.

657
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,119
Don't touch my hand.

658
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:37,399
- Seo-yoon. - Yes?

659
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:40,274
You'll go to a different academy now.

660
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,558
Why?

661
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,279
We'll go to a much better academy than Big
Parker.

662
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:47,919
So you don't have to worry about a thing.
Okay?

663
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:51,239
I'll come and pick you up later tonight.

664
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:53,959
What about Grandma?

665
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:57,435
I'll come and pick you up. You don't want
that?

666
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:59,315
It's not that I don't want you to come.

667
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,919
But it's just that Grandma has been
picking me up.

668
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:08,555
From now on, I'm going to do everything for
you.

669
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,479
No. I'm going to call Grandma.

670
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,315
No. You can't call her.

671
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:14,839
Don't call her.

672
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:16,875
How do you delete a number on this?

673
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,001
(Grandma)

674
00:42:19,258 --> 00:42:20,955
Why are you deleting Grandma's number?

675
00:42:20,979 --> 00:42:22,239
Why?

676
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:25,519
Hey, Seo-yoon. Your mom is dropping you off
today.

677
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:28,319
- Hello. - Hello.

678
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,479
For the time being, Seo-yoon...

679
00:42:30,979 --> 00:42:33,879
will stay at preschool for the entire day.

680
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,359
Sure.

681
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,799
I guess she's not going to the
academy anymore.

682
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:39,319
Right.

683
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:40,919
Let's go.

684
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:46,839
Seo-yoon, shall we go inside?

685
00:42:54,298 --> 00:42:56,035
All right. Let's take off your shoes.

686
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:57,719
Put on your indoor shoes.

687
00:43:01,732 --> 00:43:04,833
(Searching for traditions)

688
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:07,598
Seo-yoon, what's wrong?

689
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:11,639
I can't remember my grandmother's number.

690
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:13,759
What was it?

691
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:51,839
Is it over if I say I'm good?

692
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:55,479
How is it that you never asked me?

693
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,399
You know,

694
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:01,999
living as your daughter...

695
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,239
has been painfully challenging.

696
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:51,839
How long do we have to wait for the level
test?

697
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,039
A month?

698
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,719
Is there a way to move it up?

699
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:03,879
I see. Okay. I understand.

700
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:11,875
Hello.

701
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:13,999
I have a daughter who will start
elementary school.

702
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,395
When is the earliest date...

703
00:45:16,419 --> 00:45:18,959
for a level test?

704
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:22,835
Oh, right. She used to study at Big Parker.

705
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,999
She won the Grand Award at the
speech contest.

706
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:29,999
I see.

707
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:34,598
Okay.

708
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:38,435
It sure feels great...

709
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:40,078
to get rid of those nuisances.

710
00:45:42,298 --> 00:45:44,039
This was long overdue.

711
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:49,759
But what's up with you two? Why the long
faces?

712
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:55,475
Tommy's mom. This way.

713
00:45:55,499 --> 00:45:56,759
- Hello. - Gosh.

714
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,799
You're here.

715
00:46:02,298 --> 00:46:03,955
My goodness. What's gotten into her?

716
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:07,319
I'm really sorry about what happened that day.

717
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:09,959
I'm sorry.

718
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:12,159
Why make a mistake to apologize for in the
first place?

719
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:14,719
- I shouldglue up that mouth of yours. -
What?

720
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:18,234
I heard you. I understand.

721
00:46:18,258 --> 00:46:19,355
Ms. Song.

722
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:21,995
Everyone makes mistakes in life.

723
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:23,355
Right?

724
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:25,519
- Mistakes? - Yes.

725
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,399
You made the right decision.

726
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:31,795
Excuse me?

727
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:33,919
Thanks to that, your daughter can keep her
spot.

728
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:36,995
Right.

729
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:40,119
You were her friend but stabbed her in the
back.

730
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:42,075
- You. - Yes?

731
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,558
Watch your mouth.

732
00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:45,155
Oh, right.

733
00:46:45,179 --> 00:46:47,595
Didn't Jason barely pass the test to join
Class A?

734
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:50,595
Ms. Song. I must have lost my mind that day.

735
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:52,274
- Please. - Once a traitor,

736
00:46:52,298 --> 00:46:53,999
always a traitor.

737
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:56,479
- Right? - You little...

738
00:46:57,179 --> 00:46:58,519
Right.

739
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:02,399
I like ambitious people like you.

740
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,515
Now that I know what you're capable of,

741
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:07,399
you will be compensated without a doubt.

742
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:10,195
Pardon?

743
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:13,679
There will be a notice about openings in
Class B soon.

744
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:17,319
Jason'smom used to handle that.

745
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:22,119
Starting now, you'll be handling it.

746
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:26,199
You can make a few recommendations too.

747
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:29,558
Right.

748
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:34,078
Claire came to Big Parker with your
recommendation.

749
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:37,558
- Right. - Now that you've experienced what
it's like,

750
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:39,679
you won't make the same mistake twice.

751
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:44,119
Be careful whom you bring in this time
around.

752
00:47:46,219 --> 00:47:48,519
How could you recommend a family like that?

753
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:50,598
I guess you're a bad judge of character.

754
00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:54,439
Like attracts like?

755
00:47:57,859 --> 00:47:59,199
Excuse me.

756
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:00,959
I need to get going.

757
00:48:04,778 --> 00:48:06,119
Unbelievable.

758
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:13,399
I must have lost my mind.

759
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:16,754
I knew it.

760
00:48:16,778 --> 00:48:20,035
Your head is clearly more suitable for
cracking eggs.

761
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:21,799
Come here. Let me crack one with your
head.

762
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:23,795
- Grandma. - You!

763
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:24,915
- Look at you. - Grandma.

764
00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:26,555
Kid, you can try all you want to run away.

765
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,274
- I can easily grab you. - Grandma.

766
00:48:28,298 --> 00:48:29,315
This isn't fair.

767
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,234
You can't use force on me.

768
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:33,399
If you don't think it's fair, grow up.

769
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,195
If Seo-yoon were here, we could'vetaken
you down.

770
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:38,195
My gosh. I do miss Seo-yoon and her family.

771
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,875
We're used to seeing them every day.

772
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:41,635
Not seeing them is making me feel lonely for
sure.

773
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:43,635
- I'm sure you feel the same way. - Yes.

774
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:46,119
I'm thrilled that I don't have to go to the
academy.

775
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,035
But it's a pity that I can't see Seo-yoon.

776
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,399
Same here.

777
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,799
Hey, why is the professor calling me?

778
00:48:58,179 --> 00:49:00,319
I can't get in touch with Ms. Yoon.

779
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,159
I'm sure you know where I can find her.

780
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:05,715
I really don't know where she is. I swear.

781
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:07,679
Please help me. Tell me where she is.

782
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:10,519
She made sure that I wouldn't tell...

783
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,399
Come on.

784
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:15,399
So you did meet with her, right?

785
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,279
Where did she say she was going?

786
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:20,315
- Oh, dear. - Ma'am.

787
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,274
You can ma'am me, but I can't tell you even
in death.

788
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:25,719
Then pretend that you're dead and just tell
him.

789
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:29,075
Please tell me where she is.

790
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,075
Sir, should we all go on a trip together like
before?

791
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,159
Hey, she's not there. Never.

792
00:49:34,699 --> 00:49:36,959
Where was that?

793
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,319
- Could she be at... - Dear me.

794
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:45,879
I don't know. I give up.

795
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,279
That's it.

796
00:49:50,179 --> 00:49:51,919
Thank you, Tae-rin.

797
00:50:04,299 --> 00:50:05,559
Seo-yoon.

798
00:50:05,779 --> 00:50:07,439
Why are you so quiet today?

799
00:50:07,699 --> 00:50:09,599
You didn't say a word on the way home.

800
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:14,239
Are you mad at me?

801
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:18,159
Grandma is my BFF.

802
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:19,999
"BFF"?

803
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:21,395
What's that?

804
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:24,599
See? You don't even know what it is.

805
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:26,319
I...

806
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,119
My gosh.

807
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:33,239
Seo-yoon. Wait up. We should go home
together.

808
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:35,599
Seo-yoon.

809
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:39,239
- Hello. - Hello.

810
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:41,279
What are you doing here?

811
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:44,119
Then you should have answered your phone.

812
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:46,559
I have nothing to say to you.

813
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:49,119
- Let's go. - My gosh, hold on.

814
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:53,319
Here.

815
00:50:54,939 --> 00:50:56,319
What's this?

816
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,850
Here.

817
00:51:02,414 --> 00:51:03,794
What's this?

818
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,217
Number seven, please.

819
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:12,377
Number seven, please.

820
00:51:19,597 --> 00:51:21,773
- Seven! - The last number is...

821
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:22,817
(Myeongseong Elementary School)

822
00:51:23,557 --> 00:51:25,577
- Number 17. - Here.

823
00:51:29,357 --> 00:51:30,813
I'm number 17.

824
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,537
I believe this is the ball you saw...

825
00:51:32,597 --> 00:51:34,257
on the day of the draw.

826
00:51:36,277 --> 00:51:37,573
Someone wrote this post...

827
00:51:37,597 --> 00:51:39,297
a few days after the draw.

828
00:51:39,557 --> 00:51:40,613
But oddly enough,

829
00:51:40,637 --> 00:51:42,777
it was deleted the next day.

830
00:51:43,357 --> 00:51:45,373
This is the screenshotl took that day.

831
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:46,973
("An Exposé of Admissions Fraud at
Myeongseong")

832
00:51:46,997 --> 00:51:48,537
As you can gather from the post,

833
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:51,057
the whistleblowermust be someone from the
inside.

834
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:00,319
(Background)

835
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:07,657
(Carl Sagan)

("Pale Blue Dot")

837
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:12,079
("Pale Blue Dot")

838
00:52:14,037 --> 00:52:15,049
(It was first discovered...)

839
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:19,997

840
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,845

(Pale blue dot)

843
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,685
(Yu So-yeon)

844
00:52:40,037 --> 00:52:41,093
I found her.

845
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:43,092
(Pale blue dot 1209: Yu So-yeon)

846
00:52:43,757 --> 00:52:45,333
- Hello. - Hello, Seo-yoon.

847
00:52:45,357 --> 00:52:47,253
- Hello. - Go inside.

848
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:49,257
Seo-yoon.

849
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:50,817
Bye.

850
00:52:52,957 --> 00:52:54,257
- Bye. - Bye.

851
00:53:03,677 --> 00:53:05,377
Is this Myeongseong Elementary School?

852
00:53:06,477 --> 00:53:09,777
Is there a teacher named Ms. Yu So-yeon?

853
00:53:34,197 --> 00:53:36,293
We spoke on the phone earlier.

854
00:53:36,317 --> 00:53:37,657
My name is Lee Jung-eun.

855
00:53:43,157 --> 00:53:44,817
Not today.

856
00:53:44,877 --> 00:53:46,493
I have somewhere to be in the afternoon.

857
00:53:46,517 --> 00:53:48,253
What about the report to Director Yoon
today?

858
00:53:48,277 --> 00:53:50,697
Things aren't looking good. You could lose
your job.

859
00:53:50,877 --> 00:53:52,817
Even if I do, there's nothingl can do.

860
00:53:53,117 --> 00:53:54,617
I really have to take the day off.

861
00:53:55,437 --> 00:53:56,937
Go home after the report then.

862
00:53:57,437 --> 00:53:59,097
I met with your husband.

863
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:00,773
I can totally understand how you feel now.

864
00:54:00,797 --> 00:54:02,417
- But you still have to work. - My gosh.

865
00:54:02,677 --> 00:54:04,457
This isn't about that.

866
00:54:05,277 --> 00:54:07,053
Well, I'll get going.

867
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,377
Ms. Lee.

868
00:54:08,477 --> 00:54:09,777
Ms. Lee.

869
00:54:09,877 --> 00:54:11,697
My goodness.

870
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:16,293
Should we schedule the level test...

871
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:17,733
sometime next week for Class B?

872
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:20,057
Why are you scheduling the level test?

873
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,797
Becausel've always scheduled the level test.

874
00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:24,337
That's my business.

875
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,516
I thought you were taking care of that.

876
00:54:30,856 --> 00:54:33,596
Well, recently, I've been...

877
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:37,996
Jung-eun.

878
00:54:38,096 --> 00:54:40,072
- What's she doing here? - I thought her kid
left.

879
00:54:40,096 --> 00:54:41,676
Why are you here?

880
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:46,076
Do you still have business here?

881
00:54:46,256 --> 00:54:47,512
Yes.

882
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:50,236
You took Seo-yoon's place, and I'm here to
get it back.

883
00:54:50,736 --> 00:54:52,112
Get what back?

884
00:54:52,136 --> 00:54:53,272
- What's going on? - I don't know.

885
00:54:53,296 --> 00:54:54,712
- What is this? - What's she doing here?

886
00:54:54,736 --> 00:54:57,392
Tell the receptionist to get her out of here.

887
00:54:57,416 --> 00:54:58,352
Okay.

888
00:54:58,376 --> 00:55:00,196
You'll want to listen to this.

889
00:55:01,976 --> 00:55:03,552
What scene are you going to cause this
time?

890
00:55:03,576 --> 00:55:05,676
You're the one who caused a scene...

891
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:08,036
on the day of the draw at Myeongseong
Elementary.

892
00:55:08,776 --> 00:55:10,912
- What? - You rigged the draw.

893
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:12,236
- On the day of the draw? - She rigged what?

894
00:55:12,456 --> 00:55:13,796
- She rigged the draw. - My gosh.

895
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:16,356
What nonsense are you talking about?

896
00:55:16,776 --> 00:55:19,316
Have you lost your mind after getting kicked
out?

897
00:55:24,936 --> 00:55:26,872
- My goodness. - Why does she have that?

898
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:27,952
- Isn't that the ball? - What?

899
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:29,632
- Is that the ball? - How does she have that?

900
00:55:29,656 --> 00:55:31,112
- Why does she have it? - My gosh.

901
00:55:31,136 --> 00:55:32,192
Goodness. How did that happen?

902
00:55:32,216 --> 00:55:33,716
What's this?

903
00:55:34,376 --> 00:55:35,836
Take a good look at it.

904
00:55:37,576 --> 00:55:40,276
I asked you what it was.

905
00:55:40,576 --> 00:55:42,152
It came from a trash can in your house.

906
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:43,676
You should know what it is.

907
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,476
No.

908
00:55:48,976 --> 00:55:50,316
No.

909
00:56:00,616 --> 00:56:02,036
Do you have proof?

910
00:56:02,096 --> 00:56:03,312
Proof?

911
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:05,516
Can you prove your accusation?

912
00:56:06,936 --> 00:56:08,272
How dare you accuse me...

913
00:56:08,296 --> 00:56:09,956
of doing something so cheap and
disgraceful?

914
00:56:10,896 --> 00:56:12,156
Get out.

915
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:15,396
Get out of here right now.

916
00:56:38,216 --> 00:56:39,476
You...

917
00:56:40,016 --> 00:56:42,316
Lee Min-ho! Pull yourself together!

918
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,196
Can you make sure he wins first place or
not?

919
00:56:47,576 --> 00:56:49,396
I'm sure he can, ma'am.

920
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,076
It ends here.

921
00:56:51,336 --> 00:56:52,716
You're dismissed.

922
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:55,792
I only hired you for a high price because...

923
00:56:55,816 --> 00:56:57,676
you were becoming a teacher at
Myeongseong Elementary.

924
00:56:59,656 --> 00:57:01,276
I'm sure you know who she is.

925
00:57:06,776 --> 00:57:08,076
What is this?

926
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:10,032
Did you join hands to threaten me...

927
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:11,996
because you were both kicked out by me?

928
00:57:12,856 --> 00:57:14,552
How dare you plot against me?

929
00:57:14,576 --> 00:57:16,556
You'll deny it to the end?

930
00:57:18,296 --> 00:57:19,716
Then how about this?

931
00:57:27,296 --> 00:57:29,676
- What's this? - You're curious, aren't you?

932
00:57:30,456 --> 00:57:31,836
We'll show you...

933
00:57:32,576 --> 00:57:35,236
the dirty act you committed on the day of the
draw.

934
00:57:41,456 --> 00:57:44,156
Then we can all watch it here.

935
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:49,956
No.

936
00:58:27,038 --> 00:58:30,895
(Mother and Mom)

937
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:32,818
Your son can no longer attend our academy.

938
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,521
Ma'am.

939
00:58:33,545 --> 00:58:35,645
It's game over for you.

940
00:58:36,785 --> 00:58:39,281
What are you doing here all alone?

941
00:58:39,305 --> 00:58:40,805
Come with me.

942
00:58:40,945 --> 00:58:42,365
I'll wait for you.

943
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:44,125
I missed out on so much of your life...

944
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:45,925
because I was busy with work.

945
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:47,649
Now, I'll be there for everything.

946
00:58:47,869 --> 00:58:51,005
Mom. I feel sick.

947
00:58:51,029 --> 00:58:53,929
Grandma has to help him.

948
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:56,169
Jinny!

949
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:57,729
Stop!
