1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,439
For the time being, I will play the role of "president."

2
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:10,370
I'll play the president...

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,713
so that the employees feel they can confidently follow me.

4
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:18,395
And then, one day...

5
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:23,101
I hope to become a president they genuinely want to follow.

6
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:28,467
Why are you telling me all this?

7
00:00:29,642 --> 00:00:32,796
Because you're my secretary.

8
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:48,936
Hey.

9
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:51,467
Let me see your phone.

10
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:54,472
No way...

11
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,018
Can I really do this?

12
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:05,712
You can do it.

13
00:01:05,826 --> 00:01:08,475
I will not run from my destiny.

14
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:11,771
For the employees, for the company...

15
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:14,329
and for myself...

16
00:01:14,727 --> 00:01:16,555
I will give it my all.

17
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:18,956
You are unqualified to be the president's secretary.

18
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:20,689
But...

19
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:24,362
you are qualified to be *my* secretary.

20
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:58,453
Mr. President.

21
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:01,907
You'll catch a cold like that.

22
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:09,566
*He must be exhausted.*

23
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:16,830
*His sleeping face is just too cute.*

24
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,911
*So divine.*

25
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:24,288
*No. This is wrong.*

26
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:30,699
*But... just a little peek won't hurt, right?*

27
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:49,902
*I can't believe I get to gaze at my fave's sleeping face.*

28
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:53,601
*It's like a dream.*

29
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:59,037
*A dream...*

30
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:03,433
*A dream...*

31
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:06,741
Hey, are you okay?

32
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:09,837
You can't fall asleep. Wake up!

33
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,785
I chose it on purpose.

34
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:43,218
*My... my fave's head is resting on my shoulder.*

35
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:50,112
*Is this a dream or reality?*

36
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,126
Aaaaaaah...!

37
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:04,005
*I didn't get any sleep at all.*

38
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:21,600
*That must be Shun's resolve.*

39
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:24,215
*As his secretary, I have to do my best, too.*

40
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:27,314
*Alright.*

41
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,235
Excuse me.

42
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,274
So... so dazzling.

43
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:00,396
Let's pause for a moment.

44
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:03,729
*That outfit is from the 2020 stage play "Prince of Versailles," right?*

45
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:05,931
*He's exuding all the elegance and melancholy of a prince.*

46
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,329
*The fans all praised him as a "walking work of art."*

47
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:14,348
We didn't have time for a fitting for the photobook shoot next week.

48
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:16,246
We got permission first.

49
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:17,845
Photobook?

50
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:22,476
The theme is "2.5D popular stage play costumes with a modern twist."

51
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:24,970
It's targeted at his hardcore fans.

52
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:26,609
*I HAVE to buy this.*

53
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:29,816
*But I decided to be a proper secretary for Shun's sake.*

54
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:31,575
*I can't do this.*

55
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:34,257
Almost done. Wait for me.

56
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,362
Yes, sir.

57
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,435
*He probably didn't notice me here this morning, right?*

58
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:50,924
Sorry to interrupt your fitting. Regarding today's schedule:

59
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:54,806
At 11 a.m., the Senior Managing Director of Yotsuba Bank will be visiting.

60
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:57,688
At 12 p.m., a lunch meeting with ODA Design.

61
00:06:57,688 --> 00:07:00,066
At 3 p.m., you have an interview at the Akasaka studio...

62
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:02,834
...for the fashion magazine "AFD JAPAN."

63
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:03,955
Got it.

64
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,694
Lately, "AFD" has a large young readership.

65
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,894
It's a very popular magazine.

66
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:12,478
I emailed the questions and draft answers to you yesterday.

67
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,518
I've also printed a hard copy.

68
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,916
Thanks.

69
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,036
I'll take my leave then.

70
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:22,079
By the way, Shun, why didn't you go home last night?

71
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,600
I fell asleep at the office.

72
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:26,019
Huh? You didn't even shower?

73
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:29,128
I found a good sauna nearby online and went there.

74
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:32,244
A sauna you found online? Online...

75
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:34,241
Shun, that's great.

76
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:37,012
*Huh? Found it online this morning?*

77
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,180
*Does that mean a public sauna, not a members-only one?*

78
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:43,447
*Is that really okay?*

79
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:48,054
(My Fave is My Boss: Full Throttle)

80
00:08:57,645 --> 00:09:00,106
Great. Very handsome.

81
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,106
That's wonderful.

82
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,455
*He's so cool just by standing there.*

83
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:08,055
*His presence is overwhelming.*

84
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:13,845
(Lorenzo Madini, Editor-in-Chief of "AFD JAPAN")
As expected of an actor. You have a real presence.

85
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:16,008
You're too kind.

86
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:17,877
Nice!

87
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:21,925
Nice...

88
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:27,541
Yes, we are dedicated to providing high-quality materials and products.

89
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:32,050
We will further expand into overseas markets.

90
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:36,680
Additionally, I plan to challenge new fields...

91
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:39,014
...to be trusted by society...
-Your answers...

92
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,097
are too by-the-book.

93
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:43,664
What?

94
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:50,030
I think TAKASHIRO's style is a bit conservative.

95
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:54,103
After all, the former president was on the older side.

96
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,125
I don't believe age is an issue.

97
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,158
It's almost time to wrap up.

98
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,179
We're already over the scheduled interview time.

99
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:12,674
In that case, could I take a few more shots for the cover?

100
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,763
-The cover? -Yes.

101
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:16,862
Since he was an actor,

102
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,460
he's very appealing.

103
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,539
*Being on the cover would definitely help with publicity.*

104
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:27,568
*I hope he agrees, but considering Shun's feelings...*

105
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,583
I understand. What kind of pose?

106
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,354
Please come over here.

107
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:41,553
Please strike a 2.5D stage play pose.

108
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,259
I even brought a sword.

109
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:47,752
Let's do it.

110
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:53,821
Great... so cool.

111
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,556
Please look at the camera.

112
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,333
That's nice.

113
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:00,626
So cool.

114
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:03,618
That sword really suits you.

115
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:06,878
Mr. President, please look at the camera.

116
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:09,555
I don't want to mix my work as president and actor.

117
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:12,660
You should be using your actor identity.

118
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,644
It's your advantage.

119
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:18,644
Using your entertainment career for publicity...

120
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:22,867
is the only thing you can do right now.

121
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:26,823
Our time is up. Please excuse us.

122
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:30,738
Because I scheduled things too tightly,

123
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:32,380
we cannot extend our time any further.

124
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:35,699
This was my failure as a secretary. My apologies.

125
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,362
Mr. President, let's go.

126
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,998
How frustrating.

127
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,769
(Milk)

128
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:06,816
*This situation is pretty bad, no matter how you look at it.*

129
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:10,155
*But, thank goodness there aren't many other customers.*

130
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:12,067
*Is it because of the time?*

131
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,284
That was refreshing.

132
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:20,148
*Ugh, so cute.*

133
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:32,121
*My fave, fresh from a bath.*

134
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:34,695
*This is super rare.*

135
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,145
*I... I can't believe I get to see Shun with wet hair.*

136
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:42,791
*It's on par with his debut movie when he rescued the heroine from the sea...*

137
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,833
*...shirtless and with wet hair.*

138
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,539
*Can I really see this for free?*

139
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,957
Mr. President, please don't be like that.

140
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,569
You'll be recognized.

141
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:03,827
Right.

142
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:08,378
But... there's no one else here.

143
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,301
*True.*

144
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:17,450
I sometimes come here when I want a change of pace.

145
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,239
Sorry for dragging you here all of a sudden.

146
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,178
Not at all.

147
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,467
Oh, right.

148
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,240
Here, for you.

149
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:28,554
Thank you.

150
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:37,732
-Ms. Minami. -Yes?

151
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:40,738
Thank you.

152
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,633
You were protecting me earlier, weren't you?

153
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:47,267
You should be using your actor identity.
