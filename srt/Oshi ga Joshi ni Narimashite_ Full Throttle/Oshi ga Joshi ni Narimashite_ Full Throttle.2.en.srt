00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:02,751


2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:06,103
I've found the star of my life.

3
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:09,569
There it is! The unexpected wink from tsundere Shun!

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:10,750
Mr. President?

5
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:12,624
Mr. President...

6
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:14,739
-Mr. President! -Mr. President?

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,108
My idol... is the president's grandson?

8
00:00:18,134 --> 00:00:19,305
President?

9
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,560
Someone! There's a suspicious person here!

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,318
I'm not a suspicious person.

11
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:28,787
I am so incredibly sorry.

12
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:32,615
Mr. President, I'm sorry about the other day as well.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,397
At the hospital, I mistook you for...

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,408
I'm not the president yet, am I?

15
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:44,515
I forgot. I'm sorry.

16
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,937
I'll be taking my leave.

17
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:56,701
No way...

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,435
No, I must have misheard.

19
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:01,986
No, I definitely misheard. He even said he's not the president yet...

20
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:05,449
Wait, so he's going to be?

21
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:06,515
But...

22
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:08,232
Hey, have you heard?

23
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:09,596
Heard what?

24
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:13,682
The rumor that the actor Shun Himuro is going to be our new president...

25
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,541
Shun Himuro is becoming our president?

26
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:19,019
Minami-senpai, what are you doing?

27
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,329
-Nothing. -Did you say Shun Himuro?

28
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:25,518
Oh my god...

29
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:28,067
Minami-senpai isn't interested in celebrities, right?

30
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:28,890
That's right.

31
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,069
No... I'm SUPER interested.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,164
If Shun becomes the president, and I'm the president's secretary...

33
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:40,759
How could I be so presumptuous? Absolutely not.

34
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,246
Wait, what about his acting career?

35
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:45,465
Right, that must be why he canceled the stage play.

36
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:49,667
I can't accept this. They're still going to sell his calendar for next year, right?

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,326
I'm such an idiot... Why did I do that?

38
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:59,864
Everyone's already freaking out and it's just a rumor.

39
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,820
But you're really not interested?

40
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:05,518
Yeah.

41
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:06,737
Really?

42
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:08,139
Really.

43
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,113
-But it's Shun Himuro! -You're so annoying!

44
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:14,277
I'm not interested in some Shun Himuro guy!

45
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:23,226
I am so very sorry.

46
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:35,089
This hasn't been announced publicly yet...

47
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:37,920
but Mr. Shun Himuro is, in fact, the president's grandson.

48
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:40,315
He is slated to become the next president.

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,521
I've messed up again.

50
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:48,413
What am I going to do if Shun really becomes the president?

51
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:51,894
Ai.

52
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:54,192
Ms. Sato.

53
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:57,476
(Takako Sato, Head of Sales at TAKASHIRO)
The secretarial office seems busy. Are you holding up okay?

54
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:00,209
Well, actually...

55
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:04,513
No, it's nothing.

56
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:07,365
If you're ever in trouble, let me know. I can help.

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,522
Let's get dinner again soon.

58
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,082
Yes, of course.

59
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,321
Ms. Sato is always so kind and helpful.

60
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,948
Shun Himuro is an idol, right?

61
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,384
An actor, but close enough to an idol.

62
00:03:20,398 --> 00:03:22,282
He has no experience in this industry, right?

63
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:24,628
And he's just going to start as president?

64
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,671
He's probably just a figurehead for publicity.

65
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:28,598
I'm so jealous.

66
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:31,917
Celebrities get to become presidents just like that, without doing a thing.

67
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:44,266
You're not wrong. Please, continue.

68
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:40,844
You're not wrong. Please, continue.

69
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:42,750
S-Sorry!

70
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:45,356
As expected of the young master. Totally unfazed.

71
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:47,270
He's got nerves of steel.

72
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:06,261
We will also ask your older brother, Mr. Hayate, to return to the country as soon as possible.

73
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,396
For the time being, I will handle the practical operations.

74
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:10,337
During this period, we ask for your utmost effort.

75
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:12,818
Shun, you are a layman in this industry.

76
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:17,162
Furthermore, you will have to juggle two jobs until your current work is finished.

77
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,188
I know this is a difficult request.

78
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,228
However, TAKASHIRO's performance is currently poor.

79
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:25,787
There have even been several buyout offers.

80
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:32,197
It would be disastrous if our stock price were to fall due to the president's illness.

81
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:34,813
We must appoint a new president as soon as possible.

82
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,160
Pardon my bluntness, but in terms of raising the company's profile...

83
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:41,950
and creating buzz, you will be very helpful on the promotional side.

84
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:44,412
That's a bit harsh.

85
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:47,201
We implore you to accept.

86
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,460
I'll do it.

87
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:59,289
But I refuse to be an empty figurehead.

88
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:03,995
As long as it's within my power, I will do the best I possibly can.

89
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:07,026
Grandfather...

90
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:11,033
You were the one who warned me not to act rashly.

91
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,801
Why would you ask this of me?

98

99

Super comfortable.

100
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,332
It's nighttime in Japan right now, isn't it?

101
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:48,285
Pitch black.

102
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,552
The world of my heart is also pitch black.

103
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:53,560
I've decided that here in France...

104
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,826
I'm going to hold a successful one-woman show.

105
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:58,032
And make my international debut.

106
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,162
Life is tough...

107
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,572
but it's fun to do what you love every day.

108
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,208
It's exciting.

109
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:08,920
I know exactly how you feel.

110
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,860
Once you decide, see it through to the end.

111
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,029
This is the life I'm pouring my soul into.

112

no, Mr. Shun Takashiro...

00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:45,024
will be formally appointed as the representative director.

-Understood. -Yes, ma'am.

126
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,554
I want to be a help to Shun.

127
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,596
But since he dislikes me, am I even qualified to write the draft?

164
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:52,745
How did you know?

165
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:55,055
The senior managing director mentioned it in an email.

166
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:58,149
Shun is such a fast worker.

167
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:01,909
Since you're here, could you brief me directly?

00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:45,234
The president's methods are indeed...

181
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:48,196
Isn't TAKASHIRO a bit outdated?

182
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,366
No, we're not outdated at all.

183
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,808
Under the current president's leadership,

184
00:11:57,852 --> 00:12:01,825
revenue has increased across all business segments.

185
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,930
Things like importing foreign brands,

186
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:07,384
acquiring licenses for foreign brands,

187
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:11,213
expanding overseas branches, and accepting OEM production.

188
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,610
We even handle ODM, managing everything from planning and design to production.

189
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:18,314
Our performance has tripled in the last three years.

190
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:23,361
This is all thanks to the president's excellent market intuition.

191
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:26,780
-And the employees also... -What you're saying...

192
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:29,320
doesn't really answer my question, does it?

193
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,482
I... I'm sorry.

194
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:35,638
No, it's alright.

195
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:38,420
This has given me a better understanding of the business situation.

196
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:40,884
Thank you.

197
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:46,269
My fave said "thank you" to me.

198
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:52,077
We should probably wrap up soon.

199
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,005
There's no way I can finish all of this.

200
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,052
Right.

201
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:01,573
Can I really do this?

202
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:07,855
Maybe I should just run away.

203
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:13,657
You can do it.

204
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,107
How can you be so sure?

205
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,976
I've only had one night to prepare.

206
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
Why...?

207
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,258
Because you have an extraordinary memory.

208
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:32,275
And the superb acting skills you possess as an actor.

209
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:35,150
Acting skills?

210
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,167
Yes.

211
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:42,843
Can that be done even if I'm just an empty suit?

212
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:46,122
No, that's not what I meant.

213
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:49,086
I'm so sorry.

214
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:52,695
In any case, you will be fine.

215
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:55,999
Please don't run from your destiny. Good luck at the press conference.

216
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,764
Um, I'll go get some tea.

217
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,028
I'm such an idiot! How could I talk to my idol like that?

218
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,135
So hot!

219
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:19,006
No matter what fate the future holds,

220
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,817
I will walk towards the light that is you.

221
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:41,179
He looks just like the spy and president from the drama "Rival."

222
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,848
So cool.

223
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,324
He's so handsome.

224
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:54,106
-Good morning, Mr. President. -Good morning.

225
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,597
Today's press conference will be livestreamed. Don't be nervous.

226
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,103
You must be used to livestreams.

227
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,129
Not at all.

228
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,852
He stayed up all night preparing...

229
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:09,125
...then had an executive meeting and a shareholder meeting this morning...

230
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,863
...and now this press conference.

231
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:14,437
Isn't Shun exhausted?

232
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,763
Shun isn't an actor; he's the president.

233
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,037
The president, the president.

234
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:32,516
Is this suit okay?

235
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,349
It suits you perfectly. You look wonderful.

236
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,162
I chose it on purpose.

237
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,405
(New President Inauguration Press Conference)
It's about time.

238
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:49,170
The livestream has started.

239
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:51,940
The online response is very active.

240
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:53,708
There's both praise and criticism.

241
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:57,639
I didn't expect us to get this much attention.

242
00:15:57,677 --> 00:16:00,024
He looked at the script last night...

243
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:01,388
but will he be okay?

244
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:04,414
The president will be fine.

245
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,184
I am the newly appointed fifth-generation

246
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:24,023
Representative Director of TAKASHIRO Corporation.

247
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:26,254
My name is Shun Takashiro.

248
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,194
Our company was founded in the 26th year of the Meiji era.

249
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:32,835
Successive presidents and employees have worked together as one...

250
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:35,483
overcoming numerous challenges along the way.

251
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:39,812
To take over as president is not only the highest honor...

252
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,842
but also fills me with a sense of trepidation.

253
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,517
While I have no experience in the apparel industry,

254
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:48,971
I will, with a fresh perspective,

255
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,641
bring new breakthroughs to TAKASHIRO.

256
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,439
We will now take questions.

257
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,295
Please raise your hand if you have a question.

258
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:03,171
-Looks like it will conclude smoothly. -Yeah.

259
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:05,710
All that's left are the anticipated questions.

260
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:07,873
Thank goodness.

261
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:10,269
The gentleman over there.

262
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:15,013
I'm Fujiki, a freelance journalist.

263
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:19,106
Your original profession was acting. What will happen to your entertainment career?

264
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:20,836
Will you be able to continue?

265
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,908
Why would he lead with that question?

266
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:26,586
Yes. Although this was sudden and unavoidable...

267
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:30,724
after my current projects are completed,

268
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:33,470
I will be halting my activities in entertainment to focus on my duties as president.

269
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:36,066
So you'll be juggling two jobs for the time being?

270
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,191
Can you be a proper president like that?

271
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,875
Can you protect your employees and the stock price?

272
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:41,904
Being a pretty face is useless.

273
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:48,180
Please answer the question.

274
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:54,537
(Who can juggle two jobs?)
(This reporter is really sharp.)

275
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:56,596
(Employees' livelihoods are at stake.)
(Does he know anything about business?)

276
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,671
(You can't run a business on acting skills.)
(He's probably just a publicity stunt.)

277
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,840
(Wants to be an actor and a president.)
(Can't he just pick one?)

278
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:13,029
I am juggling acting, and I have no experience in this industry.

279
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:16,750
I certainly do not have the experience of the former president.

280
00:18:16,877 --> 00:18:18,877
And I do not know if I have a talent for business.

281
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:20,672
However...

282
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,829
I will not run from my destiny.

283
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:28,179
For the employees, for the company...

284
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:30,572
and for myself...

285
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:33,356
I will give it my all.

286
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:41,265
The star of my life is shining brightly today.

287
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:44,859
Shun, no matter when or where...

288
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,979
...is always the star that guides me. My Southern Cross.

289
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,160
He even threw in a wink.

290
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,417
Oh, he just had something in his eye.

291
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:04,990
Figured as much.

292
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:09,706
We will now take the next question...

293
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:25,233
Stop right there!

294
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:31,045
Who is that guy?

295
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,403
Good work today, everyone.

296
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:41,478
During the conference, a reporter named Fujiki deliberately tried to cause trouble for the president.

297
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:44,637
We have not been able to contact him yet.

298
00:19:44,637 --> 00:19:48,064
From now on, everyone needs to be more cautious.

299
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:49,582
Yes, ma'am...

300
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:53,531
Additionally, regarding the new president's dedicated secretary...

301
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:58,442
Minami will be in charge.

302
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:01,102
What?

303
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:04,533
You're highly capable and dislike celebrities, so you're the perfect choice.

304
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:08,003
Let's all work together to support our new president.

305
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:09,578
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,786
-Um... -Please come with me.

307
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:18,110
Yes.

308
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:27,368
Can you be a proper president like that?

309
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:29,074
Please answer the question.

310
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,730
In any case, you will be fine.

311
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,569
Please don't run from your destiny.

312
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,980
I will not run from my destiny.

313
00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:56,861
I can't.

314
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:59,917
As a fan, how can I possibly be his secretary?

315
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:01,917
(Transfer Request Form)
I'll confess to the section chief tomorrow.

316
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:06,860
Loving your fave means supporting them from a distance.

317
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:08,743
That's the right way.

318
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:11,134
(Shun Himuro has started a livestream.)

319
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:21,283
I apologize for surprising everyone with the sudden announcement.

320
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,628
I know this may be difficult for some of you to accept...

321
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:26,457
but I have made my decision.

322
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:30,912
As I said at the press conference, once I finish my current work...

323
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,654
I will be going on an indefinite hiatus.

324
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:37,745
There may not be a farewell event.

325
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:40,537
I feel very sorry about that.

326
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:44,618
My days as an actor...

327
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:49,573
thanks to all of you, were an incredibly precious...

328
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,833
and happy time for me.

329
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:55,532
Thank you all so much.

330
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,891
(Transfer Request Form)

331
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,914
(Please make cat ears!)

332
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:24,056
(Please make a heart!)

333
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:37,568
Though I am unworthy...

334
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:40,625
...I've decided to become your secretary.

335
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,028
Compared to the happiness you've given me in the past...

336
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:47,075
...though it cannot compare...

337
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:49,942
...from now on, as the president's secretary...

338
00:22:49,942 --> 00:22:52,123
...I will give it my all.

339
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:57,010
And of course, I will completely hide the fact that I'm a fan.

340
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:00,649
Let's practice...

341
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,289
Whoops, I almost sounded like a commoner.

342
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,900
Mr. President.

343
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:10,926
This is my battle armor for protecting my fave-turned-boss.

344
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,743
Starting tomorrow, I'm going full throttle.

345
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,976
Please take care of me.

346
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:23,440
Minami, you're here early.

347
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:24,594
Good morning.

348
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:26,814
The new president is in your hands starting today.

349
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:28,372
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:31,594
Minami-senpai, something's happened to the president!

351
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:37,224
(Is this Shun from this morning?)
(The boss of an apparel company has a very wrinkled suit.)

352
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:38,210
(The suit is so dirty.)

353
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,071
How could this happen?
