How about we schedule it for the beginning of next month?

The public filming for the drama series "Rival" is about to begin.

81
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:34,347
The star of my life...

82
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:38,095
is shining so brightly today.

83
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:42,462

84
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:47,195

Action!

89
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:09,220
It's been five years since Shun and Kazuki co-starred in that 2.5D stage play.

90
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:12,836
I can't believe I get to witness their chemistry in person again.

91
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:17,915
Oh, God of Lotteries, thank you for choosing me from among so many applicants.

92
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:20,120
I am truly grateful.

93
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:24,903
So cute.

94
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:28,107
If I had a young boyfriend like that...

95
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,691
Alright, that's not happening in this reality.

96
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:47,722
A company president who's also a spy... a James Bond-like character.

97
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:50,182
It's like the role was tailor-made for Shun.

98
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:52,284
He really is a genius.

99
00:06:57,031 --> 00:07:00,727
Ao... I wish that we...

100
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,943
had never met.

101
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,979
This is our destiny.

103
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:23,844
Why...?

104
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,221
Because...

105
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:32,336
I can't bring myself to shoot you.

106
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,495
I...

107
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:38,515
Calm down. It's okay.

108
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:45,240
Cut! That was great.

109
00:07:47,057 --> 00:07:48,512
Come on.

110
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:50,572
-Thanks. -Nice.

111
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,531
-That was amazing. -You too.

112
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:55,865
So cool...

113
00:07:55,865 --> 00:08:01,169
I... am chasing this star called "idol" with all my might.

114
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:05,659
And I always will be.

115
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:13,432
Thank you, everyone.

116
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,986
It's now time for a group photo.

117
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:19,306
You're free to upload the photos to social media.

118
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:21,367
So... so dazzling.

119
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:23,996
He's so beautiful, yet it awakens my motherly instincts.

120
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:24,979
So captivating.

121
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,747
So divine... absolutely divine.

122
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:32,972
Is he coming this way?

123
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,108
Huh? Huh?

124
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:36,108
Wait a minute...

125
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:51,472
There it is! The unexpected wink from tsundere Shun!

126
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,654
Are you okay? Wake up!

127
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:56,674
Snap out of it!

128
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,085
Ai...

129
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:02,980
Are you okay?

130
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:07,560
Shun was so handsome today.

131
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:10,625
-So hot. -Drop-dead gorgeous. So cute.

132
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:12,043
He's definitely going to take over the world.

133
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,054
He's totally world-class. World-class.

134
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,695
I pre-ordered the "Labyrinth Prince" DVD, too.

135
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:21,329
I can't believe they're including behind-the-scenes extras for that masterpiece. Bless the production team.

136
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:22,754
All hail the production team!

137
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:25,524
We have to get tickets for the "Labyrinth Prince" encore performance.

138
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:27,467
-Yeah! -We absolutely have to!

139
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,175
Shun is focusing on TV dramas and movies now.

140
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:32,880
It's been so long since I've seen him in a 2.5D play.

141
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,313
-I feel like I'm going to cry from happiness. -I know, right?

142
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,718
I'm so happy I'm his fan.

143
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:39,179
-Yeah. -The absolute happiest.

144
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:42,514
Hurry! I heard Shun ate this once in his private time.

145
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:43,497
Let's take a picture first.

146
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,819
Ah, I forgot to bring my acrylic standee! Dammit!

147
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:57,157
I brought some dishes from home.

148
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,285
Mom told me to give you some.

149
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:03,263
I went to a fan event tonight. We all went wild at karaoke afterwards.

150
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:07,389
Sounds like fun. I support you.

151
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:16,270
I've found the star of my life.

152
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,819
Thanks to my idol, every day is a happy one.

153
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,073
Not only have I made friends who get me...

154
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,800
but I'm also more motivated at work.

155
00:10:43,362 --> 00:10:46,176
Shun, thank you again for today.

156
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:48,176
I'll do my best again tomorrow.

157
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,462
Excuse me.

158
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,400
Mr. President?

159
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:10,913
Mr. President... what's wrong?

160
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:14,947
Mr. President...!

(My Fave is My Boss: Full Throttle)

162
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:29,921
(Takahiro Nikaido, Senior Managing Director of TAKASHIRO)

163
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:33,050
He must have been feeling chest pains for a while.

164
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,210
He's resting now. You should go home.

165
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:40,593
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:43,396
The president is getting older. I'm really worried.

167
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,797
If the worst should happen...

168
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,443
will Mr. Nikaido be the new president?

169
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,517
No, this company follows hereditary succession.

170
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:53,014
But I heard the president's only son started a business abroad and never came back.

171
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:55,591
What a spendthrift rich kid.

172
00:12:55,632 --> 00:12:57,950
His grandson, Mr. Hayate, is at the Thailand branch...

173
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,657
but they say he doesn't get along with the president.

174
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,214
Actually, I heard he hates him.

175
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:03,064
No wonder he was sent off to Thailand.

176
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:05,856
He actually has another grandson.

177
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,708
But his name, age, and occupation have never been made public.

178
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:09,608
What?

179
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:15,326
The president is still in critical condition.

180
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,974
If outsiders were to find out about this...

181
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:22,063
it could affect the contract signing with President Asagiri next week.

182
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,553
Everyone must keep this strictly confidential.

183
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:28,996
And be on the lookout for reporters.

184
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,572
Lately, it's not just reporters.

185
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,951
There are also those troublemakers who upload photos online.

186
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:40,984
In any case, be extremely cautious of suspicious individuals.

187
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,041
The internet...

188
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:47,153
Minami, could you deliver something to the president?

189
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:48,418
Of course.

190
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:12,078
I'm so sorry. I didn't notice you weren't feeling well.

191
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,410
It's not your fault.

192
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:19,110
I was too anxious about the contract signing...

193
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:21,433
and ignored my health.

194
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,416
I brought this upon myself.

195
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,118
Mr. President...

196
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,718
Perhaps it's time for a fresh breeze in the company.

197
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:36,046
I'll be counting on you after the new president takes over.

198
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:38,718
Please don't say such things.

199
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:42,083
You need to get well soon and come back to the company.

200
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:48,370
A new president...

201
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,550
I forgot my phone.

202
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:09,064
Be extremely cautious of suspicious individuals.

203
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:13,136
Sir.

204
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:15,632
Hey.

205
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:18,770
Stop!

206
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,340
Don't run!

207
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:24,772
Your phone! Let me see your phone!

208
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:28,093
You were secretly taking pictures just now, weren't you? I saw you with my own two eyes.

209
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:31,358
Don't run anymore! Show me your face!

210
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,814
Someone! There's a suspicious person here!

211
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,472
Hey...!

212
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,334
Huh? No way...

213
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,176
Come here.

214
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:07,689
An idol... is holding my hand?

215
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,198
I'm not a suspicious person.

216
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,492
Ouch.

217
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:39,197
Thank goodness. I slipped out in the middle of a shoot.

218
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:41,870
It would have been a disaster if fans had surrounded me. That scared me.

219
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,483
I can't believe I hit my beloved idol.

220
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:57,951
Why was he even there? Was he really a suspicious person?

221
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,107
No... that's impossible. He must have just happened to be at the hospital.

222
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:05,295
What on earth have I done?

223
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:08,062
He definitely remembers my face now. To be remembered for something like this...

224
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,085
It's the humiliation of a lifetime!

225
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:14,944
I can never go to a fan meet again! Dammit!

Times like this call for a change of scenery.

229
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:42,738

233
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:13,462

No...

249

You don't want to shake my hand?

250

I do!

251
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,787

253

The shock of him disappearing, not just from my life,
