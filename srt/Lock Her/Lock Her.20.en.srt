=I'm Letting You Go Because I Love Him=

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,160
You're straightforward.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,040
But let's not mix things up.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,800
This matter is settled now.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,360
Let's get down to business.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,280
Hold on.

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,510
The history between us

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,120
is more than just this incident.

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,360
You set up a meeting last time.

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,360
I waited hours for you,

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,300
but you never showed up.

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,520
What do you take me for?

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,040
How are we settling this?

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,280
This thing was my fault.

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
Today, in front of all the brothers,

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm apologizing to you.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,160
That's it?

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,480
There's a bottle on your table.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,120
Finish it in one go.

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,360
Then it's settled.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,320
Alright.

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,520
Young Marshal.

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,720
Good.

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,280
Good for you.

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,280
Enough.

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,640
Let's get down to business now.

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
Go ahead.

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,320
Are you planning to fight or to yield?

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,640
Neither fighting

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
nor yielding.

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,280
Darn it.

41
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,280
Dai Shiyao, are you messing with me?

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,920
Neither?

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,520
Do you want me to surrender?

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,720
The situation between our two cities

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,000
is just like this warehouse.

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,280
If a war breaks out,

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,800
all of us will die here today.

48
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,990
I'll stand my ground.

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
If you want peace,

50
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,960
I respect that.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,480
We'll exchange gifts
during the holidays.

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,600
War between the two cities

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
will only bring ruin and loss.

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,400
By then, our soldiers

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,040
and civilians

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,040
will all be dead.

57
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,120
Others won't risk a thing

58
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,360
to reap the rewards.

59
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,960
Are we agreed?

60
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,800
Agreed.

61
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,280
Deal.

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,880
Bottoms up.

63
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,400
We'll steer clear of Nancheng.

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,280
Take that chest of gold back with you.

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,680
Think of it as a gift from me

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,440
for our new bond.

67
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,360
Good. Sit.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Grandma.

69
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,210
What are you doing here?

70
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,440
I like to sit

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,100
outside my granddaughter-in-law's door.

72
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,000
The Old Madam said

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,920
a smooth peace talk

74
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,880
makes her happier than winning a battle.

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Kids,

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,640
it doesn't matter how the days go.

77
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,040
What matters is a family united

78
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,320
and happy together.

79
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,560
Shiyao,

80
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,640
starting tomorrow,

81
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,280
shouldn't you be taking some time off?

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Time to plan the wedding.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,760
Young Marshal.

84
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,120
I'll handle the military affairs.

85
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,040
You can rest easy.

86
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,760
The most important thing now

87
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,600
is for you to marry Miss Qin soon.

88
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,000
Miss Qin

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,640
waited at the gate for this.

90
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
I did not.

91
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,880
I was there to pick him up.

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,880
Everyone in the residence already knows.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,440
Madam was waiting at the gate today

94
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,120
for a full four hours.

95
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,640
I just wanted to check earlier.

96
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,960
You really waited for four hours?

97
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,800
No, I didn't.

98
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,720
You kids, honestly.

99
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,080
Miss.

100
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,680
Not staying over
at the Young Marshal's tonight?

101
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,160
How dare you laugh at me?

102
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Grandma said

103
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
she renamed me Tuanyuan

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
to represent her wish

105
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,920
that the Young Marshal and you
can reunite every day.

106
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,480
But he's been so exhausted today.

107
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,920
If you can keep him company,

108
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,240
he'll be alive

109
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,120
and vigorous.

110
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,680
You little girl.

111
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,080
How dare you laugh at me?

112
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,960
I'll find a strong man to marry you.

113
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,560
If you want to go,

114
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,520
just knock on the door.

115
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,440
You know the way.

116
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,520
Are you crazy?

117
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,360
Get out.

118
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,960
Just kill me,

119
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
so I won't suffer day and night.

120
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,800
Didn't you say you'd kill me

121
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,880
when you see me again?

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
My life's yours.

123
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,360
As long as you end me,

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,440
you'll avenge your parents

125
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,560
and your family.

126
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,560
I did resent you.

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,200
I even swore once

128
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,280
I'd take down whoever killed my parents.

129
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
But now,

130
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
I don't want

131
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,440
your life anymore.

132
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,240
Why not?

133
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,280
Because you're Dai Shiyao's brother.

134
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,400
I can choose to let this go,

135
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,800
but you must stay far from me.

136
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,000
You're letting me go

137
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
because you love him?

138
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,840
I'm letting you go

139
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,840
because I love him.

140
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,840
You two are getting married?

141
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,160
Go on, leave.

142
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,680
Get on your knees.

143
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,560
Sheng.

144
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,480
Sheng.

145
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,600
Why capture me?

146
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm your uncle.

147
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,520
Let me go now.

148
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,280
What do you mean?

149
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,690
Because you're my uncle,

150
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,960
I waited till now to catch you.

151
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,600
You used me

152
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
to commit treason,

153
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,640
killing three birds with one stone.

154
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,760
I have no uncle like you.

155
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,960
Without foreign support,

156
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,430
how could I help you and Shiyao?

157
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,960
Still acting tough.

158
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
Sheng.

159
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,880
Sheng.

160
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,640
I understand.

161
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,680
Aren't you just worried

162
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,400
that the Qin girl will blame you?

163
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,040
But right now,

164
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,720
you shouldn't be questioning me.

165
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,640
I'll shoot you!

166
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,760
Sheng,

167
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,960
think carefully.

168
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Why did that girl

169
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,960
choose Shiyao and not you?

170
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,240
What do you know?

171
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,240
Of course, I know.

172
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,080
Say it.

173
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,760
It's all because of Liu Yong.

174
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,760
If everything had gone as planned,

175
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
and Liu Yong had died at our hands,

176
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,920
the Dai Army would've crossed
the Hunshui River.

177
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
That Qin girl likes heroes, right?

178
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,160
Shiyao could be a hero.

179
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,840
You could be one, too.

180
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Liu Yong is like a ticking bomb.

181
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
With him around,

182
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,320
Nancheng will never have peace.

183
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,760
If you really want to help that girl,

184
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,560
just take Liu Yong out,

185
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,640
- instead of...
- You really have a death wish.

186
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
At a time like this,

187
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
you still want me to deal
with Liu Yong for you?

188
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,120
No, that's not it.

189
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,680
Sheng,

190
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,800
think about it.

191
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,480
Nancheng's always in chaos.

192
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,600
