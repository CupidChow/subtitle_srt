=Don't You Trust Your Devoted Brother?=

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,320
I told you

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,200
that she knows that the logbook is fake.

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,600
Why still kidnap her?

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,320
I have my own plan.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,330
After thinking it over,

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,140
it's still safest to put them both

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,000
in your secret chamber.

18
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,360
What plan could you have?

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,220
Just return them to the Dai Residence.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,880
I like to keep a backup plan.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
The arrow's already drawn.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,320
This girl is the key spark.

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,280
But don't worry.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,760
I won't hurt her.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,600
Let alone harm Shiyao.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,320
Sometimes,

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,480
all it takes is one more flame

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,720
to make the fire burn stronger.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,920
Out of respect for you as our uncle,

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,320
I convinced my brother to act.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
But now,

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,360
my brother has refused.

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,760
Then let him be.

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,080
Since he's backed down, you can't.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,120
Don't forget

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,280
we're doing this for Shiyao,

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,520
our family, and Nancheng.

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,120
If Nancheng loses Hunshui,

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
it'll lose its defense.

40
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,720
We're having a war.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,760
Winners rule; losers fall.

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,200
Strike first to gain the edge;

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,680
wait and you'll pay the price.

44
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
Don't you get it?

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,960
I get it.

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,500
But what's it got to do with Qin Shiyue?

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,640
She's Shiyao's biggest weakness.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm just using that to my advantage.

49
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,920
But relax.

50
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,240
Once Liu Yong is framed,

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,160
I'll go to Shiyao myself to apologize.

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,080
By then, he'll see

53
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,240
that I meant well.

54
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
How many days do you need?

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,640
Framing Liu Yong this time

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,680
is to push Shiyao to strike first.

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,640
As long as you work with me,

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,480
you'll see results

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
within three days.

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,480
Jinxiu.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,200
Jinxiu.

62
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,440
Shiyue.

63
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
You again.

64
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,560
No matter what you think,

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
stay here for a few days.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,160
Let me out.

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,800
I want to go home.

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,240
Home?

69
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,720
Which home?

70
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,720
Yeah.

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,360
I have no home anymore.

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Because you killed my parents.

73
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,800
You killed 36 members of my family.

74
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,200
You destroyed my home long ago.

75
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,320
Just hang on a bit longer.

76
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,760
I'll let you go in due time.

77
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,120
I won't hurt you.

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Stop lying to me.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,320
When you took my father's life,

80
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,920
my mother's, and my sister's,

81
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
why didn't you say that?

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,200
Because they deserved to die.

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,520
Why would they deserve that?

84
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,480
They committed treason;
they're all traitors.

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Do you have any proof?

86
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,400
Your father sent the Japanese
half a ship of relics

87
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
and half a ship of gold.

88
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,160
What's that if not treason?

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
My father was framed.

90
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,600
Dai Shiyao has found the evidence.

91
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,200
He's just fooling you.

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
Without solid proof,

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,280
I wouldn't have made a move.

94
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,720
And what counts as solid proof?

95
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
The Jizhou shipping list?

96
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,790
Or the forged logbook?

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,640
If you're wrong,

98
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,560
you'll be carrying the weight

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,320
of 36 innocent lives of the Qin family

100
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,640
and my lifelong hate for you.

101
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,680
Aren't you the one who kills traitors?

102
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,760
I'm the daughter of a traitor.

103
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,560
Go ahead and kill me.

104
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
Just like you killed
those innocent people.

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,960
Come on, kill me.

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,280
Let me out.

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,360
Let me out!

108
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,200
Madam.

109
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,320
You have to trust the Young Marshal.

110
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,760
He'll find us.

111
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,960
But we can't just sit here waiting.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,080
No matter what you think,

113
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,340
stay here for a few days.

114
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
He told me to stay here for a few days.

115
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,040
Something's bound to happen soon.

116
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,120
I need to get out and tell him.

117
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,240
But what should we do?

118
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
There are

119
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,160
dangerous people guarding.

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,000
Let me think.

121
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,120
There's got to be a way.

122
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,840
Someone, come here!

123
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,680
Why are you yelling?

124
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,520
Someone, hurry!

125
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
Tell your boss right now.

126
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,640
The Madam seems to be sick.

127
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,760
She's in real pain.

128
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
If she's sick, she's sick.

129
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,880
As long as she's not dying.

130
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,640
If anything happens to her,

131
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,680
your boss

132
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
will definitely come for you.

133
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,640
If I believe you now,

134
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,920
my boss will still come for me.

135
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
Hey, don't walk away!

136
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,680
Don't go!

137
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,090
You...

138
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,920
The Young Marshal is here.

139
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,680
We've kept quiet during curfew.

140
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,080
We're not even open.

141
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,520
We've lost someone.

142
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,600
Let's take a look.

143
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,560
You want to search Night Queen?

144
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,960
Shiyao.

145
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,760
You're not serious, right?

146
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,360
Hold on.

147
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,640
Since when did Adjutant Wen

148
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,560
forget all the rules?

149
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,560
You can't search Night Queen
anytime you want.

150
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,200
We've swept all of Nancheng.

151
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,760
This is the only place left.

152
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,240
We're on official duty.

153
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,720
Did you hear that?

154
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,560
It's on official duty.

155
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,680
I'm not letting you.

156
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,900
Are you trying to rebel?

157
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,280
Shiyao.

158
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,040
It's not me rebelling.

159
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,440
Seems like you've lost your cool.

160
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,920
Look up and see this place.

161
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,240
Look at the brothers behind me.

162
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,960
Every one of them
risked their life for you.

163
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,620
Do you still remember him?

164
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,480
His own brother sacrificed himself

165
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,120
to save you on the Chuanxi field.

166
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,120
To fill the gap in the Death Guard,

167
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
he volunteered to join us.

168
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
Isn't that worth your trust?

169
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,040
At least you remember him, right?

170
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,320
He grew up with us.

171
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,240
He was bullied for being mute.

172
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,320
After a small kindness, he joined us.

173
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,560
It was just a small favor from us.

174
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,240
Yet he repaid it with his life.

175
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,080
Isn't that worth your trust?

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
And there's me.

177
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,840
Your brother who bled for you.

178
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,680
Your flesh and blood.

179
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,140
Let me ask you:

180
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,600
