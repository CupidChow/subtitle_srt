77

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,600

94
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,560

96
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,320

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,400

99
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,040
was Sheng in Night Queen.

111
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,000
The one who survived is Dai Shiyao,

112
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,650
the Young Marshal.

113
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,920

is Dai Shiyao

117
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,360
and Qin Shiyue's wedding day.

118
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,720
The wedding will go on as planned.

119
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,360
Keep it as low-key as possible.

120
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,680

Shiyao.

125
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,680
