You're back.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,040

(This hypocrite!)

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,300
You didn't come home all night.

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
Where were you?

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
You didn't even knock.

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
I'm talking to you.

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
None of your business.

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,720
You were gone all night.

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
I was worried about you.

36
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,920
So fake.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,240
- What are you doing?
- Why did you lie to me?

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,280
Lied about what?

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,760
You slandered my father.

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,190

but it was you who destroyed my family!

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120

Young Marshal was stabbed again

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,720
Did this bowl offend you?

I like things clean.

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
Fine.

100
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Then wipe Grandma's, too.

101
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I thought about it last night.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,740
You're hiding something
from me, aren't you?

103
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,680
Yes.

104
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,320
You do care about me,

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,120
and don't believe I'm the murderer.

106
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,760
But you do have some evidence

107
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,880
pointing squarely at me.

108
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,200
Yet you can't kill me.

109
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,200
Killing me might execute an innocent

110
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,440
and permanently

111
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,930
bury your Qin family's vindication.

112
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,720
So you're torn inside.

113
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,120
And you didn't sleep well.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,240
If in these past few days,

115
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,440
aside from Sheng's Night Queen,

116
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
you've been nowhere else.

117
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,600
Then that evidence came from Sheng.

118
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,040
My brother

119
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,320
is always going against the grain.

120
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,800
You trust him more than you trust me?

121
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,240
My engagement with your sister

122
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,280
was arranged in my childhood.

123
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,600
The year Qin's Bank opened,

124
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,120
my grandpa signed
and sealed the agreement.

125
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,240
Proving the Qin family
colluded with enemies

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,280
benefits me not at all.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,840
You accuse me of coveting your wealth?

128
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,920
But your family has always
backed our Dai family.

129
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,200
One call to your father,

130
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,320
and crates of gold
would arrive at my door.

131
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,760
I simply recognize you as my wife.

132
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
That's why I care about you

133
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,960
and tolerate this foolish mind of yours.

134
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,640
If someone else were this foolish,

135
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,120
I wouldn't take them even as a maid.

She was so gentle and unhurried.

189
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,600
Whenever she saw Shiyao,

190
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,720
she wouldn't even dare lift her eyes.

191
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
But you're different.

192
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,120
You've tamed the formidable

193
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,760
Young Marshal himself.

194
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,440
That's not true.

195
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,320
Alright,

196
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,440
I'll stop teasing you.

197
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,800
Once the city calms down a bit,

198
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,390
I'll go with you
to visit your family's graves.

199
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,280
Oh, I spoke carelessly.

200
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,120
I brought up something that hurts you.

201
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,520
My fault.

202
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,720
It's my fault.

203
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,600
But the grudge isn't settled yet.

204
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,080
I still don't have the face to see them.

205
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
Have you forgotten what I said?

206
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,120
You are
my Dai family's granddaughter-in-law.

207
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,480
What vengeance?
