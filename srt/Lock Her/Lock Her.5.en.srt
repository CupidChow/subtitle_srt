You self-righteous patriots,

78
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,720
coveting our Qin family's fortune,

79
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,120
fabricated lies about my father

80
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,880
betraying the nation,

81
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,820
and then hunted down my entire family.

82
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,460
Dai Shiyao,

83
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,470
this was all your doing.

84
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,040
Who told you that?

85
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,180
Robbery and murder are bandit tactics.

86
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,940
How are you different from them?

87
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,700
If you move again

88
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,700
and tear that wound,

89
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,700
no one could save you.

90
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,540
How will you avenge your father then?

91
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,500
I know everything.

92
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,260
You're the one

93
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,140
who took Qin's vault.

94
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,700
Plenty of people want me dead.

95
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,420
If their words were true,

96
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,220
why would they shoot at you?

97
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,340
You're being used.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,500
Put the scissors down first.

99
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,980

100
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,420
I know

101
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,620
you want to clear

102
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,580
the Qin family's name.

103
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,500
Don't worry.

104
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,020
I'll help you with this.

105
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,250
Madam,

106
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,180
you're finally awake.

107
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,020
You've slept all day.

108
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,140
I'll go tell Young Marshal.

109
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,740
Why are you here?

110
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
What do you want?

111
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,940
Qin Shiyue,

112
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,620
you really are something.

113
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
For your family's so-called honor,

114
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,660
you nearly got my brother killed

115
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,820
and almost lost your own life.

116
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,620
I don't know what you mean.

117
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,500
Didn't you want my help?

118
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,220
I've decided.

119
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,500
I can agree.

120
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,660
I don't need it anymore.

121
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,100
You don't get to decide that.

122
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,220
You started this first.

123
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,260
The moment you drank that wine,

124
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,260
our deal was already in motion.

125
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,700
You do get what that means, right?

126
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,140
But if you cooperate properly with me,

127
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,140
your father's truth

128
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,060
will surface soon.

129
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,700
I'll say it one more time.

130
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,420
I don't need it anymore.

131
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,740
Your master is coming.

132
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,580
If you don't want him to shoot you dead,

133
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,260
you'd best stay away from me.

134
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,460
Shiyue.

135
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
Why are you here?

136
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,460
I came to report
on Marshal Liu's matter.

137
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,140
I heard Miss Qin was injured.

138
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,140
So I came to visit.

139
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,620
Let Dr. Bai examine you

140
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,380
thoroughly again.

141
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,220
I have urgent business first.

142
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,660
You,

143
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,380
come with me.

144
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,500
You've crossed the line!

145
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,220
What line?

146
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,140
I told you

147
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,380
to stay away from her.

148
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,300
Brother, you've changed.

149
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,500
You never cared about women before.

150
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,780
You're truly enchanted by that girl.

151
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,580
None of your concern.

152
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,420
None of my concern?

153
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,700
There were never secrets between us.

154
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,260
No rifts either.

155
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,380
But since she showed up,

156
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,900
you've stopped trusting me.

157
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,380
When did I stop trusting you?

158
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,100
Then what are you afraid of?

159
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,860
Afraid I might hurt her?

160
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,340
I warned you to be wary of her.

161
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,460
Wasn't she the one who drew this danger?

162
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,820
The elders were right after all,

163
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,620
"Even heroes fall for beauty."

164
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
That's irrelevant.

165
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,180
Irrelevant?

166
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,340
You nearly attacked your own brother!

167
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,100
For 20 years,
I've resolved matters for you.

168
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,940
Do you know how many families

169
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,460
and lives were involved?

170
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,700
You've gained the glory.

171
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,940
The dirty work?
Am I worth less than a woman now?

172
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,420
Think about it carefully.

173
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,300
Jinxiu says you refuse medicine again.

174
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,980
It's the damp season now.

175
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,140
The wound has almost healed.

176
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,260
You still doubt me?

177
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,740
Look at me.

178
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,370
Look me in the eye.

179
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,260
Do you think I would lie to you?

180
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,140
Do you think that
if I slaughtered your family,

181
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,620
I could sit here so calmly

182
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,550
with you?

183
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,420
Stay away from Sheng from now on.

184
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,190
Why?

185
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,180
Because you're my fiancee now.

186
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,340
I'm not.

187
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,580
It's my sister who is.

188
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,580
Why dredge up

189
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,500
the past?

190
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,900
Dai Shiyao,

191
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,100
humans aren't stone.

192
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,660
Some things aren't that easy
to move past.

193
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,460
I've seen your letters to my sister.

194
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,300
It was full of tender longing.

195
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,980
She was sincere toward you, too.

196
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,740
But now you're facing
her younger sister.

197
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,340
Don't you find that ironic?

198
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,100
If they were for your sister,

199
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,140
why do you remember them so clearly?

200
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,180
And why were the replies I received

201
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,940
in your handwriting?

202
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,060
That's because...

203
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,020
You know that?

204
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,480
Every time
I visited the Qin family,

205
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,740
you'd deliberately talk loudly

206
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,620
with your sister,

207
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,220
acting so cheerful.

208
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,300
As for writing letters for her,

209
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,180
that was your own idea too, right?

210
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,700
Stay away from me.

211
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,780
Shiyue,

212
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,880
why is it that
between the lines of those letters,

213
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,500
all I can see is your reflection?

214
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,460
I don't want to hear more.

it was for you.

218
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
I still remember your reply in red ink,

219
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,580
"A thread of longing
unravels countless worries.

220
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,780
In this mortal realm,
nowhere to bury sorrows."

221
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,180
(In this mortal realm...)

222
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,580
I knew it was you.

223
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,060
It was you, Shiyue,
writing to Dai Shiyao.

224
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,740
How could you say that?

I won't believe you.

227

My sister talked about you all the time.

228
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,060
You were her only thought.

229
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,100
How can I believe you?

230
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,820
Shiyue, the two of us...

231
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,700
If you truly value feelings,

232
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,540
why is Xue Lianzhi in your home?

233
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,060
She's just a spy.

234
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,340
Are you leaving or not?

235
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,700
Madam, that's a gunshot wound.

236
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,220
Madam,

237
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,940
there's something...

238
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,060
I don't know if I should say.

239
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,580
Since you've said that,

240
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,620
go ahead and say it.

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,500
