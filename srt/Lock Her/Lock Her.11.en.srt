11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,640
Madam,

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,120
you didn't have nightmares last night?

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
I slept quite well.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,640
That's wonderful.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,980
Since you moved in,

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,680
you've had nightmares
almost every night.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,040
You finally slept peacefully.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,800
Where's the Young Marshal?

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,720
He went to the Military Affairs Office

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,760
early this morning.

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,160
You don't have to be so tight-lipped.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,240
Dai Congling is my uncle.

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,440
Even if you spell everything out,

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,760
I'm not going to do anything to him.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,680
I really

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,000
don't know anything more.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,760
Let me ask you again from the start.

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,920
Did Dai Congling forge the secret tip
from Chongqing,

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,080
naming the Qins traitors?

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,960
The Qins

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
are indeed traitors.

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,480
Grandma.

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,600
I've been meaning to spend
more time with you.

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,440
From now on,

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,080
join me in copying scriptures.

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
Sincerity brings blessings.

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,240
Old Madam,

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,640
the Young Marshal is back.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,040
He's just back.

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
Why the fuss? Don't shout like that.

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
The Young Marshal has been hurt.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,130
What kind of injury?

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,340
They say it's a knife wound.

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,120
Come with me to get
some medicated ointment.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,960
Let's go.

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,700
(First Step to Success)

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,280
I heard you got injured.

48
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,960
It's nothing.

49
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,440
It's just a shame that I lost

50
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
two brothers who've been
with me for years.

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,280
Maybe you should lay off the drinks.

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
What are you doing here?

53
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,320
Grandma sent me to change your dressing.

54
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,760
Thanks.

55
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,400
Should I call a doctor for you?

56
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,020
I think your wound

57
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,120
is starting to get infected.

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
No need.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
But I...

60
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,600
Are you scared?

61
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,520
You're the timidest in your family.

62
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,980
You were even scared
of caterpillars as a kid.

63
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,840
Now that you're here,

64
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,160
your jaw shakes every time you see me.

65
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,960
If you're still as timid as before,

66
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
call the doctor.

67
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,200
Come here.

68
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,440
Ouch.

69
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,440
Just call the doctor.

70
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,240
I am the doctor.

71
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
Bear with it.

72
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
No screaming.

73
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Done.

74
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,640
A military doctor once told me

75
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,160
the best cure for an illness is...

76
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,320
What do you mean?

77
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,240
Don't move.

78
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,520
Let go of me.

79
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,920
You're hurt.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,920

I choose to treat you this way.

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,320
You're hurt.

84
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,520
You need to rest and recover.

85
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,920

86
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,680

Before I got here,

194
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,720
what medicine did you give him?

195
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,680
Just some anti-inflammatory remedies.

196
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,480
Was there forsythia
or schizonepeta in it?

197
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,920
I'm not sure.

198
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,680
The physician prescribed this.

199
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,820
Where's the prescription?

200
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,800
Give it to me.

201
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,080
I didn't keep it.

202
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,600
What did he eat last night?

203
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,560
Did he have any other tonics?

204
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,960
When I left last night, he drank...

205
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,360

Miss Qin,

209
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,680
as his fiancée,

210
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,960
you know nothing about him.

211
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,520
What exactly are you up to?

212
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,200
Forget it; just leave.

213
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,000
