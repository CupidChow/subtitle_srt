00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,140
(Dai Shiyao, Young Marshal of Nancheng)

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,960
Young Marshal,

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,000
twenty-eight bodies found on site.

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,650
Your fiance...

16
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,140
(Eldest Miss Qin)

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,140
What about the rest of the Qins?

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,680
(Adjutant Wen)
They went south with the young girl.

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,640
Give her a proper burial.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,510
Yes.

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,200
We've rushed here as fast as we could.

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,040
And Marshal Liu from Dongcheng

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,780
has been waiting at the warehouse for hours.

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,120
I've arranged for his care.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,600
Deal with the present first.

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,440
Got it.

27
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,140
(Outskirts of Nancheng)

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,480
I told you long ago,

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
stay away from them.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,640
What do we do now?

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,980
I had no idea this would happen.

32
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,990
(Qin Shiyue, Second Miss Qin)
It's a time of chaos.

33
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,360
Every devil hides behind a smiling face.

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,840
Why can't you be more cautious?

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,360
Now you've been branded as a traitor.

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,400
The whole family's being hunted.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
Move!

38
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,480
Get inside.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,960
Shiyue.

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Remember, my girl, I'm no traitor.

41
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,160
Remember.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
- Dad!
- Don't talk.

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Mom!

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
What are you doing?

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,840
What's going on?

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,520
You guys...

47
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,840
Who are you people?

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
Huai!

49
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,680
Huai!

50
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,020
(Liu Yong, Marshal of Dongcheng)

51
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,960
Marshal, they said they can't make it.

52
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,440
What?

53
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,320
That little brat.

54
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,080
Dai Shiyao, you sly little punk.

55
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,480
I was being respectful to you.

56
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,560
And you stood me up.

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,000
Dad.

58
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Mom.

59
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,840
Mom.

60
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,680
Uncle Qin.

61
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,000
Uncle Qin.

62
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,280
Uncle Qin.

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,840
Shiyue.

64
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,000
Dai Shiyao.

65
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,440
I'm late.

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,280
Where's my sister?

67
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,600
The Qin family...

68
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm afraid you're the only one left.

69
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,600
Shiyue.

70
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,500
(One day later)

71
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,480
The Qin family suffered a great tragedy,

72
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,320
and your sister didn't survive either.

73
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,720
(Grandmother Dai)
Shiyao is about to

74
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,560
marry your sister into Dai family
in the spring.

75
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,920
Now only you remain.

76
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,920
Your parents are buried.

77
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,920
From now on, Dai family will protect you.

78
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,320
I've decided,

79
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
on the 26th of next month,

80
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,320
you'll take your sister's place

81
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,800
to marry Shiyao.

82
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,640
In the family photo in my study,

83
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
there's a business card

84
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,040
linked to those who framed me.

85
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,880
The Dai family is tied too.

86
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,360
Qin Huai was once a big name,

87
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,160
yet was ruined overnight just like that.

88
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,440
When the big tree falls,
the monkeys scatter.

89
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,560
Whatever the wrongs you suffer,

90
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,720
you'll have to swallow them from here on.

91
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,940
(Jinxiu, maid of the Dai family)

92
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,520
My lady, please get up first.

93
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,450
It's fine.

94
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,040
The Old Madam asked me to help you up.

95
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,360
Here, careful.

96
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
What are you doing?

97
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,880
This is Mrs. Dai,

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,800
the Young Marshal's fiance.

99
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,320
If you want to be the concubine,

100
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
you still have to pay respect to her.

101
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,280
Why didn't I see this lady earlier?

102
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,280
Since Dai Shiyao is already married,

103
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,400
why drag the Qin family into this?

104
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,440
Who do you think you are?

105
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,760
Calling the Young Marshal by name?

106
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,880
Your Qin family betrayed the nation.

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,920
They deserve death.

108
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,800
If you had any dignity,

109
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,720
you'd follow your traitor father

110
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,800
and go to hell.

111
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,080
At the very least,

112
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
you should become a nun

113
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,800
to atone for him.

114
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,240
Who are you calling a traitor?

115
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,760
Say that again!

116
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,800
Young Marshal, we found out.

117
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,640
Xue Lianzhi isn't pregnant.

118
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,080
She's the one

119
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,920
who poisoned you after the banquet.

120
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,120
Just as I suspected.

121
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,690
What's her background?

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,400
This is what we found in her room.

123
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,280
Young Marshal, don't worry.

124
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,680
I've already confirmed

125
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,880
she's a spy for the puppet government.

126
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,680
These are her files.

127
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,240
Everything matches across the records.

128
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,520
They say she even volunteered this time.

129
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,970
She signed a military pledge

130
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,000
to become Mrs. Dai.

131
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,400
Also…

132
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,160
Her real name isn't Xue Lianzhi.

133
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,920
It's Xue Xiangning.

134
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm reasonable enough.

135
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,520
If you call me First Madam now,

136
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,840
I'll let you go.

137
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,920
Not saying it.

138
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,400
Then I won't leave you standing today.

139
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,460
Say it!

140
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,680
No, I won't!

141
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,040
Say it or not?

142
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,640
No, I'm not.

143
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,680
Xue Xiangning.

144
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,240
Young Marshal, what brings you here?

145
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,430
- Take her away.
- Yes.

146
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
(Looks like from now on,)

147
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,520
(I'll have to tread carefully.)

148
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,820
(One wrong step,)

149
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,390
