Will the couple please step forward

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,280
and bow before the hall

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,440
to seal their vows in the record?

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,640
Perform the nuptial ceremony.

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Wedding photos.

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
I'll have one.

49

Where's your wife?

50
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
I'll take a solo shot.

51
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,880
Alright.

52
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,800
Come on.

53
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,040
Touch me again,

54
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,600
and I'll kill you.

55
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,120
Take one more step,

56
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,400
and I'll kill myself.

57
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,400
From now on,

58
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,660
I'll stay in the west wing.

59
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm not worthy to be your husband,

60
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,540
even less worthy to be his brother.

64
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,240
Grandma wants us to take
wedding photos tomorrow.

65
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,100
She says it's for a keepsake.

66
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,740
We'll go in the morning.

67
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,440
All of that pales in comparison

68
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,880
to my wife.

69
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,160
They say you train troops
and guard the city

70
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,520
with great honor,

71
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,880
but who knew your mind

72
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,680
was full of your wife?

73
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,440
These words

74
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,450
are only for my wife to hear.

75
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,960
Grandma.

76
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,400
Grandma.

77
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,800

78

80
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,720
take a good look at you.

81
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,920
You've lost weight again.

82
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
No way.

83
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,040
Grandma, you're thinner.

84
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,440
Look at you; you've slimmed down a lot.

85
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,920
My dear grandson.

86
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
It's my fault.

87
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280

will you still be my grandson?

91
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
When that time comes,

92
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,440
I'll give in to you in everything

93
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,720
and treat you well.
