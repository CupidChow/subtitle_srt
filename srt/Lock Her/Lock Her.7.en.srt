I know you like Dai Shiyao.

191
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,960
But it's your welcome dinner today.

192
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
The city's elites are all here.

193
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,200
Don't embarrass us.

194
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,120
But she really is a traitor's kid.

195
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,720
Her reputation...

196
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,040
Dai Shiyao runs Nancheng.

197
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,040
He can marry whoever he wants.

198
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Her origin doesn't matter.

199
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,440
I don't agree.

200
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,440
Wanwan.

201
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,760
Men are like that.

202
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,040
Having many partners is normal.

203
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,160
You like the Young Marshal,

204
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,400
and I'm behind you.

205
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
But right now,

206
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,720
don't make things harder for me.

207
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,080
Just wait,

208
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,880
and I'll bring it up, okay?

209
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,120
Who says that's normal?

210
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,920
Who made that rule?

211
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,360
Nowadays, one-on-one is normal.

212
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,440
By your logic,

213
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,680
if men can marry several wives,

214
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,920
shouldn't I be allowed

215
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,120
more husbands?

216
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,080
Wanwan.

217
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,160
Well.

218
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,160
Let me test her, okay?

219
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Father,

220
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,880
help me keep Dai Shiyao busy a while.

221
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,120
I swear.

222
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,800
I won't stir up trouble.

223
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,880
Wanwan.

224
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,680
Please, Father.

225
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,800
Just help me this once.

226
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,700
Come on, please go.

227
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm begging you, hurry.

228
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,440
Young Marshal.

229
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Can we talk in private?

230
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,800
