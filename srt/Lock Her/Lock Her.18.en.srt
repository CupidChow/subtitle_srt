Madam,

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,040
who kidnapped us?

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,440
Can we still make it back?

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't worry.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,660
He won't do anything reckless.

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,960
I'll get you home safe.

17
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,640
It's from the West.

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,960
Coffee.

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,920
Did they agree to relocate

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,880
Huang's private granary?

21
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,320
Relax. Everything's taken care of.

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,920
Young Marshal.

23
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,240
Do you think we'll really fight?

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
Our strength is barely enough.

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,600
Even if we scrape by this time,

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,280
there will be a next time

27
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,420
and another after that.

28
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
Nancheng

29
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,240
is just one link in the warlord chaos.

30
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,440
The peace we long for

31
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,200
won't come so easily.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
In times like these,

33
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,400
there are too many evil men

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,680
clinging to petty obsessions

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,000
and stirring up storms.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,130
If we survive this time,

37
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,960
I want to hold an acknowledgment ritual,

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,240
bring my brother Sheng home,

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,380
and give him a rightful name.

40
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,280
Stop with these Western gadgets.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,240
Why, Young Marshal?

42
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,320
Life's bitter enough as it is.

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,600
Why drink something so bitter?

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,520
I'll add extra sugar for you.

45
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Why?

46
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,180
Because your father is a traitor.

47
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,440
My father was framed.

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,880
Dai Shiyao already found the evidence.

49
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,280
You'll be carrying the weight

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,080
of 36 innocent lives of the Qin family

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,280
and my lifelong hatred for you.

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,320
Sheng,

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
I came to ask for a drink.

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,280
Perfect timing.

55
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,400
I have something to ask you.

56
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,160
Was there more
to the Qin family incident?

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,760
Why was there no news about it at all

58
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,080
when I sent people to Chongqing?

59
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,120
Matters this confidential

60
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,670
aren't for just anyone to know.

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,440
At this very moment,

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,430
you're still hung up

63
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,230
on something already settled?

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,520
That's just ridiculous.

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,800
That girl must've

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,440
confused you,

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
trying to fool you

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
to clear her family's name.

69
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,600
In war, triumph takes countless lives.

70
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,600
In these turbulent times,

71
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,890
wiping out a few families

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,440
is nothing out of the ordinary.

73
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,360
What we need to do now

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,480
is focus on how to challenge Liu Yong,

75
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,920
not waste effort

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,680
on the Qin family that's long gone.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
Sheng,

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
you're not like Shiyao.

79
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,920
You're decisive in action

80
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,840
and know what's worth the fight.

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
You're the real one fit
to be the Marshal.

82
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
Great-grandfather.

83
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,480
What are you doing?

84
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,040
What's the point

85
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,400
of keeping a useless maid?

86
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,120
Dai Congling.

87
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,280
None of this is about Dai Shiyao.

88
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,120
It's all you.

89
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,320
You should've died
with your parents that day.

90
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,080
You're behind everything.

91
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
You set up my father

92
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,480
and forged an excuse to kill my family

93
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,880
to disrupt Nancheng's finances

94
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,400
and the Dai family's supply lines.

95
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,280
Now, you've kidnapped me

96
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,960
to spark a war between Dai Shiyao
and Liu Yong.

97
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,280
You've done all this

98
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,640
because you want to rule Nancheng.

99
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,120
You're a monster.

100
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,360
Dai Shiyao will never believe you.

101
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,840
Just the master of Nancheng?

102
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,040
You're underestimating me.

103
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,640
But you are sharp.

104
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,720
Sharp people rarely last long.

105
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,520
Me,

106
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,760
Shiyao,

107
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,720
and Sheng.

108
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,480
We're family

109
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,880
bound by blood.

110
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
But you

111
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,680
are just a traitor's orphan.

112
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,120
Someone who shouldn't still be here.

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,160
As for those schemes you mentioned,

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,360
once this war is over,

115
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,920
they'll vanish like smoke.

116
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,680
You gave me your word.

117
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,120
Drag her out.

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,080
Madam.

119
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,960
Can we still make it back?

120
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,600
Don't worry.

121
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,340
He won't do anything reckless.

122
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,800
Madam, that's a gunshot.

123
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
I slept quite well.

124
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,920
That's wonderful.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,260
Since you moved in,

126
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,920
you've had nightmares
almost every night.

127
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,780
You finally

128
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,240
slept peacefully.

129
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,600
Then I'll get back to work.

130
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,080
Miss, you should get up now.

131
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,360
Be careful.

132
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,960
