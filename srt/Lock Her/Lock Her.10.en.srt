The rear sight.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,280
The aim.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,600
And the bottle.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,480
Keep aligned.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,800
Keep the gun steady.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,520
Gently press with your finger.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,080
It's fine; try again.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,680
This is way too far.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,040
No way I can hit that.

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,840
If you learn how to shoot,

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,160
then next time you see your enemy,

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,660
you can take them down in one shot.

24
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,280
Aren't you afraid that once I learn,

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,040
you might be the one I hurt?

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,960
If I'm willing to teach you,

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,360
it means your family's matter

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,720
has some new leads.

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,640
What kind of leads?

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,960
Mingmen Shipping keeps a low profile,

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,300
but its overseas records still exist.

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,540
(Investigation)
On April 9th,

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,680
Mingmen Shipping
passed Huanghai to Jizhou.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,960
That day, your father did ship goods.

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,240
They left with porcelain

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,160
but arrived in Jizhou with fabric.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,560
Someone swapped the cargo en route.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,160
Why would they do that?

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,960
Your father built my finance system

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,360
in Nancheng.

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
Someone's trying

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
to cut off my supply line.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,920
Then my father...

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,440
I still haven't figured out

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,840
who swapped the goods,

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,120
but this piece of evidence

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,160
at least proves
that when the cargo left port,

48
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,360
your father was in the clear.

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
Continue.

50
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,600

and you had me train all day.

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,180
It didn't make it worse, right?

60
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,300
A slow apprentice

61
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,300
takes more energy.

62
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,780
I'm not slow.

63
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,940
Didn't I shoot pretty well in the end?

64
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,180
Of course.

65
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,460
I was asking about your injury.

66
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,940
Has it gotten worse?

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,220
Just stop

68
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,860
picking fights with me daily.

69
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,860
That's because you tell me nothing.

70
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,140
If I told you before I was sure,

71
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,740
it'd just add one more burden.

72
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,500
I only want you to be happy.

73
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,620
Leave the rest to me.

74
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,140
Tired?

75
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,140
Not at all.

76
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,260
I've been teaching you all afternoon.

77
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,700
Don't I deserve a reward?

78
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,980
So stingy.

79
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,380
You want a reward?

80
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,540
Work usually comes with pay.

81
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,040
Even soldiers get paid when marching.

82
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,220
Then...

83
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,740
I'll sing you a song?

84
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,340
Sing a song?

85
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,740
I may not sing as well as a singer,

86
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,740
but it's worth a listen.

87
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,300

The Young Marshal in Nancheng

105
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,420
is nothing but a coward

106
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,180
and is scared of death.

107
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,500
Look at me.

108
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,680
I walk in and out of Nancheng freely

109
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,060
because Dai Shiyao fears my uncle.

110
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,360
The two cities are so close.

111
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,380
He's just a turtle hiding in its shell.

112
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,180
Some time ago,

113
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,620
I caused a little trouble.

114
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,900
My uncle met him at the city gate.

115
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,300
He was scared out of his wits

116
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,420
and brought a chest of gold
to apologize.

117
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,500
A chest of gold?

118
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,100
What are you doing?

119
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,940
Drink with me.

120
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,900
I'm just a waitress.

121
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,820
Let go of me.

122
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,060
Do you know what cherry blossom means?

123
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,060
I'm not being difficult.

124
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,820
I have a Japanese friend.

125
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,340
Say "Welcome" to him in Japanese.

126
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,580
Then I'll let you go.

127
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,780
Say it.

128
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,170
Darn it.

129
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,660
I caught a Japanese female spy.

130
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,180
Please, let me go.

131
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,140
Let me go, please.

132
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,940
Come on.

133
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,100
Everyone, take a look.

134
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,260
In Nancheng,

135
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,380
I caught a treacherous traitor.

136
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,900
I caught

137
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,780
this traitor red-handed.

138
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,540
There she is.

139
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,620
This wine

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,620

141
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
That drink was spiked.

142
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,060
Can't you see it?

143
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,060
Try it.

144
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,900
Don't be scared.

145
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,580
That traitor

146
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,180
is hiding in the diner behind me.

147
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,460
Where are you going?

148
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,940
I'm going to get her out.

With what, exactly?

150
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,850
If I don't help her,

151

even if she survives,

152
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,980
she'll end up like me,
