don't come out.

I got a new safety amulet for you.

Do you like it?

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,640
Yeah, I do.

I'll even sleep with it on.

I, Qin Shiyue, swear to heaven,

18
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,160
(Mingmen Shipping Company)
I will clear my father's name.

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,200
I will take down the ones who hurt you

I came to...

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,040
M-Madam.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,280
Let her in.

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
Are you insane?

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,880

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,160
slapped her twice

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,600
and got shot by Young Marshal.

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,440
You'd better stand still.

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,920

(Mingmen Shipping Company)

37
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,670
Why are you here?

38
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,360
I saw your door was open,

39
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,840
so I thought I'd come in for a look.

40
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,840
A look?

41
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,720
For what?

42
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,680
I've already looked around.

43
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Nice style.

44
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,760
I'll get going then.

45
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
Since you're here already,

46
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,160
why not stay a bit?

47
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,840
You heard Grandma's decision.

48
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,000
For some things,

49
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,920
timing doesn't really matter.

50
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,600
Wait a sec.

51
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,680
Wait for what?

52
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,200
Your beard feels a bit prickly.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Prickly?

54
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,130
Yeah.

55
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,280
How about this,

56
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,480
I'll shave it for you.

57
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,240
I often shave my father's at home.

58
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,880
Alright.

59
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,160
Let's see your skills.

60
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,100
Not bad at all.

61
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,360
Pretty spot-on.

62
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
My dad taught me.

63
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
Your father taught you well.

64
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,290
But what's the point of that?

65
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,200
In times like these,

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,600
he might as well teach me to shoot,

67
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,200
teach me how to take a life.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,720
That's the only way to protect family.

69
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,880
Who told you that?

70
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,000
You think that is the only way?

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
Isn't it true?

72
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
What can truly protect this world

73
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,920
is not taking lives,

74
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
but sparing them.

75
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,440
So you need to live well.

76
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll keep the Dai family safe,

78

and most of all, you.

79
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,760
Go protect my sister instead.

80
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
She's the one you're engaged to.

81
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,760
Don't pretend you don't remember.

82
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,440

92
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,280

My father, Qin Huai, isn't like that.

160
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Your father is a big name in business.

161

170
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,030
you'd already decided
when you walked in

171
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,600
that you'd use yourself as leverage

172
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
