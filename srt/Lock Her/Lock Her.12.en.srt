11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,640
(I stabbed him yesterday.)

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,960
(It has nothing to do with this, right?)

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,600
(What if someone sees that wound?)

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,920
(Should I tell someone about it?)

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,080
How did Dai Shiyao get hurt?

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,440
They said he fought scouts
in Wuyi Alley.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,360
I'm asking you:

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,840
What's the story behind the stab wound?

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,200
He's got exceptional skills.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
No one can get close enough to touch him

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,120
except for you.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,160
Right.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,800
I injured him by accident.

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,360
An accident?

25
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,120
You nearly pierced his whole shoulder.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,040
If he were hit by shrapnel

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,160
or grazed by bullets,

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,720
those can still be called accidents.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,320
But a short blade

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,000
was driven straight into his shoulder.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,480
You call that an accident?

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,480
That's between me and the Young Marshal.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,320
This is a marital affair.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,640
I owe you no explanation.

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,760
I get it now.

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,440
When there's danger,

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,240
you hide behind marital affairs.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,320
When there's no danger,

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,240
you suspect him, hurt him,

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
and play your revenge games.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,280
Don't think I don't know
what's on your mind.

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,400
He's been digging into your case,

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,560
staying up all night
at the Police Bureau.

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,560
He's done so much for you,

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,680
but you

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,040
treat him like a murderer.

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
Do you even have a brain

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,800
or any feelings at all?

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,160
If you've got time to argue with me,

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,960
go treat the Young Marshal.

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,880
If you hadn't stabbed him,

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,920
could a few scouts have hurt him?

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,480
I wouldn't have had to treat his wounds.

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,760
If anything happens to him,

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,960
all of Nancheng will be in danger.

56
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,240
Qin Shiyue.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,160
Think this through carefully.

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,440
What matters more to you,

59
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,280
your family's honor or Nancheng?

60
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,120
What's your name?

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,040
Come here.

62
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll call you Gray.

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,640
Madam.

64
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,560
You haven't eaten all night.

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,560
Have something.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,640
Jinxiu.

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,600
Do you think I'm unworthy
of the Young Marshal?

68
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Of course not.

69
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
From what I see,

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,120
you and the Young Marshal
are meant to be.

71
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,920
What about Su Wanwan?

72
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
Su Wanwan acting eager like that

73
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,280
at most could be a concubine.

74
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
She'd have to greet you every day

75
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
and bring your foot bath.

76
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,280
So, you also believe the Young Marshal

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,760
would marry several women?

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Families of such standing

79
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
often have a few concubines.

80
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,400
But I think the Young Marshal
only has eyes for you.

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,600
Gray.

82
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,400
Do you believe what she said?

83
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,000
I sure don't.

84
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Madam...

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,160
You just recovered.

86
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,920
You still need more bed rest.

87
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
I'm fine.

88
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,360
I just wanted to take a walk

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,760
and get some fresh air.

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,920
I saved your life this time.

91
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,840
Don't you owe me one?

92
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200
Alright.

93
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
I want to join the army.

94
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,320
I want to be your combat medic.

95
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
No way.

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,040
Miss Su is highly skilled

97
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,200
and has great ambition.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,400
If she can take care of you

99
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,680
as a combat medic,

100
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
that would be perfect.

101
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,800
Young Marshal,

102
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,320
let Miss Su stay with you.

103
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
Miss Qin,

104
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,920
how kind of you.

105
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,240
I'll head out first.

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,400
Wait.

107
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,360
Did Wanwan upset you?

108
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,880
No.

109
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,200
Then why won't you even look at me?

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,880
What did she tell you?

111
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,920
Miss Su is selfless.

112
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,720
Whatever she says is right.

113
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm just being petty.

114
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
I think you're sulking.

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
No.

116
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,260
You're feeling wronged.

117
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,720
No.

118
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,880
And maybe a little jealous.

119
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Not at all.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
In my heart,

121
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,800
I don't care about selflessness.

122
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,640
I only care about my wife.

123
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,400
Stop saying things like that.

124
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,520
Alright.

125
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,200
Grandma wants us to take
wedding photos tomorrow.

126
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,960
She says it's for a keepsake.

127
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,700
We'll go in the morning.

128
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,000
- I don't want to.
- That's an order.

129
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,440
I'm not your soldier.

130
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,360
It's Grandma's order.

131
