11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,760
Give it to me.

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,840
I stabbed you the other day.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,880
Why aren't you mad?

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,200
You were having a nightmare.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,120
Why haven't you yelled at me?

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
I used to have nightmares, too.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,360
When I was 12,

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,640
my father taught me to kill.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,440
He caught deserters and convicts

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,840
and locked them in the dungeon.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,880
He forced me to aim a gun at them.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,720
I couldn't see their faces.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,960
Just the blood
on the backs of their heads

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,440
was enough to show they'd been tortured.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,800
My dad told me

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,320
this was a family tradition

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,600
passed down from our ancestors.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,640
He said I was born to be a marshal,

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,800
and a marshal must learn to shoot.

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,200
I never agreed with that.

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,280
So, I had nightmares every night.

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,680
Later,

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,680
I stole a knife

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,360
and hid it under my pillow.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,620
Every time I woke from a nightmare,

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,480
I'd swing the knife wildly.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,400
Later,

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,180
my father took my mother

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,920
and me to a birthday feast,

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,800
and we were ambushed on the way.

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,240
Gunfire roared back and forth
like thunder.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,280
I looked at their faces.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,800
I didn't even dare to pick up a gun.

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,400
But I've taken lives before.

45
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,970
I saw my father and mother

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,280
die horribly in front of me.

47
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,840
A bullet tore through my mother's belly.

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,000
One through my father's head.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,320
Then I grabbed a gun and shot them.

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,880
It all happened within a minute.

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,360
If I'd made that choice
one minute earlier,

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
maybe my parents would still be alive.

53
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,000
I looked at my father's body

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and only then believed

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,120
maybe what he said was true.

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,520
If you want revenge,

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
you've got to be healthy.

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,960
Still not drinking?

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,000
Shiyue, you're here.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,280
Have a seat.

61
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,480
Since you're awake,

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,520
you need to eat well to recover.

63
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,600
Look here.

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,440
This is fish maw from Donghai.

65
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
And that's lamb from Beiguan.

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,440
Grandma.

67
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,900
Shiyue just recovered from an illness.

68
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,560
Is it okay for her

69
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,080
to eat such strong tonics?

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,040
You don't understand.

71
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,240
Old Madam.

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
Old Madam.

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,240
The master from Shanghai is here.

74
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
Old Madam.

75
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,240
I'm back.

76
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,020
(Dai Congling)

77
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,880
Everyone's here.

78
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,680
You little rascal.

79
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,520
Won't you even greet me?

80
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,360
Uncle.

81
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,920
You came without saying a word.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,680
I could've picked you up.

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,240
If I told you, it's not a surprise.

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Old Madam.

85
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,720
Do you like this surprise?

86
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
A surprise from Congling

87
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,800
always makes me happy.

88
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,280
That's what matters.

89
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,360
You came just in time.

90
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,760
Let's have dinner together.

91
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,920
Sure, I'm actually starving.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,360
Oh, I have a friend here.

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,480
Sheng, come here.

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,440
Sheng and I shared

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,920
dangerous moments in Guangzhou.

96
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,760
You could say we're sworn friends.

97
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,880
A true friendship beyond age.

98
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,800
Since I'm back in Nancheng,

99
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,240
I had to pay him a visit.

100
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,120
I brought him here

101
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,560
and invited him for a meal.

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,720
You don't mind, right?

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,800
It won't matter.

104
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,200
He's already here anyway.

105
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,280
Come on, Sheng.

106
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,120
Have a seat.

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Don't you want to know
about Mingmen Shipping?

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,920
I can tell you.

109
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,640
Mingmen Shipping is a vessel.

110
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,560
On paper, it moves antiques

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
and exports porcelain.

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,360
In reality, it moves weapons.

113
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,840
The whole ship runs militarized.

114
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,780
All kept in the shadows.

115
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,560
They say your father's shipment

116
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,720
went through that ship

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000
to Japan.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,560
You mean my father was smuggling?

119
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,320
Keep your voice down.

120
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,000
It's just a rumor.

121
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
Smuggling relics is minor,

122
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,920
but treason is huge.

123
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,760
If you truly want the truth,

124
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,840
just get the logbook of that ship.

125
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,040
With it, you'll know what your father

126
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,280
was really transporting

127
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,400
and where it was headed.

128
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,600
As for whether your father was framed,

129
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,160
the truth will come out naturally.

130
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
How can I get that logbook?

131
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,800
It's not easy.

132
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,100
Too many interests are involved.

133
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,200
How is Dai Shiyao tied to this?

134
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,000
My brother guards Nancheng,

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,640
so he has arms reserves.

136
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,480
I have some other key leads.

137
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
Let's talk next time.

138
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,620
(Theater Ticket)

139
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Shiyao,

140
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,480
what do you think

141
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,640
of the request from Shanghai?

142
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,760
I'm not that ambitious.

143
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
I just want to keep the peace here.

144
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,440
Your father raised you up

145
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,480
not to have you hiding in fear.

146
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Only in chaos do heroes rise.

147
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,000
If you work with Shanghai

148
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,480
and the Coalition Army,

149
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,920
you could form a new government.

150
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,410
All those kinds

151
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,680
of governments don't matter.

152
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,280
As long as we have men and guns,

153
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,040
we can do it, too.

154
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,200
Ambitions alone

155
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,760
won't get us far.

156
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,920
You're always

157
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,840
too soft-hearted.

158
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,840
You're not as decisive as Sheng.

159
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Uncle,

160
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
why compare me to Sheng?

161
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,000
Why not?

162
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
If we came from the same background,

163
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,080
I might even outdo you.

164
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,840
You're young and promising.

165
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,760
You'll surely achieve greatness.

166
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,520
Besides,
heroes aren't judged by origins.

167
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,800
Come on, let's have a drink.

168
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
Why stand there?

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
Sit and eat up.

170

172
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,760
Miss, we're here.

173
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,320
Thanks.

174
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
Miss Qin, what brings you here?

175
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,240
What?

176
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,780
You came to enjoy the music?

177
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,080
I need to talk to you.

178
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,320
Come with me.

179
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,080
Go invite the Young Marshal to the show.

180
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,720
Tell him I want to discuss the situation

181
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
in Chongqing with him.

182
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,080
Yes.

183
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,000
What?

184
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,800
Did you miss me?

185
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,600
Can you mind your boundaries?

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,840
What boundaries?

187
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,680
You came to me first today.

188
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,400
You're the one who should watch it.

189
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,960
Go ahead.

190
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,400
What clues do you have?

191
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,800
What's the rush?

192
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,720
Can't you wait after the show?

193
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
What are you looking at?

194
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm not your adulterer.

195
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Why so tense?

196
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
Don't like the show?

197
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
Or scared Dai Shiyao gets jealous?

198
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,240
No.

199
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,400
What are you afraid of?

200
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,400
We're in the same boat now.

201
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,440
Sheng,

202
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,800
we're just partners.

203
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,000
Partners?

204
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,880
Isn't that the best spark of all?

205
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,360
Don't you think?

206
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
If you don't tell me, I'm leaving.

207
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,080
Go ahead.

208
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,320
(Mingmen Shipping)
Mingmen Shipping is a vessel.

209
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,000
If you truly want the truth,

210
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,080
just get the logbook of that ship.

211
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,640
With it, you'll know what your father

212
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,000
was really transporting

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
and where it was headed.

214
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,320
As for whether your father was framed,

215
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,880
the truth will come out naturally.

216
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,460
Why are you still here?

217
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,540
Are you telling me or not?

218
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,000
Shh.

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,640
Wait till the show is over.

220
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,720
Come on.

221
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,380
(Jinxiu Grand Theater)

222
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,720
I watched the play with you.

223
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,160
Time to keep your promise, right?

224
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,360
What's the rush?

225
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,840
If your deal was a date with me,

226
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,920
at least go through with it.

227
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,400
Don't push it.

228
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Don't get me wrong.

229
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,200
I just meant

230
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,320
taking you home.

231
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Pretty innocent, right?

232
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,200
That's your comfort zone, right?

233
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,740
What are you hesitating for?

234
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,440
Alright.

235
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,480
You can take me home now.

236
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,000
But I want to talk a bit more.

237
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,440
Why were you with Dai Shiyao's uncle?

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
Trying to control me now?

239
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,760
Who you're with is not my business.

240
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,760
I'm just curious.

241
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm here talking romance with you,

242
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
and you're just pretending.

243
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,380
What a surprise you see through it.

244
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,200
Let me out of the car.

245
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,440
You never planned

246
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,680
to tell me any clues today.

247
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,360
Next time you come to the theater,

248
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,080
I'll tell you for sure.

249
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,360
That's my brother's car.

250
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,600
I need to get out.

251
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
Get out?

252
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
Can you explain this?

253
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,040
I...

254
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,920
Young Marshal,

255
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
that looks like Master Sheng's car.

256
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,800
Fine.

257
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,080
If you dare, get out.

258
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,160
I'll see how you explain

259
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,200
why we're both in the car.

260
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,400
Fine.

261
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,440
If you dare, open the door.

262
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,220
I'd like to see

263
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,200
who he'd take down first

264
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,280
after he got us wrong.
