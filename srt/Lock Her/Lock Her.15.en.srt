What's going on with you?

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,960
Nothing.

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,240
Shouldn't you report
on the 6th of each month?

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,800
Shiyao,

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,120
I've been thinking
about something lately.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,920
Do you think fate's set by heaven,

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,600
or is it shaped by ourselves?

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
It's set by heaven.

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,720
Heaven set you as my brother.

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,720
Then if heaven's in charge,

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
what's there left to report?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,280
We can still work something out.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
But rules still have to be kept.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,720
Without rules,

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,360
it just leads to more chaos.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,000
I was born into chaos.

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,880
Why not end me now

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,380
and put an end to all this?

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,680
You know I could end you.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,680
Don't be so childish.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
It's really late.

32
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,080
You're still not going home?

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,320
The city's been a mess lately.

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
I questioned some spies

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,040
we just caught today.

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,680
I'm going over their statements.

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,620
Then I'm not heading back either.

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,020
I'll keep you company here.

39
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,760
Suit yourself.

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
Say what's on your mind.

41
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,920
Dai Shiyao,

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,240
I like you.

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,120
I really like you.

44
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,200
I can take care of you.

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,160
Could you

46
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,400
marry me too?

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,080
I can accept being like them.

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,080
I don't have to be your wife.

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,920
I can be your concubine.

50
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,160
Wanwan,

51
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,760
you're Officer Su's precious girl

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
and the first in Nancheng

53
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,440
to study medicine in Germany.

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
You're so remarkable.

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,620
How could you become

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,720
someone's concubine?

57
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,130
I don't care.

58
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
I've made up my mind.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,360
My father

60
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,880
has several concubines.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,720
All this time,

62
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,680
everyone's been like this.

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,600
I don't care

64
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,300
for those foreign customs.

65
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,480
Shiyao,

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,400
the only one I want is you.

67
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,760
- Wanwan.
- Qin Shiyue is fine with it.

68
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,440
Are you still going to turn me down?

69
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,060
Is it because I'm not pretty enough,

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,240
- or is it...
- How do you know she's fine with it?

71
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,520
Didn't she already say

72
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,320
I could be your combat medic?

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,440
Shiyue's not fine with it.

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,640
She just trusts me

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
and believes in you.

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,960
What do you mean?

77
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,920
You're the best female doctor
in Nancheng.

78
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,520
You know surgery,

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
nursing,

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,720
and first aid.

81
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,520
You're a kind person.

82
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,640
And you have your own beliefs.

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,600
Shiyue told me before

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,120
that she really admires you,

85
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
and she respects you a lot.

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,360
I don't buy that.

87
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
She'd never say anything nice about me.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,840
Wanwan.

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,200
One day, you'll understand.

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
When you truly love someone,

91
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
no one else can fit in your heart.

92
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,760
I still have to interrogate tonight.

93
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,520
So, I won't be going back.

94
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,640
I'll have someone take you home.

95
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,360
I...

96
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,560
(What do I lack compared to Qin Shiyue?)

97
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,440
(If she weren't here,)

98
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,840
(he'd surely be with me.)

99
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,360

then go ahead.

141
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,520
He's been digging into your case,

142
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,680
staying up all night
at the Police Bureau,

143
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,760
yet you treat him like a murderer.

144
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
Do you even have a brain?

145
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,760
Or any feelings at all?

146
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,960
You're awake.

147
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,480

148
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,600
Much better.

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,680

looking after Madam with care,

154
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
and keeping her safe.

155
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,580

Say that again,

159
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,000
and I'll break your legs, too.

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,140
