Shiyue,

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,800
I could be sober
even if I drink a lot of wine.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,000
Look at you, such poor tolerance.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,000
Just one glass made you dizzy.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,560
Miss Qin.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,680
Miss Su.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,600
I never expected
this young lady to have such nerve.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,320
Challenging me to a drinking contest?

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,200
Truly worthy of the Qin family.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,480
Drinking contest?

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Miss Su, I didn't...

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
Alright.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,000
I accept your challenge.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,080
- Good drinker.
- Not bad.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,440
Your turn.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,120
This must be the lady
the Young Marshal brought.

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,440
Why aren't you drinking?

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,960
Afraid you can't keep up?

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,960
Planning to flee later?

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,520
Even losing beats cowardly escape.

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,640
Come on, have one.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,880
Just one, alright?

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,080
- One drink.
- Just drink.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,880
Miss Su, is this fine with you?

35
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,040
Since it's a drinking contest,

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,600
who stops after one glass?

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,920
Split all the drinks
on this table in two.

38
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,960
Whoever finishes first

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,000
will be the winner.

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,680
If you don't want to compete,

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
you can admit defeat.

42
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,200
I admit it.

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,920
Miss Qin, your father, Qin Huai,

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,680
is legendary for never being outdrunk.

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,680
How is it you...?

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,640
Qin Huai?

47
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,920
Wasn't he rumored to fund the Japanese?

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,280
You're a traitor's daughter?

49
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,080
Those are baseless rumors!

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,320
Rumors?

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,320
Is Qin Huai's tolerance legendary?

52
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,600
Or that Qin Huai

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,120
is nothing but a lackey?

54
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,960
A traitor?

55
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,560
Which is a rumor?

56
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,040
Do you have proof?

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,830
You're slandering my father.

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Apologize!

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,450
Truth lives in the public conscience.

60
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,480
Want my apology?

61
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,480
Alright.

62
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Win this contest.

63
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,040
Then I'll apologize.

64
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
You heard that?

65
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,280
Drink up.

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,160
Come on. Scared?

67
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,640
Weren't you demanding justice?

68
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,480
Then drink.

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
But here's the deal first.

70
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,760
If you lose,

71
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,680
you'll voluntarily break off
your engagement to Dai Shiyao.

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,040
Engagement?

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,040
She's engaged to the Young Marshal?

74
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,320
Engaged to a traitor's daughter?

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
Another round.

76
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,440
You heard that?

77
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,360
Another round.

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,640
- Come on!
- Drink up!

79
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,480
Lost your nerve?

80
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,150
Don't you want to prove the innocence?

81
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,990
Drink up!

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,840
Come on, drink!

83
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,720
Drink it! Hurry up!

84
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,840
Aren't you here to prove yourself?

85
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,340
Drink, what are you waiting for?

86
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,520
- Drink!
- Or are you scared?

87
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,720
Didn't you hear me?

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,280
Drink to prove you're clean.

89
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,080
Aren't you proving yourself? Then drink!

90
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,160
- Hurry up!
- Drink it!

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,080
Drink!

92
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,920

143
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,120
Might get stabbed more often now.

Doesn't it hurt?

147
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,360
Hurts at first.

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,600
Then numbness sets in.

149

As long as I'm breathing,

150
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,440
none of this really matters.

151
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,680
Thanks.

152
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,160
This...

153
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,680
This scar

154
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,760
is from when I was 16.

155
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
It was my first mission for my brother.

156
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,040
Even though I'd trained for ages,

157
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,000
when it came to the real thing,

158
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,080
I still got slashed.

159
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
Back then,

160
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,640
were you scared?

161
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Of course, I was scared.

162
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,720
It was the first time I realized

163
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
a person can lose that much blood.

164
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,080
Just think about it,

165
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,960
white garments

166
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,560
turning red in an instant.

167
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,280
Like it was thrown in filthy water,

168
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,520
soaking wet and sticky.

169
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,720
This scar?

170
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,800
I got it at Beiyang Warehouse
from a shell hit.

171
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,760
Shells hit harder

172
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,120
than blades.

173
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,120
And it was all for your brother?

174
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,040
Every scar I bear

175
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,680
is for my brother.

176
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,680
I fought to build his world.

177
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,920
Got used to it.

178
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,760
But today's wound

179
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,360
is for you.

180
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,160
For me?

181
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,400
Oh, right.

182
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,240
This is for you.

183
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,400
Didn't I tell you

184
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,960
to stop giving me gifts?

185
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,920

from Mingmen Shipping.

186
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,440

188
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,040

189
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,640
just for this?

190
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,160
I promised

191
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,280
