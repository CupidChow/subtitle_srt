11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,440
Adjutant Wen,

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,960
are you married?

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,960
No.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,640
Then do you have a fiancée?

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,480
No, I don't.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,840
So,

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,920
you already have someone you like?

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
Let's just focus
on getting the drawing board

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,620
with the Young Marshal and Madam.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,000
They are walking very slowly.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
What if

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,480
you hadn't gone?

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,260
It might have turned into a fight,

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,880
or maybe they would've feared our power,

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,480
and nothing would've happened.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,120
Then why

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,440
did it have to be you?

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,480
It didn't have to be me.

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,520
Someone else

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,120
could've made the same choice I did.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,760
Our ancestors endured so much hardship.

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,760
Hate and anger will never truly fade.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,640
It's hard to ease all that.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,260
The hard part's not the process

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,040
but the state of mind.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
I want a peaceful and prosperous era

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
with refined elegance

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,860
and normal seasonal changes.

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,040
I want a pure and simple life

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
full of thoughts of you

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,880
without killing.

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,800
How about I get you
something tasty later?

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,640
Come on, be careful.

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,120
One step at a time.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,440

I'd never again live this kind

71
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,890
of peaceful and happy life.

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,880
What's wrong?

73
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,480
Are you upset?

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
No.

75
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,950
I just think it's really rare.

76
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,320

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,180
in my memory,

80
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,120
Shiyue was such a playful

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,000
and lively girl.

82
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,360
But now, she

83
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,720
has become depressed

84
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,800
because of deep grudges.

85
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,720
Do you know how much I wish
I could carry it all for you?

86
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,200

No idea.

107
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,960
Maybe he's busy with his own stuff.

108
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,920
He's my younger brother.

109
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,360
As the elder, I'm like a father to him.

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
But since we were kids,

111
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,480
I never truly cared for him.

112
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,800
So I share the blame

113
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,400

Grandma was right.

117
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,320
Maybe

118
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,000
only by letting go of hatred

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,320
can the deceased rest in peace.

120
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,880

this is your distant uncle.

128
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,920
Do you still remember?

129
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,200
When you were little,

130
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,440
you even wet yourself on me.

131
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,480
Of course, I remember.

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,160
Now, he's a professor
at Kyoto University.

133
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,320
You're flattering me.

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,920

149
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720

151
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,240
Please, have some tea first.

152
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,640
Alright.

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,600
Here, please.

154
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,560
Why are you acting like a kid?

155
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,800
I've never liked it since childhood,

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,720
when all the grown-ups gathered.

157
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,280
I was actually the most rebellious one.

When I was little,

my whole family went to your place.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
There were so many people back then.

161
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,000
