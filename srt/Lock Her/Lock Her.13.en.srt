11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,480
This road doesn't lead
to the Dai Residence.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,960
Hand over the bag.

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,160
Do you know who I am?

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,680
A war is about to break out.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,020
I don't care who you are.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,000
Give it here.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,680
- Let go.
- Let go.

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,600
Give it to me.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,040
A charming lady.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,120
Get away from me.

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,200
How did I end up here?

22
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,940
I remember I was attacked

23
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,520
by a rickshaw puller.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Then...

25
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,640
Didn't Dai Shiyao tell you

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,740
to stay put in that cage
at the Dai Residence

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,760
and just be his wife?

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,600
You're always trying to run out.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
What exactly do you want?

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,320
None of your business.

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
Go back.

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
There are ten more
rickshaw pullers outside

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,680
wanting to grab your money first

34
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,880
and then take you away.

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
Still dare to go out?

36
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,560
I don't believe it.

37
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,880
You don't?

38
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,280
Step outside, and I'll break your legs.

39
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,960
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,480
I'm teaching you a lesson.

41
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,800
From now on,

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,800
stay away

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,120
from danger.

44
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,080
Got it?

45
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,130
I'm not in the mood

46
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,670
to play games with you here.

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
But since I ran into you today,

48
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,320
I need to ask you something.

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,880
Go ahead.

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,040
Sheng,

51
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,720
did you lie to me about anything?

52
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,800
70% true, 30% not.

53
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,880
Was saving me today real?

54
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,160
Of course.

55
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,440
What about that Nautical Logbook?

56
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,920
That's definitely real.

57
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,960
Have you ever read that logbook?

58
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,040
I handed it to you right away.

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,640
Why would I bother reading it?

60
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,320
Then how many volumes are there in it?

61
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
Are you interrogating me now?

62
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,120
I saved your life.

63
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,800
Yet you question me like I'm on trial.

64
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,440
Had I known you'd be so ungrateful,

65
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,040
I should've let that rickshaw puller

66
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,320
do whatever he wanted to you.

67
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,280
I literally saved your life.

68
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,480
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

69
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,920
Thanks.

70
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,320
Is that all?

71
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,240
I ran over ten kilometers to find this.

72
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
I thought Miss Qin

73
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,920
only ate the finest delicacies.

74
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,480
This cost just a few copper coins.

75
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,960
It's for the mooncake
from our childhood.

76
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,800
Now, we're even.

77
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
Go on, have a bite.

78
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
It's not the price that makes food good.

79
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,760
A cheap mookcake it may be,

80
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,160
but it tastes like reunion.

81
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,800
Missing home?

82
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
Not really.

83
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,680
I thought you'd treat me to a feast.

84
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,040
But it's just one mookcake.

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,880
Want a feast? I've got that.

86
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
What do you want?

87
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm craving fish.

88
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,480
Fish?

89
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,760
There's a river behind my family home.

90
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,080
My father often fished there.

91
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,980
After he caught one,

92
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,020
my mother would cook it for us.

93
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,860
You just reminded me.

94
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,180
Night Queen

95
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,540
just got a batch of fresh fish.

96
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,460
It'd be a shame not to eat them.

97
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,580
Let me cook for you.

98
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,780
Wait here.

99
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,900
You're cooking yourself?

100
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,260
I'll show you what I can do.

101
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,820
Soon.

102
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,540
Go to Zuixian Tavern

103
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,020
and get me a plate of Squirrel Fish.

104
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,460
Remember to use the back door.

105
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,980
Make it quick.

106
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:12,340
(Zuixian Tavern)

107
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,580
If it weren't for my old ties
with General Dai,

108
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,260
I wouldn't have come to this meal.

109
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,340
I appreciate you making time for me.

110
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,500
No need to be so polite with me.

111
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,060
My face doesn't matter.

112
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,060
It's Marshal Liu's face that matters.

113
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,500
You broke his nephew's leg

114
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,140
and his nephew's arm.

115
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,540
That's like slapping Marshal Liu's face.

116
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,380
Why should I make time for you,

117
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,220
Young Marshal?

118
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,780
The situation was urgent,

119
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,820
and it was at night,

120
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,300
so I couldn't see clearly.

121
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,260
But your bullets saw it

122
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,380
and went straight to him.

123
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,980
If my bullet could see,

124
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,700
then it would've hit

125
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,740
right in his head.

126
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,300
Shiyao,

127
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,540
how could you say that?

128
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,780
When young folks mess up, they admit it.

129
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,100
Say you're wrong, and then work it out.

130
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,420
Don't you get that simple truth?

131
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,060
This kid...

132
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,450
Shicong,

133
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,740
don't stoop to his level.

134
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,780
Let me drink with you.

135
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,380
That night, it was at this restaurant?

136
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,540
It was outside.

137
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,260
There's something I've always wondered.

138
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,500
As the Young Marshal

139
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,580
and the master of the city,

140
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,500
how do you weigh the stakes in all this?

141
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,140
The two cities are worlds apart.

142
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,220
We've always had different views.

143
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,260
Yet at this critical moment,

144
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,460
you hurt the Marshal's nephew,

145
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,180
ignoring the safety of everyone here.

146
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,940
Was it really all just

147
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,900
for an ordinary waitress?

148
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,900
It was my mistake.

149
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,460
I'll make the proper apology.

150
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,660
If I could do it again,

151
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,020
things might not end like this.

152
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,500
That's more like it.

153
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,380
Useless.

154
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,500
You...

155
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,300
Such a fine meal on the table.

156
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,740
Don't let one girl ruin the mood.

157
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,100
Do me a favor.

158
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,580
From now on, we can say

159
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,100
we've been through life and death.

160
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,980
Respect.

161
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,020
Exactly.

162
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
Don't let a small thing ruin the mood.

163
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,500
