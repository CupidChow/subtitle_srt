You really can cook?

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,520
I can do plenty more than that.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,720
Come on, have a taste.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,760
How is it?

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,360
Did you actually make this?

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,600
It's hard to believe.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,840
Why are you so suspicious?

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,040
Got it.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Thanks, Sheng.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,800
Thanks for saving me today, Sheng.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
Thanks for the mooncake

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,800
and for making me Squirrel Fish.

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,470
You're welcome.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,020
Your happiness matters most.

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,620
So, Sheng,

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,160
can you be honest with me?

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,640
Is that logbook

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,360
fake?

29
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,080
Why bring that up again?

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,080
I know.

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,660
To you, Dai Shiyao

32
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,380
is both your shield and your weakness.

33
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,620
You care about your brother,

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,220
and you admire him too.

35
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,660
So, I don't believe you'd frame him.

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,740
I don't believe it either

37
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,820
that you'd truly deceive me.

38
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,700
I want to be your truest friend.

39
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,060
Sheng,

40
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,480
just tell me the truth.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,500
Who gave you that fake one?

42
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,340
Qin Shiyue.

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,900
You've had just two bites.

44
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,980
I'm done beating around the bush.

45
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,860
I'm just one step away from the truth.

46
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,300
Dai Shiyao has found

47
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,180
the proof to clear my father's name.

48
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,100
Dai Shiyao has found

49
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,640
the proof to clear your father's name?

50
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,660
Yes, he found it.

51
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,700
You're too persistent, Qin Shiyue.

52
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,300
Why chase after such hollow honor?

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,300
It's nothing more than a game.

54
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,900
Honor belongs to the living.

55
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,060
The dead have no honor.

56
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,780
Now, you're the Young Marshal's wife.

57
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,740
Your father's crime
was settled long ago.

58
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,260
It's a fact of the past.

59
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,660
Qin Shiyue.

60
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,140
His name can't be cleared.

61
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,260
No one would care except you.

62
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,780
You went through all this trouble,

63
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,340
made such a huge detour,

64
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,140
and even gave me a fake logbook,

65
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,420
just to drive a wedge

66
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,820
between me and Dai Shiyao?

67
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,180
I can't figure out your motive.

68
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,380
Unless

69
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,180
you actually like me.

70
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,540
I like you?

71
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,020
You're wrong, Qin Shiyue.

72
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,420
This whole time,

73
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
I've only seen you as a toy.

74
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,780
Got it?

75
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,540
All my life, everything I had

76
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
was given to my brother

77
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,140
just because I was born later.

78
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,620
But today, I won't back down.

79
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,140
You want to pin it on him,

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,900
have me kill him,

81
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,540
and then take his place.

82
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,140
You really know how to spin a tale.

83
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,820
Then let me ask you this:

84
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,340
Do you think you can kill Dai Shiyao?

85
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,460
For a moment there,

86
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,160
I actually thought
you were a good person.

87
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,020
Guess I was totally blind.

88
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,940
Step back. No one gets in.

89
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,180
No one gets in.

90
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,140
Everyone, step back!

91
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,940
What's going on outside?

92
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,540
Some trouble broke out there.

93
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,480
A few drifters
are trying to seek shelter.

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,180
Then hurry up and let them in.

95
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,580
We follow Sheng's orders.

96
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,100
Lock it up tight.

97
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,100
Don't let a single person in.

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,330
Got it.

99
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,740
Get out, now!

100
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,960
Sheng.

101
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,180
Can you help them out?

102
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
I'm not my unlucky brother

103
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,260
who lives to save others.

104
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,060
I'm the bad guy here.

105
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,740
Why would I be that noble?

106
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,420
Their fate has nothing to do with me.

107
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,820
There are women and elders outside.

108
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,060
Let's just open the door quickly

109
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,900
and let them come in.

110
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,220
I'm begging you.

111
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,030
No one gets in.

112
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,660
No one can get in.

113
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,100
Let them in.

114
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,940
Yes.

115
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,500
Thank you, Miss.

116
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,940
I can tell you're a kind person.

117
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,060
You just let us inside.

118
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,100
You'll definitely help us.

119
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,260
Are you feeling unwell?

120
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,140
Want to eat something later?

121
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,940
You can lie down over there.

122
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,820
Alright, thanks.

123
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,140
Don't worry.

124
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,300
You're Sheng,

125
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,820
the boss of Night Queen, right?

126
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,540
No.

127
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,660
Yes, you are.

128
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,650
I've seen you before.

129
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,300
Guys.

130
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,460
That's Sheng.

131
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,860
Let's kill him

132
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,100
for the brothers we lost.

133
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,900
Go!

134
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,740
It's you.

135
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,540
It's you.

136
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,900
The man in black
at the suburban post station

137
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,100
is you.

138
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,020
This timing's just right.

139
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,140
End me then.

140
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,340
That way, you'll avenge your family.

141
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,460
Why?

142
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,860
Why?

143
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,220
Because your father is a traitor.

144
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,500
He's not.

145
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,380
Nothing I say will change it now.

146
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,660
End me.

147
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,100
Just end me.

148
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,580
Do it now.

149
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,420
Next time we meet,

150
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,900
I will kill you.

151
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,820
(The one who killed your family)

152
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,060
(has been by your side all along.)

153
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,740

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
(Qin Shiyue,)

155
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,850
(you're so foolish.)

156
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,100
Madam, you're finally back.

157
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,700
The Old Madam is upset.

158
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,180
She personally prepared

159
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,780
the dinner just for you.

160
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,980
Please, have some.

161
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,420
Jinxiu,

162
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,500
can you pour me a pot of wine?

163
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,740
Wine?

164
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,580
(Father.)

165
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,340
(Mother.)

166
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,020
(Sister.)

167

168
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,580
(has been found.)

169
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,460
(The one who killed you all)

170
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,660
(is right in front of me,)

171
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,060
(but I can't bring myself to do it.)

172
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,020
(I've never taken a life.)

173
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,020
