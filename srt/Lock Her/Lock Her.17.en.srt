11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,480
Your brother who bled for you.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,440
Your flesh and blood.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,600
Let me ask you:

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,040
You don't trust me either?

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,160
Shiyao, I was just joking.

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,530
Why so serious?

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
So, who's missing?

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,520
Such a big scene.

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,480
Don't tell me the street talk is true.

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,320
You lost your fiancée?

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,000
Just joking?

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,600
Yeah.

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,480
You wiped out her whole family.

24
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,250
If you want to atone,

25
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,050
you should help me find her.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,920
So, you know now.

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,680
It makes sense.

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,960
The secret order from Chongqing

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,120
that took down the Qin family
at a high price.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
In all of Nancheng,

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,880
who could pull this off without a trace?

32
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,920
For the sake of brotherhood,

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,920
I pretended not to know.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
But did you realize

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,280
you've become someone's pawn?

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,280
Let's go.

37
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,720
Shiyao.

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,200
I've caught wind of something.

39
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,400
Liu Yong is out there,

40
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,640
spreading rumors
that you're starting the war.

41
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,840
That's really unusual.

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,680
Why's that?

43
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,000
I'd like to know that, too.

44
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,960
Could it be

45
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,160
about the one you lost?

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,320
You still want to push for a talk?

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
Yes.

48
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,520
Alright.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,560
I'll set up another meeting for you.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,640
All the concubines these years

51
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
really won him over.

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,080
It might not work this time.

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,960
But it's the only shot you've got.

54
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,480
Why are you helping me?

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,360
Shiyao.

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,880
No offense,

57
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,160
but you treat that woman

58
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,080
above all of us.

59
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,340
I've accepted that.

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,760
But I still have to say this.

61
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm on your side.

62
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,120
Let's go.

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
Goodbye.

64
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,980
Write this.

65
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,870
Go on.

66
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
Shiyao,

67
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,640
these words

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
represent me.

69
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,330
Today, I saw...

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,680
Today, I saw

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
lotuses in full bloom,

72
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,160
greener than ever.

73
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,760
Dragonflies

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,880
were chasing

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,120
little ducklings.

76
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,760
Seems these little creatures

77
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,480
are missing you badly.

78
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,560
I'll try to find something more refined.

79
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Months and years

80
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,170
slip by quickly.

81
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,960
Next year, the waters of Xunyang

82
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,880
will see my longing sent
with the lotus gatherers.

83
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,880
If he leaves town later,

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,080
we won't see him again till next year.

85
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,930
We need to hurry.

95
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,120
I think this is a trap.

96
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,640
You can't take the risk.

97
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,080
Yes, Young Marshal.

98
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
You must think twice.

99
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,680
Don't risk your life

100
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
because of the Madam.

101
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,800
What if it's a trap?

102
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,960
Besides, you're the Young Marshal.

103
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,640
You can always find

104
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,520
another woman.

105
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,520
This isn't about her.

106
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,120
As long as Liu Yong is willing,

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,640
I'll meet him despite the risk.

108
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,400
If you insist on going,

109
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,360
I'm done being the Sheriff.

110
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,920
Someone else can do it.

111
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,200
I heard Sheriff Su from afar.

112
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
What's going on?

113
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,440
Who upset you?

114
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,240
You're here just in time.

115
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,840
Please talk to the Young Marshal.

116
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,200
At such a critical moment,

117
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,840
can he really meet Liu Yong?

118
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
He'll die for sure.

119
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,040
Sit down.

120
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
As you know,

121
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
I've never been one for peace talks.

122
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,720
But at this critical moment,

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
we have to make a call.

124
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
I only just heard

125
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,560
that the Young Marshal's wife
is missing.

126
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,060
Beauty can bring disaster.

127
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,400
Alright, Su.

128
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,000
Calm down.

129
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,520
Let me say something.

130
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,960
Actually, this meeting

131
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
isn't impossible.

132
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,520
However,

133
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,880
if the rumors out there are true

134
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,160
that Liu Yong took

135
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,040
the Young Marshal's wife in plain sight,

136
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,240
then this is huge.

137
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,960
Everyone here must know by now.

138
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,960
She's a natural beauty.

139
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,800
I can't even imagine

140
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,840
what could happen to her

141
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,120
after Liu Yong took her away.

142
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,800
Since the Qin family incident,

143
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
all of Nancheng has gone wild.

144
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,320
Money couldn't be exchanged;

145
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,840
supplies have been hard to get.

146
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,400
Bombs are everywhere.

147
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,240
They'll explode soon.

148
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,640
Things have got this far.

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,520
Liu Yong wants to meet, right?

150
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,480
Fine.

151
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,400
I think we should meet him.

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,320
I won't say more

153
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,720
about the war decision.

154
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,240
I believe the Young Marshal

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,980
already has his answer.

156
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,760
I've made my decision.

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,160
You don't need to say more.

158
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,400
Shiyao,

159
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,160
what do you think?

160
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,760
