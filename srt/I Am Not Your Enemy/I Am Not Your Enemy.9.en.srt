18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,000
Youchu.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,440
He touched Mi Youchu's head.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,920
He held Mi Youchu's hand.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,040
Your Highness.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,720
Ouch.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,600
What?

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,920
Youchu.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,880
Have you agreed to marry me?

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,480
I can't take it anymore!

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,940
(Birthday Banquet Incident)

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,800
- Your Highness.
- What are you doing?

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
No.

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,520
Your Highness.

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,160
It's not Ms. Mi.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,120
Well...

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,520
I just

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,840
made a little joke.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,280
Why are you so agitated?

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,520
How dare you try to trick me
with this little trick?

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,840
Didn't you almost get fooled?

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
Thank you

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,120
for your kiss then.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,440
Tell me

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,440
where's Mi Youchu.

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,480
She went to Zuixiang Inn

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,920
to meet a girl named Fuling.

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,160
But I'm telling you

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,560
I'm determined to win Mi Youchu's heart.

46
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,720
Who did you say she went to see?

47
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,600
Fuling.

48
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,600
What trap

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,200
is this wicked female supporting role
planning again?

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,120
Where are you going?

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,400
Your Highness.

52
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,160
Wait for me.

53
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,420
(Zuixiang Inn)

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,920
This is

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,680
what I found

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,680
on the thugs who kidnapped the girls

57
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,240
that day.

58
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
What I told you about my family
that day was true.

59
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,520
My father neglects country affairs.

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,160
Various forces are eager to make a move.

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,720
I wonder

62
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,080
what fuss they're going to make
with this lotus mark.

63
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,040
If people like them gain power,

64
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,920
the people will suffer.

65
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,600
I think you're the one after the throne.

66
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,440
I never conceal
my ambition to rule the country.

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,040
Among the princes,

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm the only one who's worthy of it.

69
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,640
What does this have to do with me?

70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,880
The country is in trouble.

71
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,320
No one within it can remain unscathed.

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,080
Mi Army may seem to be in decline,

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,640
but the Mi family's old warriors
is all over the world.

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,240
I don't know why you're investigating
this lotus mark either,

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,160
but the Mi family
must have been involved in this.

76
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
Why not join forces with me

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
and take a chance?

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,520
(No matter which life,)

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,720
(I will hunt down anyone)

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,360
(who wants to harm the Mi family.)

81
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,680
(Mi Youchu.)

82
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,360
(You know
there's something wrong with Fuling.)

83
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
(Why put yourself at risk?)

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,520
I've been trying

85
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,000
to figure out who put the voodoo on me.

86
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,080
After you and Fuling
went to Su Residence

87
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,280
and saw the jade ruyi,

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,440
I had the lotus mark on me.

89
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,240
I think

90
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,360
Fuling must have added
the voodoo in my wine.

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
Why not capture her

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,120
and interrogate her?

93
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,160
Tomorrow is my father's 60th birthday.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,880
As for Fuling,

95
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,400
I have my own plans.

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

97
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,520
I didn't even have time to prepare.

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,320
It's best if you don't come.

99
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,520
It's my future father-in-law's birthday.

100
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,390
How could I not go?

101
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,120
What did you say?

102
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,480
I'm just joking.

103
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Don't be mad.

104
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,680
Youchu.

105
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,320
I hope you're alright.

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,520
Youchu.

107
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,040
(Let's start with you.)

108
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,640
Youchu.

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,680
I know

110
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,080
you asked me to go back to my hometown

111
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,320
and don't stay in the capital city.

112
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,760
But Father raised me.

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,040
It's his 60th birthday.

114
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,840
Please give this gift to him

115
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,280
on my behalf.

116
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
I'll help Father accept the gift.

117
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
If there's nothing else,

118
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll leave.

119
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,440
Wait.

120
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,400
Youchu.

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
Sit down and have a cup of tea first.

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,760
I haven't seen Father for a long time.

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
I wonder if his old injury has recurred.

124
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,240
Father's alright.

125
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,160
Who's out there?

126
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,960
No one's there.

127
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,720
I saw it wrong then.

128
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,440
Youchu.

129
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,040
This is Xuedinghancui
that's hard to come by.

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,240
Have another cup.

131
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,280
Why do I feel

132
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,680
a little dizzy?

133
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,720
Youchu.

134
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,400
Youchu.

135
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,840
Sir.

136
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,560
Mi Youchu has been knocked unconscious.

137
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,680
Your Highness.

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,080
Why didn't you
go with Prince Su just now?

139
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,840
What do you know?

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,480
Let him scout the way first.

141
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
What if we go there
and get caught in an ambush?

142
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,720
Su Buxiao is foolhardy

143
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,680
and can hardly achieve great things.

144
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,520
Are you not worried

145
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,720
that something bad
might happen to Ms. Mi?

146
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,000
If Mi Youchu could be so easily tricked,

147
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,920
I don't need to waste my efforts on her.

148
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,840
When they're almost done,

149
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,520
we'll reap the rewards,

150
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
save Youchu,

151
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,280
capture the villain with ease,

152
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,880
and kill two birds with one stone.

153
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,480
You're wise, Your Highness.

154
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,080
Sir.

155
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,720
Prince Su has turned his back on me.

156
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
I can't go back to Mi Residence

157
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,360
because of what happened last time.

158
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't even have a place
in the capital city.

159
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,640
I can only stay in this inn.

160
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,280
You promised me you'd make me rich

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
after I succeeded.

162
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Now...

163
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,800
Thank you, Sir.

164
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,960
Now that Mi Youchu is gone,

165
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,000
visit the Mi family after a few days.

166
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sure General Mi will agree.

167
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,720
As long as you obey me,

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,720
you

169
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,120
will be rewarded later.

170
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,440
Later?

171
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you alright?

172
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,020
(Zuixiang Inn)

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,600
Wait.

174
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,840
You can go.

175
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,910
(Zuixiang Inn)

176
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,360
Youchu.

177
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,200
You saw what happened today.

178
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,280
Sun is ruthless.

179
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,960
The power behind him is also unclear.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
How about you marry me?

181
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,880
I'll protect you and the Mi family.

182
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
Why are you so relentless?

183
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,400
You only came after the fight was over.

184
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,320
Where were you?

185
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,160
Enough.

186
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,040
No need.

187
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,280
I can fight.

188
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,240
I don't need protection from others.

189
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,600
Goodbye.

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,680
Let's go.

191
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,400
Your Highness.

192
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,640
Are you pleased

193
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,720
with Ms. Mi's performance today?

194
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,720
The more I look, the more I like her.

195
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,120
But

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,680
she's still a bit too soft-hearted.

197
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:19,960
It doesn't matter.

198
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,640
Won't she be easier to control

199
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,200
if she has some flaws?

200
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
Are you hiding here
for some peace and quiet?

201
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,080
Go easy on the drinks.

202
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,440
Xiaowu wrapped this for me.

203
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,720
He's clumsy.

204
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,360
Let me do it.

205
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:48,920
Sit.

206
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,760
Why are you suddenly
so concerned about me?

207
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Do you like me?

208
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,720
Thank you

209
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,840
for just now.

210
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,480
It's alright.

211
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,680
You didn't wrap it as well as Xiaowu,

212
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,040
but

213
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,160
you seem a little different today.

214
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
I just think

215
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,560
life is too unpredictable.

216
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,160
I sent her away.

217
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,000
Who knew

218
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,800
she betrayed the Mi family after all.

219
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
Can fate really change?

220
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,360
Will the Mi family...

221
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,200
Forget it.

222
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,720
You wouldn't understand.

223
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,760
Wait.

224
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,600
Look at them.

225
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,920
You're on each of them.

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
Every choice you make

227
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
will create a new world,

228
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,760
so

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,720
your fate

230
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,360
is in your hands.

231
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,440
I never thought

232
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,400
you'd be the one
to comfort me in the end.

233
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,960
Who else could it be if not me?

234
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,920
Go on.

235
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,760
Nothing's there.

236
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,240
I used magic to conjure them.

237
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:30,840
I...

238
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,640
