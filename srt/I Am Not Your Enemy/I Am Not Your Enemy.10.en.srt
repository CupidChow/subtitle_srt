Nothing's there.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,240
I used magic to conjure them.

21

(Her gaze is full of killing intent.)

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
(Oh no, I'm doomed.)

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,200
(Why did he close his eyes?)

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,680
(Why is my face so hot?)

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,520
Chu.

00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,260
(First Time in the Military Camp)

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,280
Chu.

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,200
We have a problem.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,720
Father.

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,360
Sister-in-law.

37
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,120
Chu.

38
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,000
Something happened.

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,240
What happened?

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,000
The emperor summons you to the palace

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,120
to participate
in the maiden selection.

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
Is it hot?

43
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,160
Why are your faces so red?

44
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,480
Is it?

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,480
Father.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,080
I can't accept this imperial edict.

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,320
The emperor is afraid
of the Mi family's military strength.

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
The imperial edict

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
seems on the surface
to be about maiden selection,

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,000
but it's actually
to weaken the Mi family's military power

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
and leave us without actual authority.

52
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,280
Yes.

53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,600
We can't compromise.

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,600
(Affection Value)
(I finally win some affection value.)

55
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,200
(If Mi Youchu is chosen,)

56
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,160
(won’t I have to compete
with the royal family for a wife?)

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
(How can I complete this mission?)

58
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,080
I never thought
that even though I kept stepping back,

59
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,400
the emperor is still pressing me.

60
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,480
If only Youmao was here.

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
We'll have one more person
to discuss countermeasures with.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,880
And Youchu

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,480
won't have to sacrifice her happiness

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,040
for the Mi family.

65
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,800
Do you have an older brother?

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,240
He's missing.

67
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,080
Missing?

68
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,680
News of his disappearance came

69
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,000
on Youchu's tenth birthday.

70
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,400
Speaking of which,

71
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,040
Chu and Youmao

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,640
were born on the same day and month.

73
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,560
They share a bond.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,480
Chu hasn't celebrated her birthday

75
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,480
since Youmao disappeared.

76
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,880
(Go to Mi Army's base)

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,520
(and help the heroine find her brother)

78
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,960
(to increase her affection value.)

79
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,480
(God is on my side.)

80
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,680
I know the whereabouts
of your brother, Mi Youmao.

81
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,500
(Mi)

82
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,260
(Mi)

83
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,420
(Yongping Pass)

84
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,920
Was your brother stationed here

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,960
before going missing?

86
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,600
Mi Army has always been valiant.

87
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,440
They also have
strict military discipline.

88
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,400
Now that we've sneaked in in disguise,

89
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,560
we must act accordingly.

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,000
If you can't stand the hardship,
leave soon.

91
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,840
Don't drag me down.

92
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,480
Don't worry.

93
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,400
I won't drag you down.

94
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,160
I'm warning you

95
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,080
to stay one foot away from me.

96
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,920
Don't get close to me.

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,360
Why?

98
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,160
Be... Because you

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,040
have bad breath.

100
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
I don't have bad breath.

101
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,240
Kill.

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,400
Do you want eggs?

103
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,080
No thanks.

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,280
Is...

105
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,600
Is this the valiant Mi Army?

106
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,399
It used to be.

107
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,320
What happened to them?

108
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,080
Su Daxiao.

109
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,080
Xiaochu, right?

110
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,280
I'm Liu Xiaoer.

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm your captain.

112
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:28,840
Come on.

113
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,800
I'll take you inside.

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,800
- Small.
- Big.

115
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,880
Open.

116
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Two, three, three. Small.

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,720
I won.

118
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,040
These two sides are our barracks.

119
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,760
The training camp is ahead.

120
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,280
After you enter the military camp,

121
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,560
don't be lazy.

122
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,880
We have newcomers.

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,640
They look delicate

124
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,120
like ladies.

125
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,480
I wonder if they

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
can withstand our iron fists?

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,640
Biaozi, you...

128
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,200
Get lost!

129
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,080
Here.

130
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,960
Give me a few kowtows

131
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,360
and I'll keep you safe.

132
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,000
What do you think?

133
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,800
Kowtow.

134
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,080
- Kowtow.
- Kowtow.

135
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,160
They're not easy to mess with.

136
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,400
Be careful.

137
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,720
Is that so?

138
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,440
Let me see.

139
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,600
Be gentle.

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,840
Gentle?

141
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,920
If I don't beat you up

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,240
and make you kowtow today,

143
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,400
I'll take your last name.

144
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,840
It feels good

145
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,960
that I wasn't the one being hit.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,400
Looks like you're quite skilled.

147
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,760
Of course.

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,000
He's General Youmao's...

149
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,400
Fan.

150
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,280
His fan.

151
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
I joined Mi Army

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
because of his reputation too.

153
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,480
I didn't expect it
to have become this way

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,240
after joining.

155
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,760
My master told me

156
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,040
when General Mi Youmao was here,

157
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,600
Mi Army was impressive.

158
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,560
It's a pity

159
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,080
Deputy Commander Chen
has practiced nepotism

160
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,600
after taking over.

161
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
Mi Army

162
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,960
has long since fallen apart.

163
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,960
Does your master know General Mi Youmao?

164
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,040
That's right.

165
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,760
Except for Commander Chen,

166
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,560
he's the only one left

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,600
among General Youmao's
former subordinates.

168
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,440
Come on.

169
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,400
I'll bring you inside.

170
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,520
Master.

171
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,160
Master.

172
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,840
He probably went out to drink.

173
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,760
You'll work here from now on.

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,600
Sure.

175
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,240
Thank you, Er.

176
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,480
Work hard.

177
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,440
Er, take care.

178
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,720
Is that what you paid for?

179
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,760
You can get any positions

180
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,240
but you got us to be army cooks.

181
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,320
You don't understand.

182
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,120
Food gives us strength.

183
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,320
We can't go without eating.

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
Army cook is the most informed
in the barracks.

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,520
Besides,

186
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,440
shake the rice spoon,

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,120
and the power is in my hands.

188
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
If I can't find Youmao,

189
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,600
watch out.

After all, we're...

192
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,840
Shut up.

193
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,080
If you keep talking,

194
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,040
we'll have human meat buns
as an extra meal today.

00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,200

who has people looking after her,

cook?

197
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,400

keep chopping vegetables?

238
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,880
