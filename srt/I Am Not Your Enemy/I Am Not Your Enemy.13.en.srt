=Episode 13=

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,040
You have the demeanor
of a great general.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,560
Now that Commander Chen is dead,

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,920
I'll ask Father

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,640
to return Mi Army to you.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,520
No need.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm just taking over

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,120
until my brother comes back.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,000
Sure.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,400
But does General Youmao

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,320
have any special characteristics?

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,920
I can ask my men to look for him.

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,640
My brother's hairy.

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,440
That's why my father named him Youmao.

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,520
Also,

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,280
my brother has very big feet.

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,760
Every time
my sister-in-law sews his shoes,

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,520
she sews a rope on them

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,480
to make it easier for him
to put on and remove.

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,360
Rope?

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:41,800
Also,

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,560
I think...

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,560
I remember it now.

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,880
You have to trust me this time.

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,840
Really.

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,620
(Brother and Sister Reunion)

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,160
Lure your brother out.

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,800
(Mi)
First, restore Mi Army's reputation

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,440
and rectify their morale.

46
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
- Two, two, three, four.
- Good luck.

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,040
- Three, two, three, four.
- Expand your chest.

48
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,440
Expand your chest.
Expand it as much as you can.

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,639
Open your arms. Yes.

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,360
Don't be lazy.

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
Next...

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
I won a prize.

60
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,240
I finally won a prize!

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,440
You're awesome.

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,800
I won a prize!

63
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,600
Hurry up, whoever's in front

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,760
When is it my turn?

65
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,400
(Lucky)

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,760
Are you sure you want to exchange
performance points for this?

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,200
Then I'll...

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,200
Let me think about it.

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,280
(Lucky)
This one.

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,640
Are you sure?

71
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,680
No.

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,680
I'll take this.

73
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,000
Why is it the same as before?

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
Keep up the good work.

75
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,520
I'll train hard.

76
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
I want to win all the lucky bags!

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,240
Good luck, boys!

78
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,360
Good luck!

79
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,080
You can do it.

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,800
Commander Mi.

81
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,360
Prince Su's plan
to exchange performance points

82
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,560
for blind bags

83
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,040
has achieved remarkable results.

84
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,600
Look.

85
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,440
The soldiers are in high spirits.

86
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,560
It's just a small trick.

87
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
What matters is that it works.

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,320
Boys.

89
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,480
Don't you agree?

90
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,400
- Yes!
- Yes!

91
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,400
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
Are you sure
e can lure my brother out with this?

93
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,440
Your brother stayed here

94
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,920
because he's worried about you

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,880
concerned
about Mi Army's current situation.

96
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,440
We made this such a big deal.

97
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,480
There's no way
your brother won't show up.

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,720
Don't worry.

99
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,760
Youchu.

100
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,480
I have a surprise for you.

101
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,360
What is it?

102
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,320
What's this?

103
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,560
Flower bath.

104
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,120
It's specially prepared for you.

105
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,120
They're not roses.

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,760
As commander,

107
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,880
I should be a role model for the army.

108
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
I shouldn't do such extravagant things.

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,760
It's all about work-life balance.

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't live your life too tense.

111
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
Relax when you need to.

112
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Go.

113
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,120
Take your bath.

114
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,360
Enjoy your bath.

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,320
Enjoy the bath.

116
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,240
Enjoy the bath.

117
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,080
He's quite thoughtful.

118
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,120
Youchu.

119
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,880
Does it feel good?

120
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,760
When I'm tired

121
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,000
or in a bad mood,

122
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,240
I liked to take a bath.

123
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,160
It makes me relax
physically and mentally.

124
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
I've always
been burdened with responsibility.

125
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,200
I worry about the Mi family

126
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
and am scared to relax
for even a moment.

127
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
I didn't know

128
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,880
relaxing could feel so good.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,720
Did you say something?

130
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,480
I didn't hear you.

131
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,160
Nothing.

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,400
By the way,

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,600
look up.

134
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,740
(Affection Value)

135
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,920
Mi Youchu.

136
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,360
I hope you like it.

137
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,300
(Affection Value)

138
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,000
Youchu.

139
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,240
Youchu.

140
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,800
What are you doing?

141
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,320
- Get out of the way.
- Youchu's resting.

142
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,080
You can't go in.

143
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
- It's about General Mi.
- What's with the commotion

144
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
so late at night?

145
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,400
I just received a secret letter

146
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,200
that Father is furious
because you didn't join

147
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,040
the maiden selection.

148
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
He ordered General Mi
to find you within half a month.

149
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,280
Otherwise, he'll be regarded
as disobeying his order.

150
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,040
He showed enough respect

151
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,600
to the Mi family by giving half a month.

152
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,200
There's only one way left.

153
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,000
What is it?

154
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,560
I'll go back to the capital city
and ask His Majesty

155
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,560
to let you marry me.

156
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,720
Get lost.

157
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,480
No way.

158
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,320
Do you have a better way?

159
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,080
Stop arguing.

160
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not marrying anyone.

161
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,760
Youchu.

162
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
I hope you'll consider my suggestion.

163
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,720
No need.

164
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,040
Youchu dislikes power struggles.

165
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,160
(Youmao.)

166
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,520
(Please show up soon.)

167
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,360
(Otherwise,
the emperor will steal Youchu away.)

168
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,040
Wait.

169
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,480
I remember Beggars' Gang
in period dramas are well-informed.

170
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,040
Yes.

171
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,360
I'll find Ba.

172
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
Mao Dashuai.

173
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Mr. Su wants to talk to you.

174
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,440
Mao.

175
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,840
It's so windy over there.

176
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,680
Don't bother.

177
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,400
(This guy looks familiar.)

178
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,280
Youmao!

179
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,200
My brother has very big feet.

180
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,560
Every time
my sister-in-law sews his shoes,

181
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
she sews a rope on them

182
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
to make it easier for him
to put on and remove.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,840
(Youmao.)

184
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
(It's indeed you.)

185
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
Are you not delivering vegetables today?

186
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Beggars' Gang beg for a living.

187
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
We don't have vegetables to deliver.

188
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,200
You must be kidding.

189
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,520
I think

190
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,520
you look a bit like

191
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Mi Youchu.

192
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
You're weak.

193
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,400
You're not good enough for Ms. Mi.

194
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,400
It's not up to you

195
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,560
to decide
whether I'm good enough for her.

196
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,880
Besides, who are you to criticize me?

197
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,640
Of course I...

198
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,160
Of course you?

199
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
Of course what?

200
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,680
Tell me.

201
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
I warn you.

202
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,800
Don't bully Ms. Mi.

203
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,920
Besides,

204
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,159
I know you're investigating

205
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,720
the lotus mark and Bloodthirsty Vine.

206
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,360
But this isn't what you should do.

207
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,559
Give up.

208
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,600
How much do you know

209
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,640
about the lotus mark?

210
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,720
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

211
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,799
Leave as soon as possible.

212
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,679
Also,

213
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,240
help me tell Mi Youchu

214
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,880
to stay away from the royal family.

215
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,120
None of them is good.

216
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,440
Are you talking about Second Prince?

217
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Do you hate the royal family too?

218
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,320
Do they

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,280
have anything to do with the lotus mark?

220
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,680
Asking about everything

221
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,000
will only harm you.

222
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,600
I hate the royal family too.

223
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,960
Great minds think alike.

224
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,120
Why don't you do me a favor?

225
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,080
Buddy.

226
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,040
Do you have paper?

227
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,560
Thank you, buddy.

228
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,560
Don't mention it.

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,320
I didn't expect

230
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,960
you to be a cross-dressing expert too.

231
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,000
You're too kind.

232
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Let's have a friendly spar sometime.

233
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,920
There's no chance.

234
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,800
Leave once you finish your work here.

235
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,640
Mao.

236
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,240
Look what this is.

237
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,040
(My brother has a peculiar habit
when he goes to the bathroom.)

238
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
It's my favorite osmanthus cake.

239
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,600
(Is it still good with laxatives added?)

240
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,360
What's wrong?

241
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,760
Do you need to go to the toilet?

242
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
I need to go to the toilet.

243
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,120
Hurry.

244
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
Why do you take off your clothes
when going to the toilet?

245
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,920
I can only relax
after taking off my clothes.

246
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,440
How big.

247
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,640
Peculiar habit?

248
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,320
So this is the peculiar habit.

249
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,880
How weird.

250
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,400
How satisfying!

251
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,620
(How satisfying!)

252
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,240
Su Buxiao.

253
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,240
Where are my shoes?

254
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,920
