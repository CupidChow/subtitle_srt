(Adapted from "I Am Not Your Enemy"
Author: Black Circle and White Dot)

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,980
=Episode 12=

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,120
When Youmao is around,

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,720
I met Commander Chen a few times.

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,520
He isn't a treacherous man.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,560
Youmao has always been good
at seeing through people.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,320
If something's wrong with him,

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
Youmao would have noticed it long ago.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,000
I think
there must be something fishy going on.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,920
Did you find anything unusual about him?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,960
Well...

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,200
Speaking of which,

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,440
When General Youmao went missing,

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,640
he had a new habit.

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,000
Someone needs to keep watch
while he's taking a shower.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,640
I accidentally barged in once.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,000
He drove me out
like he had lost his mind.

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,520
Shower?

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,720
Any other details?

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,120
I remember

36
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,840
he had a new red pattern on his chest.

37
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,740
(Trouble Rises Again)

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,080
(Did Commander Chen
get lotus voodoo too?)

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,960
Commander.

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,360
I brought you food.

41
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,440
Got it.

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,160
Leave.

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,440
Why are you standing here?

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,120
Li San ordered me
to take good care of you.

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,240
See if these dishes are to your liking.

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,880
He's smart.

47
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,240
Commander.

48
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,120
The weather is getting cold.

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,320
Warm yourself up with a bowl of soup.

50
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,880
Sorry.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,520
What is this?

52
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,800
Sorry.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,400
Commander, sorry.

54
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,160
What are you doing?

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,520
Sorry, Commander.

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
I'll help you get changed.

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,680
No need.

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
I said no need.

59
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,720
Get lost.

60
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,760
Get out of the way!

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
Commander Chen, don't be mad.

62
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,360
Look at you.

63
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,880
You're reckless and clumsy.

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,360
Can you afford to compensate
Commander Chen for soiling his clothes?

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,040
Don't you need me

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,400
to look after Commander Chen after all?

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,640
You...

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,880
What are you two doing?

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,480
Leave.

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,120
Leave!

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,920
Let's go.

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,440
Sorry.

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,760
Mi Youchu.

74
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,720
Can't you tell me

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
before you do anything?

76
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
You did the same with Fuling.

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
And now Commander Chen.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,120
I'm used to being alone.

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,800
Besides,

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,440
my brother's affairs

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,720
are ultimately my own.

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,840
You don't have to be so concerned.

83
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
Are you calling me a busybody?

84
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,880
You're good in martial arts

85
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,040
and can fight ten people alone.

86
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,440
I'm just redundant.

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,680
That's not what I meant.

88
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,040
Commander Chen's
martial arts skills are average.

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,080
He can't hurt me.

90
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,960
And if there's danger,

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,400
it will be easier for me to escape
if you're not around.

92
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,880
Yes.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,640
I... I'm not good at martial arts.

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm not like Second Prince

95
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,480
who can protect you.

96
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,160
What does it have to do with him?

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,280
Why are you acting weird today?

98
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
I just don't like that leech.

99
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm still annoyed
that you didn't tell me anything

100
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,440
and took risks alone.

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,360
Are you worried about me?

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,400
No.

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,080
I just

104
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,320
don't know
how to explain this to General Mi.

105
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,520
Well...

106
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,240
Should I discuss anything

107
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,480
with you in the future?

108
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,160
I promise

109
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,880
I won't at alone again.

110
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,640
Do whatever you want.

111
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,440
I don't care.

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
Su Buxiao, I gave you face, didn't I?

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm impatient.

114
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,760
I'm not going
to keep giving you chances.

115
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,320
What are you doing?

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
I'm not violent.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,480
By the way,

118
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,400
where's the person who tipped you off?

119
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,560
I want to thank them in person.

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,920
Well...

121
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,600
Maybe we should start
with Commander Chen

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,320
to find out the truth
of your brother's disappearance.

123
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,560
Youchu.

124
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,640
Why didn't you ask me for help?

125
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,200
Why is it him again?

126
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,080
According to Li San,

127
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,160
Commander Chen will go to the forest

128
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,280
on the 1st and 15th of every month.

129
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,160
So we just need to wait for them?

130
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,840
It's a brilliant plan.

131
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Good job, Youchu.

132
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,680
You're smart.

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,800
Your compliments are so exaggerated.

134
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,000
No, didn't you know
that yawning is contagious?

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,680
Get out of here.

136
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,520
Don't influence me.

137
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,080
Are you still sleepy now?

138
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,400
No.

139
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,440
Where's Mi Youchu?

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,720
Where's Mi Youchu?

141
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,640
How did we fall asleep?

142
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,360
Here.

143
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,400
Let's find Mi Youchu.

144
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Hurry.

145
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,880
Speak.

146
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,760
Is my brother's disappearance
related to you?

147
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,960
What is your relationship with Sun?

148
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,120
You're useless now.

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,680
Mi Youchu.

150
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,880
We meet again.

151
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
I knew it was you.

152
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,640
You controlled Commander Chen
with voodoo.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,640
You're despicable.

154
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,760
As long as I can help her catch you,

155
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,280
I don't care how despicable I am.

156
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
Does my brother's incident
have anything to do with you?

157
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,800
Worry about yourself first.

158
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
This is the Mi family's spear technique.

159
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,080
Are you alright?

160
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,440
Youmao, is it you?

161
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,240
You got the wrong guy.

162
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:32,880
Youmao!

163
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,760
- Youchu!
- Youchu!

164
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,720
- Youchu.
- Youchu.

165
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,400
Youmao!

166
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't move.

167
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,120
You're injured.

168
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,920
How are you?

169
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,200
Bear with it for a while.

170
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,920
You agreed not to act alone,

171
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,360
but you face danger by yourself again.

172
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,800
Youchu, medicine.

173
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,960
You two

174
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,880
were knocked unconscious
by Commander Chen's incense.

175
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,160
I couldn't wake you up.

176
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Say, you already met

177
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,440
your brother.

178
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,440
Why did he run away?

179
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,800
Su Buxiao.

180
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,200
I heard you have clues
about General Youmao.

181
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,640
That's why Youchu followed you here.

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why don't you just ask your informant

183
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,240
to lure him out?

184
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,480
Yes.

185
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,720
Yes.

186
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,280
My informant

187
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,120
is on vacation recently.

188
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,400
He went away.

189
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,600
I can't reach him.

190
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,840
Why don't we ask Master Li San?

191
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,480
He should have some clues.

192
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,080
Su Buxiao.

193
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,560
Have you been deceiving Youchu?

194
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,200
And this is just coincidental.

195
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
No.

196
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,679
I think

197
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,760
no matter what happened before.

198
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,080
We now know

199
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,280
Youmao is in the military camp.

200
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
We just need to follow the clues.

201
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,200
Su Buxiao.

202
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,720
Does the informant exist?

203
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,640
Yes.

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,400
He... He just went on vacation.

205
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,480
I hate people lying to me the most.

206
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,440
Especially you.

207
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,520
Su Buxiao.

208
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,000
You really disappoint me.

209
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Youchu.

210
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,720
Youchu, don't go.

211
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,480
Let me explain.

212
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,600
It was urgent at that time.

213
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,640
If I hadn't said that,

214
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,200
you would have entered the palace
to be a selected maiden.

215
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,200
Father is gracious.

216
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,880
Choosing women of appropriate age
to enter the palace

217
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,840
is to find a good wife

218
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,880
for the young and handsome princes.

219
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,680
What's wrong with that?

220
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
This is between me and Youchu.

221
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,680
Please go out.

222
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,080
Alright?

223
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,600
You...

224
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,880
I don't want to have anything to do

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
with those places,

226
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,960
but that's no reason
for you to lie to me.

227
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,280
Su Buxiao.

228
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,200
You really disappoint me.

229
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,800
I thought you would change.

230
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
I didn't expect
that you would tell lies like before.

231
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,440
Don't bother with my business anymore.

232
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,520
Go back to the capital city.

233
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,560
Youchu.

234
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,320
Get out of the way.

235
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
I just don't want the person I like

236
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,680
to marry someone else!

237
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,760
(What did I just say?)

238
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
(What did he just say?)

239
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,600
(What are they doing?)

240
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
