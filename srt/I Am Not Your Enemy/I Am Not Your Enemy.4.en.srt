18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,040
Do you like it?

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,320
Pick it up and have a look
if you like it.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,240
I'm sure Prince Su won't mind.

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,840
Can I?

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
Then, I'll...

23
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,540
(Unexpected Surprise)

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,760
Your Highness!

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
What if the emperor finds out

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,400
and blames us?

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,560
Was it you?

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,320
Did you break it while cleaning

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,600
and then pin the blame on me?

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,480
Yeah.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,040
Although

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,640
Fuling broke the jade ruyi,

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,720
maybe Prince Su's Residence
didn't take good care of it.

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,880
In my opinion,

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,120
tomorrow morning,

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,040
the two of you should meet His Majesty

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,000
and ask for forgiveness.

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,080
Youchu.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,040
Ask for forgiveness?

40
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,360
Isn’t this just an ornament?

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,560
Don't be afraid.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't be afraid.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
I'll take responsibility alone.

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,800
Don't worry.

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
The Mi family won't be implicated.

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,000
You'd risk your life for her?

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,240
You misunderstood me.

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
Wait for me.

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,880
Profiteer.

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,880
- I need help.
- Your Highness.

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,960
Your Highness.

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
(Are you sure you want to watch
this 30-second ad)

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,040
(in exchange for extra help?)

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Yes.

55
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,560
Hurry.

56
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,760
Your Highness.

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,440
Your Highness, you must save me.

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,040
(What tricks is he playing now?)

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,520
Save.

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,120
One for you.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,880
One for you.

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,280
You can forget about it. Go.

63
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,480
Scratch my back.

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,000
It feels good.

65
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,480
You really do love her.

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,920
Why did you say so?

67
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,200
I did it for you.

68
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
Isn't she your sister?

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,560
Your Highness.

70
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,320
Are you upset?

71
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,760
It's fine.

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,320
Guards.

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,880
Lock Fuling up!

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,320
Your Highness.

75
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,320
I'm innocent!

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,080
Hurry.

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,920
Youchu.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,920
Youchu, save me.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm innocent.

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,440
Are you happy now?

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,680
Trash.

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
How come everything I do is wrong?

83
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,760
What went wrong?

84
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,840
Su Buxiao.

85
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,040
Su Buxiao could even abandon

86
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
his beloved Fuling now.

87
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,600
Compared to him in the previous life,

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,200
he has become more ruthless.

89
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,279
Looks like I have to be decisive

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
to resolve this for good.

91
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
I specially invites Prince Su

92
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,160
(Map of the capital city)
to meet in Black Forest tomorrow night.

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,200
Don't be afraid.

94
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,080
I promise you won't feel any pain.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
Your Highness.

96
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,360
Ms. Mi asked you to meet at night.

97
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,800
Instead of getting
your beauty sleep at home,

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,400
why are you out to catch geese?

99
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,240
Stay out of this.

100
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,400
What are you looking at? Go.

101
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,080
Go.

102
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,960
Why are you afraid of catching a goose?

103
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,040
Catch it.

104
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,400
Catch it.

105
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,480
Hurry.

106
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,320
Smells good.

107
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,000
Who is it?

108
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,200
Who is it?

109
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,240
There will be a big fish

110
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,280
in Black Forest

111
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,920
tomorrow night.

112
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Run, Your Highness.

113
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Which idiot is stealing our geese
in the middle of the night?

114
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,240
Don't run!

115
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Stealing geese at midnight.

116
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,800
Unbelievable.

117
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,600
It will definitely
be the headline tomorrow.

118
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,120
(World Weekly)

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,880
Why did the Su family's servant
pluck goose feathers

120
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,920
all over the capital city?

121
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,480
Why does this newspaper
keep targeting me?

122
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,680
Gosh.

123
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,440
Sir.

124
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,320
What happened to you?

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Mi Youchu.

126
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,000
Look

127
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,120
at what Xiaowu has become
because of you.

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
Su Buxiao.

129
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,560
Mi Youchu.

130
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,960
Wait for my surprise tomorrow night.

131
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,040
My surprise tomorrow night.

132
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,920
Youchu.

133
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,400
The gift I prepared for you today

134
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,400
is special.

135
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
It's definitely a surprise

136
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,840
when you see it.

137
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,000
Just follow me.

138
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,400
It's dark. Don't be scared.

139
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,960
I'm going to kill you today!

140
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,760
I'm a cheating womanizer.

141
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,360
Spare me.

142
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,160
No way!

143
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,640
(Once we go deeper into the woods,)

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,240
(I'll kill you)

145
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,040
- (and frame it on bandits.)
- Youchu.

146
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,680
Youchu.

147
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,720
What were you laughing at?

148
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Are you looking forward to my surprise?

149
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,360
Walk ahead.

150
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,320
We'll be there soon.

151
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,240
Don't be embarrassed

152
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,120
if you're looking forward to it.

153
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,120
Just tell me.

154
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,560
Is this the first time

155
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,520
someone surprised you?

156
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,240
Are you touched?

157
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,640
You must be touched, right?

158
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
It's nothing too expensive.

159
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,520
It's just a...

160
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,440
I can't tell you.

161
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,200
If I tell you...

162
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,240
Why is it so itchy?

163
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,560
What do you mean?

164
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,040
What are you doing?

165
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,240
I'd like to ask you that question.

166
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
I was a little dizzy

167
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,800
and you crippled me.

168
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,520
What do we do?

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,960
Where's your surprise?

170
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,960
It's right ahead.

171
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,360
Lead the way.

172
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,520
You're so rude.

173
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
This is it.

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,480
What do you think?

175
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,360
Not bad, right?

176
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,360
That's all there is to it.

177
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,040
The real surprise is yet to come.

178
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,760
This is my mountain.

179
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,320
I planted these trees.

180
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
I... What line is it again?

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,120
Go aside.

182
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
You can't even remember you line.

183
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,840
Boss.

184
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,320
There's also a lady here.

185
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,960
Get lost!

186
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,880
Lady.

187
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,120
Don't move.

188
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,280
We just want money.

189
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,120
We don't kill.

190
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,080
(They don't kill?)

191
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,600
(Then I must try to impress her.)

192
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,320
Youchu, run. Leave me here.

193
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,120
(This is nothing.)

194
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,840
(Watch how I'll conquer you.)

195
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,400
Okay.

196
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,320
Goodbye.

197
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,840
No.

198
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,360
Sirs.

199
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,080
I've given you all the valuables I have.

200
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,280
I have nothing left.

201
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,120
Your shoes.

202
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,840
Take them off.

203
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,920
There... There are only socks inside.

204
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,080
These bandits are so slow.

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,560
I might as well do it myself.

206
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,560
It's true.

207
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,240
Boss.

208
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,600
There's a basket.

209
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,720
Boss.

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,880
This is worth nothing.

211
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,920
Go away.

212
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,280
It's really worth...

213
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,960
Nothing.

214
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,160
Here's a blood-forming pill.

215
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,800
Take care.

216
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
You're finally kind.

217
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
There's an ambush.

218
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,560
He's not dead yet?

219
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,960
Where's the dagger?

220
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,120
Why are there no daggers?

221
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,040
Where did it stab me?

222
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,680
Where are the daggers?

223
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,840
I don't know.

224
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,160
Hurry.

225
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,840
This is way out of line.

226
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,960
Why am I the only one who got stabbed?

227
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,800
Youchu.

228
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,160
Are you here to rescue me?

229
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,880
Youchu.

230
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,840
Look.

231
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,200
The capital city is
like spring all year round.

232
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,960
You've probably never seen snow.

233
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,600
I turned goose feathers into snow

234
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
just to win a smile

235
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,480
from you.

236
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,640
You plucked the goose's feathers

237
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,160
for me?

238
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,800
How wicked.
