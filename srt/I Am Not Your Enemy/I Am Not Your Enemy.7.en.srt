=Episode 7=

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,320
Is this your aesthetic?

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,360
I...

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
What's wrong with my aesthetic?

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,840
This is popular among my people.

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,640
We just lack photoshop,

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,760
filters and soft light.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,440
You don't understand even if I tell you.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,520
But let me tell you,

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,160
after this is settled,

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,760
you need to leave Mi Youchu alone.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,520
Your hear that?

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,440
I think you're the one pestering her.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,000
We're the official match.

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,040
Official match.

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,920
Do you know?

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,240
There's nothing I can't get

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,520
if I want it.

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,120
I made you rebellious.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,520
But buddy,

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,160
let me tell you.

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,360
Mi Youchu

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,520
might look alright.

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,760
If you anger her,

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,080
you'll be crippled at the least

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,480
and die at the very worst.

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,000
Challenges are fun.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
You're domineering.

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,560
But only I can appreciate

47
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,040
Ms. Mi's beauty.

48
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,640
She's beautiful?

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,960
How is she beautiful?

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,000
What do you think?

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,280
What a beautiful lady.

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,480
Not bad.

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,480
Why are you still here?

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,500
(The Adventures of Crossdressers)

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,480
Forget it.

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,720
We've been walking for so long,
yet we haven't seen a pervert.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,080
Could you tone down your murderous aura?

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,240
Learn from me.

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,680
Let's go.

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,920
Stop.

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,480
Get down.

62
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,880
Miss.

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,320
You're quite strong.

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,720
Come on.

65
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,280
Don't move.

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,560
Let me see.

67
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,680
Miss.

68
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,800
Miss.

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,320
Gosh.

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
What is this game doing?

71
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,280
Why is it the same plot?

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,800
Why did you knock them out?

73
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,160
Drag them aside and hide them.

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,960
Hurry.

75
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,560
Their accomplices should be back soon.

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,640
Here.

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,320
Get up first.

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,840
Tell me

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
what happened.

80
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm Ba.

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,040
I'm from the Beggars' Gang nearby.

82
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,240
Our leader ordered us

83
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,080
to dress as ladies

84
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000
and lure the criminals out

85
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
to investigate
the young ladies' disappearance.

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
People like you

87
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,400
dressing as ladies?

88
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
It's a shame to say

89
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,960
they almost saw through me just now.

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,840
That's why
they pulled over to check me out.

91
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,400
He only found out halfway through?

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,320
They must have bad eyesight.

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,440
Blame

94
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,840
my parents

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,280
for giving me good looks.

96
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,080
Buddies.

97
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,880
Show yourselves.

98
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,960
Coming.

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm Biyue.

100
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm Xiuhua.

101
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,680
I'm Qingcheng.

102
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,440
I'm Tianxiang.

103
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,079
- We're from Beggars' Gang.
- We're from Beggars' Gang.

104
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,320
They

105
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,040
were suspicious of me

106
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,600
because of my good looks.

107
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,120
Compared to them,

108
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,520
you're indeed as beautiful as a goddess.

109
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
What do we do now?

110
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,240
Judging from the way you're dressed

111
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,360
and how you're out at night,

112
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,640
I guess you're here to investigate

113
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,680
the missing ladies case as well?

114
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,680
That's right.

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,880
Later,

116
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,160
their accomplices will be back.

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,320
They usually give off a scent

118
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,680
before they commit the crime.

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,960
Is it sweet

120
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,600
like osmanthus?

121
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,320
Yes.

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,160
That's it.

123
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,000
Forget it.

124
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll faint too.

125
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,880
This lady looks quite good.

126
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,880
Lock her up alone.

127
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,320
Yes.

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,920
I could tell these two
are men dressed up as women.

129
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,000
Trying to trick me?

130
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,840
Put them in the cell later.

131
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
No way.

132
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,200
This one is a little ugly.

133
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,440
This one over here is beautiful.

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,720
How could they be men?

135
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,320
My eyes are sharp.

136
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,680
Are you telling me what to do?

137
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,920
Well...

138
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
(Her appearance is 80 marks.)

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
(20 marks were deducted
due to her figure.)

140
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,320
(Her family background)

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,560
(is 90 marks.)

142
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,960
(The Mi family's eldest son,
Mi Youmao, is missing.)

143
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,000
(General Mi is afraid of the emperor)

144
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,960
(and stays at home all day,)

145
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
(but at least he controls the army.)

146
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,720
(A lean camel
is still bigger than a horse.)

147
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
(As for personality,)

148
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,480
(it's been a long time)

149
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,240
(since a woman made my blood surge.)

150
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,920
(Besides, she's also
highly skilled in martial arts.)

151
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,760
(It's a pleasant surprise.)

152
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,440
(Even such makeup)

153
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,760
(could not cover my good looks,)

154
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
(I'm sure she'll be overjoyed)

155
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,160
(and touched)

156
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,560
(when I confess my feelings to her.)

157
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,120
Why are you smiling?

158
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,800
You're awake.

159
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,120
Sirs.

160
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,920
What do you want to do?

161
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,640
Later,

162
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
we'll feed the flower with your blood.

163
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,720
Don't come over.

164
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,880
You won't live to see tomorrow.

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
Today,

166
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,400
have fun with me.

167
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,840
I'm a man.

168
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm a man.

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,560
Sir.

170
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,080
Boss.

171
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,480
He really is a man.

172
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,120
Hands off.

173
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,640
This face

174
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
is so beautiful.

175
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,200
Miss.

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
Don't try to fool me.

177
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,480
Sir.

178
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,440
Are... Are you blind?

179
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,880
I have sharp eyes.

180
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,560
Nothing escapes my eyes.

181
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,480
But you have only one eye.

182
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,640
Ba.

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,920
Ba.

184
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,040
Biyue.

185
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,080
Xiuhua.

186
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,800
Qingcheng.

187
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,000
Tianxiang!

188
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,800
Stop screaming.

189
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,280
No.

190
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,880
The fainting incense doesn't work on me.

191
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
I've been waiting for you.

192
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,280
I tasted countless herbs
since I was young.

193
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,840
It doesn't work on me either.

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,560
Let's go.

195
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,200
Are you sure?

196
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,640
The incense will make your limbs weak
even if you wake up.

197
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,440
Are you sure you can walk?

198
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
I guess they're
not as immune to this incense

199
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,320
as we are,

200
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,960
They can't move.

201
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,640
How about we wait for them?

202
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,960
But then again,

203
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,400
those criminals

204
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
have a keen eye.

205
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,280
Seeing that we're both extraordinary,

206
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,640
they deliberately
locked us in the same room.

207
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Don't worry.

208
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,400
With me around,

209
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,320
you have nothing to worry.

210
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,520
Thank you then.

211
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Don't mention it.

212
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,520
But you didn't go home all night.

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,440
Will General Mi worry?

214
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,600
I've always been a loner.

215
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
Looks like we're the same.

216
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,360
Big families like ours

217
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,440
don't have filial piety,

218
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,440
friendship and respect.

219
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,919
For example,

220
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,200
my father

221
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,080
has many wives

222
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,960
and children.

223
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,760
I was smart since I was little

224
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,919
and was loved by my father.

225
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,880
But he went on a trip once,

226
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,720
then...

227
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Then...

228
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,960
Mr. Huang.

229
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,440
We just met not long ago.

230
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,520
It's not necessary.

231
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,640
It doesn't matter.

232
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,560
I feel like
I've known you for a long time.

233
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,400
Then,

234
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,720
my father changed drastically
after he came back.

235
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,200
He no longer cares
about the family business.

236
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,680
My family fell into decline.

237
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,880
Brothers fought against each other.

238
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,720
It's so sad

239
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,560
and lamentable.

240
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,880
Ms. Mi.

241
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
Are you interested in becoming my wife?

242
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,000
We can shoulder
the family responsibilities together?

243
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,960
Thank you, Mr. Huang.

244
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm not interested.

245
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,680
I decline.

246
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,600
Don't worry
about not being good enough for me.

247
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,600
You can become my concubine first.

248
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,520
After you give birth in two years,

249
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,560
you may become my legal wife.

250
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,000
You keep talking to yourself.

251
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,120
You're more annoying than Su Buxiao.

252
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,120
I told you I'm not interested.

253
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,960
You're so annoying.

254
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,520
You're indeed a woman I like.

255
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,840
You want to be the legal wife.

256
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,920
You're bold

257
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,720
and courageous.

258
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,560
We're a match made in heaven.

259
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,720
- I...
- Mi Youchu!

260
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,280
Mi Youchu, save me!

261
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,320
Don't shouting.

262
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,920
Even if you scream your lungs out,

263
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
no one will save you.

264
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,000
Mi Youchu.

265
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,240
Where's Su Buxiao?

266
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,200
- Over there.
- There.

267
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,880
It's good that you're alright.

268
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,480
Youchu.

269
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,280
You must first protect my safety.

270
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,240
This is your first test
to become my legal wife.

271
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,880
What do you think?

272
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
Are you happy that I avenged you?

273
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Compared to him,

274
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,760
am I slightly better?

275
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Just a little.

276
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
I saw that you were nervous

277
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,800
when I called for help.

278
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,320
Believe it or not, I won't go easy
on you if you continue talking nonsense.

279
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,200
Let's go.

280
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,600
Did you say

281
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,160
they capture the girls
to feed flowers with their blood?

282
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,080
You can speak now.

283
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,360
But I didn't see any plants

284
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,600
in the cell.

285
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,720
It means their blood isn't taken here.

286
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,800
Let's hope those girls are alive.

287
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,240
Let's go.

288
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,880
Let's go.

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,680
What are these?

290
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,220
(Name: Bloodthirsty Vine, Function: Suck
Blood, Weakness: Fears Fire and Light)

291
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,680
Fire.

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,760
This thing is scared of fire.

293
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,120
They're called Bloodthirsty Vine.

294
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,800
They're scared of fire

295
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,480
and light.

296
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,720
They can store blood.

297
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,360
I just don't know what they do with it.

298
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Let's go in.

299
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,640
Su Buxiao, save them.

300
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,560
- Alright.
- Hurry.

301
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,920
You found this place.

302
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,920
Who is it?

303
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,560
Come out.

304
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,840
Don't play tricks.

305
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Yeah, come out!

306
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,640
In that case,

307
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,600
