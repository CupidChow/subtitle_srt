Go. Split up and get her.

30

Darling!

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,120
My father didn't rebel.

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,280
He was set up.

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
This is the proof.

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,840
Please help me give it to His Majesty.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,840
Sure.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,320
Darling, what are you doing?

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,160
Let go.

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
No!

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,199
Have you ever wondered

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
how the dragon robe
got under your father's bed

48
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,600
and how the secret letter of rebellion

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,800
reach the emperor?

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,440
No.

51
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,800
You're my husband. You won't do this.

52
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,080
If it wasn't for Mi Army,

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,200
why would I marry

54
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,320
a boring innocent lady like you?

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,280
Your Highness.

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,920
Save her.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,480
Send her to Zuihong Brothel.

58
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,360
Fuling.

59
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,760
You...

60
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
You'll all get retribution!

61
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,240
Retribution?

62
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,040
All right.

63
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,880
In your next life.

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,400
Why?

65
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,440
Throw her into the lotus pond

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,200
and feed your favorite koi fish.

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,480
Sure.

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,320
Let's go.

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,600
(If I have another life,)

70
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,560
(I'll make you pay.)

71
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,520
Am I

72
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,960
reborn?

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,180
(A Wife's Revenge)

74
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,940
(Mi)

75
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,740
(After Rebirth, Mi Youchu)

76

79
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,520
Good job.

80
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,000
- Good job.
- Good job.

81

Chu.

82
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,000
Father, Sister-in-law.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Did you gain your muscles

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
from eating too much protein powder?

85
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,120
Should you be a little more subtle?

86
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,360
All right.

87
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,240
Father, Sister-in-law, what about now?

88
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,000
That's more like it.

89
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,280
That's more like it.

90
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,720
Good. How beautiful.

91
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,960
Youchu.

92
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,280
This is the husband
my father-in-law found for you.

93
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,040
It's Prince Su's recovery party today.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,040
Go check it out.

95
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,280
Charm him

96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,760
and bring him back

97
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,840
so that he asks
for your hand in marriage.

98
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,400
My mother-in-law is no longer around.

99
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,440
We have no news about your elder brother
after he went missing.

100
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,520
My father-in-law just wants
to find a good man to take care of you.

101
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,280
Father, Sister-in-law, don't worry.

102
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
I have the same idea.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,080
I'll go get ready first.

104
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,680
Sure.

105
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
(Su Buxiao.)

106
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
(You ruined my family in my last life.)

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,160
(Fortunately, God was kind)

108
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,880
(to give me a chance to be reborn
and seek revenge on you.)

109
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,200
(Su Buxiao.)

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,680
(You're doomed.)

111
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,120
(Come to think of it,
I was just like them in my last life.)

112
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,600
(We competed with each other)

113
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,920
(to win Su Buxiao's favor.)

114
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,360
(Su Buxiao accidentally fell into
a monster cave at the recovery banquet,)

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
(and I saved him.)

116
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,640
(Let's see)

117
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,760
(how I'm going to kill you today.)

118
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
(Is it her?)

119
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,480
(Could it be her?)

120
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,640
Your Highness.

121
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,240
How shameless.

122
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,240
Xiaowu.

123
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,520
Your Highness.

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,960
What's wrong?

125
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,220
Do you feel a hint of murderous intent?

126
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,840
A murderous intent?

127
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,240
Your Highness.

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,000
The monster cave is ready.

129
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,440
Not bad.

130
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,600
All of you knows

131
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
that I fell off a horse a month ago

132
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,520
and was in a coma for a long time.

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,080
My father found an exotic animal

134
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,520
and said it could cure diseases
and ward off disasters.

135
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,440
I invite all of you

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,880
to see it today.

137
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,040
Your Highness, we have an assassin.

138
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,160
What assassin?

139
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
What's all the fuss?

140
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,160
How could the ladies bear to hurt me?

141
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,559
Yes.

142
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,360
But

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,559
you refuse to watch with me.

144
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,120
I feel

145
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,600
very upset.

146
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,280
I'm very upset.

147
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,120
- How could it be?
- How could it be?

148
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,960
- Go.
- Go.

149
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,520
Are you coming?

150
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
- Go.
- Go.

151
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,960
May I ask your name?

152
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,480
Your Highness.

153
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,880
I'm dizzy.

154
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,360
Dizzy?

155
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,120
Why do you look weak

156
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,120
but is actually strong?

157
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,000
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

158
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,400
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

159
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,040
Your Highness.

160
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,280
Do you think
this is a good way to find the one?

161
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,720
I wanted to jump myself just now,

162
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,240
but

163
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,880
it doesn't affect the plot.

164
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,000
- You can't leave.
- Don't leave.

165
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,160
Isn't the one...

166
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240

167
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,480

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,360
Spare me.

169
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,320
Miss.

170
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,040
I've done nothing to offend you.

171
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
In your next life.

172
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,480
Send her to Zuihong Brothel.

173
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,040

174
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,920

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,560
This game didn't trick me.

184

It's so realistic.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,280
