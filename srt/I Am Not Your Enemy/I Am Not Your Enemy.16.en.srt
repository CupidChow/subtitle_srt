=Episode 16=

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,600
How stubborn.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,640
Stop!

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,280
Unless you want him to die.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,840
Su Buxiao.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,240
Are you alright?

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm fine.

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,080
Don't you just want my blood?

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,240
I'll give it to you.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,960
Youchu.

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,640
Releasing some blood
helps with circulation,

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,120
but we can't give her any.

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,200
Mi Youchu.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,600
The man you like is adorable.

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,680
Releasing some blood?

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,480
What I want

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,600
is all of her blood.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,320
All the more reason
we can't give it to her.

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,200
Be good.

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,000
Leave.

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,800
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,320
Mi Youchu.

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,640
If you don't want him dead,

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,080
just give up and surrender.

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,120
Youchu, leave.

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,280
I won't die. I really...

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Su Buxiao!

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,080
I'll give it to you.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
Are all women that foolish?

46
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm finally getting

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,000
my blood of rebirth.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,220
(New White Hair Witch)

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
No!

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,120
Youchu!

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,280
Youchu!

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
Youchu.

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,960
- Youchu.
- Youchu.

54
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
How dare you hurt my sister?

55
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,000
Youchu.

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Youchu.

57
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,920
Youchu, why are you so silly?

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,160
You're the woman in the painting.

59
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
Who's that man then?

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,360
Leave first.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,240
What about you?

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't leave.

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,920
Promise me.

64
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,600
If you can get away today,

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,560
forget about everything
and live a good life.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
He doesn't deserve for you
to hurt yourself like this.

67
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
So all this has been your doing.

68
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,960
I will bring you to justice today.

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's see

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,120
if you can do it.

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,360
Leave!

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,520
Leave!

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,080
(This is...)

74
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,360
(Father's jade pendant.)

75
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,800
Su Buxiao.

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,120
Su Buxiao.

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,320
Su Buxiao.

78
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,800
Su Buxiao.

79
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,560
Su Buxiao.

80
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,240
Su Buxiao.

81
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
Calm down.

82
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,040
Youchu, no.

83
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,720
No!

84
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,120
Youchu.

85
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,960
Youchu.

86
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,120
Youchu.

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,240
Youchu!

88
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,540
(Mi)

89
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,600
Physician.

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,560
How is she?

91
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
This lady fell into a coma

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,040
because she lost too much blood.

93
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm afraid

94
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
you should get ready.

95
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,920
- What did you say?
- General.

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
- You quack. Scram!
- General!

97
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,040
Scram!

98
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,600
Su Buxiao.

99
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,640
What's with the attitude?

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Youchu is a martial arts expert.

101
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,640
Her temper is no less than that of men.

102
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,840
She could have done
something big with me.

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,200
All this is because of you.

104
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,960
Yes.

105
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,440
It's because of me.

106
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,400
What about you?

107
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,320
Have you ever thought
about Youchu's feelings?

108
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
It's better than lying there
and waiting to die.

109
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,760
Shut up!

110
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,080
Youchu's still alive.

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,440
Liu.

112
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Get the imperial physician.

113
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,480
Don't go, physician.

114
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,080
There's nothing I can do.

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,880
Save my sister.

116
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,520
Physician.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,280
Save my sister.

118
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,800
Youchu.

119
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,960
I'm so silly.

120
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,360
I can't even see through myself.

121
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,880
What game?

122
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,840
What affection value?

123
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,120
I don't care at all now.

124
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
I just want you to get well.

125
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,880
Youchu.

126
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,080
Youchu.

127
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Youchu, you're awake. Youchu.

128
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,360
Be careful.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How long have I been asleep?

130
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,960
Not... Not long.

131
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,680
All that matters is that you're awake.

132
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,960
Go wash your face.

133
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,440
Youchu.

134
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,800
Youchu.

135
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
My hair.

136
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,320
Chu.

137
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,800
Chu, you finally woke up.

138
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,200
I was so worried.

139
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,120
Youchu.

140
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,120
Don't worry.

141
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,040
I've ordered people
to search for rare and famous medicines.

142
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,240
We'll cure your illness.

143
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,160
Definitely.

144
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,160
- You'll get well.
- Definitely.

145
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,200
We can think of a solution.

146
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,040
Stop talking!

147
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,920
Chu.

148
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,120
What happened to my martial arts?

149
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,240
Youchu.

150
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
I'll think of a solution, Youchu.

151
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,040
Get out.

152
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,040
Get out.

153
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,400
Get out! Get out, all of you!

154
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,200
Get out!

155
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,480
Youchu.

156
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,960
- Youchu, open the door.
- Youchu.

157
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,600
You'll be fine.

158
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,840
Youchu.

159
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,240
Youchu.

160
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,040
Youchu.

161
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,440
Chu still hasn't opened the door?

162
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,840
Chu.

163
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm Youmao.

164
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Open the door, Chu.

165
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,880
Chu.

166
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,000
Youchu.

167
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,200
- Youchu, where are you going?
- Chu.

168
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,880
I want to go out for a walk.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,720
I'll accompany you.

170
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,160
Can't I just go out for a walk?

171
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,560
Do you think I'm useless now?

172
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,760
Youchu.

173
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,560
Let's get married.

174
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,520
Give me your all.

175
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,680
I'll be good to you
and take care of you.

176
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,280
Alright?

177
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,880
Chu.

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,120
- Buxiao's feelings for you is genuine.
- Enough!

179

Su Buxiao.

180
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,960
I don't need cheap affections

181
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,240
because of your guilt.

182
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,440
I'll take a walk myself.

183
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,600
Don't any of you follow me.

184
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,400

- Chu.
