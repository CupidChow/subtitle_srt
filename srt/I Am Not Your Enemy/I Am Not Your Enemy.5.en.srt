Where's my corpse?

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,200
Where did I go?

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,760
Watch an ad
and you can be resurrected on the spot.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,400
You don't have to worry

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,800
about not finding the corpse anymore.

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,840
I'll watch.

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,360
Play the ad.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,160
You're really something, Mi Youchu.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,760
You buried me alive.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,920
You put up a tombstone for me.

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,600
You're nice after all.

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:38,260

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,360
Father.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,560
Drink some tea.

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,120
Alright.

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,720
Father.

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,360
Is your old injury recurring?

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,720
Father.

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,120
Let me massage you.

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,360
This minor injury isn't a big deal.

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,720
If your father

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,880
hadn't carried me
out of the pile of dead bodies,

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,720
I would have died.

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,200
It's a pity

43
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,199
that he also fell ill because of this

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,120
and died young.

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,000
Youchu.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
Fuling just got to the capital city

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,640
and is unfamiliar with the place.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,320
You need to take care of her
and guide her.

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Youchu.

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,360
I grew up in the other residence

51
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,560
and am inexperienced.

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,240
Please forgive me
for the jade ruyi incident.

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,600
As for Prince Su,

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,280
I'll find time to apologize to him.

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,320
Alright.

56
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,000
(Prince Su is dead.)

57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,160
(It should be your turn next.)

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,480
This pain is killing me.

59
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,560
She's so cruel.

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,440
I pretended to be pitiful
for so long in vain.

61
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
It's alright
that she just watched me die,

62
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
she even buried me alive.

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,520
I'll

64
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,960
let other sucker players conquer her.

65
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm a worker who works 9AM to 9PM

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,280
6 days a week anyway.

67
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,960
I might as as well
hide in this residence

68
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,640
and be a carefree man.

69
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,840
(Stop)

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,760
Warning.

71
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,120
If the players abandon their missions,

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
they will be locked in here forever.

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,640
I'm not quitting.

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,520
I...

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,080
You win.

77
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,280
(Zuixiang Inn)

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,800
Sir and Madam.

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,640
Please come again.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,280
Miss.

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,440
Are you stopping for a meal
or staying for the night?

82
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,280
Get me a room.

83
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,120
I need it tonight.

84
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,960
We still have a premium room available.

85
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,120
I'll arrange it for you right away.

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,080
Here's the payment for the room.

87
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll come over later.

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,800
Alright, Miss.

89
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,920
Treat the guest well.

90
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,160
(I just died,)

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,560
(and she already
booked a room in an inn.)

92
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,240
(I'd like to see)

93
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,920
(what jerk caught Mi Youchu's eye.)

94
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,560
(Why is it
the paparazzi from the tabloid?)

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Why is there a guy here?

96
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,960
Speak.

97
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,320
What's your relationship with Mi Youchu?

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,880
Speak.

99
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,840
No, what...

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,120
Don't hit me.

101
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,160
Ms. Mi says she has a tip-off tonight.

102
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,800
I came early.

103
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,160
(What kink is this?)

104
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,920
(She even asked someone to follow her.)

105
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,760
Who are you?

106
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,000
You were hiding over there.

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,560
Did someone tell you some gossip?

108
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,480
No.

109
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
Are you in the same business as me?

110
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,520
But as your senior, I want to remind you

111
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,680
that there are rules in the industry.
First come, first served.

112
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,040
- Ms. Mi gave me this headline
- Your Highness.

113
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,200
first.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
Your Highness?

115
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,640
Your Highness.

116
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,200
(It's not Mi Youchu's voice.)

117
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,680
Your Highness?

118
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,920
Why is there no one here?

119
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,640
(It's Fuling.)

120
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
(How did she know I was here?)

121
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,760
I think it's more romantic
without the lamplight.

122
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
Is she that open?

123
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,840
How beautiful.

124
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,240
Her figure...

125
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,560
Don't look.

126
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,320
Who's there?

127
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,480
Your Highness.

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,480
You came.

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,560
Put on your clothes.

130
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,600
Don't you have any shame?

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,960
Why are you here?

132
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Who do you think it is?

133
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,040
I...

134
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,520
I wrote to you
pretending to be Su Buxiao

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,400
and tricked you to come here.

136
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,880
You're a lady.

137
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,840
You're meeting Su Buxiao
in the middle of the night.

138
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,440
And you even prepared
such an obscene thing.

139
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,120
Youchu.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,600
My admiration for His Highness

141
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,400
made me make this mistake.

142
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,040
Don't tell Father.

143
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
I don't care about that jerk.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,760
It's

145
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,880
your dishonor of the Mi family

146
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,080
that is unforgivable.

147
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,240
I...

148
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,000
Why is it men who suffer

149
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,440
when women fight?

150
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,800
Come out.

151
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,640
She's asking for you.

152
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:22,940
(To: Prince Su)

153
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,080
These

154
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
are complaints
from people you've scammed.

155
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,680
He's a reporter for World Weekly.

156
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,760
He has written down all your crimes.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Tomorrow onward,

158
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,560
you'll become famous in the capital city.

159
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,800
Mi Youchu.

160
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,680
Turns out
that you've been trying to set me up.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,320
You're so despicable.

162
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,760
I'm no match for you.

163
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,480
I advise you to return
all the money you've scammed.

164
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,560
Otherwise,

165
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,240
I'll make you regret it.

166
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,360
What if I say no?

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,080
Try it then.

168
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,640
You'd better remember this.

169
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,840
Miss.

170
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,720
Should I...

171
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,960
Write this article or not?

172
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,680
Got it.

173
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,400
Well...

174
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,200
What about the one in the cabinet?

175
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,760
Where did he go?

176
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,480
Su Buxiao's dead.

177
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,400
Fuling has also left capital city.

178
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,080
All this

179
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
should be over now.

180
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,040
The previous Su Buxiao is dead.

181
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm a brand new Su Buxiao.

182
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,760
Youchu, run. Leave me here.

183
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
Lock Fuling up!

184
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,080
I did it for you.

185
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
You've probably never seen snow.

186
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,240
I turned goose feathers into snow

187
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,160
just to win a smile from you.

188
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,240
No.

189
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
Why would I think Su Buxiao has changed?

190
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,200
Never mind.

191
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,920
It's over anyway.

192
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,360
But

193
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,080
why would he save me?

194
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,400
Forget it.

195
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,440
Stop thinking about it.

196
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,200
What on earth is going on?

197
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
It's because of this.

198
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Gosh.

199
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,400
Why haven't you changed your appearance?

200
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,600
Let go.

201
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,440
No!

202
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,160
If it wasn't for Mi Army,

203
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,840
why would I marry

204
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
a boring innocent girl like you?

205
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,920
You'll all get retribution!

206
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,400
In your next life.

207
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
I see.

208
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,160
I'm just passively playing a game.

209
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,280
Why is there a bug?

210
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Mi Youchu

211
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,800
has non-player character hacks.

212
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,400
How do I play this game?

213
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,840
There's nothing I can do.
