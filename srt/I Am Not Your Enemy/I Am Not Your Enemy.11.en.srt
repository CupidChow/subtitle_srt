16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,900
(Adapted from "I Am Not Your Enemy"
Author: Black Circle and White Dot)

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,980
=Episode 11=

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,680
You're quite skilled.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,080
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,960
(His shoes are weird.)

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,920
I'm from the countryside.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,080
I don't know those things.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,600
You complained again.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,360
I'll kill you.

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,040
You complained about me
in front of the dignitary.

26
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:24,060
(A Love Rival Appeared!)

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,040
Are you trying
to report me to the dignitary?

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,920
I'll crippled you sooner or later.

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,800
Let's go.

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,720
Master.

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,440
Are you alright?

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,120
Master.

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,000
Let me help you.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
Bah.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,040
That treacherous
backstabbing lapdog Chen.

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,120
He probably forgot

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,920
General Youmao's teachings.

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,240
Master.

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,240
Do you know General Youmao?

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,240
Of course.

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,800
Everyone knows

42
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,640
how impressive and righteous

43
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
General Youmao is.

44
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,200
I admire him very much.

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,480
But I heard

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,720
he went missing.

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,239
The year General Youmao
returned to the capital city,

48
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,440
Chen was supposed to follow him.

49
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,360
But on the day of departure,

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
he said he had a sudden illness
and couldn't go with him.

51
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,560
He hurried back from outside
the next day.

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
He even injured his arm.

53
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,680
He said he was bitten by a wild animal
while out hunting.

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,520
He went hunting when he's ill?

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,320
What nonsense is this?

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,560
Soon after,

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,680
news came
that General Youmao was missing.

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,520
Is General Youmao's disappearance

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,920
related to Chen?

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm not sure.

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,240
He always
followed General Youmao around

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
and acted like they were brothers.

63
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,800
After General Youmao disappeared,

64
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,320
the lapdog

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,040
triumphantly became commander

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,160
and made Mi Army a mess.

67
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,960
There's something fishy indeed.

68
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,120
Who was the person
who delivered the vegetables?

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
He seems a little unfamiliar.

70
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,680
You didn't earn kickbacks, do you?

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,920
Master.

72
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
I asked him.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,040
He's Mr. Wang's family.

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,120
He's his nephew.

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,600
Mr. Wang's nephew?

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
How come I don't know?

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,720
Forget it.

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,560
Let's drink.

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
Your Highness.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,640
Please.

81
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Commander Chen, you're too kind.

82
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,600
I wonder why

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,880
you're here.

84
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,800
I heard you're doing a good job
at managing the army,

85
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,880
so I brought five thousand units
of supplies to commend you.

86
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,120
Actually,

87
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
I'm just doing my job.

88
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,160
But

89
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,440
I still want to thank you

90
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
for our soldiers.

91
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,320
Food is...

92
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,720
Why is it him?

93
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,720
How would I know?

94
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,680
He's so annoying.

95
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,160
I'll deal with him.

96
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,720
Leave first.

97
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,880
What are you two doing?

98
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
Hurry and serve the food.

99
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,040
Alright.

100
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,400
Your Highness.

101
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
These two are new recruits.

102
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,320
They don't know the rules.

103
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,760
Please forgive them.

104
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,320
New recruits?

105
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,320
What is this nonsense?

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,120
Leave.

107
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,280
Leave!

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Your Highness.

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,880
I'll scold them later.

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,400
Please.

111
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,640
Commander Chen.

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,280
Here.

113
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,480
I have a request.

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
Why is he here?

115
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,800
He's like a leech.

116
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,360
Once you stick it on,
you can't peel it off.

117
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,480
Fortunately, I touched charcoal
and forgot to wash my hands.

118
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,000
And we got away.

119
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,680
Look at how dirty your face is.

120
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,200
I told you to stay away from me.

121
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,360
I'll clean it myself.

122
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:11,880
No.

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,960
You can't see it.

124
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,680
Let me help you wipe it off.

125
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,520
No thanks.

126
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,080
He's just

127
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,920
a prince with an empty title.

128
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,240
What's with the attitude?

129
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,760
Why have you been avoiding me lately?

130
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,760
No.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,880
No way.

132
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,760
Really.

133
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,880
No.

134
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,760
Mi Xiaochu.

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,880
Yes.

136
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,360
Yes.

137
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
From tomorrow onward,

138
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,640
you're in charge
of taking care of His Highness.

139
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,520
He can't do it.

140
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,920
What did you say?

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
I'll do it.

142
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,760
No.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,960
Why are you doing it?

144
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
Second Prince pursues you relentlessly.

145
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
He must have ulterior motives.

146
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
I want to see

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,320
what he's up to.

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,920
Stay out of this.

149
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,280
Stay out of this?

150
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,120
Who do you want to be involved
if not me?

151
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,860
(Hmph! She Wants Me to Stay Out of It.)

152
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,140
(She Must Be Up to Something Bad!)

153
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,100
(I'm Too Weak to Draw the Bow.)

154
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,780
(Little Fool.)

155
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,580
(I'll Help You.)

156
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,300
(I'm So Mad.)

157
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,180
(Lovey-dovey...)

158
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,300
(I Can't Bear to Watch!)

159
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,140
(These Are All Su Buxiao's Imagination)

160
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,860
(In Fact...)

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Wait.

162
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,640
Stop.

163
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,640
Stop.

164
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,840
Come back.

165
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,240
Stop.

166
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,920
Come on.

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,280
Stay out of this?

168
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,880
Where are you going?

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,040
I want to be involved.

170
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,400
What are you doing?

171
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,880
Give it to me.

172
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Don't you know

173
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,520
that men and women are different?

174
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,320
Aren't we living and eating together?

175
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,200
What's the difference?

176
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
How is it the same?

177
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,880
He must have recognized us long ago

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and is messing with us.

179
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,760
That... That's even worse.

180
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,880
He keeps clinging to you.

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,200
He must have bad intentions.

182
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,320
(He's deliberately showing his abs.)

183
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,000
(What's with the overbearing persona?)

184
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,520
(He's not the only one with abs.)

185
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,320
Buddy.

186
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,280
Are you married?

187
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,000
No.

188
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,760
Do you have someone you like?

189
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,000
No.

190
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,960
Why don't you work for me?

191
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,640
I'll find you a good marriage.

192
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,440
Enough.

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,160
Enough of this.

194
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,440
Stop pretending, Second Prince.

195
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Do you think

196
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,400
you can harass Youchu however you want?

197
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm just kidding you two.

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,040
You're so annoying.

199
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,160
But why are you like a dog?

200
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,560
You can smell us wherever we go.

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,600
Su Buxiao.

202
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,240
You're as vulgar as ever.

203
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Your Highness.

204
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,760
We've played along with you.

205
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,359
Please tell us

206
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,800
your real purpose
for coming to the military camp.

207
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,720
I'm at

208
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,560
wherever you are.

209
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:39,520
What are you doing here?

210
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Why don't you tell me?

211
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,080
Maybe I can help.

212
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,680
Cooperation requires honesty.

213
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,120
Since this is your attitude,

214
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,520
we have nothing to tell you.

215
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,120
We have nothing to tell you.

216
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,780
(To General Mi)

217
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,760
Master.

218
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,800
Master.

219
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
What are you burning?

220
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,680
Yes.

221
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,880
These are letters

222
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
I've written to General Mi
over the years,

223
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
wanting him to take charge.

224
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,840
Here, take this.

225
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,240
He

226
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,400
(To General Mi)
returned

227
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,240
all the letters.

228
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
Master, stop burning.

229
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,360
Burn it all.

230
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,880
Stop burning, Master.

231
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,440
I can't wait anymore either.

232
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,960
(To General Mi)
I'll retire and return home next month.

233
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,920
General Mi can continue being a coward

234
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,400
and enjoy his wealth and splendor
in the capital city.

235
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Master, don't worry.

236
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,120
I'll personally hand these letters

237
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,640
to General Mi.

238
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,800
I'll revive Mi Army.

239
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,680
He can do it.

240
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,160
You?

241
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,320
You're an army cook.

242
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,400
On what grounds?

243
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
It's because

244
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,440
my last name is also Mi.

245
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,080
His last name is Mi.

246
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,680
Your last name is Mi?

247
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
I was blind.

248
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,400
Greetings, Ms. Mi

249
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,960
Liu﻿.

250
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,720
Your Highness.

251
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,720
How's the investigation going?

252
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,120
His Majes...

253
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,520
Master did get into danger
in the nearby Qingyuan Village.

254
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,640
When girls went missing in that village

255
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,200
three years ago,

256
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,840
the entire village disappeared.

257
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,520
Continue investigating it.

258
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,720
I don't believe

259
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,840
people can disappear overnight

260
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,720
