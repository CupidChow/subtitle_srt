00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,319
Dear Su Daxiao,

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,920
you're about to enter

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,120
an unprecedented game

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,560
and start a new journey.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,760
Gosh.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,480
(Entering Game)

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,840
This game didn't trick me.

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,720
It's so realistic.

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,560
You will play as Su Buxiao.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,520
Good luck.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,960
Tofu. Fresh tofu.

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,360
(Tofu Lady)
Welcome to the realistic virtual game,

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,480
"God's Hands".

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,680
(Tabloid Reporter)
Find the predestined one

33
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,440
and win her heart.

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,680
(Fisherman)
When you help her complete the main task

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,040
and only

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,440
(Tough Guy)
when her fondness of you reaches 100.

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,960
(A Beautiful Girl)
Then you can leave the game .

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,920
(I'm A Horse)
It's not a lie.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,160
You really can't leave.

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,800
What's going on?

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,480
(No way.)

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,560
(For real?)

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,760
(What should I do?)

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,520
Your Highness.

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,840
I finally found you.

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Why did you run out by yourself?

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,720
Are you alright?

48
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,720
Let me see.

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,199
I got trapped.

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,960
You ambusher!

51
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,300
(You Were Reborn While I
Traveled Through Time. Let's Go! OMG.)

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,320
Your Highness.

53
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,920
Someone save His Highness.

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,160
I think he's dead.

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,280
Why don't you bury him?

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
Your Highness.

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,200
- Your Highness.
- I know what to do.

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,720
Ladies.

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,040
We can save His Highness
with artificial respiration.

60
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,240
Darling.

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,320
Why do you smell like green tea?

62
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,880
This garden is full of greenery.

63
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,680
It's normal
to smell the scent of plants.

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,640
I'll pick a flower for you.

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,440
Darling, you're hurt.

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,240
Wait here.

67
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,080
I'll get you some medicine.

68
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,200
Be careful.

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,240
Buxiao.

70
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,440
You're hurt.

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,080
I'm fine.

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,840
Do you like the earrings I gave you?

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,440
Yes.

74
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,720
I have a lot more in my room.

75
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,720
Do you want to have a look?

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,920
That couldn't be better.

77
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,000
(It was indeed you back then.)

78
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,280
(I wanted to spare you
after getting reborn.)

79
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
(I sent you to another residence,)

80
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,720
(but you came back
to do the same old trick.)

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,600
(Don't blame me then.)

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,680
What a strong green tea fragrance.

83
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,840
How refreshing.

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,480
Yes, you smell good.

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,240
Miss.

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,520
What perfume do you use?

87
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,520
It's so refreshing.

88
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,600
I especially loved green tea

89
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
since I was a child.

90
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,880
I never used perfume.

91
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,280
I think

92
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,840
it's just Chaniel Number 5
that everyone uses.

93
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,280
Why pretend to be pure?

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
Who are you?

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm the Mi family's adopted daughter.

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
I was raised in another residence
since I was little.

97
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
I just returned today.

98
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,240
Youchu.

99
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,640
I missed you so much.

100
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,800
You're shameless.

101
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,920
You're a lady.

102
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,760
You came here
without receiving an invitation.

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,160
I will teach you a lesson
on behalf of Father.

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,400
You're right.

105
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,840
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
What's artificial respiration?

107
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Tell us.

108
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,400
It's

109
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
mouth to mouth,

110
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,320
lips to lips,

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,680
and breathing air through your mouth.

112
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,080
(What did I hear?)

113
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,000
(Artificial respiration?)

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,840
Tell us

115
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,920
who should breathe air to Prince Su?

116
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
In that case,

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,880
let me do it.

118
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,280
You have no shame.

119
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,720
Youchu.

120
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,480
What a misfortune for the family.

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,080
Everyone's worried about His Highness.

122
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,920
Why are you so anxious?

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,360
I...

124
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
I think you want
to have physical contact with him

125
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,360
under the guise of rescuing him.

126
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,160
No. Not really.

127
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,520
She's such a wench.

128
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,280
Fortunately, Miss Mi exposed you.

129
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,200
Otherwise, you would have deceived us.

130
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,720
- No.
- How evil.

131
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,120
No wonder she reeks.

132
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,160
That's right.

133
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,400
Which lady here

134
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,240
doesn't want to have physical contact
with His Highness?

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,280
We're just

136
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
pretending to be reserved.

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,480
You...

138
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,400
Stop it.

139
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,120
Anyways,

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,000
it's all her fault.

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,000
What did you say? I...

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,280
It's you.

143
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,560
There are other ways
to do artificial respiration.

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,120
I learned such a rescue

145
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
from Nan Country's envoy before.

146
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Let me do it.

147
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
(Affection Value)

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,440
(Why are there question marks?)

149
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,160
(Affection Value)
(She's unlike those girls.)

150
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,160
(Is she)

151
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,640
(the predestined one?)

152
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,080
(Affection Value)

153
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
Your Highness.

154
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,640
(I have a benefit in recognizing her.)

155
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,560
Firstly,

156
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,200
the first step is

157
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,160
to press the chest!

158
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,220
(Affection Value)

159
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,160
(She's so unfriendly.)

160
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,400
(The number is also low.)

161
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,600
(Watch how I'll win your heart.)

162
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,080
I'm awake.

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,480
His Highness is awake.

164
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,280
He's awake.

165
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,280
- Great.
- He's alive.

166
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,480
Your Highness

167
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,000
Thank you for saving me.

168
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm willing to marry you

169
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,240
to fulfill God's will.

170
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,280
Your Highness,
what are you talking about?

171
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,960
Let's have another round.

172
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,480
Wait.

173
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,560
His Highness is dead again!

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,240
When can I

175
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,280
fill up her affection value?

176
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,040
My dear.

177
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
Don't say that.

178
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,880
What the hell?

179
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,800
Don't blame the game if you're a noob.

180
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,520
What did you say?

181
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,480
Who are you calling a noob?

182
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,160
What stupid game is this?

183
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,880
I quit.

184
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,760
My dear.

185
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,040
Are you sure you want to quit?

186
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,920
If you click Continue,

187
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,200
you will be given

188
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,400
a free resurrection opportunity
worth 88,888 yuan.
