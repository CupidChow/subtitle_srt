=Episode 19=

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,080
Drag her out.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,760
You must stay alive

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,520
and watch me

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
destroy everything

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,360
you hold most dear.

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,220
(It Started with a Kiss)

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,120
Why are you out alone?

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
Where's Chu and Buxiao?

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,600
Did something happen to them?

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,640
We found traces of the lady in red

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,920
in the palace.

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
Chu hasn't recovered her martial arts.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
What if the lady in red captures her?

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Don't worry.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,920
They're fine.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
We found out that the lady in red's case

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,960
isn't as simple as we thought.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,560
Speaking of which,

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,520
where's the painting?

37
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,320
Why are you looking for the painting?

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,680
I found that Father and Consort Shu

39
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,720
are looking for a painting an old eunuch
took out of the palace.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,560
I suspect

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,320
it's the one you have.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,280
I finally find out

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
why you're so hostile to me.

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,440
Did you know

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,240
that the man in the painting
was my father?

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,440
The palace is dangerous.

47
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,000
For the safety of Youchu

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,440
and the whole country,

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,680
I hope you can help me.

50
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,440
Su Buxiao.

51
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,760
Why are you still in the palace?

52
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,760
I found out
who the lady in red really is.

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,080
There seems to be nothing wrong
with the painting.

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,400
But why did the old eunuch

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
give you the painting?

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,240
And why is Father

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,040
in such a hurry to find this painting?

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,520
No.

59
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Something must be wrong.

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,760
Look.

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,760
I got this
from Consort Shu's palace maid.

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,240
It's the same fabric

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,600
I found earlier
from the imperial garden.

64
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,960
So

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,080
Consort Shu's the lady in red?

66
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,280
Once we capture Consort Shu

67
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,920
and unravel their plot,

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,040
you'll be completely safe.

69
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,200
Buxiao.

70
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,960
Thank you.

71
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,560
Why have you been acting
so weird lately?

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
Why do you keep avoiding me?

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,880
Did...

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,920
I?

75
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Are you regretting it?

76
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,440
You don't like me anymore?

77
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,120
I don't dislike you.

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,520
You like me then.

79
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,480
I...

80
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,600
Can't you just speak your mind?

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,959
Youchu, you know

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,400
we're from different worlds.

83
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
That's why I'm afraid that one day...

84
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,640
Buxiao.

85
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,520
You're the one I've been looking for.

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
The one willing to treat me well.

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,920
You've

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
changed a lot.

89
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,520
You'll protect me,

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
cherish me,

91
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,040
and even

92
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,400
risk your life for me.

93
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,240
I think

94
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,920
we have to live in the moment.

95
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,960
It doesn't matter what the outcome is.

96
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,800
What matters

97
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,920
is that I trust you.

98
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,360
As long as

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm still in your world,

100
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,600
I'll try my best to treat you well.

101
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,840
His Majesty has an order.

102
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,480
Mi Youchu is asked
to meet His Majesty immediately.

103
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,360
Ms. Mi.

104
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,720
Come out.

105
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,520
Sir.

106
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
It's late.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,640
I wonder why His Majesty summoned me.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,920
I don't know either.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,960
Please follow me back.

110
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,840
Hurry.

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,000
Alright.

112
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,400
(Looks like we need to
catch the lady in red soon)

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,440
(so that Youchu
can get out of the palace)

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,880
(and avoid
being bothered by the emperor.)

115
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,400
What are you doing?

116
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,960
What is this?

117
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,360
What's the matter?

118
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,600
(If I die, the throne
will be passed to Second Prince.)

119
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,320
Posthumous edict?

120
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
How is it possible?

121
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I was assassinated

122
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,320
by the emperor's cronies,
Imperial Iron Guards.

123
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,680
Why would he have someone
send me the posthumous edict?

124
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,480
Are you saying

125
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,600
the men who assassinated you
were assigned by Father?

126
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,840
No wonder Father changed over the years

127
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
and asked Youchu to enter the palace
to join the maiden selection.

128
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,560
Turns out he had long been
under the lady in red's control.

129
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,320
Oh no.

130
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,240
They're in danger.

131
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,240
Your Highness.

132
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
Let me enter the palace with you.

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,640
Let's not alert them yet.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,720
I'll enter the palace first.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,080
You can standby outside the palace.

136
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,240
Your Majesty.

137
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,040
Mi Youchu is here.

138
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,200
I wonder why you summoned me
late at night.

139
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,520
I've had someone send General Mi home.

140
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

141
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,760
Since you're here,

142
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,240
have a chat with me.

143
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,960
Eat.

144
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
Eat.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,560
You despised me,

146
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,080
now

147
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,280
you have to rely on me to feed you.

148
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Eat it.

149
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,280
Eat it.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,480
Eat.

151
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,720
You...

152
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,200
If it wasn't for my son,

153
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
you think I'd take care of you?

154
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,880
I don't think she'll live much longer.

155
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,600
I knew it's her.

156
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,840
Gosh.

157
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,120
This country will be my son's.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
Do you suspect it's her too?

159
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,480
Turns out that the lady in red
had infiltrated the palace

160
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,320
and disguised herself
as Consort Shu to control Father.

161
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,000
That's why Father sent a painting

162
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,680
containing a secret edict
to General Youmao.

163
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,440
It's to prevent someone else
from taking over the country

164
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,200
if something bad happens to him.

165
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,240
Who's there?

166
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,320
Sit.

167
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,000
I wouldn't dare.

168
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,120
I heard you were injured some time ago.

169
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,000
Looks like you haven't recovered fully.

170
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,920
I ordered someone to make it.

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Try it.

172
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,920
Who?

173
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,240
Speak.

174
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,600
Come out.

175
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,720
Stop being sneaky.

176
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,320
Come out.

177
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,320
Who?

178
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,000
Witch!

179
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,440
Second Prince?

180
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Why does it feel different?

181
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,360
- Have I gotten stronger?
- Father.

182
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,560
How come the lady in red's skills

183
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,840
have deteriorated so much?

184
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,320
Father.

185
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,240
My son.

186
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,520
My son.

187
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,640
Youchu...

188
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,000
Drink it.

189
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,720
Yes.

190
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,720
You're not the emperor.

191
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,920
Do you think you can get away?

192
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,880
I didn't expect you
to disguise yourself as the emperor.

193
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,000
Wang Niuniu.

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's too late even if you find out.

195
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480
The two of them
have fallen into my trap.

196
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Tonight,

197
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,520
no one's coming to save you.

198
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,520
Turns out Consort Shu
is part of your plan.

199
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,600
That's right.

200
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,240
This time,

201
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,360
I want nothing to go wrong.

202
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,080
Wait.

203
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,880
I have something to say.

204
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,920
What do you have to say?

205
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,840
Is it worth it

206
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,960
for that unfaithful man?

207
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,320
He was the first person
to be nice to me,

208
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,600
but he also hurt me the most.

209
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,400
Your Majesty.

210
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,760
- Am I pretty?
- Yes.

211
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,680
You're the prettiest tonight.

212
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,160
Your Majesty.

213
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,720
Look at me.

214
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,440
Sure.

215
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,560
Who's there?

216
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,400
Niuniu?

217
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,720
You're having so much fun

218
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,760
together.
