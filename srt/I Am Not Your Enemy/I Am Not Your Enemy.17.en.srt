18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,840
Youchu.

(Confess Their Feelings to Each Other)

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,320
Youchu.

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,960
Was it you just now?

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,120
You're

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,560
not the sun

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,440
nor the moon.

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,120
You're

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,360
a gentle

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,440
and tiny star.

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,600
You're like a firefly.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,600
You can break through the darkness

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,960
and light up your own life.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,640
Youchu.

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,120
Happy birthday.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Your belated gift.

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,440
It's so beautiful.

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,720
This is the unique gift
I prepared for you.

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,840
I know

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,200
you've done a lot for the Mi family
since you were little.

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
You forced yourself,

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,240
wanting to turn yourself into the sun

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,760
to illuminate everyone around you.

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
But sometimes,

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,560
I think

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,200
it's not a bad idea

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,560
to be a firefly.

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,000
You're little

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,520
but you can also break
the shackles of darkness.

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,640
We're small but strong.

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
Let me spend

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,400
the rest of your days with you.

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,400
You

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,440
changed so much.

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,080
Actually,

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
I always knew

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
you had memories of the past.

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,160
How did you know?

56
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,280
Youchu, let me finish.

57
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm not...

58
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,080
I'm not the Su Buxiao
that will break your heart.

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,160
What do you mean?

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm

61
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,280
just using Su Buxiao's body.

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,800
The real me

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,440
is from

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,440
somewhere further away than that star.

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,840
The only reason I'm here

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,440
is you.

67
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't worry.

68
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,480
No matter what happens,

69
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,720
I'll find a way to stay with you.

70
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,480
So

71
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
for just a little bit of time,

72
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,520
could you
please let go of your responsibilities

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,320
make life easier on yourself?

74
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,200
Alright?

75
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,160
(Yongping Pass)
So

76
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,640
the people from where you are
have colorful hair?

77
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,519
Besides that,

78
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,760
they need to find

79
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,920
someone called Tony.

80
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,240
To... Tony?

81
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,440
And it's very expensive.

82
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,560
What a strange name.

83
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,880
It's not cold anymore, right?

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,320
Look.

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,080
The sun is about to rise.

86
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,600
It's the first time
we've seen the sunrise.

87
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,760
How did this happen?

88
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,000
Looks like I've failed once again.

89
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
I failed to save the Mi family.

90
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,280
Buxiao.

91
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Thank you for accompanying me.

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,720
No.

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,920
No.

94
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Everything will be fine.

95
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,720
Everything will be fine, Youchu.

96
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,160
Everything will be fine.

97
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,240
Youchu.

98
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,720
Everything will be fine.

99
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,440
Youchu!

100
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,400
System!

101
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,800
System, come out!

102
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,760
Please save Youchu.

103
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
There must be something you can do.

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,320
Reviving NPCS
is a violation of the rules,

105
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,600
but there's something we can do.

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,800
Tell me.

107
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,320
You can give your life to the NPC.

108
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,280
But in turn,

109
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
you will encounter a major crisis.

110
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
The fatality rate

111
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,800
is predicted to be 99.99%.

112
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,760
Besides that,

113
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,760
if you die in the major crisis,

114
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,080
you will never be able to
enter the game again.

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,440
In other words,

116
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,400
I may never see Youchu again, right?

117
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
You can put it that way.

118
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,320
Do you want to proceed?

119
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,120
Yes.

120
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,320
Youchu.

121
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,800
I promised you

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,600
that I would make you happy

123
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
and surprise you on every birthday.

124
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,400
Even if

125
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,640
we might never meet again.

126
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,060
(Yongping Pass)

127
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,520
Youchu.

128
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,880
You woke up.

129
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Why are you crying?

130
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm just happy.

131
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,800
What happened?

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,760
Look at you.

133
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,200
You took a nap

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
and your hair has turned black.

135
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,880
If this goes on,

136
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,280
Tony will lose his job.

137
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,520
I've recovered.

138
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,760
Buxiao, I've recovered.

139
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,340
(Affection Value)

140
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
You saved me.

141
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,400
How did you do it?

142
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,920
Our chosen ones

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,080
are possessed by the cat god.

144
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,880
We have nine lives.

145
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,240
I gave you one.

146
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,080
Really?

147
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,560
Chu.

148
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,040
Youchu.

149
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Your hair.

150
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,080
You...

151
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,760
I'm alright now.

152
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,720
It's great that you're alright,

153
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,880
but...

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,920
Something happened in the palace.

155
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,160
What happened?

156
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,800
Father has been imprisoned.

157
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,200
It's gold.

158
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,200
The imperial garden is different.

159
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,240
An eunuch.

160
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,800
It's the first time
I've seen a real-life eunuch.

161
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,720
Keep your voice down.

162
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,520
Don't forget that you're a palace maid.

163
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,679
You're doomed

164
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,480
if someone finds out.

165
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,240
Yes, Miss.

166
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,400
You're imitating quite well.

167
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,280
I notice

168
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
you look good in women's clothes.

169
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,160
That's because I'm good-looking.

170
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
If I'm like your brother...

171
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,120
That figure.

172
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,760
That voice.

173
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,400
Comfortable!

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,120
I'll give myself away.

175
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,160
Where are you from?

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,720
You have no manners.

177
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,960
You don't even bow
when you see Consort Shu.

178
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,440
I'm Mi Youchu. Greetings, Consort Shu.

179
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,280
I thought we had a monkey
in the imperial garden

180
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,640
scratching its ears and cheeks.

181
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,720
Who knew

182
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,080
it's Mi Youchu, the chosen maiden
who just entered the palace.

183
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,880
His Majesty insisted
that you enter the palace.

184
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,920
I thought you were a stunning beauty.

185
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,520
I even wanted to ask His Majesty
to marry you to my son.

186
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,520
Now that I've seen you,

187
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,040
that's all you are.

188
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,040
Are you doubting His Majesty's judgment?

189
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,840
That would be disrespectful.

190
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,440
You...

191
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,360
Are you mad?

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,320
Women get crow's feet, nasolabial folds

193
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,240
and forehead wrinkles when they're mad.

194
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,920
Do I have them?

195
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,440
- Do I?
- No.

196
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,720
You're just a chosen maiden.

197
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,440
How dare you disrespect Her Highness?

198
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,560
Miss.

199
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,160
We're new here.

200
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,480
Your earrings are so pretty.

201
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,040
Please tolerate us.

202
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,960
Let's go.

203
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,320
Don't argue with them.

204
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,760
Why are there bees?

205
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Hurry.

206
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,240
Cover my face.

207
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
Help me cover it.

208
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,680
Your Highness.

209
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,080
What happened?

210
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,560
What a waste of my beauty honey.

211
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,640
Are you happy
that I've stood up for you?

212
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,980
(Affection Value)

213
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
Father doesn't have his jade pendant.

214
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,360
Father.

215
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,960
Mi Youchu has entered the palace.

216
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,960
Please send General Mi home soon.

217
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,160
I've been traveling a lot recently.

218
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,080
I found a jade pendant

219
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,480
by chance.

220
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,640
I found it familiar.

221
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,240
You seemed to have worn it before.

222
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,440
Your Majesty.

223
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,520
Look.

224
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
Isn't this

225
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,680
the jade pendant that you gave
to the woman from Qingyuan Village?

226
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,080
Is she

227
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,400
still alive?

228
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,600
Where is she?

229
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,320
I

230
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,600
don't know if she's the woman
from Qingyuan Village.

231
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,680
All I know

232
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,880
is that a lady in red
left the jade pendant.

233
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,680
I

234
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,840
owe her my life.

235
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,240
I was in danger many years ago.

236
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
Fortunately, the lady saved me.

237
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,280
I had nothing on me,

238
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,920
so I gave her
the jade pendant around my waist

239
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,400
as a token.

240
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,800
It's a pity

241
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,080
that when I went looking for her,

242
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,280
she already died.

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,560
Bring me my box.

244
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

245
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,360
This is

246
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,640
a butterfly double jade tribute
from Siam.

247
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,840
It signifies a devoted partnership.

248
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,920
Now,

249
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,000
the butterfly double jade is in pairs,

250
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,040
but I'm lonely

251
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
and the only one left.

252
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,080
(Am I wrong?)

253
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,200
(Father hasn't been in touch
with the lady in red for years.)

254
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,200
Father.

255
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,840
Your Majesty.

256
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,560
Your health...

257
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,680
I will excuse myself.

258
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,640
Your Majesty.

259
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,440
Take care of yourself, Your Majesty.
