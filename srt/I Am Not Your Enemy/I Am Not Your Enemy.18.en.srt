16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,900
(Adapted from "I Am Not Your Enemy"
Author: Black Circle and White Dot)

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,980
=Episode 18=

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,200
You really embarrassed
Consort Shu today.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,720
You avenged me.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,640
I...

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,800
I promised your brother

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,320
I'd take good care of you.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,720
Don't you want to care about me?

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,200
It's late.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,960
Go to bed.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,080
I'll sleep on the floor today.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,880
I'm going to sleep.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,920
You should sleep soon too.

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,360
Su Buxiao.

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,160
Su Buxiao.

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,760
We

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,480
will be fine

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,800
and happy.

34
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,220
(Intrigue in the Palace)

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,240
We haven't found the lady in red.

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,680
Youchu will always be in danger.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,520
What do I do?

38
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:37,960
Alright.

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Even if this all works out

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,280
and I fill up the affection value,

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,760
I'll go back.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
What about Youchu?

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,120
If the affection value isn't filled up,

44
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,120
what if I die?

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,200
What will Youchu do?

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,240
This is so frustrating.

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,480
Your Highness.

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,320
Today, I saw that Father's
having problems with his throat,

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,000
so I made a special decoction
to reduce phlegm and cough.

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,480
You're too kind, Your Highness.

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,080
But

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,560
His Majesty has rested.

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,320
His Majesty isn't seeing anyone today.

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
Your Highness.

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,640
Please return.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,840
(Didn't Father say
he's not meeting anyone?)

57
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
(Who's this?)

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,480
Your Majesty.

59
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,680
Hurry.

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,320
Your Majesty.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,440
You worked hard

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,480
all these years.

63
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
It's my duty

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
to share your burdens.

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,880
Even if it's another 10

66
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,800
or 20 years,

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,880
I won't complain

68
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,000
and will risk my life and limbs.

69
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,800
Your...

70
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,320
Eunuch.

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,200
This is from Ninth Prince.

72
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't worry.

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,560
After this is over,

74
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,400
I won't mistreat you and your son.

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,880
Your Majesty.

76
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,320
(Father always neglected
Consort Shu and her son.)

77
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,600
(Why would he...)

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,040
Where did it go?

79
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,360
The imperial garden
looks good during the day.

80
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,520
Why is it so scary at night?

81
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,960
Are you slacking off?

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,480
What's there to see under this tree?

83
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,320
Let me see it too.

84
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,200
How's he doing lately?

85
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,240
He's looking half-dead as always.

86
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,120
It's just that when he's sober,

87
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
he'll...

88
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
He'll still swear.

89
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,040
Remember,

90
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,360
make sure all meals
are delivered on time.

91
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,320
Don't let him die.

92
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
I did everything you asked.

93
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
Did you ever find the painting

94
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,400
the old eunuch took?

95
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,720
I'm worried...

96
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,440
Painting?

97
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Don't pry into things

98
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,840
you shouldn't.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,520
Yes.

100
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,680
Leave.

101
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,120
Father is also looking for the painting.

102
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,440
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,360
Sorry for bothering you.

104
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,960
Thank you.

105
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,000
Youchu.

106
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,280
I've made a big discovery.

107
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,080
Did something happen to my dad?

108
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
General Mi is safe and sound.

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,800
And I already told Father

110
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,400
to let General Mi go home.

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,440
So what's this important discovery
you talked about?

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
- Painting.
- Dried corpse.

113
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
The emperor and Consort Shu
are both looking for a painting?

114
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:50,960
That's right.

115
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,520
The dried corpse
found in the imperial garden

116
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,760
died the same way
as the girls we saw before.

117
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,800
I was scared to death just now.

118
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,200
I found this piece of cloth
in her hands.

119
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,520
A painting?

120
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,600
Do you remember my brother told me

121
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,600
that the painting of the lady in red

122
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,880
was given to him by an old man?

123
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,320
Are you saying

124
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
that the old man
is the eunuch they talked about?

125
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,800
Something's still not right.

126
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,840
Haven't we all seen that painting?

127
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,920
It's the lady in red and her lover.

128
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
What's wrong with that?

129
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,280
What are they scared of?

130
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,120
Actually,

131
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,880
the man in the painting

132
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,920
is my father.

133
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,840
It's the emperor?

134
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,440
I can't believe you.

135
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,640
You knew it all along

136
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,840
and hid it from us.

137
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,640
Tell us

138
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,200
why you approached me and Youchu

139
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,080
and used us

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,960
to investigate the lady in red?

141
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,919
Yes.

142
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,240
We considered you an ally.

143
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,160
You're not being cooperative.

144
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,880
I told you a long time ago

145
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
that my father's personality
changed drastically since he got back.

146
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,040
I thought

147
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
it had something to do
with the lady in red.

148
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,120
As a prince

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,280
and a son,

150
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,320
I have a responsibility
to get to the bottom of this.

151
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,240
However,

152
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,840
I ran into you

153
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,760
when I was investigating
the missing girls.

154
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,520
But thanks to you,

155
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,200
I was able to find these clues.

156
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,400
You really know how to reap the benefits
without lifting a finger.

157
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
How come you royal family members

158
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,400
have more tricks than honeycomb coal?

159
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,960
What's honeycomb coal?

160
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I'll take it as you're praising me.

161
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,280
I...

162
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,880
However,

163
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,120
our priority now

164
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,240
is to investigate the lady in red.

165
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,800
At least for you,

166
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,240
the lady in red is far more dangerous
than I am.

167
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,880
Alright.

168
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,680
Split up and act separately.

169
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
I'll find General Youmao.

170
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,280
I'll find the owner of this cloth.

171
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,620
(Outside the Palace, Laundry Department)

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,720
(The lady in red)

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
(is so annoying.)

174
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,320
(I had to sacrifice my charm)

175
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,680
(and return to my old trade...)

176
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,200
To find you.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,440
Mi Youchu.

178
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Don't beat me up

179
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,600
if you find out about this.

180
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,520
Have you heard?

181
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
Another palace maid
has gone missing recently.

182
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,120
My cousin who works as a guard
secretly told me

183
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,480
that they found
another corpse last night.

184
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,400
That corpse is scary.

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,280
For some reason,
the blood's drained out.

186
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,560
Your cousin
is probably trying to scare you.

187
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,920
He wants you to leave the palace sooner

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and marry him.

189
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,520
Why won't you believe me?

190
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm telling the truth.

191
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
What's with all the commotion?

192
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,440
How is that proper?

193
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,440
Disperse.

194
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

195
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,880
(Isn't this cloth from last night's...)

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,040
I know what to do now.

197
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,280
Prince Su.

198
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,000
You're here too.

199
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,920
You look good today.

200
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,000
This fabric looks good.

201
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,200
It must be yours.

202
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm not good enough
to use such fine fabric.

203
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
This is Consort Shu's Shu Brocade.

204
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,080
It's the only one in the palace.

205
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,400
Too bad it's ripped.

206
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,000
Consort Shu told me to throw it away.

207
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,320
How can you do

208
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,560
such a tiring and dirty work?

209
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,960
Let me help you throw it away.

210
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,720
But...

211
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,880
But Consort Shu specifically asked me

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
to destroy it myself.

213
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,440
Looks like

214
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,800
you don't trust me.

215
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,000
Thank you then.

216
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,040
Go on.
