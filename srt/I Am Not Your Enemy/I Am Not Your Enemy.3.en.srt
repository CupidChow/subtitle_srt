18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Your Highness!

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,120
Your Highness, you woke up.

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,240
Who are you?

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,720
Your Highness.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,680
How could you forget about us

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,360
- in just one night?
- Your Highness.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,640
Ms. Mi.

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,880
His Highness isn't awake yet.

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,640
You can't go in.

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,480
Don't accuse me.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,800
- Ms. Mi.
- Get out of the way.

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,400
Your Highness.

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,320
Ms. Mi, you can't go in.

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,480
Prince Su is indeed busy.

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,040
Your Highness,
why don't you get some more sleep?

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,440
No.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't accuse me.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,680
Come out.

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,520
Maintain this posture.

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,160
(Affection Value)

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,920
This face.

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,600
This figure.

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,840
Yes.

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,800
Youchu.

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm innocent.

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,560
Youchu.

45
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,520
(Winning Her Heart Isn't Easy)

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,840
(I'm really innocent.)

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
No wonder the affection value is so low.

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,160
Turns out
I got the script of the Prodigal Son.

49
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,320
Your Highness.

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,560
I gave each lady

51
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,720
50 silver taels as you asked

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
and sent them all away.

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,280
Good.

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
It should be alright now.

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,080
What else did Mi Youchu say just now?

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,440
She said you're busy,

57
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,880
so she'll leave you alone.

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,320
She won't come to see me?

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
I'll go see her then.

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,080
Don't you know I'm allergic to roses?

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,800
This is a gift from His Highness to you.

62
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,480
Su Buxiao?

63
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,640
Speak.

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,560
What is Su Buxiao up to?

65
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
Do you know what my weakness is?

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,680
Look at the back.

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
It's you.

68
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,520
Buxiao.

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,000
- (How disgusting.)
- Ms. Mi.

70
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,640
His Highness
invites you to his residence

71
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,600
to see the ruyi bestowed by His Majesty.

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,360
Youchu.

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,880
His Highness is so thoughtful of you.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,720
I heard this jade ruyi is rare

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,760
and priceless.

76
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,480
When will I get a chance

77
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,000
to see this treasure for real?

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,800
Youchu.

79
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,680
Just sneak me a look at the jade ruyi.

80
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,320
Just one look.

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,320
I promise not to touch it.

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,080
And I won't tell anyone.

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Youchu.

84
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,000
Alright.

85
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Promise me

86
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
that you'll only take a glance.

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,600
The jade ruyi broke

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,560
after it got to the Mi family's hands.

89
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,200
Darling.

90
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,720
Darling, I didn't break

91
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
the jade ruyi on purpose.

92
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,960
Fuling...

93
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,880
Fuling can testify.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
If the emperor blames me,

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,840
don't blame me for disregarding
our relationship as husband and wife.

96
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,320
Darling.

97
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,360
(Fuling deliberately used the jade ruyi
to frame me in my last life.)

98
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,360
(Watch me
turn the tables around this time.)

99
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,240
Sure.

100
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,560
Tell His Highness

101
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,040
that I will be on time tonight.

102
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
That's settled then.

103
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,480
Let's go.

104
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,100
(Affection Value)

105
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,160
(I gave flowers)

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
(and wrote her a love letter.)

107
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,200
(Why is it still the lowest value?)

108
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Prince Su, drink.

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,320
No thanks.

110
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,000
Youchu.

111
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,560
No need.

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,000
Have some sour...

115
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
I don't eat sour food.

116
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,800
I like sour food the most.

117
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,200
It's good that you don't like sour food.

118
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,040
It's great
that you don't like sour food.

119
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,440
People who like sour food

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
tend to be jealous.

121
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you like the gift

122
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,720
I got you?

123
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,560
Prince Su.

124
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,320
I also prepared a delicious dish

125
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,120
for you

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,960
in return.

127
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,240
Pigeon.

128
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,640
Youchu.

129
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,880
You're so cruel.

130
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,240
How could you kill a living creature?

131
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,840
And it's Prince Su's pigeon.

132
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
When you were at the other residence,

133
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,840
(Do you know what my weakness is?)
didn't you eat meat every day?

134
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,040
Why are you so kind now?

135
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,720
Here.

136
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,680
Try a piece.

137
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,920
I was...

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Isn't this the love letter
I wrote to you?

139
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,480
Why is it with her?

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,200
I've heard that Prince Su is talented.

141
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,520
And your calligraphy is worth a fortune.

142
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,240
I saw Youchu throw it away, so I...

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,600
Youchu.

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,480
Sorry.

145
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,800
I shouldn't have said these.

146
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,120
Prince Su.

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,880
Don't misunderstand Youchu.

148
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,440
Youchu is a lucky girl.

149
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Many princes and nobles

150
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
must paint and write poems for her.

151
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,600
That's why she doesn't treasure it
like I do.

152
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,400
Youchu.

153
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,000
You won't be mad at me

154
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,240
for saying these, right?

155
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,120
What do you think?

156
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm so scared!

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,720
I'm scared.

158
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,720
You love picking up trash.

159
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,240
You...

160
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,040
Mi Youchu.

161
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,680
Why do you dislike me so much?

162
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,560
Go away.

163
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,440
Look.

164
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,560
Take a good look.

And Dismisses His Concubines)

166
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
Haven't you
always boasted of being a playboy

167
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
and said it's normal for a man
to have plenty of women?

168
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,800

169

but I was devoted to each of them.

I'm a brand new Su Buxiao.

173
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,840
So

174
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,600
I wonder

175
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,320
if you'll give me a chance

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,200
to pursue you.

failed at educating his daughter

to damage a sacred item.

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,040
It is disrespectful

188
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,600
to offend the emperor.

189
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,320
(Imperial Edict)
He is dismissed as general immediately.

190
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,800
The Mi family needs to stay at home

191
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,960
and aren't allowed to go out.

192
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,280
Thus commanded by the emperor.

193
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,720
I didn't damage the jade ruyi.

194
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,080
It has nothing to do with Father.

195
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,920
How dare you?

196
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,760
Do you want to disobey the edict?

197
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,520
General Mi.

198
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,280
Accept the edict.

199
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,520
Father.

200
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,520
I accept.

201
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,919
Thanks to Prince Su
for upholding justice over family

202
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,720
and taking the initiative
to report this.

203
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,880
His Majesty did not show kindness
to the Su family

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,799
in vain.

205
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,280
New Su Buxiao?

206
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,240
I, Mi Youchu,

207
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,000
am the only one who has truly died once.

208
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
I

209
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,880
won't be fooled by any sweet talk.

210
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,080
Why am I so unlucky?

211
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,000
I met a heroine
who is so difficult to conquer.

212
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,400
Xiaowu.

213
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Another bottle of liquor.

214
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,200
Your Highness.

215
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
Drink mine.

216
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Your Highness.

217
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,560
I feel a tightness in my chest.

218
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
See if my heart is beating too fast.

219
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,680
No.

220
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,000
Are you not tired?

221
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,200
Are you
the vicious female supporting role?

222
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,560
The type who fakes innocence.

223
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,120
If you feel a tightness in your chest,

224
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,400
you should go out and run more

225
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,560
to improve your cardiovascular fitness.

226
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,280
If you fall down even
when walking on flat ground,

227
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,080
drink some bone broth.

228
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
Stop causing trouble for me.

229
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,760
I'm really not interested in you.

230
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,600
Your Highness,
what are you talking about?

231
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,200
I don't understand.

232
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Don't do this.

233
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm scared
of giving people the wrong ideas.

234
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,720
We're almost done with dinner.

235
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,440
Come on.

236
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
Let's have a look at the jade ruyi.

237
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
I'll do whatever you say.

238
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,920
Stop pretending. Get up.

239
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
The ground is cold.

240
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,960
A leopard can never change its spots.

241
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,200
I'll make you two pay this time.
