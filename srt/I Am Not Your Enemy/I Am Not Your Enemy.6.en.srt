18

Aren't you dead?

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,840
I came back alive.

(You're My Cure)

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,040
Why are you in my room?

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,680
Speak.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,400
Look whose room this is.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,200
- Su Buxiao's finally dead.
- Dead.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,000
You'll find that I came back to life.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,000
Cheers.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
Dead.

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,720
Are you human?

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
How are you alright?

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,720
Speak.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,040
Did you do anything to me?

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,160
No.

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,640
What's wrong with you?

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,400
What are you doing?

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Blood.

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,120
Blood.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,680
He's clearly poisoned,

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,120
but he could break free from my control.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,560
Puppet voodoo.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,320
Mother-child voodoo.

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,560
Anyone who is under the child voodoo

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,200
will gradually lose their mind

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,760
and be controlled by the person
who carries the mother voodoo forever.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,840
Was he controlled by someone

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,400
in his previous life?

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,080
Is it someone else
who set up the Mi family?

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,120
It is said

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,200
that people with the blood of rebirth

49
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,720
can suppress this voodoo.

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,960
It is still unknown

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,200
what the blood of rebirth is.

52
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,880
(The plot is getting
more and more outrageous.)

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,040
(When did I get this voodoo?)

54
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,300
(Blood of Rebirth)

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,360
Rebirth?

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,480
Looks like Mi Youchu's blood

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,920
can suppress the voodoo in my body.

58
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Find the mastermind behind this,

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,080
clear Su Buxiao's name,

60
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,480
and I'll conquer Mi Youchu.

61
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,920
- Put her down.
- Put her down.

62
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,920
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

63
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,600
Speak.

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,640
Where did the lotus mark come from?

65
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,520
Speak!

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,680
Su Buxiao.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Su...

68
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,280
Ghost!

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,800
(What is this organization after?)

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
(Why kidnap those innocent girls?)

71
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,120
The girl last night was so ugly

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
that she scared me
to the point of fainting.

73
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,160
- I slept until just now.
- Shut up.

74
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm Huang Er.

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
Thank you for helping me.

76
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,080
It's nothing.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,840
I've heard that you're beautiful,

78
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
but I didn't expect you
to be good at fighting.

79
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,920
I want to ask

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
whether you're married.

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,280
We asked you here
to inquire about the lotus mark.

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,440
It's not spring yet.

83
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,640
Why are you spreading your tail
like a peacock?

84
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,120
What are you doing here?

85
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
It's because my body...

86
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
Don't I have a lotus mark on my body?

87
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
I want to investigate it, of course.

88
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,440
But why do you want to investigate this?

89
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,560
Is it

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
because you care about me

91
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,160
and want to remove the voodoo
from my body?

92
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,880
This is my business.

93
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,160
Stay out of it.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,760
Only you can suppress the voodoo.

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,440
Of course I have to follow you.

96
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
What does it have to do with me?

97
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Stay away from me from now on.

98
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,720
I know someone's
trying to harm the Mi family.

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,960
Speak.

100
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,600
This lotus voodoo
can turn people into puppets.

101
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,760
I have a vague feeling

102
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,920
that the real intention

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
of the person
who placed the voodoo on me

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,200
is to harm the Mi family.

105
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,640
What if

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,960
I do something bad to the Mi family

107
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,600
when you're not paying attention?

108
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,520
Wouldn't it be good

109
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,640
to keep me close by

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,600
and keep an eye on me at all times?

111
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,280
- Let go.
- Right?

112
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,480
Let go.

113
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,360
I won't let go
unless you keep me around.

114
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,560
I won't go easy on you
if you don't let go.

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,960
Look.

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,600
You don't have the heart
to hit me after all.

117
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,120
I...

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
You two are very close.

119
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,680
Alright.

120
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,520
Just keep me around.

121
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,200
Fine.

122
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,760
I promise.

123
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,480
Go there.

124
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,440
Mr. Huang.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,560
How much do you know
about the lotus mark?

126
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,840
I only know

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,840
that girls in the capital city
have been mysteriously disappearing

128
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,480
for a few years.

129
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,640
At first, people thought
the girls ran away from home

130
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,880
or human traffickers did it.

131
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,240
But for some reason,

132
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
the number of missing girls this year
is much higher

133
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,680
than in previous years.

134
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,640
It was done by a group of criminals

135
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,280
with lotus marks on their bodies.

136
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,040
I don't know much.

137
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,000
That's why I dressed up as a woman,

138
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,040
risked my life,

139
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,040
put myself into the trap,

140
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,920
and tried to lure them.

141
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,040
Enough.

142
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,640
Stop trying to make yourself look good.

143
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,480
Didn't you get knocked out?

144
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,880
I was pretending to be unconscious

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,480
to find their lair.

146
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,760
Cut the crap.

147
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,120
You almost killed me with your weight.

148
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,640
I heard you snoring.

149
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,920
With your makeup,

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,600
I think those criminals must blind

151
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,480
to fall for your trap.

152
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:52,960
You...

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,480
What solution do you have in mind?

154
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
I have nothing,

155
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,360
but

156
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,240

Yes.

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,080
is a brand I've been using for years.
