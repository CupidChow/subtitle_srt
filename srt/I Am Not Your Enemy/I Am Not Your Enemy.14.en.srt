00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,900
(Adapted from "I Am Not Your Enemy"
Author: Black Circle and White Dot)

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,980
=Episode 14=

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,360
Su Buxiao.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,519
Mi Youmao!

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,640
You got the wrong guy.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,120
Mi Youmao, stop right there.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,120
- Su Buxiao
- Get out of the way.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
Sorry, Youmao.

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,320
Mi Youchu is mad at me because of you.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,480
I could only betray you.

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,120
Mi Youmao.

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,880
Are you not going to acknowledge me
as your sister anymore?

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,680
My last name is Mao.

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,760
And my first name is Dashuai.

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,800
Just because my name is Mao

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,240
doesn't mean I'm your brother.

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,240
You like to get naked
when you go to the toilet.

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,680
How many people

34
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,120
in the world can do that?

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,080
And the Mi family's spear technique

36
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,000
and your shoes.

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Are you still not going to admit it?

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,440
You were born with this patch of hair.

39
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,960
Mother braided your hair by hand.

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,080
What do you have to say now?

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,920
Mi Xiaomao.

42
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,800
I have nothing to say.

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,440
Chu!

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,199
Youmao!

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,480
- Youmao!
- Youmao!

46
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,500
(Birthday Mishap)

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,560
What do you think?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,920
Don't I still look good?

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,600
I think you've gotten more thick-faced.

50
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,240
Look.

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,000
I told you
I could help you find your brother.

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,440
It's just a coincidence.

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
I'll let you pass this time.

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,200
Are you not mad anymore?

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,520
Youmao.

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
If you're not dead,

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,480
why didn't you go back to Mi Residence?

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,240
Three years ago,

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
there was also missing girls
in the Qingyuan Village

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,640
near where I was stationed at.

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,760
Villagers said

62
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
the dead lady in red, Wang Niuniu,

63
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,040
had come to take lives.

64
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,240
Lady in red?

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,720
Yes.

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
The woman is said
to be of a different race

67
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,200
and was abandoned by her lover.

68
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,520
She was nailed alive
in a coffin by the villagers.

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
She turned into a demon
and slaughtered the whole village

70
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,200
after she died.

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,280
Wang Niuniu is considered pitiful.

72
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,880
But she killed innocent people.

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
The most pitiable person
must have something hateful about them.

74
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,880
I don't believe this nonsense,

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,600
so I started investigating.

76
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,080
During my investigation,

77
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,480
I ran into an old man.

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,200
When he finds out who I am,

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,360
he gave me a painting.

80
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,240
But he was suddenly attacked
by masked men

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
and died on the spot.

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,840
The masked men pursued me.

83
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,400
I was outnumbered

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,840
and could only
jump off a cliff to survive.

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,600
I survived

86
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,600
but lost my memory temporarily.

87
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
I only recovered my memory recently.

88
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,480
Youmao.

89
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,480
Do you remember who went after you?

90
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,640
I don't know.

91
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,040
After recovering my memory,

92
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,160
I was of bringing deadly trouble
to the Mi family.

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,680
I could only hide my identity

94
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,120
and hide in Beggars' Gang

95
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,280
to wait for an opportunity
to investigate Qingyuan Village's case.

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Where's the painting?

97
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,519
This woman

98
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,760
should be the legendary lady in red.

99
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,839
The man's face
isn't visible in the painting,

100
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,800
but the accessories he wears
are from the palace.

101
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,440
So I suspect

102
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,240
that this man
is a member of the royal family.

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,920
Lady in red.

104
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,160
Sun.

105
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,680
Lotus mark.

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,840
Member of the royal family.

107
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,320
And that annoying Second Prince.

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,680
Why are things
becoming more and more complicated?

109
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,520
Sun repeatedly harmed Youchu.

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,160
Could it

111
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,720
be related to Youchu's blood
being able to suppress voodoo?

112
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
(Congratulations.)

113
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
Here.

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,920
You helped the heroine find her brother.

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,640
The affection value increased to 66.

116
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,640
The end of the game is getting closer.

117
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,360
Good luck.

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,960
It's increasing so fast.

119
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,520
Next mission,

120
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,280
uncover the lady in red's scheme

121
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,440
and save the heroine.

122
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Difficulty: five stars.

123
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,840
Difficulty: five stars?

124
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,720
That means

125
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,240
it's very dangerous.

126
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,800
Could you explain it more clearly?

127
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,080
(Yongping Pass)
Youmao, what else

128
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,680
do you know about the lady in red?

129
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,200
I already have a team working on it.

130
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,800
I've been absent all these years

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,920
and caused you concern.

132
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,840
Have you forgotten
that tomorrow is your birthday?

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,720
Yes.

134
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
I forgot if you didn't remind me.

135
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,040
You and I share the same birthday.

136
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,760
Yeah, let's take all those years back.

137
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,180
(Mi)

138
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,280
Su Buxiao.

139
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you like my sister?

140
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,520
Yes.

141
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,240
Not really.

142
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,440
What are you talking about?

143
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,520
If you like her, just say so.

144
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,520
What's so hard about admitting it?

145
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,520
Yes.

146
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,520
Fool.

147
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,120
You have to find a way
to pursue my sister.

148
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,160
I'll secretly tell you this.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
The day after tomorrow
is Youchu's 18th birthday.

150
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,440
Do something.

151
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,720
Don't lose to Second Prince.

152
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I can't.

153
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
I have high hopes for you.

154
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
(Youchu's birthday?)

155
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,240
Help me prepare some gifts.

156
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Put in some thought.

157
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,040
Don't make mistakes.

158
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,320
Yes.

159
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,000
Youmao.

160
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Why did you bring me to the kitchen?

161
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,720
Look.

162
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,160
Su Buxiao?

163
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,160
This is Youchu's first birthday

164
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
since she found her brother.

165
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,640
I need to make her happy.

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,240
The old Su Buxiao
didn't have that kind of heart.

167
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,160
The Su Buxiao now

168
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,640
is a perfect man.

169
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,920
How sour.

170
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,680
This is more sour.

171
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,000
This is sweet.

172
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,600
That lady

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,080
can't eat sour at all.

174
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,640
It's a pity that I'm a young master

175
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,520
with a servant's fate.

176
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,600
He remembers that I don't eat sour food.

177
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,080
Details.

178
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,200
The devil is in the details.

179
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,600
Round eyes.

180
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,520
High nose bridge.

181
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
Black and straight hair.

182
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,240
Adorable when she smiles.

183
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,920
Her body has an excess of internal heat,

184
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,880
so a pimple appeared on her chin.

185
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
No, I can't draw that.

186
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
She'll be mad again if I draw that.

187
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,640
When she's mad,

188
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
her cheeks bulge

189
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,600
like a squirrel.

190
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
It's quite cute.

191
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,320
Am I that ugly?

192
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,400
He's insensitive.

193
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,640
He's the typical insensitive man.

194
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,160
Chu.

195
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,040
This one.

196
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,520
What are you doing?

197
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,080
Buxiao.

198
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,840
Are you drawing my sister?

199
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
This is actually...

200
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
I can't believe you remember

201
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,920
my sister's birthday
when I only casually mentioned it

202
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,240
last time.

203
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,280
Is this the birthday cake you mentioned?

204
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,960
You said you'd teach me how to make it.

205
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
I didn't expect you to already make one.

206
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,720
Thank you very much.

207
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,320
I...

208
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,960
Thank you.

209
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,440
What are you doing?

210
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,360
It's delicious.

211
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,160
Thank you.

212
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,520
It's a gift provided by Daxiao.

213
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,760
Thanks.

214
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,320
Sis.

215
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Happy birthday.

216
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,800
Thank you.

217
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,960
Commander Mi.

218
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,320
It's been a long time.

219
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,560
The cake should be ready.

220
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,680
This cake isn't...

221
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,440
It's good enough.

222
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,640
Thank you

223
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,480
for carefully preparing
a birthday gift for me.

224
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,000
Su Buxiao

225
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
can never change.

226
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,600
Youchu.

227
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,680
Happy birthday.

228
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Su Buxiao, how dare you?

229
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,160
Youchu is allergic to roses.

230
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,280
Are you alright?

231
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,200
Sorry, Youchu.

232
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,920
I didn't know.

233
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,480
I hope I can know you better.

234
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,120
You love martial arts.

235
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,360
I think you'll like this dagger.

236
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,600
This is a really good weapon.

237
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,720
My mother left it for me
before she passed away.

238
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,200
She hoped it could help me
avoid open attacks and hidden threats

239
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
and grow up safely.

240
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,920
Youchu.

241
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,480
You can't accept this gift.

242
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,480
If you accept it,

243
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,720
won't you become indebted to him?

244
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,280
You're so petty.

245
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
A precious dagger
is perfect for a beautiful woman.

246
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,520
In my opinion,

247
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,360
only Youchu is worthy of this dagger.

248
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,280
But I'm curious

249
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,320
about what you're getting for Youchu.

250
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,320
No.

251
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,920
You do.

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,560
Where's the cake?

253
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,640
I gave it to someone else.

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,880
Is there someone more important than me?

255
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
What's wrong with you?

256
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Buxiao is kidding you.

257
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
How could anyone
be more important than my sister?

258
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,080
Our birthday is tomorrow.

259
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,960
It's not too late to make up for it.

260
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,920
It's not too late.

261
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
I think this gift is quite good.

262
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,840
It's the best gift I've ever received.

263
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,960
You're thoughtful.

264
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
It's not too late.

265
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,480
Su Buxiao!

266
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,720
Su Buxiao!

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,760
What are you doing?

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I asked you to win my sister's heart,

269
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,160
but you angered her instead.

270
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
I don't want this to happen either.

271
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,440
Youmao.

272
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,680
I also prepared you a gift.

273
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,360
A giant osmanthus cake?

274
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
I'm touched.

275
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm touched.

276
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,240
Buxiao.

277
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,600
I will help you.

278
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,920
You don't have the cake.

279
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,080
We can think of something else.

280
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,400
We won't give her

281
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,960
the tacky and childish things

282
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,600
girls want.

283
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,080
Yes.

284
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,600
It's best to think of something new.

285
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,560
It's best if it's something

286
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,520
never seen or heard before.

287
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,960
I got it.

288
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,040
Youmao.

289
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,320
