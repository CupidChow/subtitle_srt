18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,120
This is too valuable.

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,600
I can't accept it.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,920
I used you today.

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,320
Sorry.

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
I don't mind you using me.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
All that matters
is that you end up marrying me.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,320
Second Prince.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,120
I actually have a question for you.

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,080
Do you want to marry me

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,920
because you like me

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,440
or because you have ulterior motives?

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,040
I...

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600
We have a problem!

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,720
We have a problem.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,360
What's wrong, Youmao?

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,320
Youchu.

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
Su Buxiao's voodoo
seems to have acted up.

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,040
Go check on him.

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,920
Where is he?

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,640
Your room.

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,280
Second Prince.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
Let me enjoy the moon with you.

Youchu.

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,440
Su Buxiao.

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,360
My brother said your voodoo acted up.

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,000
Are you alright?

47
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,040

I'm really alright.

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,160
Look.

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,120
I'm alive and kicking.

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,640
I'm really alright.

53
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,960
You lied to me again.

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,640
Youchu.

55
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,200
Wait.

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,720
Wait.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,560

Also,

65
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,280
this is a bomb.

You can't buy these anymore.

69
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,160
Where did you get them?

70
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,040
Do you like them?

71
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,880
(I got these)

(by watching ads the whole day)

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,160
(and exchanging 30 affection values.)

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,960
(Although it costs affection values,)

77
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,720
(it's worth it)

78
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,360
(to see her so happy.)

79
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,320
You got me a gift.

80
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,280
Why lie to me?

81
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,920
I wanted to give you a surprise.

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,680
That girl...

83
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,560
It's a misunderstanding.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
That's Liu Xiaoer's sister.

85
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,520
Youchu.

86
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,720
If you like cakes,

87
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,240
I can make you many cakes in the future.

88
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,200
I don't want

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,000
to have the same birthday cake
as others.

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,440
This one doesn't count.

91
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,120
Get me another gift.

92
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,520
I want a unique one.

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,960
(I think)

94
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,000
(I've fallen for her.)

95
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,720
(True feelings)

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,480
(happened in virtual time and space.)

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,080
(How should I handle)

98
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,200
(my affections?)

99
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,880
Speak.

100
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,240
(I don't care.)

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
(I'll consider this gift as a souvenir.)

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,400
Alright.

103
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,560
I promise.

104
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,520
It's been a long day.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm so exhausted.

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,200
Youchu.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
Are these the unique birthday gifts?

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,080
You don't like them?

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,960
I can give...

110
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,040
How dare you?

111
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,560
(Why does Su Buxiao)

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,760
(reek of makeup?)

113
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,400
(He's also acting strange.)

114
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,800
Youchu.

115
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,880
Don't be mad at Su Buxiao.

116
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm not really mad.

117
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,720
Commander Mi.

118
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,240
I just think

119
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
his attitude toward gifts
is too perfunctory.

120
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,440
Youmao.

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,440
Youchu.

122
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,240
What are you doing here?

123
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,400
To give you a unique gift, of course.

124
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,880
Good job.

125
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,360
I worked up a sweat
from training just now.

126
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,920
Good job.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,880
Strike while the iron is hot.

128
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,480
Could you go get it with me?

129
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
Are you itching for trouble?

130
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,400
Why were you so strong?

131
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,080
Alright.

132
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,960
Alright.

133
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,280
You can talk on the way.

134
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,200
Go.

135
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,840
Looks like I'm going to be

136
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,120
a brother-in-law soon.

137
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,680
Su Buxiao.

138
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,920
Do you really know

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,400
what a unique gift is?

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,080
Don't women

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,000
just want simple things?

142
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,960
Maybe you wouldn't understand it

143
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,440
in your world.

144
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,280
You like me, don't you?

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
You want

146
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,120
to be with me

147
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,600
forever.

148
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,560
Who said so?

149
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,400
Women always say what they don't mean.

150
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,800
Yes means no.

151
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,920
Wanting means not wanting it.

152
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm not ordinary women.

153
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,000
If I want something,

154
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,600
I'll fight for it.

155
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,840
You're indeed the woman I like.

156
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,800
You're not pretentious,

157
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
brave and cleaver.

158
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,480
Why do you have ear piercings?

159
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,400
I accidentally punctured it
with a needle

160
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
when I was little.

161
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,000
Is that so?

162
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,800
Youchu.

163
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,000
Youchu.

164
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,600
Stop calling.

165
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,400
Chu went out with Buxiao.

166
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,160
You

167
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,120
don't stand a chance.

168
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,720
What are you doing?

169
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,520
Something's wrong with Su Buxiao today.

170
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,800
What do you mean?

171
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
So what exactly

172
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
did you get me?

173
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,080
The lady in red's tomb.

174
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
You found it?

175
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,320
I'd like to see

176
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,480
if that crazy woman is alive or dead.

177
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,360
That woman

178
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,720
has no sense.

179
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,880
It serves her right to be tricked.

180
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,600
What do you know?

181
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,080
How dare you?

182
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,760
(I knew something's wrong.)

183
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,200
(I'd like to see what you're up to.)

184
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,520
Men have been heartless and disloyal
since ancient times.

185
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,160
All of them have wives and concubines.

186
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,840
They make vows of eternal love
when they love you,

187
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,760
but later

188
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,640
abandon you like you're trash.

189
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,360
I'm talking about the lady in red.

190
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,559
Why are you so mad?

191
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm just defending her.

192
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,240
Let's go.

193
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,720
We have to get there before dark.

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,440
You know your way around.

195
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
Is this the lady in red's coffin?

196
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,120
Youchu.

197
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Why hurt me?

198
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,120
Stop pretending.

199
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,240
Where's Su Buxiao?

200
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,240
You figured it out?

201
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,360
Don't give yourself away

202
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,920
if you don't want people to notice.

203
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,600
You're quite clever.

204
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,200
Since you're here,

205
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,560
forget about walking out of here.

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,160
So Su Buxiao is fake?

207
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh no.

208
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,200
Youchu is in danger.

209
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,880
This way.

210
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,280
Youchu.

211
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,200
Don't move.

212
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,240
When she gets Mi Youchu's blood,

213
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,240
maybe she'll let you live.

214
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
I don't understand

215
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,760
why you're so loyal

216
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,600
to someone so cruel.

217
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,160
Shut up.

218
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,680
People like you

219
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,280
won't understand us.

220
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,360
Go.

221
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
Why are you killing innocent people?

222
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,400
Killing innocent people?

223
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,160
I was once innocent too.

224
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,720
At that time,

225
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,040
no one saved me.

226
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,920
- Hurry.
- Let me go!

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,720
- Let me go. I'm pregnant!
- Get in.

228
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,800
I beg you!

229
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,280
I beg you!

230
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,160
I beg you!

231
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,880
This woman is ominous.

232
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,760
Kill her.

233
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
Sir

234
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,680
called her a demon.

235
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,840
I beg you!

236
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,560
I beg you!

237
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,520
Let me go!

238
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,840
They killed me and my baby.

239
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,200
Don't they deserve to die?

240
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,120
They deserve to die!

241
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,360
