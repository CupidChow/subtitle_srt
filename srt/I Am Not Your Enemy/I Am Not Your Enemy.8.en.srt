Come out.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,280
Don't play tricks.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,760
In that case,

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,360
you don't have to leave.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,280
Please spare me.

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,920
It was my negligence

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,360
that allowed outsiders in.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,320
I promise I won't do it again next time.

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Next time?

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,760
A bunch of fools.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,880

00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,160
Speak.

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,560
Why did you take blood?

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,120
Did you place the voodoo on Su Buxiao?

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,480
Who are you?

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,440
You have so many questions.

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,000
It depends on
whether you have the life to find out.

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,720
Why do you want to harm the Mi family?

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
Is there anyone else behind this?

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,160
I didn't expect you
to be so good in martial arts.

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,560
You impressed me.

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,880
Are you telling me or not?

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,520
Su Buxiao.

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,920
Su Buxiao, the voodoo's acting up again.

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,960
Kill him

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,160
and you'll find your answer.

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,040
You can't let him get away.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,440
Sorry.

48
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,120
Good luck.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,960
Your blood

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,720
can suppress puppet voodoo.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,480
Can you answer my question now?

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,120
The girls have been sent home.

55
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,760
They should be alright
after getting some treatment.

56
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,160
It's a pity these girls
will never see the sun again.

They were all born
on a yin month, yin day, and yin time.

59
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
I've read this legendary evil method

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,600
in ancient books before.

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,520
It is said that soaking the body

62
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,480
in the blood of qualified girls

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,680
can bring the dying back to life.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
You used
so many people's lives to survive.

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,959
You'll be a walking zombie
even if you're alive.

66
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,160
I'm fine.

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,800
Su Buxiao.

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,480
Clean up

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,000
and leave.

70
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,400
Buddy.

71
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Let me tell you.

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,080
You have to be gentle with women.

73
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
Don't go too far

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,880
just because Chu
is skilled at martial arts.

75
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,520

What are you thinking?

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,440
Don't talk nonsense.

78
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,520
Clean this up.

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,200
Youchu.

80
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,920
Can Mi Youchu's blood

81
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,160
really suppress the voodoo?

82
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,360
I saw it with my own eyes.

83
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,320
It's true.

84
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,960
I just wanted
to use Mi Youchu and Su Buxiao

85
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
to gain
the Mi family's control of the army.

86
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,600
I didn't expect

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,680
to get a surprise.

88

189
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,200
my daughter has always been independent

190
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,360
and unruly.

191
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,560
She can't marry into a noble family

192
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,720
like Your Highness'.

193
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,560
But if there's a suitable candidate,

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,160
you can help me keep a lookout.

195
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,840
General Mi.

196
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,400
Don't jump to conclusions too soon.

197
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,080
Father.

198
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,960
It's your 60th birthday today.

199
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,440
Why don't you go get ready?

200
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,360
Your Highness.

201
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,040
Sorry for the poor hospitality.

202
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,640
I'll drink with you
and apologize at the banquet later.

203
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,040
Goodbye.

204
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,360
Youchu.

205
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,600
I have something to tell you.

206
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Buxiao.

207
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,400
Are you waiting for Youchu?

208
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,920
She's inside and will come out soon.

209
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,520
Young man.

210
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,880
I have high hopes for you.

211
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,120
Good luck.

212
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,280
Thank you.

213
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,040
General Mi has come out for a long time.

214
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,840
What are the two of them talking about?

215
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Yes.

216
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,120
Your Highness.

217
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Looks like they're coming out.

218
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,560
Let's go.

219
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,000
Youchu.

220
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,640
Is your house infested with rats?

221
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,440
Why is there a rustling noise?

222
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,280
Why don't we find

223
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,720
a quiet and elegant place to chat?

224
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,960
What?

225
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,400
You want to get changes?

226
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,720
Sure.

227
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,680
I'll go to the gazebo
and wait for you there.

228
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,040
Did you hear that?

229
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,640
They want to find
a quiet and cool place.

230
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,200
What are they two going to do?

231
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,600
It's daytime.

232
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,680
There were so many people
at this birthday banquet,

233
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,880
but they deliberately avoided them.

234
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,440
They want to do some shameful things.

235
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,760
Nonsense.

236
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,440
Why would Mi Youchu fall for him?

237
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,240
Ms. Mi's attitude toward Second Prince

238
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,400
is much better toward you.

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,960
Let's go and have a look.

240
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,360
Youchu.

241
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,920
He touched Mi Youchu's head.

242
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,400
He held Mi Youchu's hand.

243
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,560
Your Highness.

244
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,240
Ouch.

245
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,120
