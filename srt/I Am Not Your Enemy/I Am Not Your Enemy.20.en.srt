(Game Over)

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,680
You're having so much fun

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,560
together.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,640
Niuniu.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,840
Niuniu.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,560
Do you know how lonely it is

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,800
for me to pretend in the palace?

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,920
I miss you every day.

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,880
I waited for you.

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,400
Why didn't you pick me up?

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,600
Niuniu.

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,480
As the ruler of the country,

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I have many unavoidable
hardships and dilemmas.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,840
I promised you a grand wedding,

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,440
but

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,240
I can't make it happen.

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,120
No.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,960
I don't want a grand wedding.

36
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,720
All I want is to be by your side.

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Don't worry.

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,120
I will never part with you again.

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Did you fall for his sweet talk?

40
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,680
You really do look best in red.

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,760
What's in this dress?

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,440
Niuniu.

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,640
You should have died
in Qingyuan Village.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,720
Why come to the palace

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,160
and seek death?

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,160
Your appearance

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,080
cause turmoil in the imperial court

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,680
and instability in the country.

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,720
Don't worry.

50
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
I'll bury you here.

51
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,760
And you'll never part from me.

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
It's you.

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,200
You told the villagers
to nail me in the coffin.

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,680
- Let me go!
- Hurry.

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,960
- Go.
- Let me go!

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,640
Get in.

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,640
I'm pregnant! Let me go!

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,880
Let me out!

59
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,160
We finally took care of the witch.

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,280
We've done
what Mr. Huang told us to do too.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,560
Do you know what I've been through?

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you know how I got out of the coffin?

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,640
Let me out!

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,360
Let me...

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
I used my family's forbidden magic

66
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,200
to escape.

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
I summoned Bloodthirsty Vine's energy,

68
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,360
but I also suffered backlash.

69
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,560
It turned me into
this half-human, half-demon monster.

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,640
Monster.

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,880
Do you know that we lost our baby
because of this?

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,760
Why?

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,000
Why are you so cruel?

74
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,080
Niuniu.

75
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,160
You drank my blood.

76
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
From now on,

77
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,680
we'll live and die together.

78
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,480
I want you to watch

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,520
as I destroy everything you love

80
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,000
bit by bit.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,520
You're not a bad person,

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
but you have blood on your hands

83
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,920
for that man.

84
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,280
What's the difference
between you and him?

85
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,600
Perhaps.

86
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,400
But

87
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,840
I can no longer look back!

88
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,880
Wait.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
His Majesty isn't feeling well.

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,320
Please come again tomorrow.

91
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,320
Cut the crap.

92
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,200
I want to see Mi Youchu.

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,680
You...

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,000
You're being disrespectful.

95
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,920
Disrespectful?

96
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
Tell me where Mi Youchu is.

97
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,920
I don't know.

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,800
You don't know?

99
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,520
Su Buxiao!

100
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,320
It's Youchu's guiding bee.

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,760
Looks like she noticed something's wrong

102
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,120
and left us a clue.

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,720
How dare you?

104
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,600
You...

105
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,440
You...

106
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,440
Liu.

107
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,360
Are you going to do it or am I?

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,560
I...

109
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,080
I'll do it myself.

110
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
Take my token

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
and inform General Youmao
to enter the palace to save His Majesty.

112
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,360
Yes.

113
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,360
Youchu.

114
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,200
Youchu, are you alright?

115
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,280
Youchu, hang in there.

116
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,760
Wang Niuniu.

117
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,120
Release Youchu. Hurry.

118
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,760
Just you?

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,800
Youchu.

120
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,800
Mi Youmao?

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,640
Your savior is already struggling
to fend for themselves.

122
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,520
You should surrender now
if you know what's good for you.

123
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,560
Let's

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
die together then!

125
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,120
Niuniu.

126
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,760
Your Majesty.

127
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Niuniu.

128
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,720
Your Majesty.

129
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,040
Niuniu.

130
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,800
Don't do this.

131
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,800
Hong.

132
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,200
I want to ask you

133
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,400
now that things have come to this,

134
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
If we could go back to the beginning,

135
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,080
would you give up this country

136
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,240
and run away with me?

137
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,960
Yes.

138
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,160
I would.

139
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,880
I was forced

140
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,800
to do what I did.

141
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
Niuniu.

142
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
Give me one more chance.

143
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,480
Alright?

144
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,440
Of course.

145
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I remember...

146
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,040
I remember when we first met,

147
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,520
you treated me like I'm precious

148
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
and promised me glory and wealth

149
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,039
and that we'd be together

150
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
forever.

151
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,880
Even now,

152
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,840
I still love you.

153
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,560
It must be the same for you.

154
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,560
Yes.

155
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
I've always loved you.

156
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,840
I was in a dangerous place

157
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,160
and was seriously wounded.

158
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,880
You took risks to pick medicine for me

159
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,800
and took care of me without sleeping.

160
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
I remember

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,480
everything.

162
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,960
Niuniu.

163
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,040
Let me make it up to you.

164
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,880
Then let me ask you,

165
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,120
if we could go back to the beginning,

166
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,440
would you still want me dead?

167
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,840
Stop acting.

168
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,120
Your Majesty.

169
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,680
I...

170
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you tired?

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,080
I'm tired.

172
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm really tired.

173
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,160
Today,

174
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,800
I'll give you what you want

175
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,240
and give myself what I want.

176
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
Since we can't be together
when we're alive,

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,440
- let's die together.
- No!

178
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,000
- No!
- Your Majesty!

179
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,520
Father.

180
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,080
- Niuniu.
- Father.

181
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
- Father.
- Niuniu!

182
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,440
Save her. Hurry!

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,040
If she's dead,

184
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,720
I won't survive either.

185
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,960
Father!

186
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,280
Save her!

187
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,200
- Save her.
- Father.

188
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,920
Save her!

189
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,040
Where's the antidote?

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,320
When the mother voodoo dies,

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,280
the child voodoo stiffens.

192
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,440
I want all lovers

193
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,680
to have no lasting bond.

194
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,880
Witch.

195
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Witch!

196
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,480
I don't want to die.

197
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,440
Get the imperial physician.

198
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Imperial physician.

199
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,400
Father.

200
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,920
I don't want to die.

201
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,440
(So this is the major crisis
that the system mentioned.)

202
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,640
Father.

203
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,720
Father.

204
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Oh no.

205
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,760
This day has finally come.

206
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,960
What's wrong with you?

207
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,200
I... I'm fine, Youchu.

208
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,040
I'm fine.

209
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,560
What's wrong with you?

210
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,320
I was afraid
I couldn't fulfill your dream.

211
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
But fortunately,

212
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,280
the lady in red is dead.

213
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,080
You're completely safe now.

214
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,560
What are you talking about?

215
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,880
Didn't you say

216
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,200
you'd always be there for me?

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,400
I won't leave you.

218
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,680
Buxiao.

219
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,760
Didn't you say you have nine lives?

220
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Didn't you say

221
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,240
you'd do anything to protect me?

222
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,520
How could you lie to me?

223
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:24,880
Yes.

224
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,480
I have nine lives.

225
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,760
I've got seven more even
if I died this time.

226
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,000
No, you won't die.

227
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,320
Buxiao.

228
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,440
Buxiao, what happened to you? Buxiao.

229
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,120
Buxiao.

230
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,280
- Buxiao.
- Youchu.

231
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,760
Youchu, I don't want to leave you.

232
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,920
Youchu.

233
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,080
The affection value has reached 100.

234
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
(Affection Value)
Mission completed.

235
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,200
I like... like...

236
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
Su Buxiao.

237
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
Su Buxiao!

238
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,080
I wonder if you'll give me a chance

239
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,120
to pursue you.

240
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,840
I turned goose feathers into snow

241
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,160
just to win a smile from you.

242
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,280
Wouldn't it be good

243
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,000
to keep me close by

244
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,200
and keep an eye on me at all times?

245
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,440
Every choice you make

246
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,440
will create a new world.

247
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,920
Your fate

248
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,000
is in your hands.

249
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,520
I don't like

250
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,680
that you didn't tell me anything

251
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,560
and took risks alone.

252
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,320
Can't you tell me

253
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,600
before you do anything?

254
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,080
Don't live your life too tense.

255
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
Relax when you need to.

256
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,880
You're

257
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,800
not the sun

258
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,120
nor the moon.

259
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,880
You're

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,760
a gentle

261
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,160
and tiny star.

262
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,280
You're like a firefly.

263
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,280
You can break through the darkness

264
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,200
and light up your own life.

265
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,800
Look.

266
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,160
The sun is about to rise.

267
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,120
Yes.

268
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,120
The sun will always rise

269
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,160
Youchu.

270
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,680
Youchu.

271
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:41,920
I...

272
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm back.

273
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,440
But it's all too real.

274
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
What's the ending of this stupid game?

275
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,640
What a trap.

276
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
Congratulations on getting
Tears of True Love.

277
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,200
You can choose
whether to continue the game.

278
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
You've got a conscience after all.

279
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,480
That's more like it.

280
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,440
It should have a perfect ending.

281
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,400
Youchu.

282
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,960
I'm coming.

283
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,600
Welcome back.

284
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Your information is being re-uploaded.

285

(can you interact with the characters.)

287
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,520
System, hurry.

288
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,440
Chu.

289
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Buxiao has been gone fro a long time.

290
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,200
Why not consider Second Prince?

291
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,920
Father.

292
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,000
What Second Prince?

293
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,760
He's the emperor now.

294
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,120
He has an imperial harem.

295
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,840
Chu won't tolerate mistreatment.

296
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,480
If you ask me,

297
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,760
Buxiao is still the better choice.

298
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,840
Yes.

299
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,560
Buxiao is still the better choice.

300

301
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,600
Have a good time.

302
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,600
You still think I'm the best, don't you?

303
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,480
I'm back!

304
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,360
How are you still alive?

305
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,400
Are you surprised?

306
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,280
Are you shocked?

307
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,040
Gosh.

308
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
What's going on?

309
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,380
What on earth...

310
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,720
What is this stupid system doing?

311
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,120
I am

312
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,400
not your enemy!

313
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,940
