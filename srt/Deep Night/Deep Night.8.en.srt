1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,480
I'm sorry that I didn't know anything at all.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,790
I should've known sooner.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,040
Others just don't know that
how much awesome you are.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:16,990
But I know it.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,040
If you have time,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,420
I invite you to go to our club.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,180
Thank you for inviting my mom.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,440
Keep fighting!

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,290
Go!

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:30,770
fighting!

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,940
Hey.

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,510
Make it for me too.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,910
Sure.

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,520
Oh, James.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,660
Hey, are you ready?

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,790
I'm ready.

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,890
- Go.
- Let's go.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,800
- Keep fighting tonight.
- Sure.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,440
Thank you so much, Khemtid.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,730
You know, this is the first time
that hold a big event like this.

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,460
First time of Deep Night?

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,650
Yes.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,730
If there isn't you, it wouldn't happen.

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,480
Thanks for your dedication to Deep Night.

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,000
Change from the word thanks to...
give Deep Night to me?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,560
Do you want it now?

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,720
- Let me think later.
- What?

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,170
Please Madam Freya.

29
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,770
Oh, Meji?

30
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,570
Well... I gotta go.

31
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:47,789
Hello.

32
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,360
For me?

33
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:55,890
Yes.

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,479
Thanks for coming.

35
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,550
The important event like this, I have to come.

36
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,350
Are you ready?

37
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,910
Maybe...

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,090
If I can help something, please tell me.

39
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,710
No matter how many times we fight,

40
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm not running away from you.

41
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,910
I just think about it.

42
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,650
Both of us are old.

43
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,280
What you want me to be, where I can be,

44
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,370
Tell me then.

45
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,150
Just let me close to you is enough.

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,430
Do you think our age... can have a girlfriend?

47
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,210
I saw Khemtid and Wela, they're so happy.

48
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,960
I want one.

49
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,250
Shall we?

50
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,430
Be a girlfriend?

51
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,660
- Are you kidding me?
- I mean it.

52
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,110
- Girlfriend? We're a couple now!
- Easy.

53
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,670
- Yes or No?
- Yes for sure!

54
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,579
- Great.
- Hmm?

55
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,870
Did you see Wela?

56
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,670
Nope. He did it for me and then he's gone.

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
Where's he then?

58
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,600
Wela.

59
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:17,769
Wela.

60
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,610
Oh?

61
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,270
Who tied it?

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,500
Wela.

63
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,430
Wela.

64
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,520
Where are you?

65
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,820
Why do it yourself? It's dangerous, you know?

66
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,659
Next time, tell me.

67
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,720
Wela.

68
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,470
Wela.

69
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,360
Three... two...

70
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,380
Are you okay?

71
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,420
Do you want to go to hospital?

72
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,850
Hey, Wela.

73
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,370
But you got hurt.

74
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,470
Please let me perform first.

75
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,020
How can you do this?

76
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,770
- Aren't you worried about yourself?
- Right.

77
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,720
Do you smell something burning?

78
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,920
- Shit, Seiji's shirt!
- Hey!

79
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,820
- Damn, such a good day!
- I'll handle it.

80
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,860
- Shit!
- Fuck!

81
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,830
How is it?

82
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,360
For a while.

83
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,620
If it's finished, you take it to him then.

84
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,260
Hey.

85
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,730
Why?

86
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,110
You fix it, take it to him by yourself.

87
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,670
He will be thankful.

88
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,370
No need.

89
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,640
You give it to him.

90
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,770
You're his boyfriend...

91
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,430
He will be happy more than I give it.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,680
Please take care of him.

93
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,620
Try moving, Wela.

94
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
See? I told you can't stand it.

95
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,120
Don't perform it tonight.

96
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,050
Easy, it's just wrapped.

97
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,010
Why are you so stubborn?

98
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,000
Your leg got hurt like this, will you still perform?

99
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,990
I'm worried about you.

100
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,710
We're worried about you.

101
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,680
Everyone is worried about you now.

102
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,440
So why aren't you worried about yourself?

103
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,850
My mom came today.

104
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,350
I just want her to see what I'm doing here.

105
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,520
I'm sorry.

106
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,900
I forgot to think about it.

107
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,380
But no matter what, I'm still worried about you.

108
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,260
I promise...

109
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,550
I will save myself.

110
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,830
I'll save you myself.

111
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,330
- Welcome, madam.
- Thank you for coming. Welcome.

112
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,220
- Thank you very much.
- Welcome.

113
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,570
Is this the host club?

114
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,380
It's like a normal club, teacher.

115
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,660
Let's go. Let's take photos.

116
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,130
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

117
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:36,870
Thank you.

118
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,500
Welcome. Hello.

119
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,730
Tat.

120
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,340
Long time no see. How're you doing?

121
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,930
I'm good.

122
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,360
Soi-Nang said that you held the event here.

123
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
I've never visited here, so I stopped by to have a look.

124
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,690
The event will start now.

125
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,250
Today, men can enter for free.

126
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,450
Please go inside.

127
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,330
Dai, please take care of Tat too.

128
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,590
Yes.

129
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,210
What's wrong? Hot? Do you want a fan?

130
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,560
No, it's not hot.

131
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,580
Are you hungry? I'll have someone
bring foods to you.

132
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,540
I'm not hungry. I'll go back.

133
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,770
Hey, how can you go back?
The event hasn't started yet.

134
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,330
Your real couple is here.

135
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,450
Let him do it for me.

136
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,590
Meji.

137
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,290
What do you mean?
He and I have been divorced for a long time.

138
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,620
How can he be my real one?
The real one is standing here.

139
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,480
Come on, don't be jealous.

140
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,760
Really?

141
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,490
Yes.

142
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Don't be like this next time.

143
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,110
We'll be together for a long time.

144
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,840
You're crazy.

145
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,660
No one can see it.

146
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,200
I'm embarrassed.

147
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,350
Hello, test.

148
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,790
Hello esteemed guests!

149
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,270
First and foremost, I must say that everyone here
is an esteemed guest at our club.

150
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,000
Today's event is called 'The Real Deep Night'.

151
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,870
For anyone who doesn't know Deep Night,
today let's get to know us in depth.

152
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,270
But first of all,

153
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,490
let me introduce...

154
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,530
The Mother of Deep Night.

155
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,540
She is a beautiful and talented woman.

156
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,990
Let's give a round of applause
to our CEO, Madam Freya!

157
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,450
Thank you very much.

158
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,220
Hello.

159
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,740
I'm Freya.

160
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:51,040
I'm the one... who founded Deep Night.

161
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,670
Let me talk about my past.

162
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,620
I used to be a showgirl before.

163
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,630
It was a profession looked down upon.

164
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,830
They said it had no dignity.

165
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,740
No one knew how much effort we took for each show.

166
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,870
We had to work hard, practice rigorously,

167
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,360
and invest so much physically and mentally.

168
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,560
There are many talented hosts here
who excel in acrobatics,

169
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,450
so I wanted them to showcase their abilities.

170
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,680
That's why I opened Deep Night club

171
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,390
to let them do the showcase there.

172
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,660
I would like all of you to come here and have fun,

173
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,780
tell others by word of mouth,

174
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,620
and I'd like our hosts here are proud of yourself

175
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,120
and have the confidence to tell others
that you work here.

176
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,550
Just saying, everyone probably can't see the picture.

177
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,730
So... are you ready?

178
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,620
To meet the very special show of our Deep Night hosts.

179
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,370
It's time to see our show!

180
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,780
Hold it then.

181
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,670
Still hurt?

182
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,730
Are you okay?

183
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,860
I can do it one more time.

184
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,640
You did it so professionally.

185
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,370
Looking at the stage, I don't know you got hurt.

186
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,310
I got a good partner.

187
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,380
- Well.
- Well.

188
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,390
So when did you learn to play straps?

189
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,910
It's been a while.

190
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,780
I used to ask Wela to teach me.

191
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,470
- And then you go with him?
- Right.

192
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,900
It's normal.

193
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,470
He's boyfriend.

194
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,000
Thank you.

195
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,980
Wela.

196
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,400
Does it hurt a lot?

197
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,010
Just a little bit, mom.

198
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,070
If it's too tight, tell me.

199
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,320
It's okay now.

200
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,840
Thank you, mom.

201
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,420
You really did great today.

202
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,220
I've never seen you do like this.

203
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,770
I didn't know you could do this.

204
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,730
I know that you're a talented one,

205
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,590
But I don't know what makes you happy.

206
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,930
When I see you're happy

207
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,650
I'm happy too.

208
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,470
Really happy.

209
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,850
Thank you, mom.

210
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,770
Wela.

211
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,790
Today was really fun. Thank you for inviting me.

212
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,680
Sorry for making you feel bad.

213
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,130
No problem. Thank you for coming today.

214
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,060
Thank you teacher too.

215
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,290
You did great, Wela.

216
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,450
I don't know how many more times I'll surprise with you.

217
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,330
For me,

218
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,660
I didn't worry anything about you at all.

219
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:29,060
You're a talented, dedicated, and hardworking person.

220
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,820
No matter what you do, you will definitely succeed.

221
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,610
Thank you very much, teacher.

222
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:36,670
Oh.

223
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,350
And also

224
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,180
From what I saw today,

225
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,100
The club looks safe,

226
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,540
clean,

227
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,920
and no vices.

228
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,610
I think the university would have no problems.

229
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,430
I'll go talk to them for you.

230
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,260
Thank you very much, teacher.

231
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,010
Working here, is it okay?

232
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
Okay, dad. Don't worry.

233
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,920
Sure?

234
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I've heard that you work many positions here.

235
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,600
When you were with me,
have I ever made you tired, huh?

236
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,260
Well.

237
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,840
When I lived in the main house,
I didn't have to do anything.

238
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,980
But when I'm here,

239
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,890
I need to do many things.

240
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,050
I have to take responsibility for everything.

241
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,920
You might think it's tiring,

242
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,520
but I'm very happy.

243
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,180
I'm happy that I can take care of mom

244
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,990
and the club that she loves.

245
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,150
Even though, in the future, this club will go broke or not,

246
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,730
I'll be here.

247
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,430
Okay.

248
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,800
I promise

249
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,290
that no one will bother this club again.

250
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,480
But you've grown a lot.

251
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,380
We haven't seen each other in a long time.
Don't you miss me?

252
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,010
Dad, do you want to meet mom?

253
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,410
It's fine.

254
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,270
She's good, right?

255
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,960
Please take good care of your mom.

256
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,240
Thank you, dad.

257
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,610
- Good.
- Okay.

258
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,080
Now we've reached the end of the Real Deep Night.

259
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,350
I'd like to be a representative
to say thank you to everyone.

260
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,610
If there have been any mistakes, I must apologize here.

261
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,610
And our CEO, Madam Freya, may have something to say.

262
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:42,880
Thank you, Dai.

263
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,640
I'd like to thank everyone for coming today.

264
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,520
I believe that today will make
many people know more about Deep Night.

265
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,350
If from now on anyone feels lonely,

266
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,460
anyone who wants to have someone to talk to,

267
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,580
or anyone who wants to come see
our spectacular show,

268
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,090
Please come to Deep Night.

269
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,000
But if you want to book our number one host, Wela,

270
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,880
You might have to book a queue for a while
because it's very long.

271
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:08,790
Wela.

272
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,520
Let's say something to our guest for our hosts.

273
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,260
Sure.

274
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,670
Yes.

275
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:23,420
First of all, I'd like to thank all the honored guests
who came to our event tonight.

276
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,050
As a representative of my hosts friends,

277
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,740
It must be acknowledged that
our profession is often devalued.

278
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,730
Even though it's a profession that
brings joy and comfort to our guests,

279
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,980
we never give up.

280
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,900
We're still determined to continue to
provide happiness to our guests.

281
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,400
As everyone can see, there have many hosts in our club.

282
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,610
We have both expert hosts
who have been here for a long time

283
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,730
and trainee hosts.

284
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,460
For me, I've been here for a long time
that I want to move to another step.

285
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,170
Therefore, I'd like to announce that
I'll end my role as host

286
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:34,070
to pave the way for others to rise to this position.

287
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,910
As for me, I will go to be a behind

288
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,460
to transfer knowledges and push the new generation
to become quality hosts.

289
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,620
Anyways, I'd like all of you love Deep Night more.

290
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,720
Thank you.

291
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,210
Everyone wants to be 1st.

292
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,480
And someday...

293
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,720
I will be 1st.

294
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,550
And here,

295
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,880
Our club's next No.1 host.

296
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,650
Ah...

297
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,620
It was an unexpected farewell.

298
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,800
So I'd like to say that...

299
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:41,560
Our Deep Night No.1 right now is Seiji!.

300
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,350
Today, I'm shocked.

301
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,740
What you said on stage

302
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,840
Have you thought about it for a long time?

303
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,700
It's been a while.

304
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,870
Because of me?

305
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,290
Don't flatter yourself.

306
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,490
Oh?

307
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,600
Seriously.

308
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,200
It's okay, you can continue doing it. I don't stop you.

309
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,490
I'll understand you even more than this.

310
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,640
No.

311
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,410
I won't look after anyone anymore.

312
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
I only have you.

313
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,930
You're not allowed to have anyone else.

314
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,390
Please have only me.

315
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,130
I got it.

316
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,139
Actually, my debts are almost gone.

317
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,960
I just want to take a break.

318
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,210
We will have time for each other.

319
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,730
Like other couples.

320
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:26,120
You don't have to be like other couples,
I still love you anyway.

321
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,180
Don't be stubborn.

322
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,830
Don't want to do it?

323
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,040
Huh?

324
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,950
I'll do it for you.

325
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,340
Congratulations.

326
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:40,950
Finally,

327
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,400
you did it.

328
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,620
Thanks.

329
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,810
And also

330
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,580
Congrats to you about Japan.

331
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,640
Take good care of him.

332
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,040
Are you okay, Ken?

333
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,540
If you're okay, I'm okay.

334
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,230
Ken.

335
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,290
Thanks for today

336
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,960
about repairing his shirt.

337
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,280
But I won't give up.

338
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,840
I'll improve myself.

339
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,770
But the true love means...

340
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,840
making the people we love happy, right?

341
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,970
Seiji.

342
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,110
Actually... you love Ken, right?

343
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,030
Then

344
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,740
For your happiness,

345
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,480
What's about...

346
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,680
Shall we date together?

347
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,360
Since Seiji loves both of us

348
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,460
and I want you happy as well.

349
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,650
Why can't we be together as three people?

350
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,830
Also...

351
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,630
If you have only me,

352
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,260
there will have something that I can't take care of you.

353
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,190
But if you have Ken,

354
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,140
we can help to take care of you
and let you have max happiness.

355
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:08,760
Sure?

356
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,260
It depends on the decision of you two.

357
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,600
But for me,

358
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,880
Pan's okay.

359
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,000
I think he's right.

360
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,610
There are two people love you.

361
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,210
Two must be better than one, right?

362
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,080
Thank you guys.

363
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:29,270
I would like to thank everyone for tonight's event.

364
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,130
Everyone did a great job

365
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And our guests loved it too.

366
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,350
Please clap your hands for yourself.

367
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,480
And I would like to apologize to everyone as well

368
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,330
that there was chaos in our club

369
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,580
until today's special event had to happen.

370
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,570
And then there's another thing

371
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,450
That I have to say it

372
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,240
Since we didn't solve it yet.

373
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,610
That is the 5th golden rule.

374
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,980
It is forbidden for people in the club to be lovers.

375
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,810
I didn't forget it,

376
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,320
but I just want to get through this period first.

377
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,030
Now, everything is perfect and...

378
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,610
I would like to announce the punishment.

379
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,680
I'll use the same measures as everyone.

380
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,230
It doesn't matter that Khemtid is my son.

381
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,000
If Khemtid and Wela were to be punished
for breaking rule number five,

382
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,020
Madam has to punish me too.

383
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,330
Because now...

384
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,950
Seiji and I are dating.

385
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,680
Me too.

386
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,660
Now, I'm dating Seiji.

387
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:56,790
Me too, Madam.

388
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,570
I'm about to break 5th rule.

389
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,320
Because... I like James

390
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,350
and I'm flirting with him as well.

391
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,290
Then, punish me too, Madam.

392
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,740
Because...

393
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,400
I'll probably break the rule as well.

394
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,550
Hey, is this true?

395
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:43,590
Actually...

396
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,830
I also has one.

397
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,250
My lover is like the people in the club as well.

398
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,800
If everyone has no problems,

399
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,520
I want to cancel the 5th golden rule.

400
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,380
Because I feel like it goes against
my own and everyone else's feelings.

401
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,920
We will have love, boyfriend or girlfriend, we can take responsibility for our work.

402
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,410
Personal matters must not be affected
by your work. Understand?

403
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,920
- Got it.
- Got it.

404
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:20,750
Madam Freya.

405
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,190
It's Dai?

406
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,360
Huh?

407
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,250
What are you guys thinking?

408
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,540
Oh, my dear. Gosh!

409
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,710
This is Deep Night club.

410
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,630
A place that made me encounter many stories.

411
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,450
- It's Meji!
- Meji!

412
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,720
It made me learn that...
We shouldn't judge the book from its cover.

413
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,850
While I'm not here, please take care of yourself.

414
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,200
Don't sleep late.

415
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Take care my mom too, Meji.

416
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,140
Sure!

417
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,350
I'm out.

418
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,120
And it made me learn that...

419
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,450
In the dark night,

420
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,380
A single star cannot light it up.

421
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,690
But we need many stars

422
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,200
to help make the night dark

423
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,690
come back to light

424
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,720
With our unity.

425
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,410
And the important thing...

426
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:39,610
Good love always brings good things to us.

427
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,610
Here everyone. I'm with the new hosts of Deep Night!

428
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:50,350
Let's get to know each of them. What's your name?

429
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,150
Hello, I'm James.

430
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,040
Now, our Deep Night is once again
the number-one host club.

431
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,870
Because it is a source of male hosts who love service

432
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:01,760
and give happiness to everyone.

433
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,150
I told you to stretch my chest!

434
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,660
When talking to guests,
you must have a good personality.

435
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,520
Please be confident.

436
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,330
Slowly.

437
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,250
Take it easy and breathe.

438
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,100
Let's come and experience the Deep Night together.
