1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,270
You went to a club How was it?

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,130
I really want to give to this bar.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,600
Don't talk with me?

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,250
Be careful, others might know about last night.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,530
Employees are prohibited from being lovers.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,250
Why not allowed?

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,970
That they don't allow, it's right.

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,370
Don't date anyone here.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,290
About what I intimidated you in the afternoon,

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,290
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,810
Don't forget about our deal.

12
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,930
At the university, don't say hi to me if it's not necessary.

13
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,650
We just live separate lives as always.

14
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,330
Understand?

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,770
You look sleeply.

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,010
Yep.

17
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,010
Played football?

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,410
Or did anything else?

19
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,890
Why?

20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,170
Nope.

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,410
Pan.

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,930
Have you ever heard about Multiverse?

23
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,010
Why?

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,330
In another Multiverse,

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,970
you and someone might be very closed to each other.

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,810
But in other Multiverse,

27
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,970
he acts like you are a stranger to him.

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,570
Is that even real?

29
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,850
You summarized the data very well, Garnwela

30
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,050
You got many sample group.

31
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,010
But I think

32
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,410
it can be more than this.

33
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,250
Did you send this survey form to your classmate yet?

34
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,690
Not yet.

35
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,450
I think...

36
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,770
You should send it.

37
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:55,890
Okay.

38
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,890
Thank you, professor.

39
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,970
Can you fill this survey form, please.

40
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,330
Don't forget about our deal.

41
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,170
At the university, don't say hi to me if it's not necessary.

42
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,170
We just live separate lives as always.

43
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,010
Understand?

44
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,970
Why I have to do that?

45
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,890
It will be broken.

46
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,010
What's wrong?

47
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,130
We should go to take a shower. Let's go.

48
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,850
Give it to me.

49
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,650
The survey form.

50
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,090
You said that we shouldn't talk at the university.

51
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,210
I want to smell you all night.

52
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,050
You're blushing because of me?

53
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,450
Does the club open yet?

54
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,090
They take the pass fee for men.

55
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,450
How can I get it?

56
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,170
Why do you need to get it?

57
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,730
I want to know.

58
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,770
Want to know what?

59
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,890
There is...

60
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:35,890
Come here.

61
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,650
Hey you.

62
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,970
Let me go.

63
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:38,970
You

64
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:39,700
- Come here
-- Let me go

65
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,470
Ouch.

66
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,010
Let me go!

67
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,210
Let me go. Let me go.

68
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,970
- Let me go.
- Come here.

69
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,370
I said "Let me go".

70
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,650
Why you have to drag me?

71
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,490
Who are you?

72
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,090
What club sent you here?

73
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,410
What the hell is what club?

74
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,050
I told you that I'm from the university.

75
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:52,970
I'm asking you.

76
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,170
What club sent you here?

77
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,450
Why you have to act sneaky in front of the club?

78
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,770
I'm here for applying a job.

79
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,570
Lied.

80
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,690
It's true.

81
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,170
I have experiences!

82
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,010
Let's see.

83
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,370
Good evening, beloved customer.

84
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,490
This is your drink, Ma'am.

85
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,270
Oh,

86
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,890
Thank you for the tip.

87
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,050
That table too.

88
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,850
Where're you going?

89
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,890
Why did you kiss me?

90
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,890
I didn't mean to.

91
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,770
But that's still a kiss.

92
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,450
No.

93
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:40,950
Yes.

94
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,450
No

95
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,130
Yes.

96
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:42,690
No.

97
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,690
What a fuss, boys.

98
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,890
Madam Freya.

99
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,450
Do you know me?

100
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,370
I have watched you on TV.

101
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,370
The real you is prettier than the one in video.

102
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,370
Thanks.

103
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,770
Can I take a selfie with you?

104
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,250
Sure.

105
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,210
Thank you.

106
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:09,970
You're welcome.

107
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,810
Eh...

108
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,530
Why do you come to my club?

109
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,330
He is here for applying a job.

110
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:17,970
Okay.

111
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,250
Do you really apply for this job?

112
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,810
Try spreading you arms.

113
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,090
Not like that.

114
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,930
You're funny.

115
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,050
You're fit in my club.

116
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,050
I hire you.

117
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,210
Start to work today.

118
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:35,970
Okay.

119
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,730
Thank you, Madam Freya.

120
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,090
Sure. I have to go.

121
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,010
Ma'am.

122
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,610
Do not take a video.

123
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,130
Why here always has weird guests.

124
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,930
Hey.

125
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,450
Rose.

126
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,850
Oh gosh.

127
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,290
You dress sexy today.

128
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,250
Oh gosh.

129
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,890
You start to take a video?

130
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,010
Yes, mom.

131
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,690
What about today,

132
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,010
do you target someone especially yet?

133
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,050
I am Rose. I come here for the diamond.

134
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,530
It needs to be the number one here.

135
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,490
I'm super ready to spend all my money.

136
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,050
I knew it.

137
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,690
I has already prepared him for you.

138
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,850
Booking his queueis so hard.

139
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,410
Bring him to me.

140
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,450
Speak of it.

141
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,050
Good evening.

142
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,970
Rose.

143
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,970
Please do not take a video of a host

144
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,210
and other guests in the club.

145
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,490
But the vibe in the club, that's fine.

146
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,210
All fine.

147
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,410
Uhhhh.

148
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,010
You don't need to be worry, Di.

149
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,210
I have 700k-800k followers,

150
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,570
I don't ruin my own reputation.

151
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,610
- of course
- Okay.

152
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,450
I'll take you in the club.

153
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,490
Let's go.

154
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,730
Please take care of her.

155
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,970
Yes, Di.

156
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,290
Be careful.

157
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,530
He is the number 1 up-coming host in here.

158
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,130
I can tell you the vibe is legit.

159
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,090
First thing first, the side table has

160
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,690
hosts standing in the line for you to choose.

161
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,010
But I am a mother. Once I came here,

162
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,330
I reserved before coming here.

163
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,330
I can tell you here is lit.

164
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,330
I want you to visit here.

165
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,210
I chose the number 1 host in here that has many queues.

166
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,490
Here is

167
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,130
the table that I have reserved, everyone.

168
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:46,930
I tell you.

169
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,270
This is perfect

170
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,110
and fabulous.

171
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,690
Is that right?

172
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,250
You are the most adorable.

173
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,370
Can you cut me out, if it show my face?

174
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,090
You don't need to worry.

175
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,810
I cut it anyway.

176
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,490
Oh my good boy.

177
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,530
Thank you.

178
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,130
You are the most adorable.

179
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:06,970
So,

180
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,850
what kind of drinking that you like?

181
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,250
Um. I can drink pure liqueur.

182
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,850
But if

183
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,930
I buy 10 drinks, that means you have to drink all 10 shots?

184
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,010
No.

185
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,330
Drink is the fee that the guests give us.

186
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,050
But we don't drink the liqueur that much.

187
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,130
What if I want you stay with me all night?

188
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,010
You have to drink with me all night long.

189
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,490
Come on. Come on.

190
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,290
Enjoy it. Enjoy it.

191
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,330
Drink this. Drink this, please.

192
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,210
Is that normal?

193
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,450
Don't worry.

194
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,770
Our club has the guards.

195
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,050
If he cannot stand that, he'll give us a sign.

196
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,770
Then, the guards will take her out.

197
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,290
Drink more.

198
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,650
My baby.

199
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,970
Good boy. My good boy.

200
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,130
- Oh sorry
- Oh sorry.

201
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:09,650
Pan?

202
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,730
Pan.

203
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,210
What are you doing here?

204
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,850
You, what are you doing here?

205
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,930
Actually, I saw you here a day ago.

206
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,450
So, I turned back here for investigating.

207
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,610
I thought you are a host.

208
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,570
But

209
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,850
I don't think that

210
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,210
And what is Wela doing here?

211
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,090
I saw him dressing nicely.

212
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,370
He's not a traffic assistant for sure.

213
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,930
Or he's a host?

214
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,450
Yep.

215
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,370
Really?

216
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,720
Yes.

217
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,610
You know it, so you should go home.

218
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,610
I will tell the club's HR for you.

219
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,090
This sounds fun.

220
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,850
The multiverse that you mentioned before is here, right?

221
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,970
I see.

222
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,650
You will get closer to Wela alone?

223
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,970
What about me?

224
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,210
You cannot leave me.

225
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,690
If you have a new friend,

226
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,850
I need to be a friend with your new friend too.

227
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,290
I'm so happy that I will finally have a smart friend.

228
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,730
You have me.

229
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,090
Smart one, buddy.

230
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,250
Smart one.

231
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,350
F*ck you.

232
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,010
You can tell them.

233
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,930
But both your picture and video

234
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,730
are in this.

235
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,050
I won't tell anyone.

236
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,330
Drink more.

237
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,290
And I will delete them.

238
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,240
Hey.

239
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,210
Are you okay?

240
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,850
You can tell me.

241
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,930
- Hey you.
- Yes.

242
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,170
Drink all the shot.

243
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,530
Sure.

244
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,410
Mother is mothering.

245
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,010
Come and join us.

246
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,090
He is okay, right?

247
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,970
Absolutely, I want to take him home.

248
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,970
Yes.

249
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,370
Yes.

250
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,530
My good boy.

251
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,930
- Go Go Go.
- Your cheeks are so red. You're drunk yet?

252
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,810
You are surely not drunk.

253
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,250
Drink more.

254
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,770
How are you today?

255
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,210
You're drinking alone. Are you lonely?

256
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,650
Yes, I'm so lonely.

257
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,770
Here is your Crypiranha, Ma'am.

258
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,010
What?

259
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,770
Here is

260
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,690
Cry

261
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,690
piranha

262
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,570
Here is your Caipirinha, Ma'am.

263
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,170
Crypiranha?

264
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,570
What?

265
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,810
You're a joke.

266
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,530
Daiquiri

267
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,170
Curaçao

268
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,290
Piña...

269
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,610
Co-a-la

270
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,570
What the fuck?

271
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,850
Caipiranha

272
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,770
Caipirinha

273
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,130
Caipirinha

274
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,050
Bouleva

275
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,050
Boulevardier

276
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,010
Your accent,

277
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,330
you should apply a job in a local liqueur club.

278
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,490
Can you say thank you?

279
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,010
Why I have to say thank you?

280
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,450
It's fair for us.

281
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,650
Fair what?

282
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:07,730
For that you

283
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,050
kissed me.

284
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,290
That isn't called a kiss.

285
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,450
Yes it is.

286
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,890
Your lip touched my lip.

287
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,290
If you want to know how real kiss looks like,

288
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,850
I'll show you.

289
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:07,970
Hey.

290
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,090
IT's the VIP table's order.

291
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,090
Yes.

292
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,450
I'm getting inside.

293
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,450
I'm in front of the club.

294
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,970
Okay.

295
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:34,770
This way, Ma'am.

296
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,730
So handsome.

297
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,130
You.

298
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,610
Are you free tonight?

299
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,210
I'm not a host.

300
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,210
Oh.

301
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,010
This club is fabulous.

302
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,770
Even a traffic assistant boy is still handsome.

303
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,770
You got me.

304
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,690
I'll give you some tip.

305
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,970
Let me find some money first.

306
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,210
Where is it?

307
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,530
I'll give you 1,000 Baht.

308
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,090
You want it?

309
00:22:59,090 --> 00:22:59,770
You.

310
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:01,970
Boy.

311
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,130
You.

312
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,570
Mister.

313
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,170
Hey you.

314
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,770
Boy.

315
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,050
Oh

316
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,970
Where are you going, Khemtid?

317
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,130
You told me that our club has the guards taking care of it.

318
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,970
Then why you let him drunk like that?

319
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:17,610
I

320
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,330
let the guards watch out from here.

321
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,130
But

322
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,730
Wela doesn't give us any sign.

323
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,730
Don't you see that he's drunk?

324
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,690
What are you waiting for?

325
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,510
I

326
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:30,850
Follow me.

327
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,350
Hurry up.

328
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,130
Sorry.

329
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,930
This table is out of time.

330
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,890
He said that he can stay all night.

331
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,850
You are just a traffic assistant.

332
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,290
What right do you have to displace me?

333
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,890
Why I don't have a right to do that?

334
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,170
You can displace me.

335
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,730
But the picture and video

336
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,050
are in this.

337
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,790
Oh my god.

338
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,810
This is the special promotion for our club.

339
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,250
Open the table for today,

340
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,890
free the new phone.

341
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,210
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

342
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,730
You're bastard.

343
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,370
Fuck.

344
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,610
You're fucking in my way.

345
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,410
Record this.

346
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,650
You guys keep recording this.

347
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,050
I'll review this club until It's closed.

348
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,970
You need to know who I am. You guys keep recording this.

349
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,050
You're fucking trash.

350
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,290
Your club need to be closed.

351
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,130
Oh my god.

352
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,450
Fuck. You're fucking bitch.

353
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,290
Fucking cunt.

354
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,130
Fuck. Fuck.

355
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:14,810
Uh.

356
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,490
There is nothing happened, everyone.

357
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,130
What?

358
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,930
I'm okay.

359
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,670
Okay what?

360
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,490
Come

361
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,090
What the hell is wrong with you? Why did you have to drink that much?

362
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,170
Huh?

363
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,570
Why did you drink that much?

364
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,610
It's my job.

365
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,490
Look what are you doing?

366
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,770
Where is your house at?

367
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,970
No. I don't want to go home.

368
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,210
Please.

369
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,730
I don't go home.

370
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,010
I want to work.

371
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,090
Work what?

372
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:53,970
Hey you.

373
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:55,770
I go with you.

374
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:58,770
Are you okay?

375
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,050
Okay.

376
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,930
I'm okay. I don't go.

377
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,250
Get in a car.

378
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,090
No, I don't want to go home.

379
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:04,970
- Get in a car.
- I don't go.

380
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,370
Get in a car.

381
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,130
I tell you the way.

382
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,970
Boulevardier

383
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,170
What does its taste like?

384
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:18,770
You need to stop.

385
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,770
Ah.

386
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,770
I want to go back to work.

387
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,090
Where are you going?

388
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,210
Work.

389
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:27,970
Come to sleep.

390
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,370
It's hot.

391
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,970
What are you doing?

392
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,130
What?

393
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,050
You have something to say about today?

394
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:32,970
Khem, you know it right?

395
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,010
What you did to a guest today is not okay.

396
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,410
I know.

397
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,290
I know that you tried to help Wela.

398
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,730
But you can't vandalize a guest's stuff like this.

399
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,770
I checked it already.

400
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,890
In the phone, there was a video that Wela was in it.

401
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,650
I get it that she used this video to

402
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,410
threaten Wela.

403
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,570
You don't need to worry.

404
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,250
I deleted it.

405
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,290
I let them transfer the data from that phone to the new one.

406
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,410
I'll send it to her tomorrow.

407
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,210
Thank you.

408
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,690
Remember.

409
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,410
If there is anything happened like that again,

410
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,610
you need to tell me.

411
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,170
Don't deal with it by yourself.

412
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,410
Understand?

413
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,810
Go to bed.

414
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,130
You are tired all day.

415
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,050
Is Wela in your room?

416
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,130
You want him to sleep in a guest room? So, you don't have to fit in one bed.

417
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,370
It's okay.

418
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:55,850
Wela.

419
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,130
Wela.

420
00:28:59,370 --> 00:28:59,890
Damn!

421
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,650
What the fuck are you doing?

422
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,170
You don't take a shower?

423
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,930
You're first.

424
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,490
Let take a shower together.

425
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,850
No, thanks.

426
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,850
Come here.

427
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,690
The bathroom is big.

428
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,290
It's lonely to take a shower alone.

429
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,290
What are you looking at?

430
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,530
Me?

431
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,490
Are you drunk?

432
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,850
No, I'm not.

433
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,050
What's wrong?

434
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,610
Don't you remember about last night?

435
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,690
Last night?

436
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,050
Fuck it.

437
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,970
So,

438
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,130
You are rich. Why do you have to work as a traffic assistant?

439
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,170
Well.

440
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,970
I'm looking for the experience.

441
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,210
Looking for the experience?

442
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,300
Yes?

443
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,210
Is this your childhood picture?

444
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,570
What picture?

445
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,490
Are you Freya's fan?

446
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,380
Huh?

447
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,090
You're up?

448
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,969
I slept here last night?

449
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,409
Why?

450
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,130
You didn't remember anything?

451
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,730
Hey.

452
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,130
You.

453
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,370
Oh my god.

454
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:15,970
You

455
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:16,970
What the hell?

456
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,210
Pan.

457
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,570
You drank just a shot last night.

458
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,170
But you were drunk as hell.

459
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,210
No one can wake you up.

460
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,970
I asked where do you live, you didn't answer me back.

461
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,930
So, I let you slept here.

462
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,170
You slept here last night too?

463
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,610
So kind.

464
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,170
You tossed and turned all night.

465
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,810
Your hair is messy.

466
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,250
Here.

467
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,250
Soap and toothpaste.

468
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,970
There is the balm too.

469
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,170
I told you to spread the sheet for sleeping.

470
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,410
The mosquito bit your arm.

471
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,810
I told you to go home, but you didn't.

472
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,170
I didn't  have to sleep with me.

473
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,810
Thanks for taking me home.

474
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,210
Is this your house?

475
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,170
Yes.

476
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,210
Goodbye.

477
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,050
I come home, mom.

478
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:06,930
There you are, son.

479
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,410
- Hi.
- Hi.

480
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,490
- Can I kiss your cheek?
- I'm stinky.

481
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,050
Not at all.

482
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,770
Let me help you.

483
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,970
I bring the vegetable for you.

484
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,130
Hi.

485
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,850
I'm Wela's friend.

486
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,530
I took Wela home and saw that there are many customers.

487
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,530
Is there anything that I can help?

488
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,090
What are you waiting for?

489
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:38,930
Come in.

490
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,490
Come. Come and help me.

491
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,010
Here.

492
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,010
Can you eat it?

493
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,810
My customers really like it.

494
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:13,650
Try it.

495
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,130
I like it too.

496
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,890
Thanks.

497
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,690
You are the first person that Wela takes home.

498
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,370
Do you study in the same class or work together?

499
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,290
Both.

500
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:37,770
That's nice.

501
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,770
I thought he doesn't have any friend.

502
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,250
Because he has to work.

503
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,690
I want him to live his life as a normal teenager.

504
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,530
But If I don't get money from him, our house cannot stand.

505
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,010
I want you, Khemtid,

506
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,690
to be friend with Wela.

507
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,410
He might be

508
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,090
a tough kid, but he's a nice kid.

509
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,720
Actually, he has so many friends.

510
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,670
While he's working,

511
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,250
all customers like him.

512
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,050
The customers that bought stuffs?

513
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,450
Did customers buy stuffs late night?

514
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:31,820
Here.

515
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,730
Your shirt.

516
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,130
Thank you for today.

517
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,530
You sent me home and stayed for helping.

518
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,730
I am jealous to you.

519
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,050
Your mom is good at cooking.

520
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,850
Did my mom ask you about a job?

521
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,400
Yes.

522
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,370
I told her that our customers…

523
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,890
bought our stuffs all night.

524
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,610
Did customers buy stuffs late night?

525
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,650
Yes.

526
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,130
The customers bought stuffs all night.

527
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,970
It means that you and Wela

528
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,530
works at night shift, right?

529
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,010
So,

530
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,210
you need something to eat

531
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,690
I will give it to you a lot.

532
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,730
Because you need to eat at night for protecting sleepiness.

533
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,290
Okay?

534
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,210
I will prepare it for you.

535
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,090
Thank you.

536
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,130
What about

537
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,210
last night?

538
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,010
We had something?

539
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,650
No.

540
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,480
Be serious.

541
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,010
You fucked me or I fucked you.

542
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,170
You? You fucked me?

543
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:17,970
I think I know it.

544
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,010
You should go home.

545
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:07,970
Ouch

546
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,090
What's wrong?

547
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,210
Ouch

548
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:12,970
Ouch

549
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,170
My back is hurt like hell.

550
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,890
I see why you are sleepy everyday.

551
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:19,570
What now?

552
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,130
Gonna quite?

553
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,730
I'll tell the club.

554
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:23,810
No.

555
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:25,730
I will do it.

556
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,850
What are you into?

557
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:40,970
Nothing.

558
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:43,930
Wela.

559
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,090
How was that night?

560
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:50,690
It's okay.

561
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,370
Okay?

562
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,680
Even though, you were drunk like that?

563
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:55,450
Boys.

564
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,610
I have a good news

565
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:03,090
Our Friday Night Party tonight

566
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,730
is run out of the tables.

567
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,050
And tonight,

568
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,010
there are many guests.

569
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:17,170
I want you guys

570
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,490
to take care of our guests well.

571
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,090
Yes, Madam.

572
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,810
If there are something happened,

573
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:24,450
tell the guards,

574
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,290
Di

575
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,570
and me immediately.

576
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:27,890
Alright.

577
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:31,930
Hope everyone enjoy our Friday Night Party tonight.

578
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,050
And hope everyone

579
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,650
get a bunch of tip.

580
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,600
Turn on freaking savage songs tonight, bro.

581
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,630
I got you, bro.

582
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,290
I got you.

583
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,510
What is Friday Night Party?

584
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,050
You don't know what that means?

585
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,690
It's the weekend party

586
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,410
that our club

587
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,850
has a special event.

588
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,750
This weekend has the Auction Host

589
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,370
Right.

590
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:14,330
Auction Host

591
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:17,530
What is that?

592
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,010
Google it.

593
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,360
Auction Host!

594
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,010
Hello, Di.

595
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:14,810
Oh gosh.

596
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,890
There are VIP customers joining the auction with us.

597
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:18,970
What's wrong with you?

598
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:20,850
Nothing.

599
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,820
To love someone who has this job,

600
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:25,650
you have to think about it wisely.

601
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,130
You're jealous?

602
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:28,850
What are we?

603
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,440
Can we be something?

604
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,050
What now?

605
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,730
Do you want to be my boyfriend?
