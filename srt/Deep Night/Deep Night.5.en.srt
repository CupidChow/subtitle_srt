1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,340
Don't say that you are together?

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,150
Are you smile at the snack?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,230
You think it's strange, right?

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,580
Yes.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,620
Since I opened this club,

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,149
This hasn't ever happened before.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,540
Have you been enough?

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,000
About this club?

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,280
Everyone is telling me to quit and stop.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,720
I have never made you proud of me.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,640
For today review, the up-coming host club.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,790
Everyone said that the place is so good.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,160
How does it look like?, let's see.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,900
I am in the club right now.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,000
The inside looks exactly like a night club.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,700
But the difference is...

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,370
I'll show you.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,300
Hi ladies.

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,920
What's your name, the right one?

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,720
What's your name?

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,310
- I'm Chopper.
- Ah, Chopper.

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,840
What's about you?

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,840
- I'm Tiger.
- Tiger.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,150
Chopper and Tiger, please take care all the ladies.

25
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,700
Sure.

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
That's so legit.

27
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,520
I can say that

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,480
If you're interested someone, you can pick them by yourself.

29
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,570
It's like 'Conveyor belt Mala restaurant'

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,519
Hello, guys. Here's my camera. I'm reviewing this club.

31
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:07,590
Well.

32
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,600
Damn!

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,810
The polices come again!

34
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,650
Or it's because of me?

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,700
Damn.

36
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,600
Right! It's the same club that I came last time. Look.

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,940
This club... I don't know why polices always come, guys.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,200
How can I not be mad?

39
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,550
The passed fee is expensive.

40
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,150
And this is what I've got?

41
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,320
Tonight, I spent 50,000 baht on the host.

42
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,910
And do you know what was happened?

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,150
It's shut down!

44
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,880
Go to the other club is the better way, if you want to go to the host club like this.

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,380
Check it. Check it before coming.

46
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,759
Because there are plenty of the club that better than this club.

47
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm warning you.

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,260
Go to the other clubs, please.

49
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,640
This club is a shit show.

50
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,570
I told you. I'm warning you.

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,120
Dai.

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,960
Yes?

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,990
What're you watching?

54
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,710
I'm watching Shin-chan.

55
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,020
Have you ever watched it?

56
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,910
Oh...

57
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,510
It's so quiet today.

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,990
If it's like this tonight, it wouldn't be good.

59
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,760
The package is sent back, right?

60
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,030
Last night was a mess.

61
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,440
You can re-send it.

62
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,970
I will pay the shipping cost.

63
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,680
Yes.

64
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,980
That's right.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,930
I will pay it all.

66
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,290
Thank you.

67
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,440
Hi.

68
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,000
About the host cost, right?

69
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,110
I will pay back.

70
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,909
No.

71
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,980
We don't have illegal things, for sure.

72
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

73
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,430
Yes. Thank you.

74
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,150
Hi.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,340
As the same.

76
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,340
For today. The fully band.

77
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,180
Yes.

78
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,290
You can come.

79
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,590
That's fine. If something like last night happens again, I'll pay in full.

80
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay?

81
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,080
Alright.

82
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,670
Sure.

83
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,410
Give me it.

84
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,000
Stop it.

85
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,390
Come and sit here.

86
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,610
This is too tense.

87
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,670
This went too far.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,610
There is clearly someone teasing me.

89
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,470
You mean other clubs?

90
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,680
I don't think so.

91
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,560
It it's not,

92
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,610
there is someone want to tease you.

93
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,850
Who want to tease you?

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,260
I won't let that happen.

95
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,520
Because I am the only one that can tease you.

96
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,850
It's tickling!

97
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,430
Tickling, right?

98
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,159
- I take it back.
- Ouch.

99
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,600
You're feeling better now.

100
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,300
Thanks.

101
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,040
Yes.

102
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,740
You bump into my forehead.

103
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,280
Kiss my forehead then.

104
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,940
This too.

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,880
Can you get up?

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,500
You are heavy.

107
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Can we stay like this?

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
It's heavy.

109
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm tickled.

110
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:34,909
Fine.

111
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,360
How is Khemtid?

112
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,370
Have you been enough?

113
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,890
About this club?

114
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,490
I told you, it's too risk.

115
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,420
Maybe we'll be charged the case.

116
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,180
Suddenly,

117
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,000
the whole club was light up.

118
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,350
Then, the police came and locked everyone in the club.

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,840
That moment was under the pressure.

120
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,360
Everyone was foraged. There was no one escape them.

121
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,070
Did you see it by yourself?

122
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,190
Yeah, I saw it by myself.

123
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,530
I was foraged too.

124
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,180
Hey.

125
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,050
Here.

126
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,710
Your favorite green yogurt.

127
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,120
I bought it for you.

128
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,690
Thanks.

129
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,550
This is your favorite chocolate.

130
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,720
You have to eat it before working.

131
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,770
Give me your hand.

132
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,270
You played with a cat in front of the club again, right?

133
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,670
You got a scratch again. And not even get over it.

134
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,090
Here.

135
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,549
Bring this with you while working.

136
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,710
In case...

137
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,740
In case, you're drunk.

138
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,799
He can't bring it!

139
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,090
Guests might misunderstand that he hates their smell.

140
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,230
Ken. Don't tease him.

141
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,940
No, I don't.

142
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,770
I tell the truth.

143
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,750
And what about I've said that I'm flirting with you.

144
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,440
It's also the truth.

145
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,300
Rock Paper Scissors!

146
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,680
I need to pee.

147
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,760
I have to go to the toilet.

148
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,980
Okay. I take you there.

149
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,200
Let's go.

150
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,150
Is this?

151
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
Is this your perspective to my job?

152
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,110
I think you understand about Deep Night more than others.

153
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,190
But you are the same like them.

154
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,960
- You're already full, right?
- Yes.

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,600
Here.

156
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,190
Oh, let me find you the change.

157
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,560
Oh gosh. Where is it?

158
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:37,840
Here.

159
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,950
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

160
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,280
Mom.

161
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,300
Let me help you.

162
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,970
Go back to sleep.

163
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,760
You just went back from work, didn't you?

164
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,460
I am not that busy today.

165
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,840
You can help me at this noon.

166
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,670
Please go back to bed.

167
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,300
I get some sleep a little more then.

168
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,670
I'll help you at noon.

169
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,450
Okay.

170
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,240
Okay.

171
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,700
Is he your son?

172
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,560
Yes. He's working and studying at the same time.

173
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,980
So dedicated.

174
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,890
- So good.
- Thank you.

175
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,840
- See you again
- Sure.

176
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,690
Come back tomorrow.

177
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,710
- Hello, auntie
- You can order what you want.

178
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,950
What about cucumber?

179
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,490
Cut cucumber first.

180
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,490
Thank you, Khemtid.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,170
You help me a lot.

182
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,800
That's fine. It's fun.

183
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,100
How you cut it? Cut it slanting.

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,420
Cut it like this.

185
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,420
Cut it wider.

186
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,400
You both are the same.

187
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,270
Want to help me but you cannot do anything.

188
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,310
Thank you so much.

189
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,580
I'm glad that you are Wela's friend.

190
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,990
When he's tired, he still has you by his side.

191
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,720
We are human,

192
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,680
we don't need anything else but someone who understands us.

193
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,630
Here. Service, please.

194
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,660
Yes, mom.

195
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:26,830
Here.

196
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,590
Take that rice for me.

197
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,860
Hurry.

198
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,150
Yes.

199
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,660
Excuse me.

200
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,000
I will take this dish home.

201
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,440
Yes, sir.

202
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,290
Service this too.

203
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,430
Yes.

204
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,540
Yes, mom.

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,950
I woke up.

206
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,140
I am sorry.

207
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,430
I was too mad last night.

208
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,810
I should think about you more.

209
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,060
You were right.

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,740
I should be the one who understand you most.

211
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,820
After this, I will understand you more.

212
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,870
I am sorry too.

213
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,440
I was so busy until I forgot to think about you.

214
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,770
Actually,  I should understand you more.

215
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,330
Let's make up.

216
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,790
Remember,

217
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,190
If you want to make up with me.

218
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,000
What you should do.

219
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,710
Don't mad at me.

220
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,240
Over here?

221
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,470
It's fine.

222
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,140
It's my home.

223
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,950
but here is rooftop.

224
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,790
Where is Wela go?

225
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,280
Wela!

226
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,570
I have to dry the clothes and cooking.

227
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,110
Wela!

228
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,570
Wela.

229
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,980
Come help me dry the clothes.

230
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,460
Where are you Wela, come help me dry the clothes.

231
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,120
1 Kaphrao, Auntie.

232
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,660
Yes.

233
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,240
Where is he?

234
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,690
Yes.

235
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,760
Thank you for today.

236
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,110
You helped a lot.

237
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,360
What you means, I helped a lot?

238
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,960
Cheeky!!

239
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,740
Just go.

240
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,150
Wear it.

241
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,000
So, you will miss me.

242
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,070
Consider it a deposit.

243
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,860
Um.

244
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,420
I am sorry again,

245
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,160
to made you feel sad.

246
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,850
Never mind.

247
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,410
But there is the one you should apologize.

248
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,150
Madam Freya.

249
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,890
I am sorry.

250
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,020
I didn't mean to do that.

251
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,760
I just didn't want you tired with it.

252
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,930
but now I've already understand.

253
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,050
If we really love something,

254
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,670
No matter how tiring or difficult,

255
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,610
We are ready to fight for it.

256
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,280
I understand it.

257
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,310
You've grown up since you are in love.

258
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,630
Thank you, Khem.

259
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,180
In this world,

260
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,110
it's fine if no one understand me.

261
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,900
Just only you that understand me, it's enough.

262
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,970
Madam.

263
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,050
Next time promoting,

264
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,000
I want to choose by my own.

265
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,020
Can I?

266
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,520
Ma'am.

267
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:17,930
Yes?

268
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,460
Oh, my wallet.

269
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,130
Please wait.

270
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,170
Keep this.

271
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,340
- Thank you, but it's okay, ma'am.
- Don't want?

272
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,890
It's okay, thank you.

273
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,250
Thank you so much.

274
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,510
Come on, let's start.

275
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,510

Wait up, I want to join too!.

00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Alright, let's prepare yourself for work.

292
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,600
- What're you doing?
- What?

293
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,200
Come, stop it.

294
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,940
What? Wait, give me it!

295
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,170
What the hell?

296
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,670
Gosh!

297
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,790
How was it?

298
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,150
Our Deep night club's new content creator.

299
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,420
Are you tied?

300
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,700
I'm good.

301
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,800
Are you okay with it?

302
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,960
I think we should have something like this.

303
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,780
True.

304
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,000
Good job!

305
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:14,830
Eiei.

306
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,850
Eiei.

307
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,280
What an idea!

308
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,660
Again, please.

309
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,370
Eiei.

310
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,880
Stick out your tongue too.

311
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,050
That's enough!

312
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,660
Eiei!

313
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,740
Are you okay, mr. Khemtid?

314
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,200
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

315
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,190
This way, madam.

316
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,670
Get out!

317
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,930
Come down!

318
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,340
Go, go!

319
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,510
Hi, bro.

320
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,760
Are you done yet? I need to use the toilet.

321
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
Go other rooms.

322
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,340
- Someone inside!
- Ah, bro. I can't take it anymore.

323
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,290
Go other rooms then!

324
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,140
Bro!

325
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,350
Damn!

326
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,660
There are many rooms available.

327
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,270
What do you want?

328
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,620
You take drugs?

329
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,820
Huh?

330
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,060
Come with me.

331
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,960
Get out!

332
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,950
What the fuck?!

333
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,000
I said get out!

334
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,350
I'm going to drink! Why are you dragging me out?

335
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,510
What?!

336
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,000
Who hired you doing it?!

337
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,990
No one!

338
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,690
- I ask, who hired you?!
- I said no one!

339
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:25,970
Tell me!

340
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,470
Say it!

341
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,010
Follow him!

342
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,300
Please stop, stop it.

343
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,520
Stop recording, please.

344
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,260
Stop it.

345
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,300
Again, everyone.

346
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,730
The famous host club,

347
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,970
- Restrain him take him there.
- It's raided by the police every day.

348
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,580
- Close it.
- Hey.

349
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,630
- Take him out.
- Oh, bro!

350
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,660
(Again, everyone.)

351
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,640
(The famous host club,)

352
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,160
- (Restrain him take him there.)
- (It's raided by the police every day.)

353
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,700
(Close it. / Hey.)

354
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,020
(Take him out / Oh, bro!)

355
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,360
There is clearly someone teasing me.

356
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,190
You mean other clubs?

357
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,700
I don't think so.

358
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,580
Then... who?

359
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,300
Here.

360
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,030
Japan said that you like to eat durian french fries with red soda.

361
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,310
Really weird.

362
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,290
Not weird at all.

363
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,030
You did a great job today taking that guest out on time.

364
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,820
Otherwise, the club would have suffered for sure.

365
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,040
Seriously, things are getting better,

366
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,400
but why do these damn things have to happen again?

367
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,980
It's okay.

368
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,850
No matter how many times we fall, we can always rise again.

369
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,260
None of us are willing to give up.

370
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,570
I don't give up

371
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,000
But please give me your special support.

372
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,000
That's enough.

373
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,010
Someone might see.

374
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,520
No one is here.

375
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,970
Dai.

376
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,840
Hm? What's up?

377
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,930
If someone is breaking the golden rules,

378
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,980
That person will be fired, right?

379
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,850
Right.

380
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,960
Or did you do anything wrong?

381
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,500
Wela,

382
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,650
Will the police come here again?

383
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,940
You know what?

384
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,080
If I can't book you,

385
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,230
I won't come here.

386
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,460
I'm afraid that if they come, it won't be fun.

387
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,260
Really?

388
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,000
You're not still fun, hmm?

389
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,310
I'm having fun now.

390
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,230
I'm happy to be here.

391
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,470
I'm happy to see you too.

392
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,700
Why isn't there many guests?

393
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,230
Normally, it's not like this.

394
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,290
But it is after you come here.

395
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,130
There're a lot of strange troubles.

396
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,320
It's so quiet today.

397
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,130
Or it's jinx year of Deep Night?

398
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,000
Let's make merit together.

399
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,900
You don't have to make merit.

400
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,510
Just removing the problem itself is enough.

401
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,200
Who's the problem here?

402
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Are you mentioning to me?

403
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,150
It's not you, then who?

404
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,650
Before that, we didn't have any problems at all.

405
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,030
Until you're here.

406
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,920
What's the fuck employee?

407
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,490
Starting from a traffic assistant,

408
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,440
then PR.

409
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,270
Now, becoming a content creator.

410
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,160
Don't you think positions keep changing strange?

411
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,470
Who are you exactly?

412
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,950
I ask, just give me the answer!

413
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,280
- Calm down, bro.
- Tell me!

414
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,990
- What's wrong with you?!
- Why don't you answer me?!

415
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,780
What the fuck are you?!

416
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,990
Stop!

417
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,610
Everyone, stop.

418
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,400
Let's stop misunderstanding each other.

419
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,930
Who Khemtid is?

420
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,230
He is Madam Freya's son.

421
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,920
Khemtid?!

422
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,000
Are you her son?

423
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,740
He has to do a lot of work in many positions since he comes for the internship.

424
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,800
About being a traitor,

425
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,590
It's impossible.

426
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,550
- Dai!
- Khemtid.

427
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,550
Why do you want to keep it secret?

428
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,380
Just tell them

429
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,980
Because you don't tell them,

430
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,110
everyone misunderstands you now.

431
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,510
Got it.

432
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,690
You're her son

433
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,320
That's why you can break the rules.

434
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,800
Which rules?

435
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,000
That number 5.

436
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,360
Khemtid and Wela...

437
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,770
They're dating together.

438
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,190
Wela and Khemtid.

439
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,620
Please go to meet madam Freya right now.

440
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,400
Is there anything you want to say?

441
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,370
I'm so sorry, Madam Freya.

442
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,000
We're dating.

443
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,510
I've known it.

444
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,180
Khemtid has told me already.

445
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,870
If I know this just only me,

446
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,590
I can pretend not to know it.

447
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,330
But now,

448
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,070
Others knew about both of you.

449
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,900
So, I have to do something.

450
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,310
What do you want me to do about this, Khemtid?

451
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,840
Just cancel that 5th golden rules.

452
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,200
It's easy.

453
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,590
Actually, I want to cancel it for a long time.

454
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,660
Since I understand

455
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,980
that our feelings cannot be controlled

456
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,580
- But...
- Please don't do it, Madam.

457
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,300
If you cancel it now,

458
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,270
others might think you take side to your son too much.

459
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,730
Then everyone will negatively think about you.

460
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,850
Just follow the rules please.

461
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,760
Let me think about this a bit then what should I do.

462
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,500
Alright.

463
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,620
Go.

464
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:55,860
Just take a rest.

465
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,570
I'm sorry again.

466
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,940
You don't need to worry.

467
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,440
I won't break up with you for sure.

468
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,030
Bye.

469
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,180
Get home safely.

470
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:24,720
How am I? handsome?

471
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,000
Not bad.

472
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,640
My shirt is damn great anyway.

473
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,290
But you're a little more handsome than me.

474
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,220
Hello.

475
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,120
Why do you still come here?

476
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,570
Madam Freya didn't say anything yesterday?

477
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:45,740
Ah...

478
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,110
You're his son's boyfriend

479
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,810
She won't fire you anyway.

480
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,550
Being rich is very nice.

481
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,840
They can buy anything.

482
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,960
The right to have love can still be bought.

483
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,640
Ken, come with me.

484
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,260
What's wrong with you?

485
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,530
Why did you say to him like that?

486
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,500
You've said before

487
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,780
that among golden rules, the 5th is the most stupidest.

488
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,520
If it was it,

489
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,830
why you said it to Wela like that?

490
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,430
How bad?

491
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,310
If he's out,

492
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,470
You will be 1st host here.

493
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,740
You're stupid.

494
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,670
You want me to be 1st here... by doing like this?

495
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,220
What about if you want to be 1st someday?

496
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,200
What will you do it?

497
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,300
Flirt me...

498
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,390
And let me break the rules

499
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,250
- Then you will kick me out, right?
- Stop talking nonsense.

500
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,250
That I flirt you

501
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,420
Because I love you.

502
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,660
Why don't you believe me?

503
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,240
How can I believe you?

504
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,520
If you truly understand love,

505
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,880
you would never hurt someone else's love.

506
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,170
Hey.

507
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,820
I know you worry about Wela.

508
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:22,320
But he's fine.

509
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:23,180
He can do it.

510
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,250
Right now, you worry about the club first.

511
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:26,610
It's all messed up.

512
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:31,450
Right!

513
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,040
Or will you spend money for this solution?

514
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,970
You just let Wela resign and you're becoming his sugar daddy.

515
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,850
You're rich. You can do it.

516
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:42,880
I don't think he agrees with this.

517
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,230
He's crazy about the dignity.

518
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,760
Who can stop that stubborn cat?

519
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,390
Stubborn cat?

520
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,340
Hm, pretending to be fierce.

521
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,160
I'm sick of love-obssesed person!

522
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:09,340
Khemtid.

523
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,260
Well... I mean...

524
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,600
What happened?

525
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,460
- Sorry, you can't enter.
- Dai.

526
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,730
Er... She's my boss.

527
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,980
This way, Madam Freya.

528
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,090
What happened?

529
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,910
We would like to inspect the inside of your club.

530
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,620
It's already been inspected.

531
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,450
Let me in, please. Go.

532
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,220
- Wait!
- Get in.

533
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:28,860
Yes sir.

534
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,000
I will close the club for a big clean-up.

535
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,450
So, within these seven days, I'll give everyone a special vacation.

536
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,180
Wow, this is the garden house madam Freya told?

537
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,080
It's amazing.

538
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,440
What do you guys think?

539
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,000
Will we be able to go back to work?

540
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,870
Did you come back again?

541
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,380
The club is about to shut down like this.

542
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,570
Isn't it better to resign?

543
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,640
I think there's something she's hiding from me.

544
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,520
Something about the police.
