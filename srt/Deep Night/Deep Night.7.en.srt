00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,310
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,870
I have something to tell you, guys,

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,810
The experience of going to the white host club.

4
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,990
But once I went inside, it's very barbaric.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,190
I lost a lot of money

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,520
because I got 1st host there.

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,260
They said I can be with him all night,

8
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,270
but I sat with him just 2 hours.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,560
- Really?
- Yes!

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,820
Auntie.

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,370
Is it true that Wela is...
What does he do? How's it called?

12
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,290
- Host.
- Ah, yeah.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,940
That he services the girls at night.

14
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,090
We will organize the free event

15
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,040
to restore everyone's confidence

16
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,070
and prove to everyone that
this is indeed a white host club

17
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,730
where focused solely on entertainment
with no hidden agendas

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,310
And there's no illegal.

19
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,670
But who will come then?

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,600
People who don't understand us. I'll invite them all.

21
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,700
Let them experience of Deep Night.

22
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,690
They will know that it's not just a club.

23
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,960
But it's our work space

24
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,920
where there's dignity and it's the place
that we can make a living.

25
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,190
I promise... after finishing this event,

26
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,620
we will lie beyond than ever for sure.

27
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,760
So, you didn't work in a grocery store, right?

28
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,400
Why don't you tell me?

29
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,100
There are a lot of job that you can do.

30
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,180
Why do you need to choose this job?

31
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you.

32
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,909
I intend to do this job to pay off dad's debt.

33
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,120
and this job is profession, mom.

34
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,970
If you think like that, why don't you tell me then?

35
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,310
Today, university called to me.

36
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,680
The teacher said that they will refund your scholarship.

37
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,210
Think about it again, Wela.

38
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,220
Yo! James!

39
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,340
How was it?

40
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,220
Do you have a music for me?

41
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,050
I want to do pole dance with the new music.

42
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,880
Got it. What do you want, just tell me.

43
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,550
Tell you?

44
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,200
I think... you know my mind.

45
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,220
Hey.

46
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,020
Remember.

47
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,300
If you don't say it,

48
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,000
I won't know it.

49
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,380
Or will do order the glitter? It will be twinkling!

50
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,040
I want it feel warm like our name club.

51
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,250
Deep Night theme.

52
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,190
When people come, they will feel comforted.

53
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,310
I think this theme best represents our club's identity.

54
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,000
Here, I also prepare the references.

55
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,260
Let's take a look.

56
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,230
If we just let him start from the top of the ivory tower

57
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,920
without being overwhelmed by passion,

58
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,090
how far do you think he can accomplish that?

59
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,760
But if we let him start from small points

60
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,280
And gradually builds the bond with it

61
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,890
Until he loves it enough.

62
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,230
Then he'll ask for this club from me by himself.

63
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,210
I promise... after finishing this event,

64
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,750
we will lie beyond than ever for sure.

65
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,049
What?

66
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,280
What's wrong with you?

67
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,230
Why are you crying?

68
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,580
I just proud of you... like...

69
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,690
You've already been into Deep Night.

70
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,630
Don't cry, Dai.

71
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,810
Well.

72
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,440
I'll do my best for this event.

73
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,180
Let's do our best.

74
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,920
Let's do it.

75
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,440
Oh, my face is all messed up and not beautiful anymore.

76
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,580
I'll wipe it for you.

77
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,620
Don't cry.

78
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,220
That's fine. I can do it myself.

79
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,430
- It's okay. I'll help you, babe.
- Huh?

80
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,690
You said... 'babe'?

81
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,180
Why?

82
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,560
I just want to say it with my boyfriend.

83
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,560
You also should call yourself with the cute name.

84
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,390
Don't call yourself 'I', can you?

85
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,690
Got it.

86
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,730
Pan will try.

87
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,800
Are there many left?

88
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,360
I'll help you then.

89
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,830
It's really fine.

90
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm afraid you'll get hurt

91
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,480
and cannot perform on stage.

92
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,030
Are you worried?

93
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,180
If you're, come to have dinner with me.

94
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,460
Okay?

95
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,550
Oh?

96
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,580
Don't want to eat dinner,

97
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,660
But I want to eat you.

98
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,030
You're so cute.

99
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,670
What did you do?

100
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,850
I just helped Japan carry the box,
but it didn't hurt much.

101
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,920
Why don't you take care of yourself?
It's almost the event day.

102
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,930
If you get hurt, what will you do?

103
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,280
How can you not let me help him?

104
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,230
Because he is...

105
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,000
He's my boyfriend.

106
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,990
There is you in my all memories.

107
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,750
You have to take responsibility with this, Ken.

108
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,240
Be friend with me forever, shall you?

109
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,550
Congrats.

110
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,120
There are a lot of job that you can do.

111
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,250
Why do you need to choose this job?

112
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,420
Today, university called to me.

113
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,560
The teacher said that they will refund your scholarship.

114
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,390
Think about it again, Wela.

115
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,150
If you come up, tell me. I don't want you to get hurt.

116
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,150
I won't stop you. I know you can do it.

117
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,790
And don't overdo it. Take a break. Okay?

118
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,580
Is there anything I should know?

119
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,800
Mom already knows about my job.

120
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,800
She doesn't agree with this.

121
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,150
Also, the university will refund my scholarship.

122
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,070
I intend to do this club better again..

123
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,220
Everyone will understand you.

124
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,520
No one will.

125
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,960
Our society is always like this.

126
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,420
We can do it.

127
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,000
Trust me.

128
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,910
I love you so much.

129
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,190
I'll do my best.

130
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,930
(Because I got 1st host there.)

131
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,280
(They said I can be with him all night,)

132
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
(but I sat with him just 2 hours.)

133
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,720
How long?

134
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,510
Since yesterday.

135
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,490
You've been stressed out this whole time?

136
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,510
I'm sorry that I didn't know anything at all.

137
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,390
I should've known sooner.

138
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,040
But you're not wrong, you know?

139
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,400
Others just don't know that how much awesome you are.

140
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,040
But I know it.

141
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,829
And I love all of your side.

142
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,970
Whether you're a nerd,

143
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,170
or 1st host,

144
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,920
I love you all.

145
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,800
And I think our friends think like me as well.

146
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,920
Don't forget it.

147
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,440
You're not alone.

148
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,840
I'm here.

149
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,250
If something like this happened again,

150
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,200
Tell me as well. Okay?

151
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,680
Yes.

152
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,710
Thank you.

153
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,260
(Because I got 1st host there.)

154
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,740
(They said I can be with him all night,)

155
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,040
(but I sat with him just 2 hours.)

156
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,490
(I just knew that the traffic assistant is actually the owner' son of this club. )

157
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,270
(Also, he acted badly to me.)

158
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,000
(Like throwing my phone into the water.)

159
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,610
(Luckily, I backed up all the data in the iCloud)

160
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,530
(It's no surprise that the police
are coming to inspect every day.)

161
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,600
(Who wants to go, please go.)

162
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,780
(But for me, I don't want to go even though it's free.)

163
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,530
Khemtid.

164
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,750
Please come in.

165
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,610
What brings you here?

166
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,170
I'll talk to you straightforwardly, teacher.

167
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,150
I'd like you to reconsider Wela's scholarship.

168
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,690
Khemtid.

169
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,000
Do you know that actually...

170
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,450
You're targeted by university as well.

171
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,910
But the university can't convict you.

172
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,360
Because it's your family business.
You may not be involved.

173
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,450
But Wela's... working there, getting paid there,
it's hard to avoid.

174
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,270
- You have to understand.
- So what, teacher?

175
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,450
It's just a service job, nothing more.

176
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,690
How do you know?

177
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,510
You can say anything,

178
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,720
but whether people believe it or not,
that's another matter.

179
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:33,570
Now, just people know that Wela works as a host,
it doesn't look good.

180
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,460
Because of that, we have to change people's perspectives in society.

181
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,870
If you have time... please come.

182
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,690
Thank you, teacher.

183
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,830
Everyone! The club will be opening soon.
Boost energy, boys!

184
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,100
Sorry? Do we have more balls?
I think we can add more here.

185
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,600
I think the backdrop can be shifted
to the right a bit more.

186
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,790
Okay, that's enough.

187
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,910
How's it going, Khemtid?

188
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,010
It's already done.

189
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,030
It looks so beautiful.

190
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,010
Of course, I did it.

191
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,320
Are you tired?

192
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,200
Not at all.

193
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Then let's eat some foods together.

194
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,100
Are you hungry?

195
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:18,930
A bit.

196
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,760
Wow, what's all this?

197
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,010
I can't choose.

198
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,270
Wow, this picture is so cute, Madam Freya.

199
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,630
Well, I took this myself.

200
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,030
Pretty, right?

201
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,570
If this were a series,
you two would definitely be a couple.

202
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,260
Come on! We're not like that. I'm already old.

203
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,810
Excuse me.

204
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,840
But you two are still beautiful.

205
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,240
You're so cute, Japan. Eat up, okay?

206
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,850
Sure!

207
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,170
Let's go see, Madam. I'll handle here.

208
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,860
Dig in! I'm hungry too. What do we have here?

209
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,810
What's this? Well, it's beautiful anyway.

210
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,640
Coming out here, are you already full?

211
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,310
There's a lot.

212
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,030
Pan might not finish it in time.

213
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,400
If there's a lot, let me help.
So, what's the point of having a boyfriend?

214
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,730
I don't want it.

215
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,300
You might get hurt again.

216
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,730
Fine. I'll let you help me then

217
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,980
But you have to go back and eat
until you're full first, so you'll have energy.

218
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,650
Okay?

219
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,240
Okay.

220
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,560
But eating you, I also have energy too.

221
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,650
You're so adorable. Pan's unexpected.

222
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,530
Just only a few that I'm adorable to.

223
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,560
Er... I think you guys don't be full yet.

224
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,470
But I guess... you're probably full.

225
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,050
Hey, look at Japan. He's blushing.

226
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,270
His cheeks are about to burst from smiling.

227
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,430
Hey, what's going on? Tell me, man.

228
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,240
So, you guys have dated
since we're at Madam's house?

229
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,000
Did it so quiet, huh?

230
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,650
I didn't. Say it carefully.

231
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,100
I didn't mean it like that, man.

232
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,000
And what about Ken?

233
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,060
Doesn't he like Seiji too?

234
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,670
That's fine. If he's happy, I'm happy too.

235
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,000
Hey, Japan, taking care of him for me then.

236
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,780
Me too, Seiji.

237
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,000
Even though he's a bit clumsy, please bear with him.

238
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,600
I can do it for my lifetime.

239
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,670
That's enough, you jerk. Let's work, man.

240
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,700
What's wrong?

241
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,970
Just got a boyfriend,

242
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,450
But look at your face.

243
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,070
Oh, come on.

244
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,760
I have something to think too.

245
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,210
Seiji has already chosen you.
Why are you still overthinking?

246
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,400
But well...

247
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,820
If you're so concerned...
why don't you choose 3P then?

248
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,660
Don't you know 3P?

249
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,310
Little kid.

250
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,160
Wait, I'll show you.

251
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,890
Damn it.

252
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,700
I don't want it. I can't take it anymore.

253
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,310
Up to you. I'm out.

254
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,420
Yes!

255
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,180
What's wrong?

256
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,900
Tired?

257
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,770
Can I ask something?

258
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,160
What are we now?

259
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
We're friend.

260
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,870
Best friends.

261
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,530
Can  friends kiss each other?

262
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,489
Meiji.

263
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,270
At our age, what can we be?

264
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,580
It's not the age for us to go
telling everyone we're together.

265
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,030
That's all it is, right?

266
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,880
I don't know... if one day, Khemtid knows it,
will he be okay with it?

267
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,080
Or will others okay with it?

268
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,040
Now is good, isn't it?

269
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,350
Do you know?

270
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,630
That you said... there's no me in there.

271
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,220
I've probably been the only one thinking about it.

272
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,500
Here.

273
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,430
Banana milk.

274
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,680
Thanks.

275
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,620
Messy always.

276
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,630
Gotta go practice again?

277
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,850
I don't waste the time.

278
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,500
I get used to it.

279
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:53,690
Well...

280
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,920
Can you teach me?

281
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,390
Please.

282
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,150
Please teach me.

283
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,360
Well, fine.

284
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,630
Let's start with the warm-up first.

285
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,050
Okay.

286
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,830
Stretch your feet forward.

287
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,600
Like this?

288
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,480
- Can't take it?
- It hurts.

289
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,960
Reached it already.

290
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,530
Good job.

291
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,050
You're really good.

292
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,300
I got a good teacher.

293
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,200
Well, I'll go practice some more then.

294
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,340
More again?

295
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,840
Yes.

296
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,400
Take a break.

297
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,340
I do care about you.

298
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,350
Got it. I'll take a break.

299
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,220
Don't forget...

300
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,740
I'm still here by your side.

301
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:06,880
Here.

302
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,520
Smell good.

303
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Don't forget to get something to eat
when you're done. Understand?

304
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,670
Yes.

305
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,240
But if you forget... I'll find something for you.

306
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,220
Let's eat together.

307
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:55,960
How's that?

308
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,310
Madam Freya.

309
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,140
What're you doing? Why are you still here?

310
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,730
Just checking.

311
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,060
Right.

312
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,040
With Wela, is it going well?

313
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,230
It's good.

314
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,250
Actually, it's really good.

315
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,080
You love hime more than me, I guess.

316
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,290
It's not the same, madam.

317
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,340
It's different love.

318
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,600
Do you have someone?

319
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,960
Someone whom you love as much as me.

320
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,120
Do you?

321
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,650
Let's say...

322
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,910
If I have a friend who is old,

323
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:21,070
do you think she can start a new relationship?

324
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,280
Why not?

325
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,210
If... it's the same sex?

326
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,330
What do you think?

327
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,730
It's not weird.

328
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,020
My crush is a boy too.

329
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,660
It's true.

330
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,440
If you want to love someone, just love.

331
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,110
At this age, it doesn't matter.

332
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,260
I want to see you happy too.

333
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,750
Oh, it's just a hypothetical.
What are you thinking?

334
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,070
- Sure?
- Sure!

335
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,620
Well, it's the hypothetical.

336
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,780
I'll take my boyfriend home then.

337
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,660
He's too tired.

338
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,670
- Go. Take care of him.
- Okay.

339
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,800
I always do it great.

340
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,200
Are you okay?

341
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,120
You've already known, right, Khemtid?

342
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,100
It's my mom's club.

343
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,700
I apologize for not telling you earlier.

344
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,500
I'm sorry.

345
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,000
Then, I'm sorry too that
I need to tell you straightforward.

346
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,110
I don't want Wela do this job.

347
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,570
I'm worried about him.

348
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,210
I want him to do a normal job like others.

349
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:07,570
Do you know?

350
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,950
Wela is the top 1 of host in our club.

351
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,730
He's diligent, determined,

352
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,410
and work hard too.

353
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,480
Like I've said before, every customer likes him.

354
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,540
I'm telling the truth. I'm not lying.

355
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:32,080
I want you to be proud of him,
just like we're proud of him.

356
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,420
But maybe you can't picture it.

357
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,280
If you have time,

358
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,000
I invite you to go to our club.

359
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,240
You must come, please.

360
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,410
Thank you for inviting my mom.

361
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,730
Is it okay?

362
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,110
I'm sorry that I didn't ask you first.

363
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,440
I want your mom to see you with her own eyes.

364
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,370
I feel the same way,

365
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,400
but I just didn't know how to invite her.

366
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,530
Thank you again.

367
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,120
Let's go!

368
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,620
Keep fighting!

369
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,200
Go!

370
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:25,750
fighting!

371
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,390
Get home safely.

372
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,040
See you.

373
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,370
I gotta go.

374
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,870
- See you.
- Text me when you got home.
