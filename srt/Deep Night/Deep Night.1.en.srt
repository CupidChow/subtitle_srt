1
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,400
- Wow. This is amazing, Miss Freya.
- Thank you.

2
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,620
But, what is the show called?

3
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,860
It's called "Aerial Silk".

4
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,650
Actually, there are many equipment to use.

5
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,329
Including, silk

6
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,560
And hoop

7
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,030
- And straps.
- I see

8
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,800
Is this the show you've told everyone

9
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,340
That it's exclusive only at Deep Night Club?

10
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,400
LIVE: Unstoppable Influence After Opening of the Host Club
- Yes.

11
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,870
I'd say that at Deep Night Club, there are aerial shows every Friday night.

12
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,300
There are aerial-pole show,

13
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,680
Aerial-straps show,

14
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,380
And body balance too.

15
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,560
Once you come to our club, you'll be impressed for sure.

16
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,240
But I start to be confused.

17
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,400
At first, I thought that this place was like

18
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,000
An ordinary host club, isn't it?

19
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,440
It's both similar and not similar.

20
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,540
It's an ordinary host club, but

21
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,529
I want to make it to be an entertaining club as well.

22
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,280
I want everyone who comes here get the best service.

23
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
And great experiences back.

24
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,810
I want them to be the most impressed.

25
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,610
Actually, there are many equipment to use.

26
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,960
Including, hammoch,

27
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,220
Hoop,

28
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,210
And straps.

29
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,530
Damn.

30
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,600
Is this the host club?

31
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,250
Khemtid.

32
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,200
This is cookie.

33
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
I made it by myself.

34
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,410
Can you try it for me?

35
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,050
Try it?

36
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,510
Let's me try it when it's delicious.

37
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,690
This is the last box.

38
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,040
I took it from Engineer boys.

39
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,680
Good that you didn't get screw by them.

40
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,550
Oh

41
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,780
You're so good, Japan

42
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,600
Who the hell eating Durian French fries with red soda?

43
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,760
Is that delicious?

44
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,050
Can I try it?

45
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,520
Let me try it.

46
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,460
Please.

47
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,540
Let me try it.

48
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,720
No.

49
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,500
You just cursed on me.

50
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,200
The past is just the past. So, let's me try it.

51
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Khemtid, let me try it.

52
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,840
No.

53
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,100
Let me try it.

54
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,780
No.

55
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,960
- I bought it for you.
- No.

56
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,440
Just one piece.

57
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,400
Just one.

58
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,940
Nope.

59
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,520
Don't be stingy.

60
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,560
Please me then.

61
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,100
No.

62
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,460
Shit!

63
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,940
Wela.

64
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,830
Thanks for a snack.

65
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
And thanks for making a loud noise.

66
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,180
Even though, I didn't ask for it.

67
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,200
(If you want to lay low, go to this place.)

68
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,290
(Tham Luang National Park, Khun Nam Nang Non)

69
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,560
You like this, don't you?

70
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,180
The peaceful place.

71
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,880
All students in the Faculty of Business Administration, attention please.

72
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,840
When you are on expressway,

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Has anyone noticed the billboard advertisements on the expressway?

74
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,960
Which advertisement is the most abundant?

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,580
Alcohol.

76
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,560
Are you the alcohalic?

77
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,880
Do you know that

78
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,200
The billboard advertisements on the expressway

79
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,280
Are the best indicator.

80
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,960
To show us which business is at its the glorious days

81
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,040
Or which business

82
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,360
Has the high rate competition.

83
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,390
Who often go to the bar?

84
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,919
I know that you like to go there.

85
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,020
Alright.

86
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,100
As the students of the Faculty of Business Administration.

87
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,600
Who

88
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,320
Want to invest in the business about bar and club.

89
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,120
Garnwela.

90
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,440
Why you want to invest in the business about bar and club?

91
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,360
Even though

92
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,440
You know that there is the high rate competition

93
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,960
And it's the red ocean business.

94
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,600
I think that the bar and club business are still an interesting business, Professor.

95
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,960
Because they have received support from the government sector.

96
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,770
The opening hours are extended until 4 AM.

97
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,920
And they also support local liquor.

98
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,360
So, I think there is a chance to grow up in this business.

99
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,480
And based on

100
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,000
Consumer statistics in our country,

101
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,640
There is a high tendency of increasing demand for alcohol beverages.

102
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,600
About 2-4% per year.

103
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,160
67% of them tend to drink alcohol outside their house.

104
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,480
Around 8 PM-11 PM.

105
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,320
And another 50 like to drink around 11 PM-2 AM.

106
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,610
So, I think It's a proper number in doing business.

107
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,640
Give your friend a round of applause.

108
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,480
You're so good Garnwela.

109
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,720
I know that you're smart and you always pay attention to the class.

110
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,240
But I don't know that you are interesting in this kind of stuff.

111
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,040
Thank you, Professor.

112
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,800
Khemtid.

113
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,160
What's up?

114
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,950
But for me, I don't think it is an interested business.

115
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,960
Because the customers has high bargain power over us.

116
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,000
The presence of numerous service providers for the same product

117
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,680
Generates many alternatives for customers to choose.

118
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,820
And also diminishes their brand loyalty.

119
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,710
For an example,

120
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,760
When there is a new bar in town,

121
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,850
Is there anybody here

122
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,230
That always go to the same place?

123
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,440
No, right?

124
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,330
And if he's going to refer to statistical figures

125
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,520
Of consuming liquor statistic.

126
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,480
The increase of the rate is just 0-3% per year.

127
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,040
It's not that much.

128
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,280
Because producers are increasingly focusing on producing premium liquor.

129
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,360
This leads to limitations in consumption.

130
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,360
Give your friends hand clap.

131
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,680
Actually, if we need the customer to be brand loyalty.

132
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,960
So, we can solve by Set the key activity

133
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,560
And key proposition.

134
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,120
To find the unique selling point

135
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
In our business to be different from competitors.

136
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,080
But in this situation...

137
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
Enough.

138
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,680
Give your friends hand clap.

139
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,600
Both of you are so good.

140
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,940
Your ideas are so creative.

141
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,360
So,

142
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,750
I will give you guys

143
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,120
Bring this topic to do an assignment

144
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,360
With paper based and send me.

145
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,360
In the next class.

146
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,780
And we will have a discussion.

147
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
And the time's up, Thank you all

148
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,560
I know that you fucked with him.

149
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,780
Fucked what?

150
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,230
You are asking me?

151
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,480
You like to fuck with Wela.

152
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,640
Like when the boys like to tease his crush.

153
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,640
You are so funny.

154
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,280
(Why don't you pick up my phone call? I'll go to your mom's club.)

155
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,800
(I don't see any good thing in your mom's club. I don't understand why your mom opens a club of shame like this.

156
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,600
Why don't you pick up the phone call?

157
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,870
If I graduated,

158
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,630
I will be gone.

159
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,470
Hear me out buddy.

160
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,660
They will find you in everywhere you go.

161
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,600
Can you please drag the cloths rack smoothly?

162
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,100
Make it smooth.

163
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,980
It looks ugly.

164
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,410
It looks like shit.

165
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,410
Go.

166
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,390
What did he send to me?

167
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,660
Hurry up.

168
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,630
Where is another cloths rack?

169
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,500
Why there is less cloths?

170
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,620
Is it complete yet?

171
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,520
The shop told me that there are 2 left.

172
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,160
Tomorrow, the shop will deliver it to the club, Lucy.

173
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,560
Okayyyy.

174
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,010
Tomorrow, I will stand by at the club, waiting for  the delivery.

175
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,800
If your shop doesn't deliver it to the club,

176
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,520
I will leave my club and act madly at you at the shop.

177
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,360
Understand?

178
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,560
Why you're still standing? Just go!

179
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,470
I'm tired.

180
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,090
You're smiling big.

181
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,520
Come here.

182
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,450
Yes.

183
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,740
The cloths are arrived?

184
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,480
Yes.

185
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,560
But still not complete yet. There are 2 cloths left.

186
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,580
I will catch up with them.

187
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,190
You will go again tonight?

188
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,570
I have to go. It's my club.

189
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
You don't go just one night, it doesn't make you club disappear.

190
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,730
You go the club for checking. Checking the club or checking what?

191
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,000
There are a lot of kind of the men.

192
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,360
Can you trust them?

193
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,440
Khem.

194
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,740
I'm your mother.

195
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,480
And I remember that I have never taught you to talk to the others like this.

196
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,840
Do not talk like this again, okay?

197
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,150
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,950
I didn't mean to talk like this.
I just don't want you to work at night.

199
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,290
It's not safe.

200
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,780
Why is it not safe?

201
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,400
There are a lot of people taking care of me.

202
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,390
And the employees at the club, they are so put in into their work.

203
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,480
If they heard you, how sad they will be? Understand?

204
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:10,900
And

205
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,920
In the future, this club will be yours anyway.

206
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,880
No.

207
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,160
If you give it to me

208
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,600
I will turn it into the Mu Kratha restaurant.

209
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,850
Well, Khemtid.

210
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,440
Why do you tease your mom like that?

211
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,200
I told you I promise

212
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,920
With the scout honor.

213
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,040
If someone does something to your mom,

214
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,240
I will ruin them.

215
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,280
Hi there.

216
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,760
How does my outfit look today?

217
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,800
Pretty, girl!

218
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,600
What's about mine?

219
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,720
Sooooo... Gorgeous!

220
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,420
Slay!

221
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,980
Let's go!

222
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,760
Go!

223
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:01,910
Wait.

224
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,360
Do you come here too?

225
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,800
What's about...

226
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,290
Your mother?

227
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,530
No need.

228
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,080
I can take you inside by myself.

229
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,640
Taking care of customers are the most important, you know?

230
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,600
They paid us a lot. It's not a little money.

231
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,250
Never mind. Go, Let's do our work...

232
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,240
Gosh! Khemtid!

233
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,820
Lower your voice!

234
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,600
Has anyone known me?

235
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,620
No.

236
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,400
Don't tell anyone then.

237
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,300
What?

238
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,680
Then why you come here?

239
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,880
It's because of Aunt Sroi-Nang.

240
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,760
Aunt Sroi-Nang...

241
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,520
Don't know why she came here.

242
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,400
She looks down on everywhere and everyone.

243
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,040
Oh my.

244
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
Since the front of the club to customers.

245
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,160
Gosh!

246
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,790
Where is she now?

247
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,340
There.

248
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,640
In the toilet.

249
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,560
Well.

250
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,560
Khemtid.

251
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,319
You wait me here for a moment.

252
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,020
Alright?

253
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,319
Right Here. Don't move to anywhere.

254
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,280
I'll be back.

255
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,520
I must do my duty on the stage now.

256
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,260
Okay?

257
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,160
Keep waiting me here.

258
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,230
Don't go anywhere.

259
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,680
Hello Hello, welcome.

260
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,360
Welcome to...

261
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,680
Deep Night Club

262
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,200
Where makes you not be able to sleep all night.

263
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,040
And of course for Friday Night,

264
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,590
We have a very special show by our top of the club.

265
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,830
And they are ready now.

266
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,440
Please welcome everyone to meet with...

267
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,920
Deep Night Party.

268
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200
Let's go!

269
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,560
Hey.

270
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,110
I thought you should...

271
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,680
go back to the main house. It's gonna be better.

272
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,000
Better?

273
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,250
Yes.

274
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,000
If you go back,

275
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,970
I'll give you everything.

276
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,880
What do you want?

277
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,080
A car or a condominium.

278
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,250
Think about it.

279
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,530
It's not just like you chose to live with your mom. And that's it.

280
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,930
Because no matter what,

281
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,970
You're still the Ritpreecha.

282
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,120
I won't let you live in disgusting place like this.

283
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:17,970
Disgusting?

284
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,360
If it's that disgusting, just scream.

285
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,960
Scream.

286
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,520
No matter what, I'll stay here anyway.

287
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,920
If you can't stand this,

288
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,480
you should find yourself a husband and make your own baby.

289
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,480
Khemtid!

290
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,040
Mark my word.

291
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,640
Dirty money from dirty bar of dirty woman like this,

292
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,600
She can't raise you well.

293
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,160
One day,

294
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,790
You need to go back and live with me.

295
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
But not today.

296
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:44,920
Bye.

297
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,680
Is that the same person?

298
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,840
Do you fall asleep?

299
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,720
You seems not sleep enough.

300
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,900
A professor want us to find a pair for pair work.

301
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:12,780
You pair with me.

302
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,820
Do you have a pair?

303
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,020
You don't answer my question.

304
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,680
I have to pay you first?

305
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,650
To talk to me.

306
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,160
Done yet?

307
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,680
Done.

308
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,360
Thanks for last night.

309
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,180
Why you have to keep in touch with that family?

310
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,130
You should block them.

311
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,680
They drive me crazy.

312
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,190
Come on.

313
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,560
They're still your family.

314
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,680
Family?

315
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,540
I don't count.

316
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,600
They are so rude.

317
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,160
No manner.

318
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,200
They thought that they're in higher class than us.

319
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,280
Even though dad married with Fre,

320
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,160
They still have no respect to Fre.

321
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,000
Why Fre have to endure with them?

322
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,080
It has to endure, Khem.

323
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,320
Think about it, Khem.

324
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,170
If you are in a trouble, you have to let them help you

325
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,200
And depend on them.

326
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,080
If I stop keeping in touch with them, what can you do?

327
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,630
It's fine.

328
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
I used to it.

329
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,940
You're always being like this.

330
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,460
You went to a bar. How was it?

331
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,540
I really want to give to this bar.

332
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,080
What about

333
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,720
You intern here first.

334
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,980
Maybe you will like this bar one day.

335
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,550
I'll try it again.

336
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,980
Good.

337
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,830
You guys. You guys.

338
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,230
You need to hear this interested news.

339
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,830
Today,

340
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,580
We have a newbie here.

341
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,360
How is that interested?

342
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,900
People come and go everyday.

343
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,830
But you're still not quit yet.

344
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,210
I don't quit.

345
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
If I quit, I have nothing.

346
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,200
But believe me.

347
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,730
The new one is so handsome.

348
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,490
I don't know what position that he works.

349
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,090
If he's that handsome, he probably works as a host.

350
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,840
James

351
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,640
You need to hit your mouth.

352
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,760
He can be anything but host.

353
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,660
Why?

354
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,000
If he's a host,

355
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,040
you, you, you and I

356
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,790
Definitely lose our jobs.

357
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,040
It's the fact.

358
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,780
His skin

359
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,000
is tan like Weir.

360
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,990
His eyes are sharp like Pope.

361
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,560
And his smile

362
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,920
is precious like Mario.

363
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,660
Mario?

364
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,380
Yeah.

365
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,940
I want to meet him.

366
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,080
You are over acting.

367
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,720
I tell you the truth. He is so handsome...

368
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,380
Hi

369
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,450
Hi

370
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,200
Wela

371
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,130
Did you see that newbie when you walked in?

372
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,120
The handsome one.

373
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,630
I don't know. I didn't look.

374
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,120
Okay Okay.

375
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,050
That is just the way it is.

376
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,540
Why does Wela have to care about him.

377
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,740
He's still the number 1 here.

378
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
The rank can always change, bro.

379
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,120
How did you get in here?

380
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,330
You work here?

381
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,230
This is a private area.

382
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,720
If you're not out, I will report to a guard.

383
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,560
Report to a guard?

384
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,400
If you report to a guard,

385
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,290
I can also report to the university too.

386
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,530
About what you work here.

387
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,750
Up to you.

388
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,550
I do nothing wrong.

389
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,200
Really?

390
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,610
Okay.

391
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,920
Go ahead.

392
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,180
If you tell everyone about this,

393
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,440
They will know that you hang out in a place like this.

394
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,760
What do you like?

395
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,230
I can recommend you.

396
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:22,850
How about that?

397
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,000
Sorry.

398
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,710
I didn't come here to hang out.

399
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,520
But I work here.

400
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,810
Alright.

401
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,190
I'm going to introduce you our new one.

402
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,270
Khemtid.

403
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,070
This is the first day that he works here.

404
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,780
This is DJ James.

405
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,340
Great

406
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,930
Ken

407
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,410
Seiji

408
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,900
And Wela.

409
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,520
Everyone is the senior hosts of this bar.

410
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,940
If you have something,

411
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,480
you can consult with them.

412
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,410
And the position that Khemtid works for our bar,

413
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,860
it's the important position.

414
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,700
It's the first barrier that meet the customers.

415
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,100
It is...

416
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,060
Right here.

417
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,640
Park here, please.

418
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,400
That's right.

419
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,890
Over here.

420
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,290
Park here.

421
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:52,670
Hey.

422
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,430
Car is not allowed to park here.

423
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:56,590
What?

424
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,520
Then, where?

425
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,500
The parking is there.

426
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,380
There.

427
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,000
That side.

428
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,910
So, park there.

429
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,850
Alright, park there.

430
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,260
Let's go.

431
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,600
Go, please.

432
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,330
Let's go.

433
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,540
Park there.

434
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,970
Is that true?

435
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,780
Handsome like that, but traffic assistant?

436
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,600
Hey!

437
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,990
What?

438
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,080
Or is it our club's concept?

439
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,080
Every employee must be handsome.

440
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,120
Will he make it?

441
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,000
Look at him.

442
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,280
Don't pay too much attention to him.

443
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,780
He's just here for fun.

444
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,320
He probably won't show up tomorrow.

445
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,050
Do you know him?

446
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,570
Wait.

447
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,290
What's wrong with him?

448
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,350
That's it.

449
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,010
Is it weird?

450
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,100
Here.

451
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,330
Madam Freya.

452
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,570
Isn't it too much?

453
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,320
Like this is good enough.

454
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,110
If we let him start from the top

455
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,090
Without being overwhelmed by it,

456
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,050
how much do you think he can accomplish?

457
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,760
But if we let him start from small points

458
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,290
And gradually build up the connection

459
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,090
Until he loves it enough.

460
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,320
Then he'll ask for this club from me by himself.

461
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,190
Oh, this is your plan.

462
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,870
But I think...

463
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,380
Before he loves it,

464
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,870
You might have him go find a physical therapist.

465
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,180
Then give him massage vouchers as benefits.

466
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,180
Massage vouchers...

467
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,140
Oh my!

468
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,680
I want them too!

469
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,040
Come work!

470
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,180
Oh, I want it! I want it too!

471
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,560
Ouch...

472
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,220
Hey.

473
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,490
What did you do last night. You look sleepy.

474
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,640
Just played football.

475
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,900
All night.

476
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,000
For real.

477
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,160
Football?

478
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,080
Right.

479
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,000
All night?

480
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,620
For what?

481
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,640
Ouch...

482
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,410
Let's watch the table then.

483
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,520
I'll go to toilet.

484
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,210
Hey.

485
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,210
Don't talk with me?

486
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,820
Be careful, others might know about last night.

487
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,880
I go to work.

488
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,000
Not for fun.

489
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,389
Do whatever you want,

490
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,960
But don't mess me.

491
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,660
Hey.

492
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,970
Why are you standing here?

493
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,570
Aren't you sleepy?

494
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm sleepy.

495
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,980
Better go to sleep.

496
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,410
You spray that perfume again.

497
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,320
- I just...
- How many times today?

498
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,160
I have to smell good all the time.

499
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:52,920
Wela...

500
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,770
Do you spray so much like him?

501
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,670
He's spraying all day long.

502
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,390
I have to keep charming all the time.

503
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,650
I'm not you, man.

504
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,190
You can chill. You're already handsome, you know?

505
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,490
(5 Golden Rules of the Deep Night Club)

506
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,260
(Rule 5: Employees are prohibited from being lovers)

507
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,460
Employees are prohibited from being lovers.

508
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,320
What?

509
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,380
Oh damn.

510
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,020
That traffic assistant.

511
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,530
You're here for work?

512
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,180
Of course.

513
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,050
I'm the one working.

514
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,420
Not here for fun.

515
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:27,960
Cool.

516
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,170
Yes, cool.

517
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,350
Need any help, let me know.

518
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,290
Hey, bro.

519
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,700
These gloden rules...

520
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,290
About that rule number 5.

521
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,290
What's that?

522
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,290
Well, we're not allowed to date each other.

523
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,470
Why not allowed?

524
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,500
That they don't allow, it's right.

525
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,040
Trust me...

526
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,200
Don't date anyone here.

527
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,690
But I want to date you.

528
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,210
So, let's go.

529
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,040
Let's shower with me.

530
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:05,650
Hey!

531
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,640
Are you serious?

532
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm serious, man.

533
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,760
Wait up!

534
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,120
That's enough.

535
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,900
Ouch!

536
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,540
Sorry, really sorry.

537
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,660
Are you injured anywhere?

538
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,760
Oh gosh! My shoes!

539
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,080
This sucks.

540
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,720
You know, how much are my shoes? Do you have the wisdom to pay it back?

541
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,320
You just tell me how much is it.

542
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,940
I'll pay back to you.

543
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,340
Hm... using a new phone, huh?

544
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,680
I don't know if someone stole it or not.

545
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,640
Laborers!

546
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,890
Excuse me.

547
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,700
Is there any problem?

548
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,030
Are the shoes broken?

549
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,620
So...

550
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,510
I'll keep it for now.

551
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,490
Is there any injury?

552
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,480
Hurt...

553
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,300
It hurts here.

554
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,220
It's not too bad, right?

555
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,630
Anyway, I have to apologize again.

556
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,500
We'll take care of the shoe issue.

557
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,310
And don't worry that won't be less fun tonight.

558
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,160
I'll personally take care of you.

559
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,800
Alright, but...

560
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,580
The drinks fee... what about it?

561
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,620
The table opening fee, the club will handle it.

562
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,240
Oops!

563
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,150
Then let's go.

564
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,920
Let's go.

565
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,260
Smells like sweat.

566
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,560
What the hell?

567
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,100
Hey.

568
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:16,870
Khemtid.

569
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,790
Where are you going?

570
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,220
Toilet!

571
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,390
Go to the back of the club.

572
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,360
It's less crowded there.

573
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,910
I'll go inside.

574
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,930
What?

575
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,030
Up to you then.

576
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,320
Wherever you go, you go.

577
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,710
So damn dogged.

578
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,000
I don't wonder why you cannot be a host.

579
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,720
Hey.

580
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,090
Are you Ken, right?

581
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,520
Is there still going out with customers?

582
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,390
You mean Wela?

583
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,180
He didn't do it.

584
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,900
He gets paid a lot for a night.

585
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:51,970
No reason for him to go out.

586
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,370
It'll lose the balance.

587
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,730
Be careful to lose it by himself one day.

588
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,200
Walk carefully, Noeyhom.

589
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,260
Watch your step.

590
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,280
Sit here first, Noeyhom

591
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,940
Ummm. I don't want to go home.

592
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,180
Can I have your contact, Wela?

593
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,300
You want to leave now?

594
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,940
What.

595
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,160
He doesn't get fire yet?

596
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,390
Firing thing is for the club's owner only.

597
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,150
Not about the customer that didn't pay anything.

598
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,560
I pay nothing but I can walk in.

599
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,560
Not just being a stinky traffic assistant in here.

600
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:43,960
Have you ever taken a shower?

601
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,190
Ew. Stinky. Ew.

602
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,390
Before you leave, don't forget to check your car.

603
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,030
Goodbye.

604
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,620
- Let's go
- Why?

605
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,620
Go

606
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,800
What did you do to my car?

607
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,480
You stinky!

608
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,580
Why my car has a flat tire!

609
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,030
What did you do to my car?

610
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,960
That. Your car is arrived.

611
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,120
I'll make you pay for this.

612
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,250
Why do you come back?

613
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,850
The bar will lose the customer.

614
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,340
The bar needs to choose the customer.

615
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,040
You talk like you own this bar.

616
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,430
What about today's bill? Who will pay?

617
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,170
Don't worry.

618
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,950
I give a tip too.

619
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,190
How about that?

620
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,720
I target it since I do traffic assistant job.

621
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,320
Delicious?

622
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:11,980
Yes.

623
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,190
You look like a different person from the university.

624
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,690
You Look.

625
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,490
So sexy.

626
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,970
Moreover, you know the bar's golden rules,

627
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,280
You need to know my golden rule too.

628
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,760
I have only one golden rule.

629
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,250
I don't do things for free. I need to get a payback.

630
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,120
Okay.

631
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,330
About what I intimidated you in the afternoon,

632
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,600
I'm sorry.

633
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,690
I just want to tease you.

634
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,930
But I forget that you don't like it.

635
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,530
I'm sorry too.

636
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,940
About the thing I said that you just come here to fuck around.

637
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,560
You're serious about it more than I thought.

638
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,480
Not like when you are in the university.

639
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,770
If you want to know that I'm the same or not,

640
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,990
You have to look closer.

641
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,000
Why are you blushing?

642
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,710
Or you're just good when you get a payback?

643
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,360
Huh? Wela.

644
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,110
Khemtid.

645
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,280
You come?

646
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,650
You are here.

647
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,540
Bring more table. I will buy you meal.

648
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,630
Ken, help me carry the table.

649
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,170
Hey Seiji, you take chairs there.

650
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,440
Go Go Go Go

651
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,310
Come Come Come Come

652
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,440
You.

653
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,150
Hey You.

654
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,590
You.

655
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,310
Hey you.

656
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,430
We arrived.

657
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,520
Arrived?

658
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,670
Where are we?

659
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,670
Deep Night Club.

660
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,240
The place that you told me.

661
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:51,930
No.

662
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,000
I told you to go to Danai alley.

663
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,670
You heard it wrong.

664
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,320
What.

665
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,330
I have driven for long time.

666
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:04,730
And you tell me that it's wrong?

667
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,200
Great.

668
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,640
You just forget your phone.

669
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,410
We all have to get in with you?

670
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,180
I'm scared of ghost.

671
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,860
I'm already hungry.

672
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,740
Just walk.

673
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,390
I'm about to eat.

674
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,880
Next time, I'll buy you, okay?

675
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,960
It's Khemtid and Wela.

676
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,090
Don't forget about our deal.

677
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,980
At the university, don't say hi to me, if it's not necessary.

678
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,550
We just live separate lives as always.

679
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:41,490
Understand?

680
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,120
Why do I have to do this?

681
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,070
I will get any payback?

682
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:57,570
What do you want?

683
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,110
I want you to kiss at my cheek.

684
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,650
Kiss it.

685
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,040
You're lame.

686
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,020
So naughty.

687
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,250
Have you ever heard about the story of the Multiverse?

688
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,510
You and someone might be really close to each other.

689
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:24,720
But in another Multiverse,

690
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,790
he might act like he doesn't know you at all.

691
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,510
Why do you get in there?

692
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,140
For applying a job.

693
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,000
You said that this club have the guards.

694
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,900
Why you let him drunk like this?

695
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:33,780
Are you drunk?

696
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:35,850
No.

697
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,040
If you have a new friend, I have to be your new friend's friend too.

698
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,150
If you want to know what real kiss look like, I'll show you.
