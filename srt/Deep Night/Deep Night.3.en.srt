1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,360
This table is out of time.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,470
I'll review this club until It's closed.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,810
If you want to know how real kiss looks like,

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,280
I'll show you.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,360
Last night, you fucked me or I fucked you?

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,880
You are rich. Why do you have to work as a traffic assistant?

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,560
Are you Freya's fan?

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,850
You are the first person that Wela takes home.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,260
Did my mom ask you about a job?

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,640
It's the weekend party

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,250
This weekend has the Auction Host.

12
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,600
Hello, Dai.

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,110
Oh my gosh!

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,440
So many people, you come for me?

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,630
No way, sis.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
Well well well...  Everyone's ready

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,320
to join our auction host, right?

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,640
For who said that

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're out of money.

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,030
But I can say that...

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,190
Everyone must have money today!

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,640
Because money is the only answer!

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,480
And to not waste your time.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,220
Let's start the auction host from Deep Night club!

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,039
Oh gosh!

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,960
Today, we gather our top-tiers from our club, everyone!

27
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
And to not waste your time,

28
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,850
Shall we start it now?

29
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,350
Are you ready?

30
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,100
Yes!

31
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,790
Let's start with the first person.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,290
It's... Ken!

33
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,820
Tonight...

34
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,329
I can sit with everyone

35
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,150
Since I'm looking down... 'There're brunch of pretty girls'

36
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,240
Let's get started!

37
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,329

Thank you.

50
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,920
Next one... he's as interesting as previous one.

51
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,750
He is...

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,910

53
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,800
Hello, I'm Seiji.

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,560

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,800
I'll comfort you.

56
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,790
Oh! I just got ditched!

57
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,700
To not waste your time,

58
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,350

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,940
Oohhh, 500 drinks!

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,640
I almost got heart attack.

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,000
And the third person...

70
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,360
He's the highlight of tonight.

71
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,730

72
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,720

73
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,160
Everyone said that it's hard to book him.

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,000
But tonight...

75
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,310
He's here.

76
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,500
Wela!

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,710

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,110
Alright.

79
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,750
Want all night, please choose Wela.

80
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,350
Oh, wow.

81
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,390
Then, let's start it!

82
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,320
Oh, wait everyone!

00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,960
We have VIP guest join our auction host!

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,260
Let me read for a sec.

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
Goshhh!

86
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,400
1000 drinks!

87
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,720
Wait, my dear staff

88
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
How much 1000 drinks are?

89
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,280
370,000 baht!

90
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,380

Ooh!

95
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,850
There you go. Come and take Wela.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,860
Well, don't be sad, everyone.

97
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,590
There are many lovely men for you tonight here.

98
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,270
The guest is here?

99
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,450
Yes.

100
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,300
Wait right here.

101
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,530
The guest is coming.

102
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,880
Tonigh...

103
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,970
I want all night, can I?

104
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Of course, my 1000-drink guest.

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,150
Didn't you work tonight?

106
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,060
I take time off,

107
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Because there's something I want to do more.

108
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,190
Thank you.

109
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,850
Wh-what're you doing here?

110
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,820
What's wrong with you?

111
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,290
Is there someone curse you?

112
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
No one.

113
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,530
Nice.

114
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,860
You're so kind.

115
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,620
First time I met you...

116
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,410
Rude like hell.

117
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,960
What's about... now?

118
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,650
Um... well...

119
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,220
Kind.

120
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,990
When I'm in trouble, you always help me.

121
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,170
And as for the guest,

122
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,120
You do super great!

123
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,690
I don't wonder why you're 2nd in here.

124
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,640
I said something wrong?

125
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,090
Nothing.

126
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,430
Just being 2nd, it feels like...

127
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,860
Don't like it?

128
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,170
Everyone wants to be 1st.

129
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,690
And someday...

130
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,640
I will be 1st.

131
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,390
I think you can.

132
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,200
Even though it will take time,

133
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,060
You can be for sure.

134
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,410
Really beautiful.

135
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,560
You like it?

136
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,510
Actually,

137
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,990
Madam Freya...

138
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,040
She's my mom.

139
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,380
Sorry that I didn't tell you.

140
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,690
Actually, I knew it.

141
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,970
Your childhood picture looks exactly like her.

142
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,190
Your personality too,

143
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,650
be serious

144
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,260
And charming also,

145
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,870
I'm really happy tonight.

146
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,310
But I don't want it to be because of work.

147
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,080
No host tonight...

148
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,780
No guest...

149
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,880
Just only you and me

150
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,790
Everything is true.

151
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,310
This kiss...

152
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,530
No drink fee.

153
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,570
Stop.

154
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,070
Stop now.

155
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,540
Walk.

156
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,790
Please walk.

157
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,340
Wait for a second, I'll check it.

158
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,030
Sorry

159
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,290
Night traveler,

160
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,140

161
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,480
Please cooperate with us.

162
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,980
And please come gathering at the center of the club.

163
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,530
Come. Please come.

164
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,000
Please cooperate. Come.

165
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,610
Women on left. Men on right, please.

166
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,900
Stay in a line.

167
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,870
Everyone,

168
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:06,340
I'm at the Host club that has the acronym, Deep Night right now.

169
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,100
I can tell you something,this is so surprised. I have something to show you.

170
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,970
Oh my god.

171
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,210
The polices come.

172
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,470
There will be the random of urinalysis.

173
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,510
I have no idea what is happening right now.

174
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,850
But if anyone is coming here right now,

175
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,640
I can tell that

176
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,180
you're probably disappointed.

177
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,780
So, run away and don't come here.

178
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,200
I'm at the Host club that has the acronym, Deep Night right now.

179
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,570
There will be the random of urinalysis.

180
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,960
I have no idea what is happening right now.

181
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,200
But if anyone is coming here right now,

182
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,940
I can tell that

183
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,430
you're probably disappointed.

184
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,130
So, run away and don't come here.

185
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,650
Are you free today?

186
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,000
Suddenly,

187
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
the whole club was light up.

188
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,190
There were 100 of polices

189
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,140
that arrested our guests.

190
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,630
Hundred?

191
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,830
Yeah.Hundred.

192
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,090
There were scream everywhere.

193
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,440
People tried to escape, almost trod each others.

194
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,610
Did you see that?

195
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,330
Nope.

196
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,940
I was outside.

197
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,330
I heard from others.

198
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,340
Boo.

199
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,030
If Seiji didn't help me,

200
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,290
I might got frisk.

201
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,290
You were with Seiji?

202
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,020
Yes.

203
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,300
When do you get closer to him?

204
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,270
No.

205
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,620
I am not that closed to him.Just so so.

206
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,310
For real?

207
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,540
Hi, Wela.

208
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,150
Hi.

209
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,710
What are you doing here?

210
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,310
I have to prepare myself for work.

211
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,050
Oh. You prepare yourself for work.

212
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,410
How was that? How was that guest?

213
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,760
Pan.

214
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,510
I heard Dai calling you

215
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,250
I hear nothing.

216
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,560
Did you hear it? He's calling you again.

217
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,850
I hear nothing.

218
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,940
Or am I deaf?

219
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,770
You should go to work.

220
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,320
They might deduct your  salary.

221
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,510
Yes, Dai

222
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,860
Dai.

223
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,800
I'm coming, Dai

224
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,390
How are you?

225
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,420
Can you work?

226
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,000
If you cannot, I'll tell them.

227
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,430
Why i can't work?

228
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,820
Wela, come here.

229
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:44,880
Yes.

230
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,420
Be right back.

231
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,830
Wela, come here. Wela.

232
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,770
Yes, I'm coming.

233
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,040
Wow.

234
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,580
Where did you get this from?

235
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,980
Guess it.

236
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,470
Your home?

237
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,000
Good stuff.

238
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,810
My grandma sent it to me. I thought she wanted me to have all these food.

239
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,460
But she wanted me to share with you.

240
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,600
I'm so boring.

241
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,150
Thank you, grandma.

242
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,290
Who was afraid to blood tofu when he was a child

243
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,560
because he was afraid to turn into vampire?

244
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,640
To be honest,

245
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
it's the same as someone who afriad to eat chicken feet.

246
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,400
Until his grandma had to tell him,

247
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,120
Can, you can eat it, sweetheart.

248
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,120
You told me that we don't call our real name here.

249
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,720
You start it first.

250
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,000
Saen.

251
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,840
This is not the end.

252
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Um. How about last night, what was happened?

253
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,080
It was fine.

254
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,720
The polices just came.

255
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,200
But they didn't investigate anything.

256
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Like, they just stopped by.

257
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,120
Do you think that's weird?

258
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,520
I feel like we were teased.

259
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,000
Who teased us?

260
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,240
I don't know.

261
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,680
Ken, give me back my blood tofu.

262
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,440
Let me eat it.

263
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,120
Spit it out.

264
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,760
Don't act like a child.

265
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,000
Hey. I won't let you have my second blood tofu.

266
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,480
I will call you Can.

267
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,360
Saen.

268
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,680
Give it to me.

269
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,600
Let me eat it.

270
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,240
Give it to me.

271
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,360
Dai.

272
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,800
Uh.

273
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm sorry.

274
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,560
I'm going out.

275
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Hey. Where are you going?

276
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,000
Uh...

277
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,000
You just

278
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,720
You two

279
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,560
Are you out of your mind? There is nothing happened.

280
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,760
Oh.

281
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,760
The 5th of golden rule,

282
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,920
do not date each other.

283
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,240
Come.

284
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,320
Sit and eat Nam Ngiao

285
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,560
Sit.

286
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:10,880
Delicious?

287
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,160
Can, I'll eat with you.

288
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,920
I have to say thank you to you all for taking care of the guests in Friday Night well.

289
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,920
Even though, there was an unexpected incident.

290
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
But we can make it through.

291
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,040
Well done, everyone.

292
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,440
The other day,

293
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,640
someone reported to me that

294
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,760
there was a guest that tried to inebriate our host.

295
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,640
Normally, I let them send the guards the sign.

296
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,880
But after this incident,

297
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,000
I will change and let the guards help immediately,

298
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,360
if they see something wrong with us.

299
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,840
I have to say thank you to Khemtid

300
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,600
that made me see this loophole

301
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,480
from this incident.

302
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,240
I want to promote Khemtid

303
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,880
to be closed to the guests

304
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,520
and our hosts more.

305
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,360
That position is

306
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,280
PR of the club.

307
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,280
This position

308
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,160
have to match the guest's preferences to suit with our hosts.

309
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,880
May you

310
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,600
enjoy this night.

311
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,000
Your order is here.

312
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,400
Good evening, Ma'am. Do you have your signature's host?

313
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,440
I want Wela. Does he come yet?

314
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,750
Wela is unavailable.

315
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,080
What?! What can I do then.I came here because I want Wela to sit with me.

316
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
If you like someone cute as Wela,

317
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,400
our club has a bunch of them.

318
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,560
If you're still interested, please choose one.

319
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,000
Come in.

320
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Good evening.

321
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,240
Welcome to Deep Night.

322
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,680
Tonight,

323
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,160
I promise to you that

324
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,440
there is no more loneliness in Deep Night anymore.

325
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,840
Let have fun, everyone.

326
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,800
Do you know, Wela?

327
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,560
I had booked your queue for many months,

328
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,000
until I got your queue.

329
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
You have to be fully fun tonight.

330
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,720
I'll feed you.

331
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,080
Feed me some fruit.

332
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,400
Umm.

333
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,920
Umm.

334
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,800
It's more sweet than I have ever eaten.

335
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,360
Delicious?

336
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,880
I booked you queue many times.

337
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,200
I had never gotten your queue.

338
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,680
I'm lucky today to get your queue.

339
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,200
Or maybe it's all because of the destiny.

340
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,840
Your smell is so good from head to toe.

341
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,920
I'm jealous of your boyfriend.

342
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,720
If I want to smell you everyday, what do I have to do?

343
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
You have to come to this club often.

344
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,440
I'm asking you seriously.

345
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
Do you have a boyfriend?

346
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,280
Really?

347
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,120
You, Wela, don't have a boyfriend?

348
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,920
This job cannot have a boyfriend.

349
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,600
That's true.

350
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,199
If I have you as my boyfriend,

351
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,600
I'm definitely jealous.

352
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,200
I have to go to a toilet.

353
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,560
Please.

354
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Don't go too long.

355
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,640
Okay.

356
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,800
I'll be right back.

357
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,560
Okay.

358
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,760
I'm jealous.

359
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,360
Can I lock you up?

360
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,200
Jealous?

361
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,120
What are we?

362
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,520
Can we be something then?

363
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,920
No,

364
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,360
if you don't flirt me first.

365
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,520
Wela.

366
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,800
Wela.

367
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Are you in here?

368
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,910
Wela.

369
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,080
Yes, Dai. I'm here.

370
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,640
I thought we are gone.

371
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
The guest asked about you.

372
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,560
Okay.

373
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,150
Dai, wait.

374
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,160
What?

375
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,560
Uh.

376
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,880
Do you know

377
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,320
Know what?

378
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,760
The downstairs toilet is full.

379
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,920
Toilet is full?

380
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,560
Yes.

381
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,560
- Gosh. Does somebody deal with this yet?
- Let see it.

382
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,080
Let see the toilet, Dai.

383
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,680
Khemtid.

384
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,400
Where have you been?

385
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
I have looked you like forever.

386
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,160
I am at toilet.

387
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,640
Toilet?

388
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,200
I heard that the toilet is out of service.

389
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,830
So stinky.

390
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,670
How did you get in?

391
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,570
It's not that stinky.

392
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,320
It's smell good.

393
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,580
How is the toilet smell good?

394
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,020
So cute.

395
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,120
Super duper cute!

396
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,690
Freya

397
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,540
Madam Freya

398
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,030
Can I have selfie with you?

399
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,170
sure.

400
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,470
You look gorgeous in person.

401
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,420
Thank you.

402
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,920
Do you know that your club

403
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,560
is mass on TokTok.

404
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,640
But when there was the clip of the police at your club.

405
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,420
We decided not to come

406
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:06,040
because we don't know that there will be an illegal or not.

407
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,240
But when I come here,

408
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,310
I feel very safe.

409
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,540
No need to worries.

410
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,240
You are safe here.

411
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,000
Because we have golden rule for our employees to follow.

412
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,400
Can I be excused?

413
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,730
Enjoy your time here.

414
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,530
She is very nice!

415
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,360
Look.

416
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,440
Please wait, don't put down

417
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,500
Don't put down.

418
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,800
Don't put it down, keep it like that.

419
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,170
Keep it like that.

420
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,730
You guys requested us because

421
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,010
Because both of you are my ship.

422
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,070
Since I walked in this club,

423
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,650
I saw you both

424
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,920
are a match made in heaven.

425
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,160
Tonight,

426
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,170
can you guys please play as BL actors for us?

427
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:06,970
Please.

428
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,460
Make it like

429
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,360
We are on cloud nine as if we're watching the BL series.

430
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,780
But I think

431
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,360
Seiji, don't move.

432
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,690
You will trip over.

433
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,450
I can tie it by myself.

434
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,770
If you tie by yourself, it will be loose again.

435
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,000
It's better if I tie for you.

436
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,710
This is big dog Top.

437
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,710
with denial bottom.

438
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,930
You guys have good chemistry together.

439
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,690
I'm sorry.

440
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,150
Sorry.

441
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,840
Sorry.

442
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,190
I'm here.

443
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,540
Why did you take time so long?

444
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,650
I really miss you.

445
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,670
I like this song.

446
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,290
Sorry?

447
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,960
I like this song.

448
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:07,810
What?

449
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,710
I like this song.

450
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,640
He is number one, Host here.

451
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,760
It gonna be uneasy.

452
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,040
When I'm on stage.

453
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,400
I saw everything.

454
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,910
How it not gonna be moody?

455
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,850
He touched on every Wela's part.

456
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,510
He is my boy.

457
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,260
Do you know?

458
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,710
Why this club

459
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,360
has number 5 of golden rule.

460
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,000
because it going to be fuck up like this.

461
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,030
We have to service customers.

462
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,370
Who can bear with it?

463
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,900
If you have to seeing your love.

464
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,190
being close with others.

465
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,400
Did you used to it?

466
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,500
To love someone who has this job,

467
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,540
you have to think about it wisely.

468
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,320
It is not that easy.

469
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,210
Hey!

470
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,570
Why do you guys here?

471
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,800
Did you do have something and don't tell me?

472
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,540
Bye.

473
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,740
It's cold here.

474
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,330
Are you cold?

475
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,240

476
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,340

477
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,790

I have to pee again.

481
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:42,930
Don't be too long.

482
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,740
Okay, I'll be right back.

483
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,940

00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,570
What about the guest?

487
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,130
I want to smooth things over with you first.

488
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,180
Don't be so mad.

489
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,520
There is nothing.

490
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,800
You know that

491
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,510
I like to be the one who started.

492
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,680
Is this the best you can do?

493
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,540
Remember

494
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,420
Tonight, If you make me jealous again.

495
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,910
I will make you pay in double.

496
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,750
What if I make you being more jealous?

00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,930
I will punish you

498
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,630
until you cannot sedure anyone again.

499
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,360
I'm back.

500
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,270
Have you been waiting long?

501
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,590
No, I am not.

502
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,360
Oh,

503
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,970

506
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:43,860
Congratulation to our lucky guest tonight.

Oh, you are so dumb like Seiji.

How can it enough?

547
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,620
Being jealous like this

548
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,880
What are we?

549
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:27,450
Can we be something?

550
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:32,790

551
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,790
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

552
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,590
Just only we know.

553
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,670
You can handle it?

554
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,030
I don't know.

555
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:11,430
I just want to try.

556
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:16,660
Do you want to try?

557
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,950
Sure.

558
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:32,490
let's break the rules.

559
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:12,920
Now, Khem and Wela are together.

560
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,600
Hey!

561
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,160
Don't say that you are together?

562
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,250
Which one is mine?

563
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,120
I keep it for you.

564
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,960
I like Seiji.

565
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,330
I don't care whenever do you start to like him.

566
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,680
But now I am also like him too.

567
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,690
You might be happy today.

568
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,460
What about the future?
