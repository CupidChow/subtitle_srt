1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,610
Dai.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,970
Hm? What's up?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,510
If someone is breaking the golden rules,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,440
That person will be fired, right?

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,390
Which rules?

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,640
That number 5.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,130
Khemtid and Wela...

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,230
They're dating together.

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,490
Actually, I want to cancel it for a long time.

10
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,800
If you cancel it now,

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,480
others might think you take side to your son too much.

12
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,440
Just follow the rules please.

13
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,110
You don't need to worry.

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,530
I won't break up with you for sure.

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,220
What happened?

16
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,030
Please stop.

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,140
You can't enter.

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:38,950
Dai.

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,120
Er... She's my boss.

20
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,240
- Madam, something happened.
- What happened?

21
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,760
We would like to inspect the inside of your club.

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,870
It's already been inspected.

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,730
Let me in, please. Go.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
- Wait!
- Get in.

25
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,349
Everything that has happened so far

26
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,720
You did it, right?

27
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,690
Yes, I did.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,680
And I won't stop doing it as well.

29
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,539
As long as Khemtid is still with you,

30
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,720
I'll send people come here often.

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,539
Because

32
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,590
I don't want Khemtid has to use money from dirty business.

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,740
My club is legal.

34
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,330
No matter how many times you bring the police here,

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,600
You can never do anything to us.

36
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,470
Whether I can or can't do it,

37
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,630
Just open your eyes and look at it now.

38
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,270
Well, well.

39
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,100
Where will customers come into the club that is frequently inspected?

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,220
Ah.

41
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,060
And don't be confident too much that your club is nothing.

42
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,229
Maybe...

43
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:58,000
There's something surprise.

44
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,100
Again, everyone.

45
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,080
The police comes again.

46
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,440
So annoying! I come here for party.

47
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,570
Hey.

48
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,730
What are you watching?

49
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,420
This is mine?

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,820
If it's not yours, whose then?

51
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,050
No one eats durian french fries and red soda but you.

52
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,130
Right.

53
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,540
Did you see this?

54
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,250
It said there's insurance that allows same-sex lovers to be named as beneficiaries.

55
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:04,680
Look.

56
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,120
If I do it, I'll put your name.

57
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,380
Thanks.

58
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,980
Can I drink your red soda?

59
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,560
That's enough.

60
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,070
There's nothing better.

61
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,470
Right?

62
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,230
If you want to change it, we must help each other.

63
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,180
It's not like you're doing it alone.

64
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,070
You're so cute, you know?

65
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,460
Be careful, you'll get kissed.

66
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,350
That's crazy.

67
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,080
We're at the university.

68
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,180
Naughty!

69
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,400
You know?

70
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,710
The black bottle is suitable for people who work at night like us.

71
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,100
Try smelling it.

72
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,270
How is it? Good?

73
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,440
And for white bottle,

74
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,560
It's suitable for evening.

75
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,360
Smell it.

76
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:52,750
Smell good?

77
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,710
Well, smell good.

78
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,760
- Right?
- Yes.

79
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,770
What's about... this?

80
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,460
Look.

81
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,640
I'll show you how to apply perfume perfectly.

82
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,330
When I give you the signal, you spray it.

83
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,020
One, two, three... spray it!

84
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,200
How was it? Smell good?

85
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,440
Run that fast, it won't have perfume on you.

86
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,980
Oh...

87
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,880
How is it?

88
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,870
Do you guys like the perfume I bought you?

89
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,310
- I love it, Madam Freya!
- I love it too.

90
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,060
- Its smell is so good.
- I want it.

91
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,110
I know since the perfume scent fills the room.

92
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,800
But let's put the perfume topic aside for now.

93
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,840
I've something to tell all of you.

94
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,360
I will close the club for a big clean-up for 1 week.

95
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,430
I'll have someone come clean every nook to ensure our club is spotless

96
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,210
And there are no legal stuffs in our club.

97
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,720
So, within these seven days, I'll give everyone a special vacation.

98
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,100
You can travel comfortably

99
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,650
Because I don' t deduct your salary.

100
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,640
- Really, Madam?
- For real?

101
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,900
- Really?
- Gosh.

102
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,100
What's up, Khemtid.

103
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll be here to help you for big cleaning.

104
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,340
That's fine.

105
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,970
There're a lot of people here.

106
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,910
But you're still tired.

107
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,630
Thank you, Khemtid.

108
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,300
But it's okay.

109
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,910
I can do it.

110
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,710
Go rest.

111
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,030
It's good to take Wela on trips.

112
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,540
Don't you like that you get to rest for a week?

113
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,950
I like it, but...

114
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,290
I think there's something she's hiding from me.

115
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,470
Something about the police.

116
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,210
If Madam doesn't tell you, it means she may have thought it through well.

117
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,140
Madam Freya is a talented person. You should trust her.

118
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,330
Just don't make her worry more than she needs to.

119
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,870
Are you my mom's fan?

120
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,060
Yes.

121
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,380
What's about you?

122
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,010
Where will you plan to go?

123
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,060
So...

124
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,810
Do you want to go out on a date?

125
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,370
Go out on a date?

126
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:05,840
Yes.

127
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,580
You bring just this?

128
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
We only slept for one night, aren't we?

129
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,140
Just in case you're so impressed that you don't want to go back.

130
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,380
Don't go back?

131
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,490
If I don't go back, how will I live?

132
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,050
Oh?

133
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,670
Where are we now?

134
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,090
It's my mom's home.

135
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,170
Here?

136
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,800
Here's Madam Freya's home?

137
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,210
Her home where she grew up.

138
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,820
I think when I come here

139
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,960
I feel like I've recharged my energy.

140
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,700
That's why I want to bring you here.

141
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,020
If I know in advance, I won't bring clothes for just one night.

142
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,190
I should bring them for 7 days.

143
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,010
So pity.

144
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,470
That's okay.

145
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,410
Being with me...

146
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,850
No need to wear anything.

147
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,600
Cheeky!

148
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,140
Let's go.

149
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,300
Go.

150
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,300
Are you shy?

151
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,780
Let's go into the house.

152
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:05,950
What are you doing?

153
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,490
Are you hungry?

154
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,990
It's just finished. Let's eat it.

155
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,590
Here.

156
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,440
Try it.

157
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,990
Like a child.

158
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,580
Not at all.

159
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,190
Child doesn't do like this.

160
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,000
So lonely.

161
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,690
Normally, I'm at Deep Night at this time.

162
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,960
I might clean the glass right now.

163
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,000
I might pratice my show with...

164
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
With Ken?

165
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,970
Are you still angry at him?

166
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,490
I'm not.

167
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,550
I just didn't think he would do like that.

168
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,840
But I understand him.

169
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,660
Ken loves you so much.

170
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,330
But I don't mean that what he did was right.

171
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,660
I just understand what he's doing.

172
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,680
You say it like you take side with him.

173
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
You won't flirt with me anymore?

174
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,100
No, I'm still flirting.

175
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,610
I just don't want you to argue with your friend.

176
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,750
Talk nicely, Seiji.

177
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,640
I'll be waiting around here.

178
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,540
Do you know?

179
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,270
For me...

180
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,520
You're the best.

181
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,650
You don't talk much,

182
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,619
but you try hard to entertain guests

183
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,710
until everyone likes you.

184
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,230
You're not good at dancing,

185
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,740
but you practice hard

186
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,020
until your performance comes out really good.

187
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,000
You don't like dressing up,

188
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,410
but before meeting guests,

189
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,650
You always check yourself in the mirror

190
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,790
Because you don't want them to be disappointed.

191
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,000
And how person like you

192
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
Shouldn't get 1st here?

193
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,050
I just want you to get what you deserve.

194
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,670
I appreciate you so much, Ken.

195
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,340
That you see the effort in me.

196
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,360
But what you said, Wela also did it.

197
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,530
Being number one isn't something we can just claim.

198
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,820
It's up to everyone.

199
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,200
I think I should be 1st here too.

200
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,680
But if guests still don't accept me,

201
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,140
I'll just focus on improving and working harder,

202
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,950
not by seeking to be number one like this.

203
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,790
I'm so sorry.

204
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,910
I shouldn't do like that.

205
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,150
Never mind.

206
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,060
What's done is done, and we can't go back to fix it.

207
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,880
But we can make it better, you know?

208
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,000
If you don't use it, let's just throw it all away.

209
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,380
That red hairpiece is mine. I still use it.

210
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,490
Gosh!

211
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,120
Out, out, I'll handle it myself.

212
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,530
You guys don't know anything.

213
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,710
And here, are these things yours?

214
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,010
- Gosh, Dai.
- Yes, it's mine.

215
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,670
Big Clean, are you still doing it?

216
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,640
All you've done are useless.

217
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,750
As long as you haven't returned Khemtid to the Ritpreecha house,

218
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,130
there will probably be frequent visitors here.

219
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,450
Former showgirl like you

220
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,000
can earn a living just like this.

221
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,950
Don't drag my grandchild down with you.

222
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,510
Hey, Grandma!

223
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,460
Who is showgirl? Even though we're former showgirl,

224
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,950
but we are still making a living.

225
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,720
We're not karen like you

226
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,790
who just want to take Khemtid to live without knowing how to make a living.

227
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,670
Some people like this

228
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,630
We call them 'Perverse one'.

229
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,380
Who are you?!

230
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
- You low-class showgirls!
- So what?

231
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,240
- Go back!
- Go!

232
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,530
I'll catch dirtiness from you!

233
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,040
Dai.

234
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,280
I'm so sorry, Madam.

235
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,570
Thanks.

236
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,340
Don't shirk!

237
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,200
Let's put everything away. It's yours, right?

238
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,170
Yes, Madam.

239
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,160
Peek-a-boo!

240
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,070
Are you hungry?

241
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,950
What should we eat for dinner today?

242
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,360
Here, my dinner.

243
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,020
Already delivered.

244
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,510
What should we eat seriously?

245
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,680
I have something for you.

246
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,420
Here.

247
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,490
I think it's worth it and suitable for us.

248
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,260
I want you to keep this.

249
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,610
It will put my mind at ease knowing someone is taking care of you.

250
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,990
I have mine too.

251
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,730
I also put your name down as a beneficiary.

252
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,960
Are you crazy?

253
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,890
I'm not.

254
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,700
Thank you.

255
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,160
Can you change to thank you here?

256
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:02,790
Here.

257
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,640
- What's about this?
- Ouch!

258
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,030
You did the same, huh?

259
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,300
Like this, huh?

260
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,710
Wanna eat you up!

261
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,900
My cheeks are all stretched out.

262
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,240
- They're coming!
- Huh?

263
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,640
Khemtid!

264
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,230
Wow, this is the garden house madam Freya told?

265
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,580
It's amazing.

266
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,910
Hey, is the backyard ready for use?

267
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,470
Damn, it's really worth having a barbecue.

268
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,990
Madam Freya told us you guys were here

269
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,170
And she wanted us to relax together.

270
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,950
It's no problem, right?

271
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,470
No problem at all, bro. Let's have a lot of fun together.

272
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah, awesome.

273
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,850
Party, party!

274
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,610
I'm sorry.

275
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,570
I don't know how to put it, I just want to apologize.

276
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,680
Back then, I did it out of my own selfishness.

277
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,410
Now I know it, you guys didn't do anything wrong at all.

278
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,470
If someone has to be kicked out, it should be me.

279
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,500
Calm down.

280
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,700
It's not appropriate for anyone to be fired because of this.

281
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,140
Aren't you here to relax today?

282
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,170
Forget it.

283
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,610
That's right.

284
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,320
Just hangin' out.

285
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,160
Let's go! Just chilling!

286
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,880
Hey, I'm hungry. Do you have anything to eat?

287
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,210
- Eat BBQ, shall we?
- Deal!

288
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,740
Let's go!

289
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,510
Let's party!

290
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,750
Here.

291
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,170
I'm sorry.

292
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,800
I thought you were the problem all along.

293
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,310
I just thought it was someone from another club,

294
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,440
but now I know you're not.

295
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,780
Well...

296
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,340
Nice to work with you.

297
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,580
Yes!

298
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,430
Hey!

299
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,180
Is this a mosquito or a bee?

300
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,470
Damn, it's bee! I told you!

301
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,300
Who draws mosquitoes on a pancake?

302
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,290
Look at it.

303
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,060
Look!

304
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,950
How is it?

305
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,430
What do you guys think? Is it pretty?

306
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,310
I'm the best at painting in the store.

307
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm really good at it. James also told me it's pretty.

308
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,260
Hello, we are Paramouth band.

309
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,990
It's music band!

310
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,190
Let's join them!

311
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,990
What you waiting for? Let's go!

312
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,190
Go, go, go!

313
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,850
May Deep Night club prosper!

314
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,720
- Prosper!
- Prosper!

315
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,220
Khemtid.

316
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,170
I apologize you again.

317
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,750
That 5th golden rule is so stupid.

318
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,230
Two people love each other, is it wrong?

319
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,750
I also love Seiji.

320
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,750
- Hmm? Huh?
- Huh?

321
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,470
I do love him too.

322
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,470
And I won't give up anymore!

323
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,880
I love him more than you.

324
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,200
I love him more than you!

325
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,390
- I love him more.
- I love him more too!

326
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,270
Has she replied you already?

327
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,110
I told you that she's good at it.

328
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,630
You don't need to worry about her.

329
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,290
She can manage it all.

330
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,570
Why are you so confident like this?

331
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,690
Why am I?

332
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,530
Madam Freya is the first one who knows that I have potential of this way.

333
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,290
And then she invited me to work here.

334
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,670
Out, out.

335
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,480
What does 'ouch' mean, teacher?

336
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,630
It's 'out'.

337
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,990
- Out?
- Yes, out.

338
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,240
Is it correct, teacher?

339
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,470
Correct.

340
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,190
After we finish warming up our joints, we'll start stretching.

341
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,940
What if we don't warm up, teacher? What will happen?

342
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,190
She always believes in me.

343
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,920
Even though I don't have confident while working sometimes.

344
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,170
She is my inspiration and makes me want to be as good as her.

345
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,880
I think I'm really the most luckiest one that I met her.

346
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,850
You're always doing great.

347
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,390
Even if you didn't meet my mom, you always did great.

348
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,200
That's not true.

349
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,680
It's true.

350
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,610
Right.

351
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,670
Actually, tomorrow is important for me.

352
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,290
Hey, you two!

353
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,120
Hey, let's eat it!

354
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,320
Come eat together!

355
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,150
Go, party!

356
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,460
Come, let's party!

357
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,120
Come here.

358
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:49,510
Come on. Cheers first, man!

359
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,420
Can I rub on your back a bit?

360
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,920
Yes.

361
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,310
For me too.

362
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,990
Turn your back.

363
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,240
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

364
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,310
That today marks the anniversary of your dad's passing?

365
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,280
I didn't want to bother anyone,

366
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,590
but I wanted you to come actually.

367
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,610
Tell me some stories about your dad.

368
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,690
I want to hear.

369
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,380
My dad?

370
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,930
He's handsome man

371
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,710
Be tall and also kind.

372
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,940
When I was child,

373
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,170
My dad was so rich.

374
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,750
If I want something, he will buy me it always.

375
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,630
Until I was in high school,

376
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,510
My dad worked very hard that he didn't sleep.

377
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,430
At the end, he was sick

378
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,910
And didn't wake up forever.

379
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,990
Are you okay?

380
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:21,670
I'm okay.

381
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,450
When my dad passed away,

382
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,790
I just knew that he had been guaranteeing millions debts for his friend.

383
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,350
Then my mom opened a restaurant to help pay off my dad's debt.

384
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,910
I couldn't bear to see my mom working alone like that.

385
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,010
That's why...

386
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,490
I wanted to finish my studies quickly

387
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,490
so that I could work and help her to the fullest.

388
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,740
I just want to take care of her.

389
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,800
I believe in you.

390
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,930
You can do it for sure.

391
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,100
And for me,

392
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,570
I'll take care of you.

393
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,910
Is it good?

394
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,420
Yes.

395
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,160
- Is this for Seiji?
- Yeah.

396
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,020
Add more three eggs. He likes it.

397
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,770
What?

398
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,670
- Don't do it raw. He doesn't eat it.
- I know.

399
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,020
What're you doing?

400
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,780
Sprinkling onions.

401
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,690
Take it out. He doesn't eat it.

402
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,110
He's picky.

403
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,400
If he doesn't like, he won't eat it.

404
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,710
Let me help you then.

405
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,520
Did you two gossip me?

406
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,560
Wait a sec.

407
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,810
Here.

408
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,300
Eat.

409
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,260
Right, Ken.

410
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,090
Where is my hair oil?

411
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,020
How do I know? It's yours.

412
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,530
Black zipper bag.

413
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,950
Try looking for it.

414
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,030
Black zipper bag?

415
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,550
Right! I haven't take a look it yet.

416
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,460
So, I'll go take a shower and then I'll come eat.

417
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,770
They woke up already, see?

418
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,010
Hey, I bought some grilled pork with sticky rice for you.

419
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,750
- Wow.
- Thank you so much.

420
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,230
Hey, hey, I made this for you guys too.

421
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,830
- Thank you.
- Drink it, guys.

422
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,830
- I'll take chocolate.
- Me too.

423
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,500
Thanks.

424
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,220
Here.

425
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,430
You like it, right?

426
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,420
Thanks.

427
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,130
Hey.

428
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,590
What activity will we do it today?

429
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,390
Sleep, bro. We come here for a rest.

430
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,620
We don't have to be active that much.

431
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,790
I don't know,

432
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,550
but I don't get used to it when I don't do anything.

433
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,350
Right?

434
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,690
What do you guys think?

435
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,460
Will we be able to go back to work?

436
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,070
Shit, Great! What're you talking about?

437
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,160
We will for sure.

438
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,150
Have you heard about Manifest?

439
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,510
If we think about good things, good things will happen.

440
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,190
We must believe in Madam Freya.

441
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,610
That's right. For Deep Night!

442
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,030
For Deep Night!

443
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,640
Hey.

444
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,200
Did you see the comments on Tiktok?

445
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,320
- What?
- Here.

446
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,600
'I follow Deep Night for a long time'

447
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,960
'My dream is that, when I turn twenty,'

448
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,730
'I'll work to earn money and then meet all of you at the Deep Night.'

449
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,750
Great news like this

450
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,730
We must have party!

451
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

452
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,950
What are you thinking?

453
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,940
I'm afraid that our club will be shut down.

454
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,600
I'll protect Deep Night.

455
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,160
Trust me.

456
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,480
That two...

457
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,540
They're lovers.

458
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:40,970
You're right.

459
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,940
Lovers must have something like that.

460
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,470
So, what do you think lovers should do?

461
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:53,550
Well.

462
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,120
Travel

463
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:58,990
Share foods

464
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,220
And also...

465
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,550
Hold hand.

466
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:31,890
Remember.

467
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,890
If we like someone, we will want to kiss that person.

468
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,470
- Hey.
- Hey!

469
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:19,390
Shit!

470
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,290
Fuck! Who will be responsible this?

471
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,190
- Where's him?
- He drove over there.

472
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,570
- Stop, guys.
- It wastes time so much...

473
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,790
I have insurance.

474
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,060
Ah.

475
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,900
Good.

476
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,060
Hello.

477
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,120
(Emergency Center for Dhipaya Insurance, we're here to assist you.)

478
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,700
(Hello, sir. What's happened?)

479
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,340
Oh, Motorcycle scraped my car.

480
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,900
(Did you get any injuries?)

481
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,530
No injuries.

482
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,520
(Is the other party present?)

483
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,030
No.

484
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,670
(Alright, sir. We'll dispatch assistance promptly. Please wait for a moment, sir.)

485
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,800
Yes, yes.

486
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,720
Hey, it's far, will insurance come?

487
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,440
Hey.

488
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:15,990
So fast.

489
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

490
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,770
From the Dhipaya Insurance, we're glad to be of service, sir.

491
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,520
Yes.

492
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,750
Where did the damage occur?

493
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,920
Exactly, the mirror.

494
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,660
Yes, you can sign here.

495
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:44,920
Alright.

496
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,910
Let's get home.

497
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

498
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,040
It's the most fun we've ever had.

499
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,160
I'm shocked!

500
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:42,270
Gosh.

501
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,560
How was it? Having fun?

502
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,320
Is there enough foods, huh?

503
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,820
Yes, it's enough. We ate that our six pack disappeared.

504
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,790
Did you come back again?

505
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,950
The club is about to shut down like this.

506
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,410
Isn't it better to resign?

507
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,000
Khemtid,

508
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,790
You should prepare yourself to come back to your dad's home.

509
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,000
It's not long

510
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,670
There is no Deep Night club anymore.

511
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,360
So, is this your doing so far?

512
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,610
Auntie, remember this.

513
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,400
Even though there is no this club,

514
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,700
I won't go back with you.

515
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,650
This club that my mom loves it the most,

516
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:38,780
I'll take care of it by myself.

517
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,050
Outsider like you,

518
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:43,750
Don't be nosy.

519
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,870
Khemtid!

520
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,440
Madam Freya.

521
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,570
I think I have a great plan.

522
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,380
Auntie.

523
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,000
Is it true that Wela is... What does he do? How's it called?

524
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,560
- Host.
- Ah, yeah.

525
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,870
So, you didn't work in a grocery store, right?

526
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,280
Khemtid,

527
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:57,560
Please come in.

528
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,610
I intend to renovate this club.

529
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,400
No one can do anything to you.

530
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,190
I love you so much.

531
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,470
I'll do my best.
