00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,000

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,980

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,310
Everything is true.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,940
I'm jealous.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,520
Can I lock you up?

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,930
What are we?

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,980
Can we be something?

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,200
What now?

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,930
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

12
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,970
So handsome.

13
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,229
Khemtid.

14
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,620
Can I take a photo with you?

15
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,660
Wela

16
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,110
Come here.

17
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,130
Are you in a wrong seat?

18
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,100
This is my seat.

19
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,399
So, Can't I sit on my boyfriend's seat?

20
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,250
Don't you afraid people will know?

21
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,490
Oh, just teasing like this makes you sulking?

22
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,040
Did you just teasing me?

23
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,850
Huh?

24
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,810
Did you just teasing me?

25
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,130
Don't do that.

26
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,390
So, about us

27
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,650
Do we have to keep it secret?

28
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,310
Does, university has a rules?

29
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,000
The rules that students are not allowed to date?

30
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,120
So, it's depend on us.

31
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,290
It's embrassing

32
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,840
How is that embrrassing?

33
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,540
No need to be embrsassing

34
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,650
Khemtid.

35
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,420
Can I stay like this?

36
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,110
We can't do it when we back to the club.

37
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,610
Hey!

38
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't say that you are together?

39
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,570
Yeah

40
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,230
We are together.

41
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,730
but please don't tell anyone.

42
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,720
I don't want to have trouble with the club.

43
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,420
I won't tell anyone.

44
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,980
I promise with the scout honor.

45
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,000
Congrats, my friend.

46
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,560
I have to tell you this, Wela.

47
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,440
Khemtid has never been in a relationship.

48
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,700
Don't mind  him, if he acts weird.

49
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,440
You really have never had a boyfriend?

50
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,260

51
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,230
I will stay with my boyfriend.

52
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,050
Fine! I will go, you crazy in love!

53
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,850
Who are you talking to?

54
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,250
You keep talk to him all day.

55
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
Here. I bought it for you.

56
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,090
Really?

57
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,330
Yes

58
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,780

59
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,710

60
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,830
Try it.

61
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,590
I choose this one.

62
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,580
What did you do?

63
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,180
Can I have one?

64
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,210
Is that delicious?

65
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,540
sure.

66
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,490
It's my favorite.

67
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,680
One more bite.

68
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,440
Okay.

69
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,750
Here.

70
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,650
Will I take it home.

71
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,760
Yes, you can.

72
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,250
I bought it for you.

73
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,380
Was the queue long?

74
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,360
Not that long

75
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,060
Actually, It so long.

76
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,890
I came to it already.

77
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,390
It was so long.

78
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,020
Shit

79
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,390
be careful.

80
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,650
be careful.

81
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,350
Thank you

82
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,400
Why did you do it by yourself?

83
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,429
It's dangerous.

84
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,200
You should tell me next time.

85
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,590
here

86
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,640
Banana milk.

87
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,950
Thank you

88
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,210
Why this part still not good.

89
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,990
Really?

90
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,990
Why do you have to be serious?

91
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
You are a No.1 host here.

92
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,520
Do you still have to do this?

93
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,740
Did you heard this before?

94
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,930
It is hard to be No1,

95
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,250
and it is even harder to stay there.

96
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,710
When they give me a honor to be No.1 host.

97
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,750
So, I have to try hard.

98
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,250
You seem to like this job.

99
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,920
I want to pay their kindness.

100
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,130
How may host club that

101
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
good take care of the customers

102
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,160
until we don't have to go out and have sex with them?

103
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,420
My duty is only take care of customers

104
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
And also entertain them.

105
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Deep Night only want this from me.

106
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,920
So, why can't I give them?

107
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,400
This bar is so lucky

108
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,440
to have you.

109
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,140
I am the lucky one to came across this place.

110
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,040
You also lucky

111
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,690

112
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,210
Don't be such a confident.

113
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,420
You're in denial?

114
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,650
- Are you lucky?
- Don't

115
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,560
- Lucky yet?
- Khemtid

116
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,620
Lucky yet?

117
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:04,900
No

118
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,280
Lucky yet? Lucky yet? Lucky yet?

119
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,770
Fine, I am so lucky.

120
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,540
I give up.

121
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,090
I am lucky.

122
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,280
Anyone will see this.

123
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,570
Do you know who is the luckiest?

124
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,950
Me.

125
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,420
Be prepare to open the club.

126
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,970
Oh,

127
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,890
who bought this?

128
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,670
Seem like madam Freya has a guest.

129
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,510
Too many guests.

130
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,590
If you afraid to get fat,

131
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,760
You don't have to eat it.

132
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,450
Oh?

133
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,570
My trainer told me that

134
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,910
I can eat everything

135
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,000
but I need to workout too.

136
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,020
What?

137
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,270
Are you smile at the snack?

138
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,960
Are you crazy?

139
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,430
Oh?

140
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,600
Which one is mine?

141
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,310
- I keep this for you.
- I keep this for you.

142
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,670
I've been into Seiji

143
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,280
for a long time.

144
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,830
Before you were born, I guess.

145
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,290
I don't care whenever do you start to like him.

146
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,300
But now I like him too.

147
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,800
And I'll do everything to get him like me.

148
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,140
Do you declare war with me?

149
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,790
Fine.

150
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,720
Just do what you want.

151
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,470
But I'll make a move as well.

152
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,180
Yes.

153
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,120
I understand.

154
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,050
I didn't offend you.

155
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,290
But it's too often.

156
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,570
You have to understand me.

157
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,360
My guests are terrified.

158
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,600
Yes, you can.

159
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,040
But please bring warrants next time.

160
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,339
You think it's strange, right?

161
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,890
Yes.

162
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,069
Since I opened this club,

163
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,569
This hasn't ever happened before.

164
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,010
Maybe it's nothing.

165
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,819
Don't be stressful.

166
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,069
You can't underestimate anyone in this industry.

167
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,660
Look.

168
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,130
You won't be beautiful if you're tense like this.

169
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,270
Why do you be in this mood so often?

170
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,470
Like this is better. You won't be stressful.

171
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:43,990
What happened?

172
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,880
Aunt Sroi-Nang came at the club.

173
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,010
She wants Khemtid to come back at the main house.

174
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,810
Until I start thinking that

175
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,100
or maybe I have to take hime to that house?

176
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,700
Hey.

177
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,380
Seriously?

178
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,040
Khemtid chooses to be with you

179
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,240
Because he trusts you.

180
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,910
And you know what?

181
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,650
No one loves him as much as you.

182
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,430
Okay?

183
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,080
Thank you.

184
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,390
Don't make the grumpy face. You'll look old and ugly.

185
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,170
Hello, Meiji.

186
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,180
Wait, there's something on your face.

187
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,780
Okay, it's done.

188
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,230
Stay here and take care of her.

189
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,940
Okay.

190
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,760
Hi, Khemtid. What's up, hm?

191
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,710
Do you remember?

192
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,590
What's number 5 of golden rule is?

193
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,620
Er...

194
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
Now, me and Wela are together.

195
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,220
Now, me and Wela are together.

196
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,530
I don't want to hide it to you.

197
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,260
You know what?

198
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,370
Why do we have that rule?

199
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,110
Well, I knew it.

200
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,000
Do you think it wisely, Khemtid?

201
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,200
Today... you might be happy with him.

202
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,160
What's about in the future?

203
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,670
Have you thought about it?

204
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,690
Do you have enough patient?

205
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,720
I said as your mother.

206
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,160
And I'm really worried about you too.

207
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,680
Just think about it.

208
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,420
Khemtid.

209
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,380
We've a new guest, can you take care of them?

210
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,220
Got it.

211
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,100
Why he upset?

212
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,930
Bottoms up, bottoms up!

213
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,500
Oh!

214
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:16,970
Which table?

215
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,280
Well... that table.

216
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,150
VIP 2.

217
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,820
I'll do it for you.

218
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,290
Here's your cosmopolitan.

219
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,720
Let's dance.

220
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,700
Would you like anything else?

221
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,950
No, right?

222
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,920
Is it for VIP 2 table?

223
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,200
If yes, I'll serve it for you.

224
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,500
Why do you want do it?

225
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,780
Well... I...

226
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,330
It... It's close to me.

227
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,710
Other tables are close too.

228
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,100
I might get a tip.

229
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,610
Other tables can give you too.

230
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,800
Alright.

231
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,370
Because of you.

232
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,110
I like you.

233
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,600
I want to be closer to you.

234
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,930
But...

235
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,550
I don't know how to start.

236
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,020
So childly.

237
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,090
Take a rest.

238
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,570
I'll serve this for you.

239
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:51,790
So...

240
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,700
Can I hit on you?

241
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,730
Try it.

242
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,440
Hey!

243
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,460
What're you doing?!

244
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,870
This is work time.

245
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,790
That's right. Your work.

246
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,060
Isn't it?

247
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,640
You're expert, aren't you?

248
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,120
Is this?

249
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,740
Is this your perspective to my job?

250
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,980
I think you understand about Deep Night more than others.

251
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,930
But you are the same like them.

252
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,810
And I've told you that you're like Freya.

253
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,560
Actually, you don't.

254
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,700
And the employees at the club, they are so put in into their work.

255
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,810
If they heard you, how sad they will be? Understand?

256
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,180
What the fuck did I do?

257
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,730
Just eat, Japan.

258
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:53,630
Sorry.

259
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,010
I thought you were Japan since he often came to serve drinks at my table.

260
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,830
Don't get used to him.

261
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,070
Huh...

262
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,260
Tomorrow is day off.

263
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,910
Shall we go that place?

264
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,510
Deal.

265
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,430
Here.

266
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,410
Hello, uncle. Hello, everyone.

267
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,830
Hey, Nava.

268
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,570
I'll bring snacks for you.

269
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,280
- Thank you.
- No problems.

270
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,590
Keep sweeping.

271
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,850
Hello.

272
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,520
Here's for all of you.

273
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,440
Yes. Thank you.

274
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,110
Do you finish paying respect to your dad?

275
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,380
Yeah.

276
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,110
It reminds me to the past.

277
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,710
We had grown up in the temple.

278
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,070
We stole fish bread.

279
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,200
Fish could not eat the bread at all.

280
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,470
You stole it first.

281
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,660
It's yummy, man.

282
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,650
But I'm the one who is very good luck.

283
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,790
There is you in my all memories.

284
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,850
You have to take responsibility with this, Ken.

285
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,970
Be friend with me forever, shall you?

286
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,220
Sure.

287
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,850
Really?

288
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,330
Let's think about it again.

289
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
Being friend with me is boring.

290
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,620
If I'm bored, I won't be friend with you until now.

291
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,380
The word 'Forever'

292
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,130
I can give you always.

293
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,070
What's about if I got hit by a car and my legs are missed?

294
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,990
Will you still be my friend?

295
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,960
Sure. And I'll be your legs too.

296
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,640
What if

297
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,460
I got bitten by a shark and lost my arms.

298
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,580
Will you still be my friend?

299
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,660
Yeah.

300
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,890
I'll buy you this too.

301
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,270
Here.

302
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,190
No matter what, you got hit by a car,

303
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,230
a shark bites your arms,

304
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,560
bump your head at the pole,

305
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,730
you don't need to worry about it.

306
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,410
They'll pay for you.

307
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,870
But me,

308
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,920
I'll take care of you.

309
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,320
Pan.

310
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,390
Do you often come here?

311
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,480
Yes.

312
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,980
Quite often.

313
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,130
My grandma told me that a monk here is so good at fortune telling.

314
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,810
Why don't you go for a fortune telling.

315
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,240
No.

316
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,570
My grandma likes to eavesdrop what the fortune teller said.

317
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,010
Hey granny.

318
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,940
Granny, wait.

319
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,090
Hey.

320
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:50,710
Wanna go back home?

321
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,220
You told me you're free today.

322
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,550
What's wrong?

323
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,380
Here.

324
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,700
This is so good.

325
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,730
I want you to try it.

326
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,180
Let me do it.

327
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,000
Drink some water.

328
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,400
It will stuck in your throat.

329
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
You made a mess.

330
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,220
You made a mess like a child.

331
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,040
I wipe it.

332
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,880
He's mine. I wipe it by myself.

333
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,590
I wipe it.

334
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,760
-I wipe it
-I wipe it.

335
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,460
He's mine.

336
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,000
He's mine.

337
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,570
-He's mine.
-He's mine.

338
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,520
-He's mine.
-He's mine.

339
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,560
-He's mine.
-He's mine.

340
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,070
What are you guys playing?

341
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,830
We aren't playing.

342
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,290
We are flirting with you.

343
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,700
Better be ready for it.

344
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,300
Last night, I was flirted by many girls. I was on the cloud nine.

345
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,290
How?

346
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,970
Last night,

347
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,540
there were two guests.

348
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,230
After they came, they fought each other to buy drinks for me.

349
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,050
They were so pretty.

350
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,000
When I looked into their eyes,

351
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,360
I was almost melted.

352
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,780
They asked me out for more fun last night.

353
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,949
Oh hey.

354
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,300
Here.

355
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,520
I have to go.

356
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,150
Thank you.

357
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,410
See you again.

358
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,360
Okay. Bye-bye.

359
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,130
Yes, Ma'am.

360
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,690
Uh, sir.

361
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,380
There is male's passed fee for 1,000 Baht per person.

362
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,200
Okay. No problem.

363
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:31,730
Here.

364
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,370
And

365
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:37,790
this is

366
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,470
including the VIP room

367
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,160
and the number 1 host of here.

368
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,930
It's not his working period.

369
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,210
Are you interested in others?

370
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,720
I'll take you in and choose.

371
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,130
I'll take the number 2 or 3 then.

372
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,880
They take their time off today.

373
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:58,920
What the fuck.

374
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,550
You bring me the number 1 then.

375
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,550
Relax, sir.

376
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,090
I'll take you inthe club

377
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,670
and bring you the other hosts to choose.

378
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,990
I said that I want the number 1.

379
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,640
I told you. He's not available.

380
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,410
How the fuck he's not available? It's early in evening.

381
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,760
I told you. He's not available.

382
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,950
What is going on?

383
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,310
This motherfucker,

384
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,160
I told him I want the number 1 host.

385
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,280
I don't know why he's so grudge.

386
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,400
I told you. He's not available.

387
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,710
Why he's not available? It's still early in the evening.

388
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,650
He is really unavailable.

389
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,170
Khemtid.

390
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:24,980
What the fuck is wrong with you?

391
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,760
Stop.

392
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,210
Bring Wela.

393
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,570
I know that he's ready.

394
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,040
Now.

395
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,270
-But
-Khem

396
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,500
I've told you already

397
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,190
that this position has to take care of the guests

398
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,160
and match the host according to the guest's preference.

399
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:48,510
Dai.

400
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,010
Yes.

401
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,000
Bring Wela.

402
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,940
Yes, Madam.

403
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,730
This way, sir. I'll take you to the table.

404
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:55,860
Excellent.

405
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,710
Bottoms up!

406
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,260
You's cute.

407
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,290
I'm not surprised

408
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,140
that you got the number1.

409
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,560
Thank you.

410
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,880
Do you try to get me drunk?

411
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,280
You drink a little.

412
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,540
You won't be drunk, Pla.

413
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,230
-I'm drunk.
-Cheers!

414
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,380
Where are you going, Khemtid?

415
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,930
He molests Wela, look.

416
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,930
What molest? They're just talking.

417
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,580
If you're grudge like this, I'll tell the guards to look after him.

418
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,000
Go and take care of the guests over there.

419
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,890
You have the smooth skin.

420
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,340
Cheer!

421
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,970
Here we go. Here we go.

422
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,740
You can't.

423
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,060
You have to do this.

424
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,630
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

425
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,000
Careful, Pla. It's messy.

426
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,080
This can't bother me.

427
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,250
If I'm drunk,

428
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,610
will you take care of me?

429
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,980
Sure, Pla.

430
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,760
Really?

431
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,650
Hey.

432
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,880
What the fuck?

433
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,320
What the fuck is wrong with you?

434
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,880
Calm down, Pla

435
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,030
Why did you stop me?

436
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,270
Brother. Brother.

437
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,590
Let's dance.

438
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,240
Get in.

439
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:30,810
Let me go.

440
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,000
Khemtid.

441
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,960
I said let me go.

442
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,460
What's wrong?

443
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm working.

444
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,030
I saved you.

445
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,250
Save what?

446
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,150
That motherfucker

447
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,840
He's drunk, I have to take care of him.

448
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,350
I won't let you go.

449
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,350
Are you out of your mind?

450
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,930
This is my job.

451
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,380
I will make you to switch the table.

452
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,000
So, you won't be with that motherfucker again.

453
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,910
What did he do?

454
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,600
Everything is still in the boundary.

455
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,630
Boundary?

456
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,080
Boundary? Huh?

457
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,710
How wide is your boundary?

458
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,530
Is this your boundary?

459
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,170
What the hell are you doing?

460
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,140
Do you have the boundary only with me?

461
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,760
Why is it so hard having a boyfriend?

462
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,460
If it's that hard, just break up with him.

463
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,420
The fuck is break up?

464
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,290
Bruh.

465
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,080
If you don't want to break up,

466
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,750
just take care of him better than this.

467
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,800
How do I take care of him bad?

468
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,810
I look after him everyday.

469
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,320
Bro,

470
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,820
taking care

471
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,230
is not just physical or safety.

472
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,610
It's about here too.

473
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,210
It's tired having a handsome boyfriend.

474
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,980
Damn.

475
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,240
I'm sorry for disappearing so long, Pla.

476
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,830
Make yourself enjoy, dude. The host came.

477
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,030
Cheers!

478
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,650
Hurry up.

479
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,630
Don't be mad at me, Pla.

480
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,800
Don't let that happen again.

481
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,170
Okay.

482
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,440
Sorry.

483
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,750
Okay.

484
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,990
Let's cheers.

485
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,300
-Cheers!
-Go Go.

486
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,590
Go go.

487
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,340
Please ramain in calm.

488
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,610
I want your cooperation.

489
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,940
Do not go anywhere until we finish the investigation.

490
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,990
You guys go there.

491
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,300
Yes, sir. Follow me.

492
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,670
I'll walk you to the exit.

493
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,450
I'm so sorry for today.

494
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,410
Pla.

495
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,600
Is there anything illegal here?

496
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,960
Why the police often come here?

497
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,860
Our club has nothing illegal.

498
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,080
Really?

499
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,660
The passed fee is expensive.

500
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,020
The openned table fee is expensive.

501
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,880
And this, you want us to leave early.

502
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,610
Who will take the responsibility?

503
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,920
-If you come here next time
-Next time?

504
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,380
I won't come here.

505
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,010
I will go to the other club.

506
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,770
I'm pissed. I'm leaving.

507
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,140
Calm down.

508
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:14,990
Hello.

509
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,860
I have to cancel to the band for tonight.

510
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,000
I will pay every Baht.

511
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,270
The club has a little problem.

512
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,950
Say sorry to them for me.

513
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:35,710
Dai.

514
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,730
All the guests that are upset, I will pay them back.

515
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,050
Make the list for me.

516
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,240
Whether they want cash of credit for next visiting,

517
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,010
I will pay and return them all.

518
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,700
Yes, Dai.

519
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,490
I told you to make a list for me. Do you understand?

520
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:10,850
Have you been enough?

521
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,120
About this club?

522
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,610
I told you, it's too risk.

523
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,340
It's just a few month away from my graduation.

524
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,830
I can take care of you.

525
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,470
You don't have to waste your time on this.

526
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,830
Everyone is telling me to quit and stop.

527
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,110
But you know, Khem?

528
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,800
I had never lost my spirit.

529
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,980
Until the day that you told me like this.

530
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,800
So, I know that it is really true.

531
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,580
Everything that everyone said is true.

532
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,230
I have never made you proud of me.

533
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,480
Or is this our bad year.

534
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,480
We should make merit.

535
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,000
We don't have to make a merit.

536
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,580
Just bring the trouble out from here.

537
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,030
You talk about me?

538
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,430
This went too far.

539
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,900
There is clearly someone want to tease me.

540
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,620
Who did hire you?

541
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,930
Answer me.

542
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,920
I know that if I love something so much,

543
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,100
no matter how tired or hard it is,

544
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,410
I am ready to fight for it.
