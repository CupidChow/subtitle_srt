1
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,560
Go back to your life and forget about me.

2
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,320
Have you ever loved someone?
Is it that easy to stop loving them?

3
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,880
I got close to you without realizing that

4
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,280
you would misinterpret my intention.

5
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
You aren't allowed upstairs.

6
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,120
Mai…

7
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
Mai is back as a volunteer lawyer?

8
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,240
I'd love it if you would
open your heart to me.

9
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,560
Will you be my girlfriend?

10
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,440
I finally saw you after seven years.

11
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,280
But you have that inspector by your side.

12
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
That hurts like hell.

13
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,320
Fah.

14
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,920
Watch it, you brat. I'm your mom.

15
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,120
Gosh! She made a mess on my bed.

16
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,560
You did this again.

17
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,320
When will you learn your lesson?

18
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,440
What's the big deal?

19
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,320
This is someone's life
we're talking about.

20
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
When will you stop doing this?

21
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,560
Even if I don't do it for her,

22
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,400
she'll have someone else do it.

23
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,640
-Mom!
-What?

24
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,200
I called you here
so you can take her to see a doctor,

25
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,160
not for you to stand here and lecture me.

26
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,520
Or do you want her to die here?

27
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,720
That's fine by me.

28
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,640
Little girl.

29
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,040
Can you hear me, little girl?

30
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,760
-Little girl.
-"Little girl."

31
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,240
Come help her!

32
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,680
Why should I? That's your job.

33
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,320
Don't you work at the foundation?
You should help her.

34
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,040
Get up slowly, okay?

35
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,000
Do an ultrasound.

36
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:37,800
Page an obstetrician.

37
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,240
Did you turn your phone off, Mom?

38
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Hey. Fah.

39
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,520
I thought it was someone else.
How did you get in?

40
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,800
-I broke in.
-Are you crazy?

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
I would have to get the door fixed.

42
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,160
Do you know that girl almost died?

43
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,160
She's still unconscious.

44
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,200
How could you do it?

45
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,160
She asked me to do it.

46
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,440
-How could I refuse?
-Of course you could.

47
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,360
You have a job and a salary.

48
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,960
Yet you choose to make easy money
without caring who you hurt.

49
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,600
Just like how you never cared for me.

50
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,080
Who said I didn't care?

51
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,360
If it weren't for me,

52
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,760
you would've died long ago.

53
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,240
You wouldn't be
standing here yelling at me.

54
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
I worked my butt off to provide for you.

55
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,320
You didn't provide for me.

56
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,880
Of course I did.

57
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,480
I raised you for almost ten years.

58
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Do you think you're a saint

59
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,480
now that you're working
for the foundation?

60
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
Don't forget.

61
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,360
Isn't it because of you

62
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,160
that I'm in this position?

63
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,680
You brat!

64
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,240
All right.

65
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,000
Then let us pay
for what we did together today.

66
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,440
What will you do?

67
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,680
I already called the police.

68
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,160
They're probably on their way here.

69
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Fah, did you call the police on me?

70
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,680
If you don't escape in time,
they will put you in jail.

71
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,960
You bitch. Let me go.

72
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
I'm screwed.

73
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,800
You little brat.

74
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
I'll make you pay for this.

75
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
-Here you go.
-All right.

76
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
-Thank you.
-Well done.

77
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,000
All right.
Let's drink to our new attorney.

78
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,640
Good job! Cheers!

79
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,520
-Cheers!
-Hooray!

80
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,240
Congratulations on getting
your license on your first try.

81
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,360
I had to take the exam three times.
Very good job, Nicha.

82
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,000
Mai tutored me.

83
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,960
I wouldn't be able
to do it without his help.

84
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,240
The exam was so hard.

85
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,360
Mai is like Superman.

86
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,360
He got his license
and passed the bar in one year.

87
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,120
How did you do it?

88
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,360
It's incredible.

89
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
We should celebrate.

90
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,960
How about we go get drinks tonight?

91
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,440
So it's a no.

92
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,600
No need to give me that look.

93
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,400
Since you got your license,
what kind of cases do you want to work on?

94
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,680
I'll arrange it for you.

95
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I don't know yet, Ek.

96
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,160
I can't decide right now.

97
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,800
What about you, Mai?

98
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,600
I'll leave it up to you.
But I'd like to work on criminal cases.

99
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,840
Once I have enough experience,
I want to become a prosecutor.

100
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,640
Why a prosecutor?

101
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,080
I want to help people get justice.

102
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,280
I want to do what I can.

103
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,080
Come on, man.

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
You're handsome, smart, and capable.

105
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,040
You're outshining us in everything.

106
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,560
I really admire you
for having such a clear purpose.

107
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,240
You make me feel like a slacker.

108
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,120
You wouldn't be able to get your license
if you were a slacker.

109
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,800
Hey, Chol. Are you heading home?

110
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,960
There's nothing for me to do, so why stay?

111
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,960
Hello.

112
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,039
That's right. I'm Chenchanok's father.
What's the matter?

113
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,840
-Chol!
-Chol!

114
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,840
Chol.

115
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,960
Don't worry, Nicha.
Chol and I are at the hospital.

116
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,720
I'm Chenchanok's father.
How is my daughter?

117
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,400
-I'll call you later.
-The patient is out of danger.

118
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,680
But you can't see her yet
since she's still very weak.

119
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,200
Can I have a look?

120
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,360
I just want to have a look at her.

121
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,160
Sure. This way, sir.

122
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,760
Go ahead. I'll wait around here.

123
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,920
Thank you so much for driving me here.

124
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,280
What a coincidence.

125
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,800
So…

126
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,000
What are you doing here?

127
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,320
Are you sick or are you visiting someone?

128
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,280
Neither.

129
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm here with a colleague.

130
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,400
What about you?

131
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm visiting someone.

132
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,080
I'll see you later.
I need to check on my colleague.

133
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,240
Chol!

134
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,360
Chol, don't!

135
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
Mai, let me go!

136
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,720
-Let go of me! Let go!
-Chol.

137
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,160
Mai, let me go!

138
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,000
Do you want to get your wound dressed?

139
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,480
No.

140
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,360
Thank you.

141
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,360
Just don't hurt yourself again.

142
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,600
It's my life.

143
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,840
I can do what I want.
It's none of your business.

144
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,120
You won't die from hurting yourself here.

145
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,800
You're releasing your anger.

146
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,880
If that's what you want to do,

147
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,680
think of your sick daughter.

148
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,880
I mean no offense.

149
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
I don't know what happened to you.

150
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,240
I don't know what happened to the guy

151
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,480
who Ek said was the best at the firm.

152
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,960
But what I know is that

153
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,720
your daughter needs you
the most right now.

154
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,040
You shouldn't hurt yourself again.

155
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
You've done that enough.

156
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,760
You won't understand.

157
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,960
You can never understand
what happened to my life.

158
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,080
It's a wretched life.

159
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
What should I do?

160
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,400
Do you want to come with me?

161
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,720
Let me hold the umbrella.

162
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,120
I think it's been seven years
since we last saw each other.

163
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,120
Yes. Something like that.

164
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,760
You've come so far.

165
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,440
You finished school
and now you're a lawyer.

166
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,680
I wanted to have a good life.

167
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,480
Higher education helped me
get to where I want to be.

168
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,400
Why are you smiling?

169
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,560
I'm smiling because
you're the same person you always were.

170
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,400
You're determined
and you manage to get what you want.

171
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,680
No.

172
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,120
I don't get everything I want.

173
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,760
What do you mean?

174
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,760
Just things in general.

175
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,920
We can't always get everything we want.

176
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,320
I'll take off now.

177
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,680
Fon.

178
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,480
Your umbrella.

179
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,480
You can hold on to it.
In case it rains again.

180
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
I'll give it back next time we meet.

181
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,600
Where are you going so early?

182
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,760
I thought you'd sleep in on your day off.

183
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,080
You'll just nag me if I sleep in.

184
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,560
You're a grownup and you've graduated.

185
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,960
You even got a lawyer's license.

186
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,880
I have nothing to nag about.

187
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,920
Come on, Dad.

188
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,400
You can still nag me.
You haven't done it for years.

189
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,200
I get lonely.

190
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,520
If you're lonely,
you should find yourself a boyfriend.

191
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,680
I'm not against it anymore.

192
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,320
I actually want you to have one.

193
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,200
You just want me out of the house.

194
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
You can't get rid of me that easily.

195
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,880
See you later.

196
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
How would I know what she likes?

197
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,960
She's two years old.

198
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,800
Why don't you buy it yourself?

199
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,480
Do you think I like kids that much?

200
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,640
I like kids.

201
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,960
I love them.

202
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
I love kids more than anything.

203
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
I'll call you later.

204
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,480
Are you buying toys for your cousins?

205
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,240
Do you need my help?
I'm great at picking toys for kids.

206
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,520
No, thank you.

207
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,320
Wait, miss.

208
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,920
Miss. Hey, miss.

209
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,440
Why?

210
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,840
I look so handsome.

211
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,320
Why was she so scared of me?

212
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,080
Fon.

213
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,600
Are you sure you can go with Mai?

214
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,080
I'm sure.

215
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,800
We met at the hospital yesterday
and we talked.

216
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,240
Did you meet Mai yesterday?

217
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,800
Yes. We ran into each other.

218
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,360
I guess you can't run from him forever

219
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,000
since you have to work together.

220
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm really okay. Don't worry about me.

221
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,920
I'll get going now.

222
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,520
Good luck.

223
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
Mhai.

224
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,040
You're still here, Rey?

225
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,400
What's the beef between Fon and Mai?

226
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,560
What?

227
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,240
I mean, what happened between them?

228
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
It's none of your business.

229
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,240
Get back to work.

230
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,080
My firm let me use the car today.

231
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,800
Get in.

232
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,160
We're half an hour early.

233
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,280
Do you want to go in now or wait?

234
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,880
I guess we can wait in the car.

235
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Mai.

236
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,200
Yes?

237
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,520
I'm uncomfortable.

238
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,520
Are you uncomfortable with me?

239
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,360
Yes.

240
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,160
I mean, no.

241
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm uncomfortable because

242
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,920
we have nothing to talk about.

243
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,840
What should we talk about?

244
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,840
I don't know.

245
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
What?

246
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,520
Just forget it.

247
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,000
Fon.

248
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,040
You should be glad that I'm like this.

249
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,920
I'm not chasing after you
and making you uncomfortable.

250
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,080
I only came back to the foundation
to repay my debt.

251
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,600
Does hearing that make you
more comfortable with me?

252
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,400
No.

253
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,040
That's too bad.

254
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,800
Think what you will then.
I don't know how to please you.

255
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,400
How have you been all this time?

256
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,240
Did you have a hard life?

257
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,200
How did you get through it?

258
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,040
I want to thank you

259
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,600
for living a good life.

260
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,640
I've been waiting for the chance
to tell you I'm sorry.

261
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
I want to tell you

262
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,400
that I'm really sorry
for what I said to you that day.

263
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
I didn't mean to say it, but…

264
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,440
I didn't know what else to say.

265
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,320
About everything that happened,

266
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,400
it wasn't your fault at all.

267
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,760
It was my fault
for letting you into my life.

268
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,560
I think we should go in now.

269
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,640
That's good.
Now I won't have to worry anymore.

270
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,640
-Pick one.
-Which one do you want?

271
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,760
-This one? Pick one.
-You want this one?

272
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,720
-You want a bag?
-You want the pink one?

273
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,120
Here you go.

274
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,480
-You want this one too?
-It's a tough choice.

275
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,480
Nicha.

276
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,880
-Take the knife, Rey.
-Okay.

277
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,360
Call an ambulance.

278
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
-Get me a clean cloth.
-Okay.

279
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,320
-We're here, Nicha.
-My gosh.

280
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,960
Nicha, can you hear me?

281
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,840
Will Fon come back here?

282
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,160
I don't know if she'll make it.

283
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,840
She has an urgent case, so she's out
with our new volunteer lawyer.

284
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,240
Do you have a volunteer lawyer now?

285
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,040
Goodness. I wonder who that is.

286
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,880
They beat me to the punch.
I'm not ready to do that yet.

287
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,480
It's more than enough
that you come to visit us.

288
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,960
How long has it been
since we last saw each other?

289
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,160
Two years.

290
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,280
But I see Fon often.

291
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,640
We meet up outside the foundation.

292
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,680
I see that you really love Fon.

293
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,800
She's the best.

294
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,560
Hello. What's up, Nicha?

295
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,920
I can talk. I'm done with the case.
I'm about to head back.

296
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,680
Are you at the foundation?

297
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,480
Okay. I'll see you soon.

298
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,560
All right.

299
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,880
Is someone waiting for you?

300
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,800
It's just a girl I know.

301
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,080
She's visiting the foundation.

302
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,160
Nicha.

303
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,080
Fon.

304
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,520
I missed you.

305
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,600
I heard you went out
with a volunteer lawyer.

306
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,200
Why are you back alone?

307
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,240
He dropped me off at the front and left.

308
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,920
I see.

309
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,280
I bought you snacks. Let's go eat.

310
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,720
-You bought me snacks?
-That's right. Here.

311
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,600
-You bought me things again.
-Here you go.

312
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,000
Hello, ma'am.

313
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,240
Mai.

314
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,160
Mai.

315
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,080
God bless you, dear.

316
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,400
Thank you so much for not forgetting me.

317
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,400
How could I ever forget you?
You're like a mother to me.

318
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,120
Mom, you're smiling from ear to ear.

319
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,600
Watch it, Bee. I can still smack you.

320
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,840
Since Mai's here, let's go eat
something delicious tonight.

321
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Gosh. Butt out, Bell.
Mai's going out with me tonight.

322
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,560
Come on. I want to come too.

323
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,240
Mai, can I come with you?

324
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,040
Sure. You should come too, ma'am.

325
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,720
All right.
Can we go after the shop's closed?

326
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,720
Okay.

327
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,840
You heard him, Bee.

328
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,080
Fine.

329
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,560
I'll go get dressed.

330
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,520
Goodness.

331
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,600
My sister keeps acting like a child.

332
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,160
Give Bell a break.

333
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,400
She's more mature than you think.

334
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,240
-Bell is mature?
-That's right.

335
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,400
She really is.

336
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,240
What makes you think she's mature?

337
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,160
Your sister is actually
a very intelligent girl.

338
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,720
How so?

339
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,120
What are you looking at me for?

340
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,520
I know about
all the despicable things you do.

341
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,400
What do you mean by that, you brat?

342
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,200
I taught you everything.

343
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,320
Are you going to betray me?

344
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,920
You only taught me bad things.

345
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,760
I can never do what you want me to do.

346
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,400
You can be a scumbag all by yourself.

347
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,240
Mai, you asshole!

348
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,600
Get out of here! Get lost!

349
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,200
If you won't go, I'll tell the boss

350
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,680
to put your ass in jail.

351
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,920
Do you think I don't know what you did?

352
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,440
You stole things from here
and sold them for money.

353
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,160
You also took outside jobs
repairing air conditioners

354
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,120
for people in your flat.

355
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,040
Come on. Help me stop them.

356
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,400
Let me go! Let go!

357
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,600
Let go of me!

358
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,440
Mai! I'll call the cops on you!

359
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,480
You tried to kill me.
Everyone here saw it.

360
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,360
-Hey!
-Grab him!

361
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,840
I'll tell the boss what you did.

362
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,280
You jackass! Let's go!

363
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,640
Well? Will you tell me or not?

364
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,280
After I moved out of your house,

365
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,200
I was wasting my life away.

366
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,480
I barely had a future.

367
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,480
Then Bell found me one day.

368
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,920
Mai!

369
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
I'll tell Mom and Bee that I found you.

370
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,720
Bell, leave me alone. You should go.

371
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,560
Why?

372
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,160
Just go. Don't come back
and keep this to yourself.

373
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,040
I don't want to see anyone.

374
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,800
Why not?

375
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,360
Please, Bell. Leave me alone.

376
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,520
But I mean well.

377
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,160
Bee has been looking for you
since you moved out.

378
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,640
Why do you not want
anyone to know where you are?

379
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,160
I have my reasons.

380
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,720
You're a kid. You won't understand.

381
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,760
How am I a kid? I'm in high school now.

382
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,520
You don't know what real life is like.

383
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,000
My life isn't some kind of soap opera

384
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,880
you can pry into
to indulge your curiosity.

385
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,240
You've changed, Mai.

386
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,640
To be honest,

387
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,440
you used to be someone I looked up to.

388
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,880
I don't know what caused you to change.

389
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,040
But you've changed for the worse.

390
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,560
Soon you'll have no one left in your life.

391
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,160
In my eyes,

392
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,360
you've lost your worth.

393
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,640
That's your sister for you.

394
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,240
She helped me come to my senses.

395
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,640
Bell is a badass.

396
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,280
She's even more mature than you and me.

397
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,200
Well, I'm glad anyway

398
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,120
to have a good friend like you back.

399
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,920
By the way,

400
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,960
I have something to tell you.

401
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,560
What is it?

402
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,720
Today, I finally met my dream girl.

403
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,680
Another one?

404
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,400
What do you mean?
I've never felt this way about anyone.

405
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,680
I'm sick of hearing it.

406
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,120
Hey, Mai.

407
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Mai, I'm serious. Come on.

408
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Come back. Just listen to me.

409
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,280
She's really cute, man.

410
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,080
PORK TOM YUM NOODLE SOUP

411
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,560
PORK TOM YUM NOODLE SOUP

412
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,720
Thank you.

413
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,199
Why did you wreck my shop?

414
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,159
Why did you wreck my shop?

415
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,199
Why?

416
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,679
Why did you destroy that man's property?

417
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,400
Do you want to be put in jail?

418
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,000
So will you put me in jail?

419
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,760
Of course! You bet I will.

420
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,000
The victim filed a complaint against you.

421
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,280
You're done for.

422
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,000
Officer! Chet!

423
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,840
Hello.

424
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,880
Why did you do this?

425
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,880
I've told you not to do it.

426
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,600
Why did you cause trouble for everyone?

427
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,920
Officer, I'm really sorry

428
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,960
for Chet's behavior.

429
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,320
I'd like to talk to the victim
and pay for all the damages.

430
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,320
Boy, you don't know how lucky you are

431
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,800
getting to live with Ms. Duan.

432
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,600
She's such a generous
and kind-hearted woman.

433
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,120
Officer, please. You're exaggerating.

434
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,120
I'm not, ma'am.
When I go on patrol in the morning,

435
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,520
I always see you give alms
to the monks every day.

436
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,920
You're making me blush.

437
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,640
It's not just the monks.
I also give food to people.

438
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,880
So let me know if you officers
would like to eat something.

439
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,720
I'll bring it for you next time.

440
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,720
It brings great merit to be generous
towards good people like you.

441
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,760
Do you see?

442
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,760
You've been given an opportunity
to have a better life.

443
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,160
Ma'am, what's your relationship
with the offender?

444
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm his caretaker, Inspector.

445
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,280
Chet has always been emotionally unstable
even before I took him in.

446
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,920
I'd like to ask you
to show him some kindness

447
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,960
and sympathy just like I do towards him.

448
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,840
You're the boy's caretaker?

449
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,080
That's right.
Chet's parents are both dead.

450
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,040
Does Chet also work for you?

451
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Well, he doesn't have to do much.

452
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,360
He helps out with the chores
around the house.

453
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,480
But I make sure he's taken care of
and I also give him money to spend.

454
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,880
POL.MAJ. SUPHANUT TANABUMRUNGRUANG

455
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,720
Inspector, please show Chet some kindness.

456
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,200
He's a really pitiful boy.

457
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,000
If the station is in need of something,

458
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,560
I'll be happy to make a donation.

459
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,840
I consider myself a philanthropist.

460
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,320
Does the plaintiff's co-counsel
have any questions?

461
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,400
On the night of July 13,

462
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,400
you said you were at home.

463
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,520
Is that correct?

464
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,080
That's right.

465
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,480
-Were you at home all night?
-I was.

466
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,280
But an eyewitness saw you leave
the house to attack the victim that night.

467
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,680
That's not true.

468
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,480
I've been framed. I didn't do it.

469
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,080
They are in on it together.

470
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,640
Are you denying that
you assaulted the victim?

471
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,400
I am.

472
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,280
No further questions.

473
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,400
Chol.

474
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,880
MATERIAL EVIDENCE

475
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,560
I have additional questions, Your Honor.

476
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,520
Is it relevant to the case?

477
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,760
It is of relevance
to the case, Your Honor.

478
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,080
Let us hear it then.

479
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,320
What's your question about?

480
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,000
It's about the weapon that
the defendant used to commit the crime.

481
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,760
You may proceed.

482
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,720
Do you see this knife?

483
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,960
I've never seen it.

484
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,120
Look at the picture carefully.

485
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,600
Do you remember this knife?

486
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,280
I've never seen it.

487
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,400
This knife was used to assault
the victim on the night of July 13.

488
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,720
I don't know.
I told you I've never seen it before.

489
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,520
But the forensic examination results
show that your fingerprints and DNA

490
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,320
are on this knife…

491
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,560
according to these exams.

492
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,480
Are the facts correct?

493
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,480
Get in here, you brat.

494
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,000
How dare you, Chet?

495
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,560
Did you think doing this
would help get you out of here?

496
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,760
Do you know

497
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,480
how much I had to pay
for the damage you caused?

498
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,440
You had the nerve
to run to the police for help.

499
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,080
Did you think it would work?

500
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,600
You thought wrong.

501
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,840
I'm close friends
with all the police at the station.

502
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,440
You'll never be able
to run away from me, Chet.

503
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,560
I won't do it again, ma'am.

504
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,120
Do you know what I think?

505
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,560
I think you did what you did
because you have too much energy.

506
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,280
You have some nerves.

507
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,040
I think…

508
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,640
I'll make you unable to walk.

509
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,920
-I'm scared.
-So you don't misbehave again.

510
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,280
Please don't hurt me!

511
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,520
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

512
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,200
You wouldn't dare do it in the first place
if you knew it was wrong.

513
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,360
I'm scared.

514
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,920
You two. He dares disrespect me.

515
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,600
Get over here and beat him
until I tell you to stop.

516
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,040
Beat him!

517
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,240
I'm sorry!

518
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,600
Please forgive me!

519
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,800
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

520
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,760
I'm sorry for calling you here.

521
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,080
But I want you
to take a look at something.

522
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,440
I think this case is strange,
so I'd like your opinion.

523
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,720
Why did he act like
he wanted to get caught?

524
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
You're right. It's really strange.

525
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,960
Here.

526
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
He's a 17-year-old orphan.

527
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,800
He has bruises on his body.

528
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,960
His caretaker said that he hurt himself

529
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,120
and that he has mental issues.

530
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,000
That's possible.

531
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,040
How is the caretaker related to the boy?

532
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,480
They're not related.

533
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,040
It seems that she's a charitable woman
who likes to help others.

534
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,160
She's a banquet service provider.

535
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,480
Thank you, Mai. I know it's a lot of work.

536
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,080
It's fine. I'm on it.

537
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,960
Hey, Fon. I thought you left.

538
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,800
I left my stuff here,
so I came back for it.

539
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,400
Is something wrong?

540
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,320
Mhai.

541
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,360
I have a suspicious case.

542
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,600
There's a teenager
who might've been abused.

543
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,560
I'm not sure if we should get involved.

544
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,240
Tell me the details.

545
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,200
Can I listen too?

546
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,880
I might be able to help.

547
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,480
It's fine if you don't want help.

548
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,640
I don't mind.

549
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,200
Three heads are better than two.

550
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
So what happened?

551
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,880
Hey. Get up.

552
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,000
Here. Madam said you've been
lazing around, so this is all you get.

553
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
The rice's gone bad.

554
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,560
So? You can't work right now,
so you don't get to eat good food.

555
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,240
Just eat your rice.

556
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,400
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

557
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,720
I'll look into the case you told me about.

558
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,320
It's fine.

559
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,720
You already have tons of work
from working two jobs.

560
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,920
I'll look into it myself.

561
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,640
You and Mhai are women. It's dangerous.

562
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,200
It's safer if I go.

563
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,840
I've been doing this for over ten years.

564
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,520
I know what's safe and what's dangerous.

565
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,200
It'd be bad if something went wrong,

566
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
especially since I know about the case.

567
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,200
Hey.

568
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,680
Are you jinxing me?

569
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,680
I'm not jinxing you.

570
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,440
But this job is too risky for women.

571
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,520
Just come with me then
if you're so worried.

572
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,680
But…

573
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,520
maybe we shouldn't.

574
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,840
Don't overthink it. It's just work.

575
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
This is it.

576
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,600
This is the house where the boy lives.

577
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,720
We'll tell them we are
brother and sister, all right?

578
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,240
Let me do the talking.

579
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
Why are you smiling?

580
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,360
I'm the foundation's volunteer lawyer.

581
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,720
I'm here to do my job.

582
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,640
I'm not here as your friend.

583
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,240
Hey.

584
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,760
Move it, will you? You're all so sluggish.

585
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,960
You all eat like horses.

586
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,680
Yet you work like sloths.

587
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,960
Get on with it.

588
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,960
Hello.

589
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,720
Are you here for someone?

590
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,080
-I'm here to ask about--
-Hello.

591
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,280
Do you provide a Chinese banquet service?

592
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,800
That's right.

593
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,920
So what's the occasion for the banquet?

594
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,600
My brother is planning to ordain.

595
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,800
So I'd like to host a banquet
that has about 50 tables.

596
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,000
Have a look at our menu then.

597
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,560
All right.

598
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,560
My parents are very particular
when it comes to food.

599
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
Are there any dishes that we can try?

600
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,080
Do you want to try the food?

601
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,600
I normally don't let anyone try the food
since our clients trust in our cooking.

602
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,360
Most of our clients are referred
to us by word of mouth.

603
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,120
But after the ordination,

604
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,120
my brother is getting married.

605
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,000
If we like the food, we'll hire you
to cater the wedding as well.

606
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,000
We're actually not siblings.

607
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,120
She's embarrassed
to be with a younger guy.

608
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,280
We'll hire you if we like the food.

609
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,440
Well, please come with me
to the kitchen then.

610
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,560
This is my kitchen.

611
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,960
Everything here is clean and sanitary.

612
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,480
Can you make crispy fish maw salad
and fish maw soup for the clients to try?

613
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,680
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,520
It will be a while
before the food is ready.

615
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,040
Would you like to wait outside?

616
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,320
Please come with me.

617
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,920
That's all right. We can wait here.

618
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,680
I'd like to watch
the cook prepare the food.

619
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,920
Is that so?

620
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,680
You don't want to sit down?

621
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,560
We'll be fine.

622
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,280
Where's the bathroom?

623
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,560
It's to the left just outside the kitchen.

624
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,160
Thank you.

625
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,920
Who's in there? Is it Chet?

626
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,720
Who are you?

627
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,080
I'm a lawyer. I'm here to help Chet.

628
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,840
Are you Chet?

629
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,840
I'm Chet.

630
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,880
Please help me.

631
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,680
They locked me up in here.

632
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,480
I want to get out of here.

633
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,600
I don't want to die.

634
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,960
Listen to me, Chet.

635
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,880
I'll get the police to help you.

636
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,840
But can you write me a message
to confirm your story

637
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,080
that you've been abused and imprisoned?

638
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,080
Here, Chet.

639
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,080
I don't know how to write.

640
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,480
-Dech!
-Yes, ma'am.

641
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,560
-What is it?
-Dech.

642
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,000
Hurry and go look.
There's someone in the back.

643
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,880
-I'm on it.
-Hurry.

644
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,120
Show the police my blood.

645
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,600
So they will come and help me.

646
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,000
This isn't enough, Chet.

647
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,360
Sir, where have you been?

648
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,280
What's the matter?

649
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,640
I went to check the bathroom,
but you weren't there.

650
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,920
I liked your garden,
so I went to have a look.

651
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,480
I even saw you pass by.

652
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,840
Is something wrong?

653
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,320
No. Everything's fine.

654
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,640
I was just worried.

655
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,320
There's a dog here.

656
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,000
It's a ferocious dog,
so you might get bitten.

657
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,040
You shouldn't wander around.

658
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,240
I apologize.

659
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
It's all right.

660
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,400
It's really good.

661
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,160
Try it, Mai.

662
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,480
This also tastes nice.

663
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,560
Shall we sign a catering contract then?

664
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,360
-We want--
-We want our parents to try the food too.

665
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,720
What? You won't sign the contract,
but you want to take the food home?

666
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,840
Don't worry.

667
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,480
I'll pay for these two dishes.

668
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,040
But we need time to think
before we make a decision.

669
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,680
This is good, Mai. Try it.

670
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,280
Their food is actually quite tasty.

671
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,640
Too bad you had to pay for it, Fon.

672
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,920
Mai paid for it.

673
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,720
How could you let Mai pay?

674
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,040
It's fine. Think of it
as my treat for you and Rey.

675
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,200
You're so sweet, Mai.

676
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,280
So did you find anything?

677
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,040
Just a bloodstained piece of paper.

678
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,480
The police will need more evidence
to get a search warrant.

679
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,960
I asked around the neighborhood
about that house and got nothing.

680
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,600
Just that a lot of teenagers live there.

681
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,720
I think we need
to gather more information.

682
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,080
I got a number from someone
who goes there often.

683
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,520
We can try calling them.

684
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,960
Seeing us now makes me
think back to many years ago.

685
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,440
I never thought
you would become our lawyer.

686
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,880
You're right, Mhai.

687
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,720
I'm so happy that
you're here to help us, Mai.

688
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,960
From now on, it will be easier for us
to handle complicated stuff

689
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,040
like lawsuits and all the legal cases.

690
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,680
Because we have
a lawyer like Mai to help us.

691
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,240
Well, I'll call the person
who might give us a lead.

692
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,800
What a fussy bunch.

693
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,160
They made me cook for them and left.
What a waste of time.

694
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,120
Hey, has Chet gone back to work?

695
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,960
Not yet, ma'am. He's still feverish.

696
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,400
What a wuss.

697
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,280
Give me that.

698
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,080
Get up and get to work.
Stop lazing around.

699
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,280
I'm not feeling well, ma'am.

700
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,120
That's your problem, not mine.

701
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,600
But don't be a freeloader.

702
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,680
You're not here to be a watchdog.

703
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,560
I keep you here
so you can work for me. Get up.

704
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,120
Will you get up?

705
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,880
-Get up!
-Ma'am!

706
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,480
Pae ran away again.

707
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,960
Does he dare to cross me?

708
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,920
Did he not learn his lesson?

709
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,320
We'll see about that.

710
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,560
That's right.
I visit that house regularly.

711
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,000
What do you do again?

712
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,720
I'm an electrician.

713
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,080
Madam always calls me in to fix things.

714
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,440
She may have lots of boys there,
but all of them are uneducated.

715
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,280
That's why Chet said
he didn't know how to write.

716
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,760
Of course not.

717
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,160
Madam took those homeless boys in.

718
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,040
But none of them get to go to school.

719
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,280
So she uses this
as leverage to keep the boys there.

720
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,040
Because they're illiterate.

721
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,560
I sometimes see her
give the boys a beating.

722
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,200
I can barely watch. I feel bad for them.

723
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,920
So the boys want to escape.

724
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,880
Officer, have you found my boy?

725
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,400
Right.

726
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,320
Please wait a moment.

727
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,440
I was notified that
he's with the police now.

728
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,200
They're bringing him to the station.

729
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,280
-There he is.
-Why did you arrest me? Let me go.

730
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,640
Pae, give me back my gold.

731
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,880
Gold? I didn't take it.

732
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,400
Stop lying!

733
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,400
I forgave you
every time you stole from me.

734
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,080
But let me tell you.
I won't forgive you this time.

735
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,120
Officer.

736
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,880
This boy is a thief.

737
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,520
He's a threat to society.

738
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,840
He needs to be locked up.

739
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,520
No way. I didn't steal
from you. It wasn't me.

740
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,680
We'll lock you up.

741
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,480
-That will teach you a lesson. Come here.
-No!

742
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,080
Come with me.

743
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,600
Every time the boys run away,

744
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,880
she manages to bring them back.

745
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,840
Sometimes she tells the police
the boys stole from her.

746
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,840
But those boys are uneducated.

747
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,040
They don't know what to do,
so they end up in a detention center.

748
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,480
Is there any way we can help Chet?

749
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,280
It will be difficult.

750
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,040
Madam portrays herself
as a kind and generous person.

751
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,080
But what do I know? You're a lawyer.

752
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,920
You're from the foundation.

753
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,720
You may be able to help the boys.

754
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,840
I'd like you to help them.
I feel bad for them.

755
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,960
That serves Pae right.

756
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,840
Doesn't he know that a good person like me

757
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,960
can do no wrong in others' eyes?

758
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,400
How will you get home?

759
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,600
I'll probably take a cab.

760
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,200
I'll give you a ride.
You shouldn't take a cab alone.

761
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,880
Colleagues can give
each other rides, right?

762
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,120
Thank you.

763
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,880
You don't mind riding
with a poor lawyer, right?

764
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,720
Why would I mind?

765
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,920
I was just wondering.

766
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,960
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

767
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,600
Mai, are you stopping to get something?

768
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,520
Food.

769
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,320
What? Aren't you full from earlier?

770
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,120
I am.

771
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,400
The food is for you.

772
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,160
Why are you buying me food?

773
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,120
You haven't eaten anything,
not even a single bite.

774
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,720
I'm not hungry.

775
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,320
Are you sure?

776
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,280
You're not hungry?

777
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I'm only eating
because you ordered so much.

778
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,880
To wash the food down.

779
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,280
Would you let yourself go hungry
if I didn't take you to eat?

780
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,000
I have snacks in my room.

781
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,360
I won't let myself starve.

782
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,800
You're abusing yourself.

783
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,240
Why do you care about me?

784
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,880
Aren't you mad at me?

785
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,320
It'd be too petty of me
not to care for my colleague.

786
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,360
Thank you for the ride.

787
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,640
You should go home.

788
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,760
Fon.

789
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,440
Don't worry about Chet.

790
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,440
I'll find a way to help him.

791
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,720
I'll try to help him as well.

792
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,080
Wait.

793
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,040
See you tomorrow.

794
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,040
All right. I'll head in now.

795
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,680
Get home safe.

796
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,920
Okay. Thank you.

797
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,080
Would you let yourself go hungry
if I didn't take you to eat?

798
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,280
I have snacks in my room.

799
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,560
I won't let myself starve.

800
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,000
You're abusing yourself.

801
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,520
Why do you care about me?

802
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,200
Aren't you mad at me?

803
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,960
You cacti have it easy, you know?

804
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,440
Today, I met an orphan who has
even worse teenage years than me.

805
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,040
His name is Chet.

806
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,080
Why are you always in my mind?

807
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,120
How have you been all this time?

808
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,280
How did you get through it?

809
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,600
I want to tell you

810
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,400
that I'm really sorry
for what I said to you that day.

811
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,280
Is Chol telling on you?

812
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,400
He keeps looking at you.

813
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,440
It's probably nothing.

814
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,800
You can't trust him.

815
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,240
He's a bit nuts these days.
He's not his old self.

816
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,720
Thank you.

817
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,040
What's up, Ek?

818
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,400
I want you to take this case.

819
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,680
This is…

820
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,840
Why did you give it to me?

821
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,880
Chol said you're ready.

822
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,200
And you're familiar with the case.

823
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,520
-Chol.
-What's up?

824
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,360
Why do you think I can take on
such an important case?

825
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,120
You're ready.

826
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,120
But this is a big case.

827
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,040
Only because
there's a lot of money involved.

828
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,080
It's just another case.

829
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,920
You have good legal knowledge
and you're thorough.

830
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,480
You're quick-witted and trustworthy.

831
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,040
You have all the qualities
that a good lawyer should have.

832
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,200
You only lack experience.

833
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,120
And this will be
the most important experience for you.

834
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,760
Thank you, Chol.

835
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,840
Believe in yourself.

836
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,040
Like how I believe in you.

837
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,320
Yes, Chol.

838
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,600
I'll believe you when I see
that there's nothing on your phone.

839
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,920
You.

840
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,720
-Stop right there!
-Fon!

841
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,240
You can't do this. Let her go.

842
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,720
Butt out!

843
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,680
Fon.

844
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,040
Mai?

845
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,200
I don't want Mai to know about my past.

846
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,240
Can you not tell him about it?

847
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,160
I already called
your personal chauffeur here.

848
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,280
Personal chauffeur?

849
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,600
That's right.

850
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,200
Let me give you a ride.

851
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:31,200
