1
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,680
<i>If you don't do as I say,</i>

2
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,920
<i>I'll destroy everything
and everyone in your life.</i>

3
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,960
<i>Then I'll destroy you.</i>

4
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,800
If it were up to me,
I'd rather you not leave my side.

5
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,360
Do you know you're in my spot?

6
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,880
I'm looking for a new place.

7
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,480
I can't stay at my apartment anymore.

8
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,920
There's actually one place.

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,880
- Where?
- Here.

10
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,400
You can share the apartment with me.
I'll charge you 2,000 baht.

11
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,520
<i>Sleep on the bed tonight</i>

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,320
or I'll carry you to bed myself.

13
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,560
I…

14
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,960
I just wanted to tuck you in.

15
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,760
Good night.

16
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,000
Why did you want to see me, Fon?

17
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
Well…

18
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,760
I just found out from Mai
that you were also at the court yesterday.

19
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,600
That's right.

20
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,880
I ran into Mai at the court.

21
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,400
But nothing happened.

22
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Don't worry.

23
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
Nicha.

24
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,680
I just want to explain myself to you.

25
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,800
I had a problem yesterday.

26
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,200
Mai helped me out, so I just
tagged along to the court with him.

27
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,080
So you don't have feelings for Mai?

28
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,040
If you and Mai like each other,

29
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
that's not wrong.

30
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,280
You and Mai are the two people I love.

31
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
I…

32
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm much older than Mai, Nicha.

33
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,320
I can't be with him.

34
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,720
Why not?

35
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,440
Why can't you be with him?

36
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,160
You know about my past.

37
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,840
I've told you about it.

38
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,160
An older man tricked me into loving him.

39
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,480
So how can I let Mai love me?

40
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,320
That's your head talking.

41
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,520
But what does your heart say?

42
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,600
How do you feel about him?

43
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,480
You and I are the same.

44
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,160
We both have a past.

45
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,760
But I've managed to overcome it.

46
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,240
You shouldn't let your past

47
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,760
stop you from moving forward.

48
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,440
I want you to be happy.

49
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,760
You've punished yourself enough.

50
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,640
I've been punishing myself?

51
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,040
You refuse to let anyone love you.

52
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,560
You won't let anyone in.

53
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,320
That's you punishing yourself.

54
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,120
I love you, Fon.

55
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,040
And we'll always be sisters.

56
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,920
Nicha.

57
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,640
Thank you, my dear sister.

58
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,200
Congratulations, Chol.

59
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,640
This is the first case you won in months.

60
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,080
Looks like the old Chol is back.

61
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,760
Thank you.

62
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,560
But why did it feel like
you were teasing me?

63
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,800
Where should we go drink tonight?
I won't tell Ek.

64
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,640
I don't drink anymore. I've quit drinking.

65
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,160
I'm going to work hard
to catch up with Mai.

66
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,600
I can't let him outshine me.

67
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,320
You're far too good
for me to compete with you.

68
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,560
Then you should learn from me.

69
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,920
You'll be as good as me one day.

70
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,120
Goodness. Listen to you bragging.

71
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm actually planning
to head out early today.

72
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
What? You're slacking off already?

73
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,200
Just make sure you get your work done.

74
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,040
Okay.

75
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,440
Well, get back to work.

76
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,880
Come on, Chol.

77
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,880
Let us rest a little.

78
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,160
- We've been working hard.
- Do you want to rest?

79
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,560
I can tell Ek to give you guys
a long break.

80
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,039
That's all right.

81
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,760
Mai, go on then.

82
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,600
Okay.

83
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,400
Will somebody
please bring the old Chol back?

84
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,520
Come back, Chol.

85
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,400
- No.
- Come back, Chol.

86
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,720
Come back to us, Chol.

87
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,280
Stop playing and get back to work.

88
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,320
- Knock it off.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,960
These guys are so immature.

90
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
They're horrible.

91
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,400
You guys got me in trouble.

92
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,000
Stop messing around.

93
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,080
Don't let me see you
mess around like that again.

94
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,080
Nicha.

95
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,560
Are you heading out?

96
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,440
That's right.

97
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,880
Where have you been?

98
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,040
I went to talk with Fon.

99
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
But don't worry.

100
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,240
Fon and I had a great talk.

101
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,200
Also,

102
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,760
I'm rooting for both of you.

103
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,200
Thank you, Nicha.

104
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,080
I'll get going now.

105
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,640
You came to wait for me,
but you never said anything.

106
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,040
Are you a stalker?

107
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Maybe.

108
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,960
I could pass for one
if I started sending you creepy emails

109
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,400
and followed you to your house.

110
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,200
You didn't come yesterday.

111
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,880
I had a shift at the factory.

112
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,800
I don't have work today
so I decided to come check on you.

113
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,960
Thank you.

114
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,400
Did you talk to Mai?

115
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,560
I did.

116
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,960
How did it go?

117
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,520
I suppose we're good now.

118
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,960
We're still friends
like we always have been.

119
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,320
Nothing's changed.

120
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,040
I meant you.

121
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,160
How are you feeling?

122
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,280
You can tell me.

123
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,720
I don't know.

124
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,720
If you want to know whether I'm sad,

125
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,240
I guess I'm a bit sad.

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,840
But I actually feel…

127
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,560
kind of relieved.

128
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,000
It felt good
getting to talk to Fon about it.

129
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,360
It was like a weight
had been lifted off my shoulder.

130
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,200
That's good.

131
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,680
Now everything's cleared up.

132
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,400
I know it wasn't easy for you.

133
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
You handled it really well.

134
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,080
Things will only get better from here.

135
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,120
Trust me.

136
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

137
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
<i>Fon.</i>

138
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Fon.

139
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,680
Fon.

140
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,640
Fon.

141
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,240
<i>Thank you for everything, Mai.</i>

142
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,200
<i>I'm going to check out a new apartment.</i>

143
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,760
<i>I found a place at a reasonable price.</i>

144
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,080
<i>I'll keep you updated. Don't worry.</i>

145
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,760
The apartment looks nothing
like the pictures they posted.

146
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
There's no electricity and water.

147
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,880
I'm afraid you're stuck with me
for another night.

148
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,040
Thank you for coming back.

149
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,280
I'll be downstairs.

150
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,960
Okay.

151
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,960
What's on your mind?

152
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,360
I want to quit my job at the foundation.

153
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,760
Why?

154
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,800
You love your job.

155
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,640
Is it because of your problem?

156
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,080
That's part of it.

157
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,240
But I've thought about quitting
for a long time.

158
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
Even Mhai knows this.

159
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,560
What I'm dealing with every day are just…

160
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,120
symptoms of the problem.

161
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,360
Sometimes, those issues are so big
that they make me feel discouraged.

162
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,920
I don't want to deal
with those issues anymore.

163
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,200
I'd rather live a quiet and peaceful life.

164
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,360
Then what do you want to do?

165
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,280
Will you laugh if I tell you?

166
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,400
Try me.

167
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,960
I want to open a child care center
in a slum.

168
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,040
Kids in slums may not have anyone
to give them guidance.

169
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,120
They grow up
without having any purpose in life

170
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,800
since their parents are too busy working
to teach them.

171
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,800
If I could help those kids,

172
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,040
I would be so proud of myself.

173
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,600
I just want them to grow up to be good,

174
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,600
happy people.

175
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,760
You're talking like a real saint.

176
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,520
You make me sound old.

177
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
You're not old.

178
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,840
You're still young
and you're also beautiful.

179
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,080
Did you just say that to placate me?

180
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,240
No.

181
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,840
I really admire you.

182
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,960
I'm comfortable when I'm with you.

183
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,000
It feels very heartwarming to be here.

184
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
But…

185
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,640
someone like me

186
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,760
doesn't deserve you.

187
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,160
Why do you look down
on yourself like that?

188
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,520
Because I have a bad past.

189
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,440
It's the reason why
I'm being followed right now.

190
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm not a good person like you think.

191
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,000
So what?

192
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,160
If you knew

193
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
what kind of person I used to be

194
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,920
and what I used to do,

195
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,960
you might hate me for it.

196
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,960
Tell me then.

197
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,800
Let's see if it will change
what I think about you.

198
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,120
But if you're not ready,

199
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,040
I'll stop asking you about it.

200
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,080
I can wait.

201
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,920
No matter what issues you have,

202
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
I'll help you solve them.

203
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,160
You should go to bed.

204
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,560
I'll get back to studying.

205
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,480
I'm wide awake now.

206
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,480
Good night.

207
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,680
Did he leave already?

208
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,480
<i>I have to go to the office early.</i>

209
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,200
<i>Don't forget to have breakfast.</i>

210
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,440
<i>I've made it for you.</i>

211
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,960
This is sweet of him.

212
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,600
What's up, Toey?

213
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,720
Fon, please help me.

214
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,280
Toey, wait for me right there.

215
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,520
I'll call the police for help
and I'll be there soon.

216
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,480
Nut.

217
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,480
I need your help with something.

218
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,840
Inspector, do you see anything?

219
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,680
I don't see anyone.

220
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,680
Sergeant, wait for me here.
I'll go check things out.

221
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,240
Inspector, wait.

222
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
It's dangerous. Inspector.

223
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
He should be careful.

224
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,440
- Toey, I'm here.
- Who else is here?

225
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,600
Ma'am.

226
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,920
Fon.

227
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,080
Toey!

228
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,720
Fon!

229
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,520
Fon, please help me.

230
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
What happened?

231
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,320
- Tell me.
- I'm scared, Fon.

232
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,720
Here you go.

233
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,440
Are you sure you're not hurt?

234
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm good.

235
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,800
Can you tell me what happened
before you ended up here?

236
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,920
I was with Chai at his house last night.

237
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,080
Then some people came to the house.

238
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,240
Toey, go hide.

239
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,000
- What's going on?
- Just go.

240
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,040
- Go hide.
- What's going on, Chai?

241
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,200
What's going on, Sak?

242
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,960
Chai, you stole the boss's money.

243
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,880
What are you talking about?

244
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,760
Where's the money?

245
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,920
I don't know.

246
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,720
I had Wut deliver it as usual.

247
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,880
Then where is it?

248
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,520
Where is the money?

249
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,800
It's not here.

250
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,760
I'll get you the money.
I'll find out where it is.

251
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,800
You have three hours.

252
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,480
If I don't have the money by then,

253
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,800
you're dead.

254
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,080
Who were those guys? What's going on?

255
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,760
Tell me, Chai.

256
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,800
Toey, we have to run.

257
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,600
Run? What do you mean?

258
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,480
Chai. Tell me what's going on.

259
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,280
There's no time. Pack your things.

260
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,440
- Come on, Toey.
- Chai.

261
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
Where are we going?

262
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,440
Go hide in the trunk.

263
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,040
No way. Are you leaving me here?

264
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm not leaving you.
I'll come back for you.

265
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,000
Now get in there.

266
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
I love you.

267
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,960
Officer, can you please help me find Chai?

268
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,160
Please, Officer. I'm begging you.

269
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
The police are searching the area.

270
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,960
It will probably take a while.

271
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,040
Toey, why don't we go wait
at the police station?

272
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,760
Inspector!

273
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,760
We found him.

274
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,280
Did you find Chai?

275
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,720
Where is he, Officer?

276
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,200
Why didn't he come with you?

277
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,960
Where is Chai, Officer?

278
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
He's over there, Inspector.

279
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,480
Fon, wait for me.

280
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,240
This way.

281
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Chai!

282
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,600
Chai!

283
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,880
Chai!

284
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,480
Chai!

285
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,280
Chai!

286
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,880
I'm on my way to pick you up.

287
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,480
Are you done with your swimming lesson?

288
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,840
You don't need to rush here.

289
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,240
I'm still having fun swimming.

290
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,280
Fun time's over.

291
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,640
Do you want Ruk to get mad?

292
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,600
What did your boyfriend do for a living?

293
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,480
He owned a gaming center.

294
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,840
Is it just a gaming center?

295
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,160
Yes.

296
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,800
I saw it with my own eyes.

297
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,600
Chai wouldn't lie to me about it.

298
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,360
This is my gaming center.

299
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,200
Goodness. You're doing
a great job with this place, baby.

300
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,120
Your business must be going well.

301
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,000
You seem to be making lots of money.

302
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,920
That's right.

303
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,840
The more people come here,
the more money I make.

304
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,880
Toey, how old are the people
who come to Chai's gaming center?

305
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,160
Well, it's a gaming center.

306
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,760
Most of the customers are teenagers.

307
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,680
Some are even younger than me.

308
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,000
According to Chai's financial statements,
it seems there's something more going on.

309
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,920
I'll contact my friend
at CCIB to look into it.

310
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,680
Can you give me the address
of your boyfriend's gaming center?

311
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,000
Is it not just a gaming center?

312
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm sorry I got here a bit late.
Where is Lookkaew?

313
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,480
She's probably getting dressed.

314
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,360
Can you stay for a while?

315
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,000
No, I have to go now.

316
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,400
- Please stay.
- Stop it. I have to go.

317
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,560
Come on. Let's go.

318
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,160
Who were you with?

319
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,680
Tell me who you were with.

320
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,600
Don't go in there or I'll run away.

321
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,600
Lookkaew.

322
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,480
If Ruk finds out, he'll kill you.

323
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,840
- Don't tell him then.
- Lookkaew.

324
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,200
Do you know you'll get me in trouble too?

325
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,280
This is the police! Show me your hands!

326
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,680
- Sit down.
- Stay where you are.

327
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,960
- Put your hands up.
- It's okay. Don't panic.

328
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,840
Go sit over there.

329
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,400
Sit down, everyone.

330
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,640
Collect all the evidence, Sergeant.

331
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,200
- Yes, sir.
- Stay where you are.

332
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,040
See if you can find anything.

333
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,880
Ms. Prae, we were raided by the police.

334
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,200
They got all our men.

335
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
What?

336
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,200
Damn it.

337
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,360
- What about the money?
- I couldn't find it.

338
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,120
You moron.

339
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,280
I told you not to do more
than what you were told.

340
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,200
Ms. Prae, Mr. Ruk is waiting for you.

341
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,840
Get me my money or you'll be the one
who has to pay me back.

342
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,560
Do you have something to tell me?

343
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,560
Mr. Ruk, I made a mistake.

344
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,400
I was cocky
thinking that I could handle it.

345
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,920
I just didn't want you to trouble yourself
with trivial matters.

346
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,480
Please don't be angry with me.

347
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,720
I don't care about the money.

348
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,200
I don't care who has to die.

349
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,520
What upsets me
is the problems that follow.

350
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,240
And I'm also upset
that you can't handle a small problem.

351
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,920
Do you know

352
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,200
that within one month,

353
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,120
the police already visited
my establishments twice?

354
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,880
I'll take care of it.

355
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,000
Please give me another chance.

356
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,200
I promise I won't let
these problems bother you again.

357
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,480
SUVARNABHUMI AIRPORT POLICE STATION

358
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,640
This way, please.

359
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,640
This way, Inspector.

360
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,600
Five of them are under 18
and two of them are under 15.

361
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,720
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

362
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,480
All right.

363
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,240
Inspector.

364
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,400
Can I have Mai…

365
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,080
Can I have Attorney Mavin
help us with this case?

366
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,160
That's good.

367
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,120
We could use help from an attorney.

368
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,800
<i>The police have launched a raid
on an illegal gambling website operation.</i>

369
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,240
<i>They have confiscated computers,
safes, transmitters,</i>

370
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,760
<i>and one million baht in cash.</i>

371
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,280
<i>The seized items are worth
over ten million baht in total.</i>

372
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,800
<i>The website GalaxyNight.com
has over 40,000 members</i>

373
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,040
<i>with over 677 million baht of circulating
capital in the past two months.</i>

374
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,440
<i>Upon performing the search,</i>

375
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,000
<i>officials arrested over ten offenders.</i>

376
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,600
<i>Two of the offenders are Chai and Wut,
the leaders of the operation.</i>

377
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,600
<i>Both men were found dead this morning.</i>

378
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,480
<i>The police are now trying to find
the person who's behind this operation.</i>

379
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,120
<i>We think we'll find that person soon.</i>

380
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,840
Police Major Suphanut Tanabumrungruang.

381
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,920
So this is your doing, Fahnapa.

382
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,320
- You're here, Mai.
- You said there were minors involved?

383
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,679
That's right. That's why I need your help.

384
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,199
I want to talk to you
before I go talk to the inspector.

385
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,520
Why didn't you call me?

386
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,960
It was dangerous to go help Toey
by yourself like that.

387
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,480
Well, I was in shock

388
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,280
and I was worried about Toey.

389
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
We need to have a long talk after this.

390
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,840
So where is the inspector?

391
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,840
He's upstairs.

392
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,280
We've questioned
the teenagers who were arrested.

393
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,040
Most of them said they got tricked
into doing this for money.

394
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,760
They got paid every month

395
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,480
and they were told
not to tell their parents about it.

396
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,440
But there are some
who knew what they did was wrong,

397
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,120
but they still did it
because they wanted money.

398
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,520
These people are smart.

399
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,840
They know kids and teenagers
are easy targets.

400
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,240
After a few years in juvie, these kids
will be out to work for them again.

401
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,400
Most of the kids are orphans.

402
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,800
They have no parents,
so they're easy to manipulate.

403
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,320
It's despicable.

404
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,400
I sent the bag that Chai gave to Toey
to CCIB for examination.

405
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,000
It should give us more information
about the person behind this.

406
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,000
We also found
Chai's cell phone in that bag.

407
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,800
Chai must've known they were coming
for him, so he left the bag with Toey.

408
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,160
I'll take you to talk to an officer
from CCIB.

409
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,120
Let's go.

410
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,920
All right. Here you go.

411
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,760
Ms. Prae, I promise.

412
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,560
Those kids won't say anything about you.

413
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,280
I will give you one last chance.

414
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,840
Make sure those kids
keep their mouths shut.

415
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,600
If this gets back to me,

416
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,920
I'm going to put you
and your family through hell.

417
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,480
This is the evidence
that we got from Chai's cell phone.

418
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,640
We think both men were the ones
overseeing the operation

419
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,400
and they probably got into a fight.

420
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,440
Sakda.

421
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,040
Do you know him?

422
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,320
There were times when
I used to work for him.

423
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,760
Do you know anything about his background?

424
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,440
You only taught me bad things.

425
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,840
I can never do what you want me to do.

426
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,520
You can be a scumbag all by yourself.

427
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,360
Mai, you asshole!

428
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,720
Get out of here! Get lost!

429
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,280
Come on. Help me stop them.

430
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,680
Let me go! Let go!

431
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,240
Then it was discovered that

432
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,640
he stole parts from the shop
and sold them for money.

433
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,000
He got fired and got arrested for theft.

434
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,680
Then he came to work here,

435
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,160
a corrupt establishment full of swindlers.

436
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,920
As for this woman,

437
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,480
our informant told us that
she might be the ringleader

438
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,640
behind the gambling website.

439
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,360
Right now, we don't know for sure
who this woman is.

440
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,680
But if we can catch Sakda,
it should lead us to her.

441
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,720
A woman is the leader
who controls a gang of thugs?

442
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,120
I find it hard to believe.

443
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,520
She must take orders from someone.

444
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,320
I agree with you.

445
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,280
We'll have to keep investigating.

446
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,720
Bell, this is a big case.

447
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,440
You're just an intern,
so don't ask too many questions.

448
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,640
Just watch me.

449
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,240
I'll show you how it's done.

450
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,640
What's in your notebook?

451
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,960
It's my list of questions.

452
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,880
Did you lose something?

453
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,800
Goodness. It's my glasses.
I think I forgot to bring them.

454
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,920
You know I'm short-sighted.

455
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,560
Excuse me. Your glasses are on your head.

456
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,480
Oh, my. That was embarrassing.

457
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,040
Who sent you to do fieldwork?

458
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,920
Come on. Follow me.

459
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,600
The other reporters are over there.

460
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,960
Bell, I told you to follow my lead.

461
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,520
<i>The foundation can't give you
any information right now.</i>

462
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,440
<i>We're here because there are minors
under 18 years old who were arrested</i>

463
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,920
<i>and we hope that we can help them.</i>

464
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,320
Fon, let me handle this.

465
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,560
Mai. It's me, Bell.

466
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,440
- Bell, what are you doing here?
- I'm here to get the scoop.

467
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,600
PLAIFON PHOSUWAN
EMPLOYEE OF KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

468
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,080
<i>Who are you, sir?</i>

469
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,080
<i>I'm the foundation's attorney.</i>

470
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,320
<i>Will any of the kids get convicted?</i>

471
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,600
<i>If they get sent to juvie, they will
probably be out in a few years, right?</i>

472
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,800
<i>The kids will be punished since this is
a serious offense with a lot of victims.</i>

473
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,560
<i>They won't be spared because of their age.</i>

474
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,800
<i>So I'd like to warn those watching.</i>

475
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,920
<i>Don't be fooled into
scamming others for money.</i>

476
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,040
<i>Online gambling is a horrible thing.</i>

477
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,320
<i>Your connections might've saved you today.</i>

478
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,920
<i>But you can't escape forever.</i>

479
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,840
<i>Money obtained through corruption
won't bring you happiness.</i>

480
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,840
<i>I have a message for the person
behind this business.</i>

481
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,120
<i>Your connections won't save you.</i>

482
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,360
<i>May you sleep well at night
until the day we finally meet.</i>

483
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,160
<i>Because I will find you
and I'll make sure you are punished.</i>

484
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,840
<i>You'll be spending
the rest of your life in prison</i>

485
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,800
<i>for all the crimes you committed.</i>

486
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,960
<i>May I have your name?</i>

487
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,600
<i>I'm Attorney Mavin Keawsawat
from Kanyamit Foundation.</i>

488
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,720
<i>Thank you.</i>

489
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,240
<i>- Let's go, Fon.
- Wait, sir.</i>

490
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,240
<i>We still have more questions.</i>

491
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,360
Does this mean you know who's behind this?

492
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,240
Do you know who's responsible?

493
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,600
Mai is so cool.

494
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,120
Attorney Mavin.

495
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,320
Fahnapa.

496
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,640
We finally meet again, Mai.

497
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,320
You should sleep.

498
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,000
Let me finish reading this.

499
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,080
Toey only got a few days of happiness
before things turned tragic.

500
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,520
I guess we never know

501
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,000
when we'll lose someone we love.

502
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,720
What are you looking for?

503
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,760
My pen.

504
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,840
I must've dropped it somewhere.

505
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,440
I'll go get you another one.
Is it at your desk?

506
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,000
Yes. Thank you.

507
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,000
It's a gift for a smart boy.

508
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,800
I have a gift for you too.

509
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,920
But I forgot to bring it.

510
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,760
It's the gift I wanted to give you.

511
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,080
I never had a chance to give it to you.

512
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,840
It probably brings back
bad memories for you.

513
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,280
Let's just put it away.

514
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,280
Do you still want me to have it?

515
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,440
Can I open it?

516
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,360
I'll open it now.

517
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,600
It's so cute.

518
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,640
I didn't have money then.

519
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,040
This was all I could afford.

520
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,160
Let me find you another gift.

521
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,000
No, I like this one.

522
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,520
I'll treasure this forever.

523
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,520
Will you also treasure my love for you?

524
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,520
Mai.

525
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,920
I'm not ready.

526
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,760
It's like what you said to me earlier.

527
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,040
We never know
when we'll lose someone we love.

528
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,120
- Tomorrow, I might--
- Hey.

529
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,600
Stop it. Don't say stuff like that.

530
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,840
Nothing's going to happen to you.

531
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,520
Does this mean you love me?

532
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,000
Did you trick me?

533
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,040
I'll wait until you're ready.

534
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,480
I'll just stay with you
until you fall asleep tonight.

535
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,880
You don't have to stay with me.
I can sleep by myself.

536
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,280
You'll just stay up late if I leave.

537
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,920
I won't stay up late.

538
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,800
I'm getting sleepy. I'll sleep soon.

539
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,960
I have to go to work tomorrow.

540
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,880
You should get back to studying.

541
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,520
I'm done studying tonight.

542
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,600
Are you being bad?

543
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,720
Yes. I want to go to sleep with you.

544
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,720
Just go sleep on the couch.

545
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,120
I want to sleep on the bed tonight.

546
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,400
Then I'll go.

547
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,480
I'll kiss you if you try to get up again.

548
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,720
Then I might not
be able to control myself.

549
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,120
Don't do it, Mai.

550
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,800
Then go to sleep.

551
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,720
Your heart's beating so fast.

552
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,160
Are you sure it's my heart?

553
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,480
You can't sleep?

554
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,320
I'll sleep now.

555
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,720
- Fon.
- Mai.

556
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,160
What are you doing here?

557
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,680
I want to take a shower.

558
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,920
You smell nice.

559
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,360
Knock it off.

560
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,440
Mai, wait.

561
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,440
I'll go with you.

562
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
Where are you going?

563
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,440
I'm going to work.

564
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,960
Do you think that's safe?

565
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,560
I already asked Mhai.

566
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,720
No strangers came to the foundation
the past couple of days.

567
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,720
I think that man
probably stopped following me.

568
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,160
Are you sure? I'm not sure.

569
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,160
The foundation has received
tons of donations

570
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,640
since the news
about online gambling came out.

571
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,000
I want to go help everyone.

572
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,040
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

573
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,600
- Tik.
- Yes?

574
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,640
Why is it so quiet here?
Where is everyone?

575
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,480
A kind man brought food and gifts
for the kids.

576
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,840
Everyone's in the courtyard.

577
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,440
- Really?
- Yes.

578
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,440
Thank you.

579
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,960
Who is the kind stranger?

580
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,920
Come on, kids. Let's get in line.

581
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,360
Don't fight over the gifts.

582
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,480
Hello, Plaifon.

583
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,320
Mr. Ruk.

584
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,480
- Hello, Rey.
- Hey, there.

585
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,800
Are you having a party?

586
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,280
Yes. Someone brought food
and snacks for the kids.

587
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,920
He's so handsome.
He makes me wish I was young again.

588
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,080
I should get going.
I have a meeting with Mhai.

589
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,800
Mhai pushed the meeting to 2 p.m.
She couldn't make it back in time.

590
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,640
I'm sorry. I was busy arranging the party.

591
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,040
I forgot to call and tell you.

592
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,680
Is that so?

593
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,280
Have you eaten?

594
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,200
You should check out the party
and grab something to eat.

595
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,960
All right.
Let me send out some emails first.

596
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,560
Okay.

597
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,320
It must be nice working here.

598
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,880
You get to help the less fortunate

599
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,880
and you get to be around
these adorable kids.

600
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,040
Don't touch them.

601
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,720
What do you want?

602
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,840
Do you want me to say it here?

603
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,400
You wouldn't dare.

604
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,280
You wouldn't risk
getting yourself in trouble.

605
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,240
I'm so happy
you still remember what I'm like.

606
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,960
Can we talk in private?

607
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,040
For both our sakes.

608
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,400
Of course, we can talk in private.

609
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,280
You know I've always let you
have your way with me.

610
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,360
Little girl, has the man who came
to make a donation left?

611
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,400
No, he's talking to Fon.

612
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,560
- Thank you.
- Sure.

613
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,920
Why did you come to threaten me?

614
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,880
Except for my mom,
I have nothing to do with you.

615
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,400
Why do you think I'm here to threaten you?

616
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,240
Maybe I'm just here to make a donation.

617
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,760
Or maybe I just want to see you.

618
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,280
There's no one else here.

619
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,240
You can drop the act.

620
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,680
How did you know Chai?

621
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,000
Chai?

622
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,480
From the gambling website case.

623
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,800
Did you know Chai?

624
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,640
He was one of my men.

625
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,480
It was you.

626
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,400
You killed Chai, Toey's boyfriend.

627
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,840
You're as smart as always.

628
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,160
But being smart alone won't save you.

629
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,520
You also need to keep your word.

630
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,760
Don't forget who gave you the freedom

631
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,680
to live your life.

632
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,240
If you betray me,

633
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,720
you'll end up like Chai.

634
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,760
He also betrayed me.

635
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,320
Remember that, Fahnapa.

636
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,200
Hey.

637
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,280
What's wrong with Fon?

638
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,760
She's a little lightheaded.

639
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,680
Did you have too much fun with the kids?

640
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,920
I also passed out
from dancing too hard, once.

641
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,440
Come inside and rest, Fon.

642
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,080
Come on.

643
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,960
Come sit down. You'll feel better soon.

644
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,080
<i>There was a man following Fon.</i>

645
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,240
You have to tell me so I can help you.

646
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,640
Mai.

647
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,680
I really can't tell you.

648
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,480
You would've come to me about work.

649
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,640
So this is a personal matter.

650
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,120
<i>Fon is scared
and wants to find a new apartment.</i>

651
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,840
<i>What scares her isn't work-related.</i>

652
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,200
<i>The man who came to the foundation today
made Fon cry.</i>

653
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,520
Who is that man
and why is Fon scared of him?

654
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,720
Can I have information on the man
who came to make a donation today?

655
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,760
He's a tall man.

656
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,720
Sure.

657
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,280
Thank you.

658
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,120
RUK HIRANSAMIT

659
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,320
Ruk Hiransamit.

660
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,600
If you betray me,

661
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,040
you'll end up like Chai.

662
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,000
Don't be scared. I'm right here.

663
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,720
Mai.

664
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,520
Are you free today?
Can you go somewhere with me?

665
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,360
Where?

666
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,760
I know lots of kids here whose parents
are struggling to make ends meet.

667
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:29,200
These kids often have problems because
their parents are too busy working,

668
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,560
so they can't give
the kids proper guidance.

669
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,960
So the small issues that the children have
often turn into bigger problems.

670
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,600
I want to help look after the kids here.

671
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,320
I see.

672
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,760
Minnie, a felon's daughter.

673
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,080
You'll grow up to be a skank.

674
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,160
Minnie, a felon's daughter.

675
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,800
- Your dad is a felon.
- Little boy.

676
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,400
You shouldn't bully your friend like that.

677
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,960
It's not nice to hurt others
for your own pleasure.

678
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,840
What's your name?

679
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,320
Can you tell me?

680
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,840
What's your name?

681
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,800
What's your doll's name?

682
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,160
If you like this place,
you can give me the deposit.

683
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,320
I'll clean the place up for you.

684
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,680
Can I have a look around
and think about it first?

685
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,840
Sure.

686
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,360
What do you think, Mai?
Isn't this a nice place?

687
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,920
I can turn it into a child care center.

688
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,600
Feel free to have a look around.

689
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,280
Once you're done, just lock up
the house and return the key to me.

690
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,200
Here you go.

691
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,840
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

692
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,480
Look at this place. It's so spacious.

693
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,360
I can care for the kids
and have them do activities here.

694
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,640
The house has three bedrooms.

695
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,920
The kids can spend the night here
if their parents need them to stay over.

696
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,280
Come have a look here.

697
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,120
I think I'll make this my bedroom.

698
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,920
Look. It has a nice view
and it's really breezy here.

699
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,800
I won't even need an air conditioner.

700
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,440
Can I come to stay over?

701
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,440
Don't be crazy.

702
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,200
Do you feel better now?

703
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,680
I'm fine.

704
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,600
Don't worry about me.

705
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,520
You can't stop me from worrying.

706
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,520
You like to act tough.

707
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,560
But you can let yourself be weak
when you're with me.

708
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,200
How can I do that?

709
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,040
Of course you can.

710
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,720
It would make me so happy

711
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,280
if you let me take care of you

712
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,640
and let me be your rock.

713
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,720
I'm serious.

714
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,880
I know.

715
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,080
<i>I'm not good with words.</i>

716
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,920
I'm not good at consoling others.

717
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,200
So I have to do this.

718
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,720
Sure, Mr. Attorney.

719
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,800
It wasn't hard to find you

720
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,760
<i>and it won't be hard to catch you.</i>

721
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,840
<i>What if it's your man's life at stake?</i>

722
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,000
Attorney Mavin.

723
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,160
I'm going to teach him
what pain feels like.

724
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,720
Let's see if he can go on living

725
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,480
without you in his life.

726
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,640
It's a dead body!

727
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,520
