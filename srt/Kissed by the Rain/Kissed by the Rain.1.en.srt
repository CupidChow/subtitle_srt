1
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,040
Hey, that way.

2
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,440
…right?

3
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,880
Did Ruk come home?

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,560
She acts arrogant
thinking she's his favorite.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,000
Ruk, open the door.

6
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,360
Ruk!

7
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,840
You stole my husband!

8
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,440
-How could you?
-Napa.

9
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,320
-You stole my husband!
-Stop it, Napa.

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,760
-Stop it.
-Let go.

11
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,800
How could you do this to me?

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,160
She's basically a child.
How can you sleep with her?

13
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,120
I first slept with you
when you were her age. Now get out.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,840
I'm not leaving. I'm your wife.

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,880
-You stole my husband!
-No, Napa.

16
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,600
Enough. Enough is enough.

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
You don't love me.

18
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,360
Don't be stupid.

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,520
Then why did you sleep with me?

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,400
Leave if you can't accept it.

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,160
Napa!

22
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,160
Your mom has left you under my care.
What's your name?

23
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,000
Fahnapa.

24
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,480
I'll adopt and support you.

25
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,040
I see you are a good student.

26
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,240
What would you like as a reward?

27
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,040
I leave that choice to you.

28
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,240
Why don't we go to Japan?

29
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
She's just a sugar baby.

30
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,200
She doesn't realize that
she's not the first one.

31
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,520
She definitely won't be the last.

32
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,120
Why are you heading to the foundation?
Were you raped?

33
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,360
Mister, I work there.

34
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
I see. You are an employee there.

35
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,080
Are there many rape victims seeking help?

36
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,240
Most victims suffer domestic violence.

37
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,920
You are sticking your nose
in someone else's business.

38
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,240
Domestic violence is illegal.

39
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,680
How do you feel when the police
intervene in a couple's fight?

40
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,520
They are intrusive.

41
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,920
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

42
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,600
How did he get inside?

43
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,160
Mister, stop. Mister.

44
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,080
Mister, outsiders are not allowed
on the premises.

45
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,280
What's your business here?

46
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,400
Stop smiling and answer me.

47
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,960
Fon, you are here.

48
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,880
I just saw your missed call.

49
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
Yes, I called you.

50
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,960
I ran into a strange taxi driver
so I wanted to call someone.

51
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,400
I had to pretend to be on the phone
since you didn't answer.

52
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,160
Mai, I've spoken with your mom.

53
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,880
She insists on going home

54
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,360
so there's nothing we can do.

55
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,640
What if something happens again?

56
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
Feel free to give us a call at any time.

57
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,640
Remember, do not do something
that can destroy your future.

58
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,240
I don't get her.

59
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,680
Your mom isn't the only woman who is
too afraid to leave her relationship.

60
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,680
She may not feel confident enough.

61
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,480
It's our job to show your mom

62
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,640
that she does have options
and whatever choice she makes,

63
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,680
she will be okay and safe.

64
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Don't worry, Mom.

65
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,440
We'll talk to him when you're ready.

66
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Only the soup is left. Can you eat it?

67
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,320
Of course.

68
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,600
Mhai.

69
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,120
What was the earlier case about?

70
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,200
Domestic violence, as usual.

71
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,880
That boy, Mavin, reached out to us

72
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,960
on his mom's behalf.

73
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,680
Who's the abuser?

74
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,440
-Guess.
-His stepdad?

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,880
It's his biological dad.
He's an alcoholic.

76
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,000
He physically abuses his family
when he's drunk

77
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,880
or doesn't have money to buy alcohol.

78
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
Women should be brave enough
to walk away from those abusive men.

79
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
It's hard, Fon.

80
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Given the past patriarchy,

81
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,320
it's challenging to change their beliefs
or earn their trust.

82
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,560
So what's the next step?

83
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Mai wants his parents to separate.
I support his opinion.

84
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,760
However, his mom
doesn't want to sue her husband

85
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
so she's going to talk to him first.

86
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,080
It's all we can do right now, Fon.

87
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,440
But I told Mai to contact us right away
if anything happens.

88
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,160
I'm going to visit them next week too.

89
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,320
Have you worked on a case

90
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,200
where a man reached out to us before?

91
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,120
He's the first to reach out to us

92
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,280
on his mom's behalf.

93
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,480
Where have you been?

94
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,920
Don't you have school, Mai?

95
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,640
Hey, Mai. What's your problem?

96
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,880
Malai! Teach your son some manners.

97
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,920
I asked him nicely.

98
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,640
I was in a good mood earlier.

99
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
Do you want a piece of me?

100
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,080
Your dad asked you a question nicely.
You shouldn't have walked away.

101
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,240
He asked if I had school.

102
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,400
My summer vacation started a week ago.
Do you expect me to answer him every day?

103
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,800
I was with you all day.
What else do you want from me?

104
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,800
-I was trying to help you.
-No, that's not true.

105
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,120
You can help me
by not fighting with your dad.

106
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,240
That's all I ask of you.

107
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,240
You don't plan to leave him.

108
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
I do.

109
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
When?

110
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,080
When are you going to talk to him?

111
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,440
What's going on?

112
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,760
Is there something
you want to say to me, Mai?

113
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
Is there?

114
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,480
Move. I'm asking you nicely.

115
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
Do you want a piece of me?

116
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,640
You got it.

117
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,560
-No.
-Do you want a piece of me?

118
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
-No.
-Who raised you?

119
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,000
Mom raised me, not you.

120
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,320
But I made you.

121
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Do it! I'll definitely fight back.

122
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,360
I don't care that you're my dad.

123
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,640
You aren't the only one
with hands and feet.

124
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,120
-Mai. Look at him.
-Stop it.

125
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,960
Look at this ungrateful son you raised.

126
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,800
-You did a terrible job raising him!
-Mom!

127
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,320
-Mai, don't.
-You better watch your back.

128
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,320
-Please stop.
-Watch your back.

129
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,440
Please stop.

130
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,840
I told you I wanted to leave.

131
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,200
Why did you come back to get abused?

132
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,680
We wouldn't be in this situation
if you had listened to me.

133
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,840
You are too young to understand.

134
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,160
Where would we go
and what would we do if we left?

135
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,640
Your dad would harass my relatives
if he found out we ran away.

136
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,080
That's why I took you to the foundation.

137
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,600
They can help us.

138
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,040
They are outsiders.

139
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,520
They can't help us every time.

140
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,600
No one cares about us, Mai.

141
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm sorry, Mai.

142
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
You can stay with your aunt

143
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,520
if you wish to leave.

144
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,520
Stop apologizing and making decisions
for other people.

145
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,480
If you weren't here, I'd leave.

146
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,560
But since you insist on staying,
I won't let him hurt you.

147
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,560
If you truly love me,

148
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,480
stop protecting him

149
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
and ordering me not to stand up to him.

150
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,560
My son doesn't get me.

151
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,760
I don't get
why you put up with that man either.

152
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,160
I still need him

153
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,440
to buy groceries
and drive me to the market.

154
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,080
I can't do it all alone.

155
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,000
You have Mai.

156
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,200
He's old enough to help you out.

157
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,280
Mai has school.

158
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,840
So you are going to keep
being that man's punching bag?

159
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,400
He spends all the money you make
on alcohol. Is it really worth it?

160
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,840
Also, he beats you up every day.

161
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,960
Listen, if you won't leave him
for your sake, do it for Mai's.

162
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,400
Nobody understands

163
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,840
what it's like to be me.

164
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,640
I don't have a choice.

165
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,480
You have many choices
but you won't choose one

166
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,600
because you love that jerk.

167
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,640
Malai. Mai.

168
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
Is anybody home?

169
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,000
Did we come at the wrong time, Mhai?

170
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,520
Could they be working outside?

171
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,240
It's possible
since they sell food at the market.

172
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,960
I should have made an appointment.

173
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,360
I saw a grocery store nearby.
Why don't we go buy some drinks?

174
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,400
Mhai.

175
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,960
I thought nobody was home.

176
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,040
I came to check on you
since no one answered my calls.

177
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,320
May we come inside?

178
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,880
Sure.

179
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,920
I wasn't expecting you.

180
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
You're wasting your time.

181
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,120
My mom won't leave him.

182
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,840
I'm not here for that.

183
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,960
I came to check on you and your mom.

184
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,040
Is there anything you want to tell us?

185
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,840
No.

186
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,440
I have no choice but to endure it

187
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,080
until I lose my patience.

188
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,400
Mai.

189
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,280
Does your dad know about us?

190
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,200
My name is Fon.
I'm a social worker at the foundation.

191
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,599
No, he doesn't know.

192
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,480
She told me not to say.

193
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,960
She's afraid

194
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,839
he will hit us.

195
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,880
What about you?

196
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,440
Do you trust

197
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,480
that we will get you two
out of this situation?

198
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,520
How are you going to do that
when my mom won't cooperate?

199
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,680
Physical assault is against the law

200
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,520
even if it occurs within a family.

201
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,320
If he harms you or your mom again,

202
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,360
take your mom to a safe room,

203
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,000
then call me or Fon right away.
Do you understand?

204
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,320
We will ensure
that the police take action.

205
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,840
I forgot to serve you water.

206
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,280
I would be proud of him
if I was his parent.

207
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,560
Most people still think that
sharing household matters with others

208
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,600
is making a mountain out of a molehill.

209
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,520
We can't change everyone's mind.

210
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,560
We get to change someone
or a family's life for the better

211
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,920
with every case we work on.

212
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,000
That's what matters to me.

213
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,280
You shouldn't have let them inside.

214
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,440
It will be trouble
if somebody tells your dad about them.

215
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,520
I don't care.

216
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,920
If he assaults us again,

217
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,520
I will follow Mhai's advice.

218
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,520
Are you trying to drive me insane?

219
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,680
Do we not have enough on our plate?

220
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,320
Who's at the door? I'll go check.

221
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,320
He's here to collect our rent.

222
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,480
I'll ask him to postpone the rent.

223
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,720
Okay.

224
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,280
What the fuck are you looking at, Mai?

225
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm looking at a fucker like you.

226
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,440
Mai, you shithead.

227
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,600
You scum.

228
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,360
You…

229
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,880
-How dare you fight back?
-Mai.

230
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,360
-How dare you?
-No. Stop, Mai. Stop.

231
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,720
Do me a favor. Please don't hurt him.

232
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,840
-I'm begging you.
-Don't bother, Malai.

233
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,880
How could you raise a son

234
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,400
who hits his dad?

235
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,320
Mom!

236
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,720
Mom!

237
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,120
Don't take her money.

238
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,000
-Give it back.
-Stay out of it.

239
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,600
Get lost.

240
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,480
-Give it back.
-Mai, no.

241
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,600
Mai, stop it. Let him go.

242
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,840
Let him take it.

243
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,200
How can you let him take it?
It's your savings.

244
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,440
We haven't paid rent and my tuition.

245
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,320
We can't let him spend all that money.

246
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,760
Look at what he did to you.

247
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,960
I'm going to call Mhai.

248
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,320
Just you wait.
I'm going to take him to jail.

249
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,480
Don't do it, Mai.

250
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,040
He's your dad.

251
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,560
He doesn't deserve to be anyone's dad.

252
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,400
Mom, are you hurt?

253
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,680
Go ahead.

254
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,880
Do whatever you want.

255
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,480
Both my husband and son
don't care about me.

256
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,680
I don't know how long
I can put up with it.

257
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,040
Do you and your dad want me to die

258
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,320
in front of you?

259
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,240
Why would you die
when he's the one at fault?

260
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,640
No one cares about me.

261
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,960
You all cause me trouble.

262
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,720
Damn it! I'm trying to help you.

263
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,760
How can you compare me
to the man trying to sabotage us?

264
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,480
How is what you are doing any different?

265
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,680
I shouldn't have gone
to the foundation with you.

266
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,920
I shouldn't have.

267
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,920
Do you and your dad want me to die

268
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,560
in front of you?

269
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,480
Why would you die
when he's the one at fault?

270
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,920
No one cares about me.

271
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,440
You all cause me trouble.

272
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
What a coincidence.

273
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,320
Do you remember me, Fon?

274
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
I visited your house with Mhai.

275
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,640
Why are you smiling again?

276
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,880
We just met yesterday
and you are asking me if I remember you.

277
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,600
What a coincidence though.

278
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,240
Where are you heading this early?

279
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,000
What about you?

280
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,240
I'm heading to work.

281
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,360
Do you live in the area?

282
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,600
You haven't answered my question.

283
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Me?

284
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,840
I'm just getting some fresh air.

285
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,840
Why don't you come to the foundation?

286
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,360
That's not a good idea.
I don't want to bother you.

287
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,040
What are you talking about?

288
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,560
Our job would be meaningless

289
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
if nobody visited or thought of us.

290
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,120
It's up to you though.
You are always welcome there.

291
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,360
I won't mistake you
for an intruder anymore.

292
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,240
Don't worry.

293
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,800
Fon.

294
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,320
We've passed the foundation.

295
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,120
You're right.

296
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,320
I guess I fell asleep and missed the stop.

297
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,120
Are you sure? Aren't you just worried
that I might be running away from home?

298
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,320
No.

299
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,800
Are you thinking about doing that?

300
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,680
Yes, but I won't do it.

301
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,720
I'm worried about my mom.

302
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,080
She doesn't worry about me though.

303
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,760
She wouldn't have come to the foundation
if she wasn't worried about you.

304
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,000
She's afraid I might kill him.

305
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Perhaps I'm no different than him.

306
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,640
You would never do that.

307
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,080
You are better and smarter than that.
She knows it.

308
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,880
Why don't we get off at the next stop
before we go too far?

309
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,840
Sure.

310
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
Shouldn't you be rushing to work?

311
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,040
Let's enjoy this meal
while we wait for the traffic to clear up.

312
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,120
I didn't bring any money.

313
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,800
I'll pay for your food
as long as you eat less than two portions.

314
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,600
The next meal is on me.

315
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,120
All right. Dig in.

316
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,680
I'm happy to see you eating well.

317
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,320
Where are you heading to next?

318
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,560
I don't know. I'll probably go home.

319
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,840
My friends went on a trip.

320
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,120
Getting a part-time job
sounds like an interesting option.

321
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,160
It will give you something to do
and take your mind off your worries.

322
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,680
You're right.

323
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,920
Why haven't I thought of it?

324
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,000
I've been worrying about my mom.

325
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,120
I'm sure you have a lot on your mind.

326
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,440
You can talk to me if you have
any questions. I'll give you my number.

327
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,440
Thank you.

328
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,960
This sauce is delicious. Try it.

329
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,600
Fon.

330
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
Thank you for everything.

331
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,960
Stay in touch.
Don't forget the meal you owe me.

332
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,080
I've written it down.

333
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,720
Are you hungry?

334
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,840
Do you want a snack?

335
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,280
Do you?

336
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,240
It's good.

337
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,600
Hello, Lieutenant.

338
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,800
Hello, Mhai and Fon.

339
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,080
Hello.

340
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,720
What happened?

341
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,640
She called to report
that her mom was gambling.

342
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,600
We brought her mom in, fined her,

343
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,400
and released her.

344
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,040
After that, she and the girl fought.

345
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,160
She spanked the girl and handed her to us.

346
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,560
And the girl won't go home
because she's afraid of a spanking.

347
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,240
Please look after her for a few days.

348
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,840
Once her mom calms down
and wishes to take her back,

349
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,200
I'll ask her to go to the foundation.

350
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,240
I'm not going home.
I'm going to stay with my dad.

351
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,400
Wait.

352
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,640
Where's your dad?

353
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,840
I don't know.

354
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,280
Don't you live with your dad?

355
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,280
No, I don't remember what he looks like.

356
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,280
What? Then how can we deliver you to him?

357
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,280
Post a video of me with my name on TikTok.
He will see it and come pick me up.

358
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,560
They are idiots.

359
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,240
How about this?

360
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Come stay with us tonight.
We'll figure out the rest later.

361
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Okay?

362
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,200
You will be staying here
until your mom picks you up.

363
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,720
What do you think of this place?

364
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,360
You have many friends here,
but they are eating lunch.

365
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,360
I will also be your friend.

366
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,760
You are too old to be my friend.
I'm six years old. How old are you?

367
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,120
It's rude to ask people's age, Puifai.

368
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,240
-Let's sit here.
-Sure.

369
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,440
Order whatever you want. It's on me.

370
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,040
One fried rice--

371
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,880
Mai.

372
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,680
What are you doing here?

373
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,280
You told me to get a part-time job.

374
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,840
Do you work here?

375
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,360
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

376
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,320
You should place an order
before you get Mai fired.

377
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,240
Okay.

378
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,960
I'll order crab fried rice.

379
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,840
-Okay.
-Make it two.

380
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,040
Sure.

381
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,199
I'm glad to see Mai looking livelier.

382
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,480
I agree. It eases your mind, doesn't it?

383
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,280
Keep the change.

384
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,400
Your service was excellent.

385
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,960
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

386
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,640
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

387
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,640
Here's your tip.

388
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,640
You got a lot of tips.

389
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,520
-The customer was very generous.
-I'm happy for you.

390
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,280
Honey, I didn't do anything.

391
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,120
Are you planning to cheat on me?

392
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,080
He was just a customer.

393
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,280
Stop talking nonsense.

394
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,200
-Mom!
-Stop.

395
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,480
Mom! Open the door.

396
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,240
Open the door!

397
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,920
Don't touch her!

398
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,080
Mai, did you just hit me?

399
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,000
-Come here, you ungrateful son.
-Stop.

400
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,880
-Stop.
-How dare you hit me?

401
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,880
Enough. Mai, run.

402
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,880
How long will you put up with him?

403
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,760
I've had enough.

404
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,600
If he does this again,
I'll settle it to the grave.

405
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,600
Mai.

406
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,960
Don't say that.

407
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,040
Where did you get that idea?

408
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,680
Don't throw your future away.

409
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,680
What future?

410
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,800
You refuse to accept help
from the foundation.

411
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,280
So what's your plan?

412
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,960
Mom, please leave him.

413
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,120
Let's run away together.

414
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,760
I'll work hard and support us.

415
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,920
Please, Mom.

416
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,560
Who's going to drive to the market
and help me with the business?

417
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,200
I can do it.

418
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,480
I can even quit school to help you.

419
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,800
Enough, Mai.

420
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,880
This is too much for me.

421
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,480
My head hurts.

422
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,280
Here you go again.

423
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,920
I always fight for you,

424
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,560
but you never fight with me.

425
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,360
Mister.

426
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,200
Do you enjoy fighting?

427
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,160
It's not good. You might end up in jail.

428
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,600
Are you deaf?

429
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,040
-No.
-So you can talk.

430
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,960
Mister.

431
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,880
What?

432
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,600
Play with me.
No one wants to play with me.

433
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,600
Mai.

434
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,160
Have you been waiting long?

435
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,120
I'm glad you called.

436
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,560
Take today off work.

437
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,520
I can't.

438
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,920
But I also can't go looking like this.

439
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,600
I'll help you.

440
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,800
Thank you.

441
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
All done.

442
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,880
I'm not familiar with makeup.

443
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,200
I'd be surprised if you were.

444
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,360
I'm a pretty good makeup artist.

445
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,840
Take a look yourself.

446
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,080
It looks great.

447
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,640
Your bruises disappeared.

448
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,920
Right? No one will be able to tell.

449
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,360
You started smiling
as soon as the bruises disappeared.

450
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,280
Good for you.

451
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,800
Thank you for your help.

452
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,200
Go to work or you'll be late.

453
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,560
-Go already.
-Okay.

454
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,080
-Fon.
-Yes.

455
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,840
Can you put makeup on me too?

456
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,480
What for?

457
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,160
Are you going somewhere?

458
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,160
It's 90 baht.

459
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,840
Here's the change. Thank you.

460
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,320
-Give it to me.
-Ma'am.

461
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,640
Ma'am, please don't collect
the debt today.

462
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,720
I have to pay
rent, gas, and groceries today.

463
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,400
You have to pay the money you owe, Malai.

464
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,520
Ma'am, show me some mercy.

465
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,360
Let me postpone the payment one more time.

466
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,320
I won't have money to buy more supplies
if you take that money.

467
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,640
That's your problem.

468
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,520
I operate my loan business for profit,
not charity.

469
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,520
Keep that in mind.

470
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,160
Ma'am.

471
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,800
Puifai, wake up.

472
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,560
Your mom has come for you.

473
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,320
Do you promise?

474
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,120
Fai, let's go home.

475
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,440
Are you going to spank me again?

476
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,640
No, I'm not. I'm sorry.

477
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,200
It took a few nights of me sleeping here
for you to come to your senses.

478
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,000
Are you going to stop gambling?

479
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,320
I'm not taking her back. What kind of kid
calls the police on their parent?

480
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,280
She did it out of love.

481
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,600
She wants to break your bad habit.

482
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,600
Love? I spent this month's salary
on the fine, all because of her.

483
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,360
That brat.

484
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,080
If you don't take her back,

485
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,320
she's going to look for her dad.

486
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,760
No, she can't go looking for him.

487
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,320
Unless you stop gambling,

488
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,920
you are the one pushing her away.

489
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,960
You have a choice to make.

490
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,000
Will you stop gambling for your daughter?

491
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,040
All right, I'll stop.

492
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,120
Are you sure? I'll call the police on you
again if I catch you gambling.

493
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,160
Do you understand?

494
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,320
Yes, I'll stop.

495
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,680
Are you my daughter or my mom?

496
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,200
Since I have to keep lecturing you,
you might as well be my daughter.

497
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,320
Come on, let's go home.

498
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,640
Fai, wait for me.

499
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,040
Don't be mad. I'm sorry.

500
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,520
PARK MORE CAFE

501
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,840
What would you like?

502
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,280
One creamy tom yum soup.

503
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,960
-This is yours.
-Thank you.

504
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,680
Hello, Mai.

505
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,520
Fon, my first paycheck came.
I'm going to give it to my mom.

506
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,920
Thank you for your advice.
I'll buy you a meal.

507
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,400
I'll tell her the good news
and give her the money.

508
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,960
That was a lot of information.

509
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,560
I'm happy for you, Mai.

510
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,280
Can I stop by the foundation
to give you snacks this evening?

511
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,560
Look at you becoming a sugar daddy
with your first paycheck.

512
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,120
Don't spend it all.

513
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,720
I won't. I'm very frugal.
The snacks don't cost much.

514
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,200
Okay. All right then.

515
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,520
See you this evening.

516
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,600
Thank you.

517
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,880
I wish you the best day of your life.

518
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Mom.

519
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,840
Mom.

520
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,960
Mom.

521
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,440
Mom!

522
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,040
Mom!

523
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,160
Mom!

524
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,840
Mom!

525
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,560
Mom!

526
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,400
MAI

527
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,440
-Offer everything to this place.
-Okay.

528
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,520
Hello.

529
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,280
Fon, my mom is dead.

530
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,360
Mai.

531
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,000
Call an ambulance. I'll meet you there.

532
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,840
Malai!

533
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,120
Mai, I'm going to kill you,
you ungrateful child.

534
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,520
Mai, listen to me.

535
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,640
Lock yourself inside a room
and call an ambulance.

536
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,800
On second thought, I'll call.
I'll go to your house with the police.

537
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,240
Do you hear me? Mai?

538
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,880
You killed her, Mai. You killed her.

539
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,120
No, I didn't.

540
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,840
I didn't kill her.

541
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,160
What happened, Fon?

542
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,160
Mai called saying his mom is dead.

543
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,520
What? I'll drive you there.

544
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,840
Let's go. Come on.

545
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,480
-Mink, call Mhai and let her know.
-Sure.

546
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,880
Let's go.

549
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,640
-Where are you going?
-Mai called saying his mom is dead.

550
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,920
I heard his dad yelling in the background.

551
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,360
Rey, call the police and an ambulance.

552
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,400
-Okay.
-Fon, come with me. Get in.

553
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,840
-Okay.
-I'm counting on you.

555
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,520
You, I'm going to kill you.

556
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,640
Mai, you are dead. Open the door.

557
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,120
I'm going to kill you, Mai. Open the door.

558
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,440
Open the door now.

559
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,920
You won't open it, will you?

560
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,640
All right then.

561
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,080
Mom!

562
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,160
Mom!

563
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,760
Mai is not picking up, Mhai.

564
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,200
His dad might have hurt him.

565
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,320
Ask Rey what the police say.
Report their family issue too.

566
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,040
Okay.

567
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,240
Mai, open the door.

568
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,000
I said, open the door. Damn it.

569
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,960
Open the door.

570
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,480
Open the door now.
I'm going to kill you, Mai.

571
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,080
What's going on?

572
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,040
Open the door.

573
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,840
Don't go inside.

574
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,160
Rong might be armed.

575
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,440
We work for the foundation
and the police are on their way.

576
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,240
Could we have male volunteers
come with us?

577
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,600
Mai, you ungrateful son.

578
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,200
You killed your mom, Mai.

579
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,040
I'm going to kill you.
You killed your mom, you ungrateful son.

580
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,160
Come out here this instant. Come out.

581
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,520
The police and an ambulance
are on their way. Come downstairs, Narong.

582
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,200
Who are you? How did you get inside?

583
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,880
Mai killed his own mom.
That ungrateful son.

584
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,080
We are representatives of the foundation.

585
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,160
We know what happened.

586
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,520
Where is Mai?

587
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,840
He's inside a room.
I'm going to cut his head open.

588
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,960
Here come the police.

589
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,360
Stay calm.

590
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,520
Mai, it's me, Fon.

591
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,800
Open the door.

592
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,680
The police have arrived.

593
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,760
An ambulance is coming.

594
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,080
We are here for you.

595
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,200
Come with us, Mai.

596
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,920
I'm staying with my mom.

597
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,760
I'm staying with her.

598
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,400
RUAMKATANYU FOUNDATION

599
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,320
He killed his mom.

600
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,680
He's the reason she's dead.

601
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,560
Mai, no.

602
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,920
Calm down.

603
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,680
Look at him and his messed-up personality.

604
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,640
I didn't kill her.
You are the one who should have died.

605
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,600
Fuck you! You are no longer my son.

606
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,280
I never saw you as my dad.

607
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,320
Keep it together, Mai.
Focus on taking your mom out of here.

608
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,040
Let's go.

609
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,320
Arrest him.
Put him in a detention center or jail.

610
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,640
I'm standing right here.

611
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,760
You have no right to assault anyone.

612
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,400
What are you talking about? I'm his dad.

613
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,640
Go ahead! Do it!

614
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,120
We work for the foundation

615
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,720
where Malai reported herself
as a victim of domestic violence.

616
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,360
Assaulting your son
in the presence of the police

617
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,600
will serve as evidence that could result
in your arrest for physical assault.

618
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,120
We have been collecting evidence

619
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,560
that you have been
physically abusing Malai and Mai.

620
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,320
We can use it as evidence
to prosecute you in court, you know.

621
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,560
You bastards tore my family apart.

622
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,960
Are you the reason
Mai has been disobeying me?

623
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,600
Malai is dead
because all of you kept pressuring her.

624
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,000
Enough, Narong.

625
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,240
Take a good look, everybody.

626
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,440
These nosy people destroyed my family.

627
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,720
Could you not bear to see two people
in love that you had to intervene?

628
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,000
Love?

629
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,640
Lovers don't abuse each other.
How disgusting.

630
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,440
Don't use love as an excuse
to assault anyone.

631
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,080
Enough, Fon.
Let the police take care of it.

632
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,040
Narong, come to the station with us.

633
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,600
All of you too.

634
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,760
Let's go.

635
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,320
Let's go.

636
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,840
We'll meet you there.

637
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,200
-Let's go, Mai.
-Okay.

638
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,120
That's right.

639
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,560
Fon, call a volunteer lawyer
to seek legal advice.

640
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
Okay.

641
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,640
Mai, wait here.

642
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,520
Hello, Lawyer Pol, it's me, Fon.

643
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,720
You must be tired.

644
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,080
Take him to get some rest.

645
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,760
Yes, Mhai.

646
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,560
Let's go, Mai.

647
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,040
This room is currently unoccupied.

648
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,520
Mhai wants you to stay here
for the time being.

649
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,720
Are you okay with that?

650
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,120
Mhai will come and talk to you.

651
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,960
I will get you some necessities.

652
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,640
Is she going to perform
a psychological evaluation?

653
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,040
I'm fine.

654
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,080
I just want to retrieve her body.

655
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,680
Our lawyer is at the hospital,
closely working on the case.

656
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,320
I'll let Mhai know
that you want to retrieve her body.

657
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,360
I was on my way
to give her my first paycheck.

658
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,400
I thought I could ease her burden…

659
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,280
and earn her respect as an adult.

660
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,360
But she left me.

661
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,520
You have to move on with life
for your own good.

662
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,960
Good things will happen to you.

663
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,720
You deserve a good life.

664
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,600
I truly believe so.

665
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,560
Why didn't my mom believe

666
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,520
that there were good people out there
willing to help her?

667
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,960
Someone like Fon.

668
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,560
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

669
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,680
Hello.

670
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,800
The autopsy report is out.

671
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,320
Malai committed suicide.

672
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,760
If her relatives have no objections,
they can claim her body for the funeral.

673
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,120
Thank you very much.

674
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,320
MALAI KEAWSAWAT, BORN 18TH MAY, 1972

675
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,880
DECEASED 22ND JULY, 2017 45 YEARS OLD

676
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,640
Malai…

677
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,240
Mai!

678
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,480
Take a good look at him.

679
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,920
Mai is an ungrateful child

680
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,800
who caused his mom so much trouble
that she killed herself.

681
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,960
Narong, if you are here
to cause a scene, please leave.

682
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,000
Did you forget
the police's warning yesterday?

683
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,720
She's no better.

684
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,320
She and her foundation

685
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,760
like to tear families apart.

686
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,960
Damn you, hypocrites
hiding behind your charity facade.

687
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,240
You're the one who destroyed our family.

688
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,560
Everyone knows you used
to abuse Mom every day.

689
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,440
That's why I had to seek their help.

690
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,680
That's what killed her.

691
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,200
All of you put a lot of pressure on her.

692
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,160
Otherwise, she wouldn't
have killed herself. Mai, you idiot!

693
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,800
Are you still at it, Narong?

694
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,080
Yes.

695
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,880
Don't worry.

696
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,800
Rest assured
Narong won't cause any trouble here.

697
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,080
Thank you.

698
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,520
You are welcome.

699
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,600
Should we sue him for defamation?

700
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,640
If we sued every jerk like him, we'd have
ten times as many cases on our hands.

701
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,160
He discourages me.

702
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:31,520
If you're going to do this job, you can't
let the words of these people affect you.

703
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,920
Just focus

704
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,920
on what you're doing.

705
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,520
You could punch until your hand breaks,
but your dad wouldn't feel a thing.

706
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,840
You're the only one getting hurt.

707
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,040
Come on, let me clean your wound.

708
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,720
Remember this.

709
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,080
Don't let that man hurt you anymore.

710
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,600
He might be your dad,

711
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,840
but the moment he laid a hand on you,

712
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,040
he was no longer fit to be a dad.

713
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,080
As long as you still feel hurt
by his actions,

714
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,760
you'll never be able to escape from him.

715
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,640
Do you understand?

716
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,800
-Nicha is pregnant.
-What?

717
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,560
-Look.
-How could this happen?

718
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,200
I'm begging you. Get out.

719
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,000
All of you, get out.

720
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,120
We are here to see Mr. Tannatorn.

721
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,320
He's over there.

722
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,600
You have destroyed the honor and dignity
of the profession of teacher.

723
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,960
Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?

724
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,600
I'm just a gas deliveryman.

725
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,360
Do you want to see the lights?
I'll take you.

726
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,560
That sounds fun.

727
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:23,320
