1
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,360
Have you worked on a case

2
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,600
where a man reached out to us before?

3
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,600
-You…
-Do it! I'll definitely fight back.

4
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
-You ungrateful son.
-Stop.

5
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,640
I always fight for you,
but you never fight with me.

6
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,720
You can help me
by not fighting with your dad.

7
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,320
That's all I ask of you.

8
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Mom!

9
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm going to kill you.

10
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,720
Come out here this instant.

11
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,480
Good things will happen to you.

12
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,040
You deserve a good life.

13
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,760
I truly believe so.

14
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
An ungrateful child

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,000
who caused his mom so much trouble
that she killed herself.

16
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
You could punch until your hand breaks,
but your dad wouldn't feel a thing.

17
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
You're the only one getting hurt.

18
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,640
What a coincidence.

19
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,920
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

20
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,480
Thank you so much for today.

21
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Aren't you hungry?

22
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,800
You haven't eaten anything

23
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
all day.

24
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,280
I don't have an appetite.

25
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,440
You might not be hungry

26
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,640
but I am.

27
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,240
Will you help me make noodles?

28
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,040
Please.

29
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,760
Put the noodles in the pot.

30
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
They are over there.

31
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,640
Put two bags in.

32
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,160
Let's add sausage.

33
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,959
It looks delicious.

34
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
I'm not hungry.

35
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,600
Just admit you are hungry.

36
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,560
Lying is bad.

37
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,800
Fine.

38
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,280
Eat some, Mai.

39
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,480
You need energy. Trust me.

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,360
If Malai was here,

41
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,200
she would want you to eat.

42
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't make her worry.

43
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,920
Okay.

44
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,000
Come on, let's eat.

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,000
Look.

46
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,160
Thank you.

47
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,880
Take more sausages.

48
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,400
Thank you.

49
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,040
Mai.

50
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,400
-You can't enter.
-I'm here to see my son.

51
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,200
Mai, come here.

52
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,040
Come here.

53
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,680
Are you going to keep hiding
under women's skirts?

54
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,640
Come here, Mai.

55
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,600
Give me some money.

56
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Give me money.

57
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,880
Or I'll come here every day
until you give me money.

58
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm your dad, Mai.

59
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,640
Give me money.

60
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,640
Don't be ashamed.
He should be ashamed of himself.

61
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,880
If he's a bad guy, then he should be
the one feeling ashamed.

62
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,400
Remember that.

63
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
Thank you for that, Rey.

64
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,480
Mai, come here.

65
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,000
-Come here already.
-Leave.

66
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,320
You're coming to the station
with me, Narong. Come on.

67
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,920
-Why are you arresting me?
-I'm taking you to the station.

68
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,560
I didn't do anything wrong.
I came to see my son.

69
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,960
-Take him away, Officer.
-Come with me.

70
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,960
We have evidence from the security camera.

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,200
I'll send you the footage.

72
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,480
Come with me. Come on.

73
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,320
A new girl is coming today

74
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,520
so I'll have to ask you
to sleep downstairs.

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
Don't worry about me.

76
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,480
I've made a decision.

77
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
What decision?

78
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm moving into a friend's house tomorrow.

79
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,560
I would have to quit school

80
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,200
if I moved to my aunt and uncle's house.

81
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,920
They are already struggling
financially without me.

82
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
You must have thought it through.

83
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
You have my respect.

84
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,680
Yes.

85
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,840
Mai.

86
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,840
I'm not chasing you away.

87
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,960
Lady Saengsuda, the president of the
foundation, is aware of your situation.

88
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,320
She said you are more than welcome to stay
until you feel ready to leave.

89
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,440
I feel grateful for your help.

90
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,280
Are you sure

91
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,039
you are ready to leave?

92
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,760
Yes, I'm sure.

93
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,159
I respect your decision.

94
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,640
You should know

95
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,360
that everyone here loves you
and wants the best for you.

96
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,000
No matter what happens,
you are a part of our family.

97
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,080
Thank you.

98
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,760
Shit.

99
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
You're good.

100
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,480
I'm not bad myself.

101
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,400
We cannot offer him a scholarship.

102
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,040
Otherwise, other parents would come
to us for scholarships.

103
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,120
I hope you understand.

104
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,160
Damn, you're good.

105
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
Hey.

106
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,240
Hey.

107
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,160
Fon.

108
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
Mai.

109
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,800
I knew it was you.
I recognized your uniform.

110
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,400
I…

111
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,760
-Bee, get lost.
-What?

112
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,360
-Why?
-Just go.

113
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,480
Gosh, you are being overly protective.

114
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,520
What brings you to my school?

115
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
You didn't tell me you were coming.

116
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,800
Well, I came to request
a scholarship for you.

117
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,960
I failed today, but I'll try again.

118
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,400
No wonder a teacher asked me about
my family on the first day of school.

119
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,840
Don't worry about me.

120
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,320
My teacher said
I can still take the exams.

121
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,080
I can pay tuition later
in exchange for my diploma.

122
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,760
I'm planning to find a job,
save some money, get my diploma,

123
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,360
and enroll in an open university.

124
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,680
I currently work for Bee's family.

125
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,760
I make enough to get by.

126
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
The friend you are living with?

127
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,400
What does his family do?

128
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,760
They sell gas.

129
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,920
On my days off from school or whenever
I finish school early, I help deliver gas.

130
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,960
Let's try hard together.

131
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,920
You keep studying and working hard

132
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,840
and I'll do my best
to get you a scholarship.

133
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,280
Is your dad still stalking you?

134
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,400
Not anymore.

135
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,840
He tried to ambush me
at the bus stop in front of the school,

136
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,400
but I spotted him first.

137
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,840
He probably realized
it was a waste of time.

138
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
He'd better spend that time drinking.

139
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,160
You should get to class.

140
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,960
Don't forget me and Mhai.

141
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
I could never forget you guys.

142
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,960
Bye.

143
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,480
-Hey.
-Hey, you scared me.

144
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,880
You forgot your bag.

145
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,600
Who was that woman?

146
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,680
She works for the foundation
that helped me.

147
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,720
You were smiling from ear to ear
while talking to her.

148
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,080
She has been so kind to me.
I couldn't bring myself to frown at her.

149
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,960
Whatever, you better not
be having a crush on her

150
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,240
or I'll tease you
until your baby grows old.

151
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,880
-You missed me.
-Watch your mouth.

152
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,600
Of course, I miss you, and only you.

153
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,320
Who else would I miss?

154
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,680
I'm dying to see you.
When will you be free?

155
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,720
Tomorrow? What time?

156
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,400
Sure.

157
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,960
Mai, you should sleep here tonight.

158
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Don't go to the store.

159
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,480
-Okay.
-Good.

160
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,440
I have my undivided attention on you.

161
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,680
Let's try hard together.

162
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,800
You keep studying and working hard

163
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
and I'll do my best
to get you a scholarship.

164
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,280
-Hey.
-Do you have money?

165
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
If not, get lost.

166
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,760
I'll pay you when Mai comes home.

167
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,280
Your son? He's not coming back.

168
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,160
No one can put up with you.

169
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,920
-Give it to me.
-No.

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,360
-Give it back.
-Let go.

171
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
Give it back or I'll call the police.

172
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,680
If you call the police,

173
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,120
I will kill you.

174
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,440
Don't try me.

175
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,400
He's the worst person I've ever met.

176
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,840
What happened to my house?

177
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,240
Narong.

178
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,520
If you can't afford rent, move out.

179
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,120
Even after I cut off your water,
you shamelessly stood your ground.

180
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,360
I'll bring the police
if you don't move out.

181
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,720
I'm not scared of the police.

182
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,440
No one can drag me out of here.

183
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,240
Listen, you can sue me if you want.

184
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,160
You jerk.

185
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,440
I've never met anyone as shameless as you.

186
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,160
Did you just insult me?

187
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,600
Did you insult me?

188
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,760
What are you going to do about it?

189
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,960
You.

190
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,880
Hey, don't you dare.

191
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,480
Don't test me.

192
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,760
-Help!
-Bring it.

193
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,480
-Help!
-Come back.

194
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,040
I dare you.

195
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,920
Mom, I'm back.

196
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,720
-You're back.
-Yes.

197
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,640
You are such a loud boy.

198
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,600
Stop, Mai.

199
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,560
Go get changed and have dinner first
before helping out.

200
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,680
A dirty uniform is hard to clean.

201
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,800
Yes, Mom.

202
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,840
I admire you for being a hard worker.

203
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,040
Can I be your first fan?

204
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,600
Are you his fan?
Have you finished your homework?

205
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,440
Almost, Mom.

206
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,840
You keep saying that. You've solved
two questions in the past two hours.

207
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,440
You must have turned too quickly
when you were a fetus.

208
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,560
Your brain didn't receive enough blood.

209
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,800
Mom.

210
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,280
Mom, my uniform is all dirty.

211
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,640
What happened? It wasn't dirty earlier.

212
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,120
I just rubbed filth on myself.

213
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,560
Look.

214
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Why would you do that? How old are you?
Go take a shower and eat dinner.

215
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,560
Mom, you didn't laugh at my joke.

216
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,520
Because it wasn't funny.

217
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,920
-Bell, you…
-Here we go.

218
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Go finish your homework.

219
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,640
Please go your separate ways. Go away.

220
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,840
Go finish your homework. Go.

221
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,680
MAI: CAN WE MEET? I'VE SAVED
ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY YOU A MEAL.

222
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,720
Mai.

223
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,800
Can we meet?

224
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
I've saved enough money to buy you dinner.

225
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,480
Don't worry about it.
Save the money for yourself.

226
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,840
Sure, how about we meet
at the bus stop in the afternoon?

227
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,520
Okay.

228
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,080
Fon.

229
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,480
-When did you get here?
-Not long ago.

230
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
What do you want to eat?

231
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,400
You decide since you're paying.

232
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,760
But choose something cheaper
than our last meal.

233
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,880
Or you might owe me another meal.

234
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,520
I won't let you pay.
You've helped me so much.

235
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,720
Why don't we cross the road
and catch a bus to the mall?

236
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,280
Why don't we eat somewhere close?

237
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,200
The noodle shop in the market
looks good. Let's go there.

238
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,160
Sure.

239
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,480
You refused to eat at the mall

240
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,840
because you were concerned
it might get expensive, didn't you?

241
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,920
That's part of the reason.

242
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,520
But this shop is also really good.
Try it if you don't believe me.

243
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,760
How is it?

244
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,160
My mom cooked it better.

245
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,520
I'm sorry.

246
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,200
Hey.

247
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,400
Keep it down.
You are lucky he didn't scold you.

248
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480
You are funny.

249
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,360
You're afraid of him but not my dad.

250
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,080
It's different.

251
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,320
With your dad, I'm just doing my job.

252
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,520
I don't enjoy getting into fights
outside of work.

253
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,360
What major did you study
that got you working at the foundation?

254
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,480
I was in the Faculty of Humanities,
Department of Sociology.

255
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,160
What about you? What's your plan in life?

256
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,360
I have a goal.

257
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,840
You'll be the first to know what it is
once I've achieved it.

258
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,840
That's good to hear.

259
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,840
I don't know if I'll succeed.

260
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,720
I don't want to get my hopes up

261
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,320
because I'll be disappointed
if things don't go my way.

262
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,840
I'll be waiting for the good news.

263
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,920
Look what's happening.

264
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,040
I'm letting you buy me dinner as promised.

265
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,720
Let me do it.

266
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,760
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

267
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,360
Hello, beautiful.

268
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,960
Your clips are so cute.

269
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,160
Feel free to have a look.

270
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,960
-Aren't they cute?
-Yes, they are.

271
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,640
-How much is it?
-It's 20 baht.

272
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,760
Which one suits me best?

273
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,040
This one.

274
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,920
But the colors are a bit dull.
I like this one.

275
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,520
Isn't this one cute? I think it's cute.

276
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,680
It's a flower.

277
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,360
-I…
-Don't you like it?

278
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,120
I'll take this one.

279
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
Mai, you paid for the food.
Let me pay for the bus.

280
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,840
You paid for our way there.

281
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,960
We're fighting over bus tickets.

282
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,320
I'll let you pay if that's what you want.

283
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,480
Thanks.

284
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,400
Where is your friend's house?

285
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,480
It's nearby.

286
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,960
I've even delivered gas
to a house on your street before.

287
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,320
Really?

288
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,320
Don't you have to work
on the weekends like today?

289
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,760
I don't get paid on my days off.

290
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,680
Bee's mom doesn't mind.
She's a kind person.

291
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,400
I just don't understand why my mom

292
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,800
didn't have the courage to walk away
from that kind of life.

293
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,880
She didn't believe that anyone
could genuinely be kind to us.

294
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,840
Everyone's experiences are different, Mai.

295
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,800
It's not her fault.

296
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Some women,

297
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,240
even after being physically
or emotionally abused,

298
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,280
still love the men who hurt them.

299
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,640
I never got angry at her.

300
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,160
I just felt disappointed and sad

301
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
that she wouldn't allow herself the chance
to have a better life.

302
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,520
You have a positive outlook on life.

303
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,840
You aren't afraid of change.

304
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,440
That requires a great deal of courage.

305
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,560
Hey, we've passed your stop.

306
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,040
Why didn't you tell me?
Now you have to pay for the ride back.

307
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't worry about me.
It's just one stop away. I can walk back.

308
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,440
I walked here from home.

309
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
I have to see you home first.

310
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,040
I see. Thanks.

311
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,040
Good luck.

312
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Stay in touch.

313
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,040
I will. We aren't strangers.

314
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,720
After all, we are only one bus stop away.

315
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,760
I'll go from here. See you later.

316
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,480
Today is my birthday.

317
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,920
Thank you.

318
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,680
Darn it.

319
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,360
I didn't bring him a gift.

320
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,280
I even refused to eat at the mall.

321
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm sorry, Mai.

322
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,160
Don't lose your personality.

323
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,600
I believe everything will turn out
as you hope.

324
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,040
Happy birthday, Mai.

325
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,160
I woke up early so I thought
I could take the bus with you.

326
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,400
This way, you won't be lonely.

327
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,480
Thank you for your concern.

328
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,680
You won't nag me, right?

329
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,560
Why would I? It's your life.

330
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,320
Do you see me as an old lady or something?

331
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,480
Yes.

332
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,160
Watch it.

333
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,240
The bus is here, Fon.

334
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,400
Fon, take a seat.

335
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,520
Ma'am, take my seat.

336
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,480
Come.

337
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,360
Thanks, dear.

338
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,320
You are indeed a social worker.

339
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,640
I would do the same
even if I wasn't a social worker.

340
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,880
They put clear signs.

341
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,080
Did you offer her the seat
out of conscience or because of the signs?

342
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,360
The signs.

343
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,760
Come here.

344
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,120
Go inside. Go.

345
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,480
Stay here.
You don't have to go to school anymore.

346
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,360
I'll withdraw you from school.

347
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,760
Stay here until you repent.

348
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,400
Wait.

349
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
Miss Nicha.

350
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,680
Miss Nicha.

351
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,720
MAI: YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE SKIPPING WORK.

352
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,880
You didn't tell me you were skipping work.
I'm going to school then.

353
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200
Mhai.

354
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,400
Can I take this morning off?

355
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,280
I've been feeling sick since last night.

356
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,280
Take the whole day off.

357
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,280
No, I can still go.

358
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,880
You either take today off or resign.

359
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,040
Fine, thank you very much.

360
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,560
You are welcome.

361
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,360
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

362
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Mai.

363
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,480
Get on.

364
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,680
Tell me. How are you just arriving
when you left home so early?

365
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,240
I was stuck in traffic.

366
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,880
You should ride a bike like me. I woke
up late and I didn't get stuck in traffic.

367
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,400
-Yes, you are a genius.
-Of course I am.

368
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,640
I'm taking today off.

369
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,160
You didn't skip school, did you?

370
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
No, I know my duty.

371
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,240
Why are you taking today off?
Are you sick?

372
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,200
A bit.

373
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,480
Mhai made me choose
between taking today off and resigning.

374
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,120
I'll visit you after school.

375
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,640
I'm really fine.

376
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,880
I actually need your advice on something.

377
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,800
Let's meet at the food court
in the alley then.

378
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,400
I knew it.

379
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,040
Mai, you said you didn't like her.

380
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,720
I'll tease you about this
until your baby grows old.

381
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,960
Suit yourself.

382
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,880
The teacher is calling you.

383
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,920
Mai!

384
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,120
I'm sorry for dragging you out here.

385
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,840
Don't worry about it.

386
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,480
What's the urgent matter?

387
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,320
Well, I heard

388
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,040
my dad is reaching out to my friends
to track down my address.

389
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
Tell me if he shows up at the foundation.

390
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
Who told you this?

391
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,480
Bee, my best friend.

392
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,240
He saw my dad ambushing me
in front of the school.

393
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,960
When did this happen?

394
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,760
Two days ago.

395
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,280
Don't worry about me. I just thought
it's something you should know.

396
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,800
Let's talk about you.
Have you seen a doctor?

397
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,840
I can go with you.

398
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,360
Thanks for offering.

399
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,280
But it's just my sinuses.

400
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,720
You always say that.

401
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,600
I'll tell Mhai.

402
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,000
Hey.

403
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,920
Are you in a rush to deliver gas?

404
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,560
Since we're already here,
let's eat something.

405
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm not in a rush.

406
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,400
Are you sure
you don't want to go home and rest?

407
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,440
I do.

408
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,280
But I should just eat here

409
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,560
so I can take my medicine
and sleep once I get home.

410
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,840
I'll see you home after this.

411
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,920
You don't have to.

412
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Why not?

413
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,000
Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?

414
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,440
I'm just a gas deliveryman.

415
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,560
It's none of those reasons.

416
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,000
Then it means I can see you home.

417
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,720
I'll let the foundation know
about your dad.

418
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,640
What?

419
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,800
Oh, that.

420
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,920
I'll be fine.

421
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,440
We can only hope so.

422
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,520
I'm glad you came to me.

423
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,240
Call me the next time you feel sick.

424
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,080
Use the time for yourself.
Don't waste it on me.

425
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,240
I'm an adult.

426
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,640
Being an adult sucks.

427
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What do you mean?

428
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,960
I see that you are always alone.

429
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,480
You go places alone.

430
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,840
At least, I've got friends.

431
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,360
It's nice that you have friends.

432
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
But you don't have one.

433
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,400
You're wrong.

434
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,080
I love being an adult.

435
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,000
We get to make our own decisions.

436
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,800
We take care of ourselves,
without being under anyone's control.

437
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,320
You should go.

438
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,920
Get well soon.

439
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,760
Call me if you need someone
to go to the hospital with you.

440
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,400
Even though you're an adult,

441
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,520
everyone should have
a friend by their side.

442
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
See you later.

443
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,360
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION
WOMEN AND CHILDREN PROTECTION CENTER

444
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,960
Sure, I'll call you tomorrow
to ask questions.

445
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,080
Thank you.

446
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,280
Goodbye.

447
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,040
After the Loy Krathong festival,

448
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,480
our number of cases
increased significantly.

449
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,960
How can we reduce the number?

450
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,160
We need to address
the root of the problem.

451
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,720
You're right. We've received three more
new cases within the past week.

452
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,960
Oh, no. It's lunchtime for the children.
I have to go.

453
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,080
Mink, come with me.

454
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,360
Yes, Rey.

455
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,320
Let's go.

456
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,120
Hello, you've reached Kanyamit Foundation.

457
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,080
Hello, may I speak to Plaifon?

458
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,320
I'm speaking. Is that you, Lieutenant?

459
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,160
POL. LT. SUPHANUT TANABUMRUNGRUANG

460
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,520
Hello, Fon.

461
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,160
A 17-year-old runaway girl

462
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,920
needs shelter.

463
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Of course, I'll pick her up with…

464
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,760
Mhai.

465
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,040
Thank you. Goodbye.

466
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,240
Great. Goodbye.

467
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,480
SUVARNABHUMI AIRPORT POLICE STATION

468
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,440
I'm sorry for bothering you, Fon.

469
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,400
Don't worry about it.
Feel free to call me at any time.

470
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,840
Thank you for thinking of us.

471
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,960
Honestly,

472
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,240
I have a hard time dealing
with delicate cases like this.

473
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,760
It's easier for me to catch bad guys.

474
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,360
I'm not really good at comforting people.

475
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,400
That's why we need to rely on each other.

476
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,400
You were detained for one month?

477
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,960
What happened, Nicha?

478
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,480
Tell us.

479
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,080
We can't help you
unless you tell us what happened.

480
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,160
Mr. Tan…

481
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,320
and I…

482
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,640
We are in love.

483
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,320
When my dad found out,

484
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,680
he wouldn't let me go to school.

485
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,720
He locked me inside the house.

486
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,120
He said he was going to get Mr. Tan fired.

487
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,880
Mr. Tan doesn't teach there anymore.

488
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,800
I'm worried about him.

489
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,600
I want to find him.

490
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,760
I don't know where he is
or how he's doing.

491
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,280
Nicha,

492
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,920
do you realize that this family issue

493
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,280
has now turned into a criminal case?

494
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,280
Mr. Tan committed a crime

495
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,200
because you are only 17 years old.

496
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,520
No, please let him go.

497
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,240
You can't arrest him.

498
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,520
He didn't do anything wrong.

499
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,360
He's a very good man.
We truly love each other.

500
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,200
He didn't deceive me.

501
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,400
Please don't arrest him.

502
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,160
He's the kindest man I've ever met.

503
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,000
Apart from providing shelter,

504
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,640
we need to work on changing
her mindset while she's here.

505
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,360
You talked to her.
What's your opinion on this case?

506
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,080
I don't blame her.

507
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,720
It's teenage love.

508
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,680
She has been seduced by her teacher.

509
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,200
The more we try to stop her, the more
emotional turmoil it will cause her.

510
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,920
She will do whatever it takes
to prove us wrong and to prove her love.

511
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,200
We should slowly talk to her
and try to understand her

512
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,880
without using words like right or wrong.

513
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,160
Fon.

514
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,920
Did you hear what I said?

515
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,400
Yes.

516
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,560
Do you have any suggestions?

517
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,320
I'm just wondering

518
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,400
if we'll be able
to track down the teacher.

519
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,320
The police will find him.

520
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,200
Don't talk to Nicha yet.

521
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,400
I'll handle it.

522
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,480
I want to try talking to her, Mhai.

523
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,480
Our hardest job

524
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,920
is to change a victim's mindset.

525
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,600
It's difficult to do so
without their cooperation.

526
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
You focus on coordinating with the police.

527
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,320
Okay.

528
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,240
-One spicy seafood salad, please.
-Sure.

529
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,560
How much?

530
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,120
It's 40 baht.

531
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,680
Hey.

532
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,720
I'll give you a ride.

533
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,320
Bee's mom will punish you
for slacking off.

534
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,400
I'm not, I've completed my delivery.
I'm on my way home.

535
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,160
Thanks for the ride.

536
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,920
Keep working hard.

537
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,040
I will.

538
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,920
The store will be closed for New Year
so I have to make extra money now.

539
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,880
What's your plan for the New Year?

540
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,040
I don't know yet.

541
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,800
Don't you have to visit your family?

542
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,400
No.

543
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,400
Let's have a barbecue together then.

544
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
Okay.

545
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,880
-See you then.
-See you.

546
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,120
Here you go.

547
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,640
Thank you, Mai.

548
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,800
Don't thank him, Mom.

549
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,080
He would deliver to that alley for free.

550
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,000
What are you saying?

551
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,520
I wouldn't make him work for free.
You're unbelievable.

552
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,400
You don't know anything.

553
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,200
Mai has a crush on a girl
who lives in that alley.

554
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,040
Look at him smiling from ear to ear.

555
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,200
I'm sorry for this.

556
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,120
-Come with me.
-What?

557
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,880
Calm down. What the hell?

558
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,600
What's with you?

559
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,760
She agreed to go eat a barbecue with me.

560
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,760
Really?

561
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,640
How romantic.

562
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,960
-Barbecue.
-Mai, Bee.

563
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,680
What are you guys doing here
so suspiciously?

564
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,920
We are standing out in the open.

565
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,960
How exactly do we look suspicious, Bell?

566
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,680
I wouldn't do anything suspicious
with him. Don't worry.

567
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Listen to him.

568
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,160
Learn to talk nicely to your sister
like Mai does.

569
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,800
Go inside.

570
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,520
The adults are talking about girls.

571
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,360
You're just a kid. Go away.

572
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,200
I'm not a kid.
I'm only 1.5 years younger than you.

573
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,440
Who's the girl?

574
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,320
Ignore him.

575
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,320
Not you. Leave us, Bell. Go inside.

576
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,760
-Go inside.
-Bee.

577
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,360
You didn't use to come to the store.

578
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,200
She has been coming here every day
ever since you started working here.

579
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,480
What a brat.

580
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,520
What's your plan for the New Year?

581
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,120
I don't know yet.

582
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,120
Let's have a barbecue together then.

583
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,560
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION
WOMEN AND CHILDREN PROTECTION CENTER

584
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
Nicha.

585
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,520
You look much livelier.

586
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,120
What's up?

587
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,960
Any updates on Mr. Tan?

588
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,760
Not yet.

589
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,200
This means he's still safe.

590
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,880
Fon, I have something to tell you.

591
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,240
Take a seat.

592
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,280
What is it?

593
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,560
You can talk to me about anything.

594
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,360
Here she comes.

595
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,960
What's the matter?

596
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,960
-Nicha is pregnant.
-What?

597
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,000
We already tested her.

598
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,280
She's not pregnant.

599
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,560
Look.

600
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,520
How could this happen?

601
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,840
I'm late on my period.

602
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,840
Don't worry.

603
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,720
We already tested you.
You're not pregnant.

604
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:45,640
Sometimes, stress can cause
irregular periods.

605
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,040
I was terrified back then.

606
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,120
I didn't take the test.

607
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,320
What do you mean?

608
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,200
I dropped water on the stick.

609
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,320
I asked her to take another test today.

610
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,480
I'll take her to the hospital
to see how far along she is.

611
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,080
You want to volunteer
to stay over on the weekends.

612
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,600
Yes.

613
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,800
I've been talking to Nicha.

614
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,840
There's no indication
that she'll do anything concerning.

615
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,000
It happened to Mai's mom before.

616
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,680
We shouldn't have let them go home.

617
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,280
We couldn't change Mai's mom's mind.

618
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,200
But with Nicha, she still hopes
to build a family with that teacher.

619
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,520
Dear.

620
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,120
We have employees
rotating to look after them

621
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,280
and there are other children
in the room as well.

622
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,480
Mhai.

623
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,120
What if we find out

624
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,840
that they truly love each other
after we track him down?

625
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,120
Is there a chance for them to be together?

626
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,440
What would we have to do?

627
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,080
If that were really the case,

628
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,400
Mr. Tan would be prosecuted.

629
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,520
And if they both wanted
to start a family afterward,

630
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,560
they'd need long-term counseling
from a therapist.

631
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,200
It'd be a long
and challenging journey, Fon.

632
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,760
Love is such a powerful thing.

633
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,800
But it's heartbreaking when love happens
at the wrong time, in the wrong way,

634
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,520
or in this case, with the wrong person.

635
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,320
I agree, Rey.

636
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,080
Poor girl.

637
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,720
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

638
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,640
Here you are.

639
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,480
Rey, you stay here.
You're too far along in your pregnancy.

640
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,640
-Are you sure?
-Take care of this end.

641
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,560
Okay.

642
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,320
-Let's go, Fon.
-Where are we going?

643
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,600
Suphan Buri province.

644
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,480
The police have found Mr. Tan.
He's at the station.

645
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,120
-Let's go.
-Come on.

646
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,600
-Excuse me.
-Hello.

647
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,600
We are here to see Mr. Tannatorn.

648
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,000
He's over there.

649
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,000
Mr. Tannatorn has denied the allegations.

650
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,200
He stated that he didn't force
or deceive anyone.

651
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,320
The female student seduced him.

652
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,720
We've recorded everything
in the daily report.

653
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,760
We have enough evidence
to approve his bail.

654
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,440
Therefore, we have no choice
but to release him.

655
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,640
Am I free to go?

656
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,840
Mr. Tan,

657
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,280
are you aware that Nicha is pregnant?

658
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,960
I'm certain the baby isn't mine.

659
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,000
I can prove it to you
in whichever way you'd like.

660
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,480
You have destroyed the honor and dignity
of the profession of teacher.

661
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,840
You've shamed teachers nationwide.

662
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,560
We will ensure that
you receive legal punishment.

663
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,960
Just wait and see.

664
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,400
Fon.

665
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,400
-Leave me alone. Get out.
-Pull yourself together.

666
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,000
Nicha, pull yourself together

667
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,120
-and listen to me.
-Get out.

668
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,320
-I'm telling you--
-I'll take it from here.

669
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,200
Nicha.

670
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,240
-Listen to me.
-No.

671
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,640
-Get out. I don't want to hear it.
-How's Nicha doing?

672
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,000
She has been acting this way
after she found out Mr. Tan has a family.

673
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,200
-Get out.
-Nicha.

674
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,320
No, get out.

675
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,040
All of you, get out.

676
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,320
-Nicha, listen to me--
-Enough, Rey.

677
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,640
I'm begging you. Get out.

678
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,440
All of you, get out.

679
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,320
Get out!

680
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,120
I'll stay over tonight. Don't worry.

681
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,080
Okay.

682
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,160
There are two lives at stake this time.

683
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,080
Nicha is with a child.

684
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,640
It's time for her to make a decision.

685
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,120
It all depends on her now.

686
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,520
I can't seem to find a solution
to this problem, Mhai.

687
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,160
Every problem has a solution.

688
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,400
We've got through it together before.

689
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,480
That's right.

690
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,560
Last night, Nicha threatened to run away
if you get in the way of her love.

691
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,080
I even asked her,
what if he just nailed and bailed?

692
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,920
Why would she want to run away?

693
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,720
Then she looked at me
with such angry eyes.

694
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,920
She would have slapped me if she hadn't
feared that I'd slap her back.

695
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,240
Thanks for worrying about her
and telling me about this.

696
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,920
I'm not worried about her. She annoys me.

697
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,720
Who would be so stupid as to
not be able to distinguish true love?

698
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,320
She acts like she's better
than a spoiled child like me.

699
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,920
We all can't see the dust in our own eyes.

700
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,360
Sometimes, looking from an outsider's
perspective makes things clearer.

701
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,480
That's why we need to help each other.
Isn't that right?

702
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,920
Last night, Nicha threatened to run away
if you get in the way of her love.

703
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,280
I'll stay over tonight. Don't worry.

704
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,200
It's time for her to make a decision.

705
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,600
It all depends on her now.

706
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,720
Mai.

707
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,640
-Are you hungry?
-Yes, what about you?

708
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,920
A little bit.
I haven't eaten anything since lunch.

709
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,800
Me too.

710
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,200
Is the restaurant far away?

711
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,080
No, it's not.

712
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,760
It's only two streets away.

713
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,920
Do you have another restaurant in mind?

714
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,480
No, let's go to your restaurant.

715
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,400
Gosh, it's quite crowded.

716
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,520
I asked around while delivering gas.

717
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,480
Everyone recommended this place.

718
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,760
I see you did your research.

719
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,280
The weather's nice.
Why don't we sit outside?

720
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,480
-Sure, let's sit there.
-Okay.

721
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,800
I believe you now that you were hungry.

722
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,440
Everyone gets hungry, even you.

723
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,840
Of course, I didn't say I wasn't hungry.

724
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,280
Let me know next time you're hungry.
I'll come pick you up sooner.

725
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,160
Hey, did you just kick me?

726
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,440
I won't come with you again.

727
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,840
Fon, I'm sorry.

728
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,440
I'm sorry.

729
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,680
I'm kidding.

730
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,080
You'll pay for this.

731
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,280
Are you threatening me?

732
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,960
No, I'm telling you to pay for the meal.

733
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,360
Where do you want to go after this?

734
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,320
I don't know.

735
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,560
I'll probably go home.

736
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,840
Do you want to see the lights?
I'll take you.

737
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,560
That sounds fun.

738
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,320
Let's go.

739
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:18,920
This one is cooked.

740
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,600
-The bacon is also cooked.
-Mai.

741
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,640
Eat some yourself.
Don't give everything to me.

742
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,040
Eat this.

743
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,640
Hey, Mai.

744
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,480
Do you know where I can buy
a light bulb this size?

745
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,360
The light bulb in my bathroom
stopped working this morning.

746
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,920
Let's get a new light bulb at Bee's store
after we look at the lights.

747
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,360
They have many bulbs there.

748
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,400
No, we can't do that.

749
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,080
Yes, we can. They have a lot in supply.

750
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,400
I'll pay her back later. It's cheaper.

751
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,640
We're not stealing it.

752
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,400
Are you sure?

753
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,320
Of course. Why do you ask?

754
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,840
Are you afraid that I'll be fired
and you'll have to support me?

755
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,960
Yes, I can't even
support myself at this point.

756
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,080
I won't let you support me.

757
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,240
Come on, let's go see the lights.

758
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,280
It's beautiful.

759
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,920
Could you see me in the photo
if I stood here?

760
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,680
-Fon.
-Mai, be careful.

761
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,440
-Hold them.
-Are you going to take a photo?

762
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,000
Where is your childhood home?

763
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,160
It's near Pathum Thani province.

764
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,760
That's not far.

765
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,360
Do your parents still live there?

766
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,440
Yes, they do.

767
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,920
Don't you miss them?

768
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,480
Not every home
is worth returning to, is it?

769
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,600
By the way,

770
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,080
have you heard from your dad?

771
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,520
No.

772
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,040
Let's look at this together.

773
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,680
It's my grades for the first semester.

774
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,640
GPA

775
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,440
Your GPA is 3.89?

776
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,760
You know,
Bee will leave for university soon.

777
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,400
He'll have to stay in a dorm.

778
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,760
He's thinking about
giving me this motorcycle.

779
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,800
I might use it to deliver food.

780
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,120
It'll probably earn me more
than delivering gas.

781
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,160
Don't you envy your friend?

782
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,880
I'd be lying if I said no.

783
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,560
I'm glad he has a good life.

784
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,000
I wouldn't want anyone to be in my spot.

785
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,760
Why are you looking at me like that?

786
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,400
It's a gift for a smart boy.

787
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,960
On the bus,

788
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,720
I saw your current earphones getting old.

789
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,680
Am I right?

790
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,640
Thank you so much.

791
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,120
I'll treasure it with my life.

792
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,560
I have a gift for you too,
but I forgot to bring it.

793
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,200
I'll grab it when we get the lightbulb.

794
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,560
No, don't give me anything.

795
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,440
I want to. You gave me a gift.

796
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,840
Fon, wait here.

797
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,160
-What are you doing?
-Wait a second.

798
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,360
Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar?

799
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,480
-Do you know how to play?
-Kind of.

800
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,440
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

801
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,720
You are welcome.

802
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,120
-Fon, follow me.
-Where?

803
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,600
What are you doing?

804
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,840
Do you even know how to play?

805
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,920
I'm no longer addicted to coffee

806
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,760
I'm more addicted to you

807
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,800
My heart is currently not available
Because you are here by my side

808
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,240
We see each other almost every day

809
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,120
My friends ask
How we don't get tired of one another

810
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,680
How is that possible?

811
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,680
I'll clear their doubt with my answer

812
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,680
You haven't changed one bit
Since the first day we met

813
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,480
How can I not love you for it?

814
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,480
My girlfriend is so cute

815
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,440
Her cuteness could literally kill me

816
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,040
I don't care if anyone says

817
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,000
I'm obsessed with you

818
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,760
My girlfriend is too cute

819
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,800
Her cuteness could literally kill me

820
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,000
You make me want to be with you every day

821
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,920
My girlfriend is cute

822
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,120
My girlfriend is cute

823
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,640
Go back to your life and forget about me.

824
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,800
Have you ever loved someone?
Is it that easy to stop loving them?

825
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,480
I got close to you without realizing that
you would misinterpret my intention.

826
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,320
Plaifon.

827
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,800
I wish you a boyfriend.

828
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,080
I'd love it if you would
open your heart to me.

829
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,400
Will you be my girlfriend?

830
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,360
You aren't allowed upstairs.

831
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,200
Mai…

832
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:29,520
