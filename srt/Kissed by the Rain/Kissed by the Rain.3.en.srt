1
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,520
-Nicha is pregnant.
-What?

2
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,280
Here.

3
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,560
How did this happen?

4
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm certain the baby isn't mine.

5
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,000
You have destroyed the honor and dignity
of the profession of teacher.

6
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,560
I'm begging you. Get out.

7
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,360
All of you, get out.

8
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,760
Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?

9
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm just a gas deliveryman.

10
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,360
Do you want to see the lights?
I'll take you.

11
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,920
That sounds fun.

12
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
Is this the kind of bulb you use?

13
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
Yes.

14
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
How much is it?

15
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,480
I don't know. I'll have to ask Bee's mom.

16
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
You let me know.

17
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,920
I left my stuff upstairs.

18
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,880
Do you want to come up?

19
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,320
I'll go wait by the motorbike.

20
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,560
My room is a bit messy.

21
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,960
If your room is messy,
my room would be a pigsty.

22
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
I'll change the bulb.

23
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,600
-Okay. It's that way.
-The bathroom, right?

24
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,240
Can you get me a chair?

25
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm done. Try switching it on.

26
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,240
Well? I told you this is easy-peasy.

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,520
Yes, you're the best.

28
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,720
What's with you?

29
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,480
I have to pee. Get out of the bathroom.

30
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,600
Is it good?

31
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,800
I don't hear anything.

32
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,960
But I do.

33
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,360
Are the earphones broken?

34
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,840
Listen carefully.

35
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,360
My gosh! Mai!

36
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,640
-Since when are you such a jerk?
-Hey, easy.

37
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,200
You did that on purpose.

38
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
-I got those earphones for you.
-I was kidding. Don't hurt me.

39
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,320
-I'm not. You hurt me first.
-Hey.

40
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,560
-Gosh.
-Hey.

41
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,440
It's late. You should go.
I'll walk you out.

42
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,240
Do you have plans for tomorrow?

43
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,680
I think I'll go to the foundation.

44
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,600
It's not your day off?

45
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,040
I have some work I need to get done.

46
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,360
Mai! I have good news to tell you!

47
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,080
I just got accepted into college
through direct admission!

48
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,240
Thank you so much for tutoring me.

49
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,040
What's with you today? You seem down.

50
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,720
Thank you so much.

51
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Why are you thanking me?

52
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,200
Hey, Mai.

53
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,000
SUNDAY, JANUARY 15TH

54
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,600
Here you go.

55
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,400
Fon.

56
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,640
Why are you back so late?

57
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,200
Do you need something?

58
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,800
I'm just here to tell you that
Bee got accepted into college.

59
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,320
I'll be able to use his bike
to do food delivery like I told you.

60
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm happy for both of you.

61
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,600
From now on, you can just text me
if you have something to tell me.

62
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,600
Don't wait around for me.

63
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,800
I'm not important to you anymore.

64
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,120
Isn't that a good thing?

65
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
You can now take care of yourself
so I won't have to worry.

66
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,200
It's good that you're here.

67
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,600
I'll go get your jacket
and you can have it back.

68
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,280
Fon.

69
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,480
Can I have a word?

70
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,840
Sure.

71
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,160
Do you remember what you told me?

72
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,080
About how Mai's dad went
to pester him at school?

73
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,120
Yes, I remember.

74
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,600
Mai once came to talk
to me about that. What about it?

75
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,720
I went to see Lieutenant Nut yesterday.

76
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,560
Thank you so much
for keeping an eye on things.

77
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,760
You're welcome.

78
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,720
By the way, do you remember
the domestic violence case?

79
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,960
The one that the mother
and son are the victims?

80
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,560
Do you mean the case
where the mother killed herself?

81
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,680
That's right.

82
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,400
I want to know how Narong is doing.

83
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
Does he still live in the same house?

84
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,040
I thought my men
already informed the foundation.

85
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,800
Is something the matter?

86
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,520
-Sergeant.
-Yes, sir.

87
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,080
Where's the body of the man
who fell into the canal?

88
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,160
You mean Narong?

89
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,200
The foundation buried him
in the potter's field in Chonburi

90
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,720
since no one claimed his body.

91
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,280
I meant for you
to inform Kanyamit Foundation

92
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,760
because the staff there know his son.

93
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,280
Mai's dad is dead?

94
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,800
I'll let Mai know.

95
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,480
You said Mai's dad went to pester him.

96
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,240
When did that happen?

97
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,760
About a month ago.

98
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,680
But Lieutenant Nut told me

99
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,400
Mai's dad passed away
about two months ago.

100
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,000
This means that Mai lied to you.

101
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,960
Did he do it to get your attention?

102
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,000
Do you see him often?

103
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,560
Not really.

104
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,200
All right then.

105
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,280
I'll visit you after school.

106
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,680
I actually need your advice on something.

107
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,920
What's the urgent matter?

108
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,080
Well, I heard

109
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,840
my dad is reaching out to my friends
to track down my address.

110
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,800
Who told you this?

111
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,120
Bee, my best friend.

112
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,920
He saw my dad ambushing me
in front of the school.

113
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,640
When did this happen?

114
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,680
Two days ago.

115
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,920
Let's go, Mai.

116
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,200
You guys can go ahead.

117
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,760
What's the matter with you?
You look miserable.

118
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,280
What's wrong?

119
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,640
Fon's mad at me.

120
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,520
What?

121
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,480
What did you do?

122
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,440
I almost kissed her.

123
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,280
-What?
-Stop saying that already.

124
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,520
That means the kiss didn't happen.

125
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,160
Why would she be mad?

126
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,400
Did you apologize to her?

127
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,280
I tried.

128
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,359
But she acted like
she wanted nothing to do with me.

129
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,800
I meant to take the bus in the morning.

130
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,360
She didn't even text me
when I didn't show up.

131
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,920
So now you're mad at her?

132
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,000
Hey, this is a serious matter.
Don't joke around.

133
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,240
Tell me something.

134
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,840
You said you guys almost kissed.

135
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,760
Does that mean you already
told her how you feel?

136
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,640
No, I haven't told her.

137
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,040
Come on, man!

138
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,080
Maybe this is why she's mad at you.

139
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,000
How about we go get drinks tonight?

140
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
No, thank you.

141
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,160
What's the matter with him?

142
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,120
I'll go see you this evening.

143
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,160
I have something important to tell you.

144
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,440
Are you worried about Nicha?

145
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,720
You don't have to worry.

146
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,960
Everyone here is looking out for her.

147
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,120
How did it go with the police
when you two went to the station?

148
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,920
She calmed down when the police said
we have enough evidence to prosecute Tan.

149
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,320
But she still won't talk.

150
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,360
Rey is so close to giving birth.

151
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,600
Can you let me
handle Nicha's case instead?

152
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,520
Fon.

153
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,320
I want you to trust me.

154
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,240
I can do this.

155
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,120
You didn't text me back,
so I came to wait for you.

156
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,080
Is this about your dad?

157
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,680
Was he at the foundation?

158
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,560
No.

159
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,400
But Mai talked to the police
about your dad.

160
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,480
Did she press charges against him?

161
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,360
Mai went to see the police

162
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,640
and found out that your dad was dead.

163
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,080
He died about two months ago.

164
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I had no idea.

165
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,440
You can think about what you want to do.

166
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,640
Maybe you want to claim his body
and hold a funeral for him.

167
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,960
You can ask the foundation for help.

168
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,320
Everyone's willing to help you.

169
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
What about you?

170
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,240
I work at the foundation,
so I have to help you.

171
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,800
Can you stop saying that?

172
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,200
What else should I say?

173
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,920
That I'm disappointed that you lied to me?

174
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm sorry.

175
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,200
I didn't mean to.

176
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,360
I just wanted to see you.

177
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,480
When I saw that you were sick,
I was ashamed for making you come out.

178
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,080
That's not a good enough reason.

179
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,680
I like you.

180
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,600
Am I so wrong for wanting to see you
and spending time with you?

181
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,480
I want to make you happy
like how you make me feel.

182
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
I regret lying to you.

183
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,800
And I never did it again.

184
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,080
I don't even lie to myself
about my feelings for you.

185
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,840
Everything I do,

186
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,560
it comes from my heart.

187
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,880
When we almost kissed,

188
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,960
I wanted it to happen.

189
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,560
What you're feeling isn't love.

190
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,640
How do you know that?

191
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,120
You're just a kid.

192
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,080
I'm younger than you, but I'm not a kid.

193
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,720
Of course you are.

194
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,720
You're still so young in my eyes.

195
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,680
You don't know what being in love is.

196
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,440
You feel attached to me
because you have no one.

197
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,320
That's not love.

198
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,160
Go home.

199
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,120
Go back to your life and forget about me.

200
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,560
That's easy for you to say.

201
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,240
Have you ever loved someone?

202
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,880
Is it that easy to stop loving them?

203
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,800
-Give that to Bee.
-Bee?

204
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Come on.

205
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,400
What's with that face? Look at her, Mom.

206
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,400
Gosh.

207
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,640
Mai! Come eat!

208
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,240
Jeez. Bee!

209
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,360
He's heartbroken. Leave him be.

210
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,640
Mai's heartbroken?
Who's the bitch that broke his heart?

211
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Goodness, Bell. Watch your language.

212
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,120
Come on. Let's eat.

213
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,320
Here. Eat this.

214
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,080
OPENS AT 6 A.M.

215
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,680
Mai, give me that.

216
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,640
Let me do it. You should go home and rest.

217
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
You're a good kid, Mai.

219
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,480
Unlike Bee.
That boy is a good-for-nothing.

220
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,840
But he has some good qualities too.

221
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,360
He doesn't let anything
bother him for too long.

222
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
You should try to be like him.

223
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,120
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,400
Here are some oranges from the temple.

225
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,360
You take them.
Eat them and they will bring you luck.

226
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,480
See you later.

227
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,280
What's with you, man?

228
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,040
Are you that mad that I took your orange?

229
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,000
I really do feel like
she doesn't mind being with me.

230
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,400
Just let it all out, man.
I'll lend you an ear.

231
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I need to know

232
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,480
why is she putting up a wall.

233
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,400
Kudos to you, man.

234
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,200
You have determination and patience.

235
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,680
Because I know I did nothing wrong.

236
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,880
So what will you do next?

237
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,320
I'll prove myself to her.

238
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,320
If she thinks I'm too young,

239
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,760
I'll ask her to wait until I'm old enough.

240
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,920
It's all up to her.

241
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,960
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION
WOMEN AND CHILDREN PROTECTION CENTER

242
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,320
Will you go eat now, Fon?
Nicha's dad will be here in the afternoon.

243
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,160
What did you say, Mhai?

244
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,800
Are you spacing out, Fon?

245
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,480
You should go eat. We already ate.

246
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,560
-All right.
-Go on then.

247
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,400
You're here, Fon.
I'll let you take over, then.

248
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,520
Where's Nicha, Gib?

249
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,240
We asked her to come down,
but she wouldn't come.

250
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,080
I'll go talk to her.

251
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
Keep an eye on the kids for me.

252
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,800
Nicha, can you let me in?

253
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,200
Nicha, open the door.

254
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,240
Nicha!

255
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Mink, get Mhai here now!

256
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,920
-Okay.
-Hurry.

257
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,680
Nicha.

258
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,480
Hang in there, Nicha.

259
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,680
Listen to me. We can work things out.

260
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,000
Can you hear me?

261
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,040
Nicha! Can you hear me, Nicha?

262
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,600
-Nicha.
-Gosh, Nicha.

263
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,680
-Take the knife, Rey.
-Okay.

264
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,520
-Call an ambulance.
-Yes, ma'am.

265
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,880
-Get me a clean cloth.
-Okay.

266
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,720
-We're here, Nicha.
-My gosh.

267
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,400
Please hang in there, Nicha.

268
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,960
Nicha, can you hear me?

269
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,760
If she isn't safe at the foundation,

270
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,920
why should I even put her there?

271
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,520
The case with that teacher
is going nowhere.

272
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,920
I should've gone to the press about this.

273
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,840
He would've been condemned by the public

274
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,120
and the police
would've arrested that bastard.

275
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,200
We'll definitely look
into how she got the knife.

276
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,800
And the police are already
at the crime scene.

277
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,440
Nicha doesn't want
the press to know about this.

278
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,160
I think you did the right thing

279
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,800
by respecting her wishes.

280
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,400
She wants to protect that teacher.

281
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,040
I shouldn't have listened to you.

282
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,320
I shouldn't have listened to my daughter.

283
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,800
Her father is very hotheaded.

284
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,800
No wonder Nicha lacks support.

285
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,280
If everyone realized that,
they wouldn't need our help.

286
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,560
Try not to take things personally, Fon.

287
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,520
Don't let these things get to you.

288
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,720
Or we'd be too discouraged to help others.

289
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
Are you Nicha's caretaker?

290
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,160
She's conscious now.

291
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,840
Can we see her?

292
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,960
Yes, ma'am.

293
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,840
Fon.

294
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,040
Mhai, I…

295
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,600
Can I go talk to Nicha?

296
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,280
You don't have to do this.
I don't support you doing this.

297
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,560
I know.

298
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,360
I know you're not forcing me,
but I want to do it.

299
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,320
I really want to talk to Nicha.

300
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,600
Nicha.

301
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,400
I understand the agony
and the pain you're going through.

302
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,840
Because I've been through the same thing.

303
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,560
Let me tell you my story.

304
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,520
It might help you feel better.

305
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,480
-Ma'am.
-Hey.

306
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,560
Can I take the day off?

307
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,400
Sure.

308
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,080
Thank you.

309
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,240
We won't let this happen again.

310
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,880
Did you put ideas in my daughter's head
and make her not want to come home?

311
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,480
Hello, Lieutenant.

312
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,360
Hello.

313
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,360
Here's your coffee.

314
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,560
Thank you.

315
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,880
Thank you for coming to help.

316
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,960
It's my pleasure, Fon.

317
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,880
It must've been a hectic day.

318
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,240
Yes.

319
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,360
Have you told Narong's son
about how his dad died in the canal?

320
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,360
Do you still see Narong's son
from time to time?

321
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,400
No.

322
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,200
-Fon.
-Hey.

323
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,760
I heard you mention that you live
around here. Let me give you a ride.

324
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,840
It's okay.
I'm actually heading to the bus stop.

325
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,719
I can drop you off there.

326
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,480
It's really no bother.

327
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,880
Do you still have
to go back to the station?

328
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,440
I'm off duty, but I need
to go back to get some stuff.

329
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,800
Thank you for taking the time
to help us out.

330
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,440
It's my job.

331
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,880
I'm also interested in your work
regarding child protection services.

332
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,000
We're lucky
we get to work with you as well.

333
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,679
Well then. Please let me give you a ride.

334
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,120
Someone might file a report about a woman
wearing a blood-stained shirt on the bus.

335
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,040
-Please.
-All right.

336
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,760
Thank you for the ride.

337
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,960
If you ever have cases
involving women or children,

338
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,920
feel free to contact me or the foundation.

339
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,960
We'll be happy to help you.

340
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
All right.

341
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,680
Fon.

342
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,120
Yes?

343
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,960
Here's my business card.

344
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,000
Thank you.

345
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,160
Call me if you need me.

346
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,560
And you can call me Nut.

347
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
I think we're the same age.

348
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,880
Fon.

349
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,600
It's that kid.

350
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,640
Please excuse me. You should go.

351
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
All right.

352
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,720
Get out.

353
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,200
I won't.

354
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,800
Go ahead and call the police.

355
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,520
Get out, Mai.

356
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,120
Don't do this.

357
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,240
This is harassment.

358
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,520
Harassment?

359
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,760
Since when do you think I'm dangerous?

360
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,480
Have I ever done anything bad to you?

361
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,800
What did I do wrong?

362
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,600
Why did you change?

363
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,520
What you're doing is wrong.

364
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,520
If loving you is wrong,

365
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,120
what's the right thing to do?

366
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,040
Just tell me.

367
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,080
Tell me and I'll do it.

368
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,440
You should be with someone your age.

369
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,200
Just get on with your life.

370
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,040
Stop doing crazy stuff like this.

371
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,280
But it's fine when that officer does it?

372
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,960
That's right.

373
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,680
I don't believe you.

374
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,120
I don't believe you don't like me.

375
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,240
Or you wouldn't hang out
with a gas deliveryman like me.

376
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,320
You're someone
our foundation has helped out.

377
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,800
It was my fault.

378
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,880
I got close to you without realizing that

379
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,360
you would misinterpret my intention.

380
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,160
If that's what you think,

381
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,360
then I want to tell you that I've never
felt this way about Mhai or anyone else.

382
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,360
Do you still think
it's just infatuation on my part?

383
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,600
Yes, because you see me
more often than anyone else.

384
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,520
Do you want me to go back to my world?

385
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,080
See someone my age?

386
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,600
Do you want me to waste away my life?

387
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,680
Don't be sarcastic with me, Mai.

388
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,720
You can do whatever you want.

389
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,200
You don't have to tell me
or get me involved.

390
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,280
If you don't care anymore,
why do you care about what I do?

391
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,760
This is my life.

392
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,080
Mai.

393
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,680
Don't you pressure me.

394
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,320
Don't do to me what you did to your mom.

395
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,200
Excuse me.

396
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,280
You're friends with Mai, right?
I remember you.

397
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,920
I remember you too.

398
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,960
How is Mai doing?

399
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,480
Is he doing all right?

400
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,440
Do you care about him?

401
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,840
I helped him with everything
I could as the foundation staff.

402
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,440
You think I don't care about him?

403
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,440
I'm sorry.

404
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,320
I'm just worried for my friend.

405
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,560
Why? Did something happen to him?

406
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,240
Mai moved out of my house.

407
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,440
He no longer comes to class.

408
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,520
He's quit school.

409
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,560
Mai really likes you.

410
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,960
He's serious about you.

411
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,080
He's probably hurt
that you don't see his sincerity.

412
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,360
That's easy for you to say.

413
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,760
Have you ever loved someone?

414
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,040
Is it that easy to stop loving them?

415
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,040
Mai moved out of my house.

416
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,080
He no longer comes to class.

417
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,400
He's quit school.

418
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,120
I'm sorry, Mai.

419
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,360
I'm sorry.

420
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
Fon.

421
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,240
Mhai.

422
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,720
Please help me.

423
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,120
I've hurt Mai.

424
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,480
It's my fault. This is all my fault, Mhai.

425
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,640
Fon.

426
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,960
I didn't mean to do it.

427
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,480
I just wanted him to stop trying.

428
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,520
I didn't want him to throw
his life away for someone like me.

429
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,480
Goodness, Fon.

430
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,880
I'll reach out to Mai directly.

431
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
I'll ask his relatives
if they know anything.

432
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,600
We'll contact the police
if we can't find any leads.

433
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,360
You're not mad at me?

434
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,560
There's no reason for me
to be mad at you and Mai.

435
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,880
You also shouldn't
blame yourself for this.

436
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,000
Do you know now how it can
impact your life when you keep

437
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,440
all your problems to yourself?

438
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,920
My pain caused me to lash out at Mai.

439
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,320
Though he has been
through much worse than me.

440
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,560
It's okay.

441
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,360
It's okay. I'm right here.

442
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,800
You didn't do anything wrong.

443
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,040
Mom.

444
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,440
Fah. Where have you been all this time?

445
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,560
You ungrateful child.

446
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,920
You didn't come to your dad's funeral.

447
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,760
You barely gave me any money.

448
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,720
Do you know how hard
my life has been since you ran away?

449
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,520
You little brat.

450
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,640
7 YEARS LATER

451
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,960
I have my lucky hair clip on,
so it should bring me luck today.

452
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,840
Hello.

453
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,960
Don't do that.

454
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,840
Please don't do that.

455
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,760
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

456
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,200
Hello?

457
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,360
Give me back my kid!

458
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,160
The court has ordered you
not to go near your child. Don't do this.

459
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,560
Jin! Come to Mommy!

460
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,600
Please come out!

461
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,000
Hey, let me be with my kid!

462
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,160
-Please don't do this to me.
-Let's go inside, honey.

463
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,840
Where are you going?

464
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,600
You can't do this!

465
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,080
Ma'am, please stop.

466
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,560
You're assaulting an officer
who's helping you.

467
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,240
I don't care.
You're taking my kid from me.

468
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,480
You wouldn't have a restraining order
against you if you were a good mother.

469
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,760
I didn't do anything wrong!

470
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,640
Please help me.

471
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,960
I know.

472
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,520
Let's talk and think
of a way out together.

473
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,880
Please, ma'am.

474
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,280
Please help me! Give me back my kid!
I want to be with my kid!

475
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,200
My kid needs me!

476
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,480
Come stand over here
so you can breathe. You're so tiny.

477
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,160
Are you calling me short?

478
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,960
Your word, not mine.

479
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,440
I'm sorry.

480
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:59,400
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

481
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,400
Which one suits me best?

482
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,680
This one.

483
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,400
But the colors are a bit dull.
I like this one.

484
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,080
Isn't this one cute? I think it's cute.

485
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,480
It's a flower

486
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,000
-I…
-Don't you like it?

487
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,760
I'll take this one.

488
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,200
Plaifon.

489
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,960
Make a wish, Fon.

490
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,600
I wish you a boyfriend.

491
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,080
I hope not.

492
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,440
Everyone here
who got into a relationship quits.

493
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,880
Goodness.

494
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,560
I'll blow out the candles.

495
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,720
Hooray.

496
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,000
I wish you the best, Fon.

497
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,000
Looks like my wish
for her came true, Mhai.

498
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,440
It seems that man is already here.

499
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,720
Happy birthday.

500
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,560
Thank you. How come you're here?

501
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,760
Well…

502
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,160
I'm here to drop off
some documents for the latest case.

503
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,320
Goodness. Is that the only reason
why you're here, Inspector?

504
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,640
Come on now.

505
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,920
I should go.

506
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,280
I'll let you two catch up.

507
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,280
Lady Saengsuda asked me
to go wait for a guest out front.

508
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,760
You should come too, Mhai.

509
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,320
We'll be back soon. Save us some cake.

510
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,320
Let's go. Goodbye, Inspector.

511
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,840
Why are they not here yet?

512
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,600
Who do you mean?

513
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,360
I don't know either. Lady Saengsuda
just asked me to wait for someone.

514
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,680
Aunt Mhai. Aunt Rey.

515
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,200
Nam and Pueng are fighting.

516
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,600
My gosh! Again?

517
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,280
Go stop them, Rey.

518
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,080
-Hurry.
-Are they over there?

519
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,480
Come on then.

520
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,520
I'll see you off here.

521
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,160
All right.

522
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,280
Don't forget our date tonight.

523
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,840
I won't.

524
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,600
Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?

525
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,000
You aren't allowed upstairs.

526
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,440
Sir, can you hear me?

527
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,280
What's your business here?

528
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,840
Visitors aren't allowed
inside without permission.

529
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,080
Mai…

530
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,600
I have an appointment with Lady Saengsuda.

531
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,040
Can I go in?

532
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,240
I'm late. Please excuse me.

533
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,840
Thank you so much
for volunteering to help us, Mr. Mavin.

534
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,560
-Have a seat.
-Yes, ma'am.

535
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,160
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

536
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,080
Please don't call me Mr. Mavin.

537
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,800
Just call me Mavin like you used to.

538
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,840
You helped me

539
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,320
with the funeral for my mom.

540
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,400
I'll never forget it.

541
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,440
It's the duty of our foundation

542
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,040
to help those who are in need.

543
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,480
And when those whom we've helped

544
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,440
manage to pass on that kindness to others,

545
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,880
we consider that a great success

546
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,000
that will help better society.

547
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,560
Thank you so much, Mavin,

548
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,280
for choosing to support
our small foundation.

549
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,720
You once told me to think
of this place as my new home

550
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,000
and that everyone here is family.

551
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,760
I still remember those words by heart.

552
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,720
-Tarn.
-Yes?

553
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,600
Who's that man who just went in?

554
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,240
Wait, Mai.

555
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,280
So what are you doing here?

556
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,280
Can't I come here?

557
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,200
Of course you can.

558
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,840
That's not what I mean.

559
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,480
I mean…

560
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,200
I just want to say that…

561
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,880
I'm happy to see you.

562
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,440
So…

563
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,160
Are you doing well?

564
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,720
I suppose you are.

565
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,520
You look so sophisticated.

566
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,560
You got your answer, so please excuse me.

567
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,040
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

568
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,400
Mai is back as a volunteer lawyer?

569
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,560
Is he the guest you asked me to wait for?

570
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,080
That's right.
I wanted it to be a surprise for you guys.

571
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,360
But you somehow
ended up missing each other.

572
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,320
Is he really that same boy?

573
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,600
He's come so far.

574
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,920
A volunteer lawyer?

575
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,080
I'll leave things to you, Mhai.

576
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,440
Please help prepare a desk for Mavin here.

577
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,440
He was in a hurry today,
so he didn't stay to say hi.

578
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,360
Yes, ma'am.

579
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,440
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

580
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,960
THANYABURI PROVINCIAL COURT

581
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,520
Mai, do you have it?

582
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,800
It's right here.

583
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,080
A copy of the defendant's testimony.

584
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Just in time.

585
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,800
But we have another problem.

586
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,280
What is it?

587
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,320
Damn. He forgot to wear
a gown to a hearing? Way to go.

588
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,760
-Here.
-Thank you.

589
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,440
Return it to me in the cafeteria
once you're done.

590
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,400
Yes, sir.

591
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,760
Here, Chol.

592
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,800
Hurry. The hearing will start soon.

593
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,360
Wait, Chol.

594
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,440
Here's a copy of the testimony.

595
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,680
Unbelievable.

596
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,480
He forgot to bring
a copy of the testimony.

597
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,000
He even forgot his gown.

598
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,080
Do you think he'll win the case?

599
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,720
Happy birthday.

600
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,800
Thank you.

601
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,400
But…

602
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,800
I think this is a little bit too fancy.

603
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,320
It's a special occasion.

604
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,720
Today is a special day.

605
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,840
I want to make it special for both of us.

606
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,640
I'm back.

607
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,160
How are you guys? Did you get lonely?

608
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,880
I guess not.

609
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,760
There are many of you.

610
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,680
So you have each other to talk to.

611
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,600
We'll see each other again.

612
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,840
Well, I'll see you off here.

613
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,440
All right.

614
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,560
Don't forget our date tonight.

615
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,240
I won't.

616
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,040
I'll see you later.

617
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,640
Happy birthday, Fon.

618
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,240
I finally saw you after seven years.

619
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,960
But you now have
that inspector by your side.

620
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,680
That hurts like hell.

621
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,600
Here you go.

622
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,360
Make a wish.

623
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,800
What did you wish for?

624
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,440
It's a secret.

625
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,200
Here you go.

626
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,880
Thank you so much, Inspector.

627
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,240
It's Nut.

628
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,400
What?

629
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,360
I want you to call me Nut.

630
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,360
"Inspector" feels too formal.

631
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
We've known each other for a long time.

632
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,920
And I've always been clear
about what I want.

633
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,200
Or…

634
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,520
have I not proven myself to you enough?

635
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,160
Is that why you won't let me in?

636
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,320
It's not like that.

637
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,440
You're a very good guy.

638
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,960
If you think I'm good enough for you,

639
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,920
I'd love it if you would
open your heart to me.

640
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,200
Will you be my girlfriend?

641
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,960
If you think I'm good enough for you,

642
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,440
I'd love it if you would
open your heart to me.

643
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,080
Will you be my girlfriend?

644
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,840
Inspector.

645
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,920
Nut.

646
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,280
You…

647
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,120
You caught me off guard.

648
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,200
Can I give you an answer later?

649
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,400
All right. I'll be waiting.

650
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,560
MOM

651
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,760
What is it?

652
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,920
Mom!

653
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,720
I'm coming!

654
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,040
Stop knocking already.

655
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,480
Fah. So you're finally here.

656
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,480
Watch it, you brat. I'm your mom.

657
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,560
Gosh! She made a mess on my bed.

658
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,400
Do you want to come with me?

659
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,360
Why are you always in my mind?

660
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,640
Why did you wreck my shop?

661
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,080
-Chol, don't!
-Mai, let me go!

662
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,920
I think this case is strange.

663
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,520
Why did he act like
he wanted to get caught?

664
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,800
Is there any way we can help Chet?

665
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,640
Hurry and go look.
There's someone in the back.

666
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,800
