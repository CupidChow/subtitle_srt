1
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,759
You.

2
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,560
I'll tell the police what you did to us.

3
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,440
I'll make you pay for this!

4
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,600
Fon.

5
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,960
Mai?

6
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,120
I don't want Mai to know about my past.

7
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,160
Can you not tell him about it?

8
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,000
I already called
your personal chauffeur here.

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Personal chauffeur?

10
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,800
Let me give you a ride.

11
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,840
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

12
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,360
Mai.

13
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,720
I brought you food.

14
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,040
One hot espresso, please.

15
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,880
We met for the first time by chance.

16
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,560
But this must be destiny.

17
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,320
This guy again?

18
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,240
You pervert.

19
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,560
What?

20
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,600
Did she call me a pervert?

21
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,800
Miss. Hey, miss.

22
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,800
Hey, miss. Wait.

23
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,880
I think you misunderstood me.

24
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,440
What do you want?

25
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,280
There are security cameras here.

26
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm sorry I scared you.

27
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,760
But I don't mean any harm.

28
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,920
I don't want you to think I'm a pervert.

29
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,080
You're acting exactly like a pervert.

30
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,040
You were filming me
and you followed me out here.

31
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,000
What? I wasn't filming you.

32
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
I was taking a selfie.

33
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,079
Here. I'll show you.

34
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,640
Look.

35
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,960
But it seems you were
in the background of the photo.

36
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
This isn't funny.

37
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,200
If you use this photo
to ruin my reputation,

38
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,400
you'll be violating Section 27, Clause 1
of the Personal Data Protection Act.

39
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,960
You'll face up to one year of imprisonment
or a fine of up to one million baht.

40
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,920
Or you could be fined
as well as imprisoned.

41
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,240
You really know the law.

42
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,520
I'll delete the photo.

43
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,880
Here, I'm deleting it.

44
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,560
Hey, miss. Wait.

45
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,520
My name is Bee.

46
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Ms. Angel Face.

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
Gosh, I was misunderstood again.

48
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,360
Mai, I have something to tell you.

49
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
Bee, I'm busy.

50
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,760
Isn't this your day off?

51
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,200
Let me call you back.

52
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,520
Gosh, all right. Call me back soon.

53
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,200
It is already 11 a.m.

54
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,760
Mai.

55
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
I brought you food.

56
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
Mai.

57
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,160
Wait a second.

58
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,120
I know that you're worried about me.

59
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,720
But I can take care of myself.

60
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,960
You should eat.

61
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,160
Then I'll help do the dishes.

62
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,040
Mai.

63
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,840
But I'll leave now if you want me to go.

64
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,080
-Then I want you to--
-Fon.

65
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,240
I know what it feels like to be alone.

66
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,280
I feel fine living on my own.

67
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,200
But I know how horrible it feels

68
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,040
to be alone when you're sick.

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,280
Please let me do something for you.

70
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,760
You did a lot for me in the past.

71
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,320
I want to return the favor.

72
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,120
How can I say no after what you just said?

73
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,280
You can't.

74
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,200
Hello, Nut.

75
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,080
When is your follow-up appointment?

76
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,600
It's in six days.

77
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,040
Then can I take you to the hospital?

78
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,400
-Well--
-Please don't say no.

79
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,720
-All right, then.
-Okay.

80
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,600
All right. Goodbye.

81
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,920
What are you reading?

82
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm studying to become
an assistant prosecutor.

83
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
But I need more experience in court.

84
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,680
You're so hardworking.

85
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,280
Yes.

86
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,080
Did you already pass the bar?

87
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,600
Yes.

88
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,480
That's amazing.

89
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,040
I'll get it.

90
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,160
Won't you get that?

91
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,880
It's Bee. It's nothing.

92
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,360
He'll either talk about girls or food.

93
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,560
Mai.

94
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,640
Yes?

95
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,280
I want to talk to you about something.

96
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,400
Sure.

97
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,520
I'm glad that
you're not mad at me anymore.

98
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,880
But…

99
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,480
I don't think you should be doing
these sorts of things for me.

100
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,720
Hold on.

101
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,600
Who said I was mad at you?

102
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,240
You were gone for seven years.

103
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,280
When we saw each other again,
you acted like you were mad at me.

104
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,000
Did I act that way?

105
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Yes.

106
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,800
You barely spoke a word to me.

107
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,160
You seemed very angry with me.

108
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,800
But you're not acting that way now.

109
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,800
It was all in your head.

110
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,000
I wasn't mad at you.

111
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,240
It wasn't all in my head.
You really acted that way.

112
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,440
Well, I'll see you off here.

113
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,120
All right.

114
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,160
Don't forget our date tonight.

115
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,880
I won't.

116
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I'll see you later.

117
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,160
Why are you smiling?

118
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,360
It's nothing.
Stop nitpicking my every move.

119
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,680
If I was a lawyer,

120
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,280
I'd get the truth out of you.

121
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
It's okay. Leave it.

122
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,200
I'll go once I'm done cleaning up.

123
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,080
Hello, Nut.

124
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,760
What did you say?

125
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,880
I'm sending over some food.

126
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,800
Well, I already ate.

127
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,600
That's all right.

128
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,840
You can save the food for later.

129
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,400
I told the delivery guy
to bring the food up to your room.

130
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,640
You won't have to come down.

131
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Okay. Thank you.

132
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,040
You're welcome.

133
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,040
It's food delivery.

134
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,200
From Inspector Nut?

135
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,960
-Yes.
-Do I need to go hide?

136
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,240
It's fine.

137
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,000
But you can go now if you want.

138
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,560
Let me do the dishes first.

139
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Hey, Fon.
I bet you didn't expect to see me.

140
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,600
I got you tons of food.
Someone also left food for you downstairs.

141
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,760
Fon.

142
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,800
She shut the door in my face.

143
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,600
What did I do wrong?

144
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,480
Fon.

145
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,440
Fon, open the door. It's me, Rey.

146
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,280
Rey's here.

147
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,800
Fon.

148
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,760
Just leave it and go hide. Hurry.

149
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,400
Take this with you.

150
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,360
Fon!

151
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,400
Yes, Rey! I'm coming right now!

152
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,320
Go hide.

153
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,080
Wait a moment, Rey.

154
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,080
You're acting strange.

155
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,400
Is Inspector Nut here?

156
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,360
No, he's not.

157
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,040
Then why did you lock me out?

158
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,720
My room is messy.

159
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,920
Messy?

160
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,520
There!

161
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,640
I thought I heard something break.

162
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,800
I placed it on the edge of the table
to go get the door, so it fell.

163
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,600
I see. Then can I snoop around some more?

164
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,080
Come on, Rey.

165
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,960
I'm kidding. I believe you.

166
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Here.

167
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,320
I didn't want you to starve
so I bought you this.

168
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,640
Thank you, Rey.

169
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,760
But I think I probably worried too much.

170
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,000
You seem to be well taken care of.

171
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,960
When did Inspector Nut leave?

172
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,640
You're mistaken, Rey.

173
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,440
My friend came by to visit.
It wasn't Inspector Nut.

174
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,480
Is that so?

175
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,640
Well, this isn't fun.

176
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,840
Someone sent you this. It was downstairs.

177
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,200
It's from Nut.

178
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,000
Good. At least he's acting
like a good boyfriend.

179
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,840
Inspector Nut isn't my boyfriend.

180
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,200
You've been flirting for years.
Are you still too shy to admit it?

181
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,080
I'm not being shy.

182
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,960
But he really isn't my boyfriend.

183
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,120
And you shouldn't trouble him again
in the future.

184
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,560
I don't want to bother him.

185
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,040
Why would you feel that way?

186
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,760
Even if he's not your boyfriend,
he's willing to take care of you.

187
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,680
So that one day
you'll finally accept his love.

188
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,120
Let me clean up
all these pieces of broken glass.

189
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,320
They could be dangerous.

190
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,640
I picked up a habit of being cautious
when my kid was a baby.

191
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,200
You have to wrap them up
carefully with paper like this.

192
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,360
Then put them in a plastic bag
and tie the bag with a rubber band

193
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
so the strays can't get to them.

194
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,680
All right.

195
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,480
Just put them in a plastic bag
like this to make sure it's safe.

196
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,120
All done.

197
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,600
I'll get going now.

198
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,320
-Missy.
-Yes?

199
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,160
You don't have to see me out.
Your leg's still hurt.

200
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,680
-I'll head out now.
-Thank you, Rey.

201
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,440
Stop thanking me already.

202
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,440
Just focus on getting better.

203
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,560
Don't hurry back to work.
Don't worry about the foundation.

204
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,080
Baitoey may be a rowdy girl,
but she knows the ropes.

205
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,080
She can help me and Mhai out.

206
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,320
All right.

207
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,560
I'll see you later.

208
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,840
Mai, can you wait a bit before you leave?
Wait until Rey's gone far from here.

209
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,080
Okay?

210
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,160
Your leg won't heal
if you keep having guests.

211
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,240
A cold compress?

212
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,480
Didn't the doctor recommend it?

213
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,680
Well, he did.

214
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,520
But you haven't done it.

215
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,160
I'm about to do it.

216
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,920
Let me do it.

217
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,440
I got it.

218
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
I'll do it.

219
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,359
Let's not fight about it.

220
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Does it hurt?

221
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
Not anymore.

222
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,440
So you and Inspector Nut aren't dating?

223
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,760
That's my business.

224
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,840
I'm just curious.

225
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,360
He has been at it for seven years

226
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,200
and he still can't win your heart?

227
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,360
Mai.

228
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,480
What an amateur.

229
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,240
You're being immature.

230
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,120
There's one more thing.

231
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,320
I was never mad at you.

232
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,000
What happened
in the past wasn't your fault.

233
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,640
Stop feeling guilty about it.

234
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
I'll get going now.

235
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,960
You stay put.

236
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,920
I'll close the door for you.

237
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,840
Keep this on for 15 minutes.

238
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,880
I heard Fon's injured so I came to visit.

239
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,400
I see. Me too.

240
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
You're such a good police officer.

241
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,400
You really care about your colleagues.

242
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
I'm not here as a police officer.

243
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,080
Then why are you here?

244
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,840
Are you here as her boyfriend?

245
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,880
I like Fon.

246
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,280
What about you?

247
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,360
You can't even admit it.

248
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,000
I guess your heart isn't in it.

249
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,760
My heart was in it from the start.

250
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Can you recheck this document for me?

251
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Hey, Mai.

252
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,960
Toey wants to ask you
for some legal advice.

253
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,800
Can you help her out?

254
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,440
Sure. Where is she now?

255
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,120
You can ask the court
to issue a restraining order against Chai.

256
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,040
I broke up with him ages ago.

257
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,920
But he won't stop pestering me.

258
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,600
Can you tell me what happened

259
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,120
between you and Chai?

260
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,840
We were in the same gang.

261
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,280
The same gang?

262
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
I'm here.

263
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,320
Who's that? Is he a new member?

264
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,760
Yes.

265
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,200
Let's split up.

266
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,400
We'll meet up at the bus stop in an hour.

267
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Do you want the new kid
to do this with us?

268
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,040
Why not? Bas wants a taste.

269
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,600
It will spice up his life.

270
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,480
But he seems like a rich kid.

271
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,400
Why would you have him do this?

272
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,080
Toey, just shut up.

273
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,280
Or I'll kiss you right here.

274
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,120
Kiss me then.

275
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,520
Be more careful.

276
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,680
You didn't feel guilty for stealing?

277
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,680
I didn't have a lot of options back then.

278
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,560
We always have options.
It's up to you which one you'll choose.

279
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,160
Well, that was what I chose to do.

280
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,040
I was young then.

281
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,600
That's no excuse.

282
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,640
Don't lecture me just yet.

283
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,520
Things got even more heated.

284
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,400
SUANPLERN MARKET

285
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,640
Your dad caught us. Let's go.

286
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
Stop right there!

287
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,440
-Stop!
-Come on!

288
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,920
Bas! Hurry! We have to get out of here!

289
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,040
Come on!

290
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,280
-Bas, hurry!
-Stop!

291
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,920
-Come this way! Come on!
-Stop!

292
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,200
Your heart's pounding.

293
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,120
Are you scared?

294
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,040
It's not worth it to throw
your life away out of spite.

295
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,040
How does it feel?
Does doing this give you a rush?

296
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,720
I mean being close to me.

297
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,800
Does it give you a rush?

298
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,240
So you stole
and also cheated on your boyfriend?

299
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,000
I got beaten almost to a pulp that day.

300
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,680
By the guard?

301
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,040
We got away from the guard.

302
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,520
But Chai beat me up.

303
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,240
Why did he beat you up?

304
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,160
He found out that I did it with Bas.

305
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,080
So I ran away and came
to this foundation for help.

306
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,480
Mhai and Fon helped me out.

307
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,560
But Chai still won't stop harassing me.

308
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,800
Toey, you have to live more responsibly.

309
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,320
Don't live the way you used to.

310
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,840
Gosh, I've quit doing all those things.
I've learned my lesson.

311
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,160
Now I'm trying to sell things online.

312
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,400
But I have to keep running away
from Chai so I can't make a living.

313
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,600
Once you have some money,
give some to your family and others.

314
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,200
I'll definitely help my family.

315
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,120
But why should I help others?

316
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,520
Because the foundation helps you
when you're in trouble.

317
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,120
Then I'll help others when I'm rich.

318
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,480
Do it now or you'll never do it.

319
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,480
Just do what you can.

320
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,840
Why do you want me to help others?

321
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,960
Because doing good
can help shape who you are.

322
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,880
The act of sharing will make you
feel happy and content.

323
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,160
You'll have a sense of self-worth
and a drive to better yourself.

324
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,480
I'm sorry I couldn't go get you.

325
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,760
I have urgent work,
so I don't know what to do.

326
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,720
I told you it's fine, Nut.

327
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,880
This is the tenth time
you've apologized to me.

328
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,160
Well…

329
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,640
Excuse me, sir.

330
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,320
So is anyone else going with you?

331
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,960
I like Fon.

332
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,880
What about you?

333
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,920
You can't even admit it.

334
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
I guess your heart isn't in it.

335
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,720
My heart was in it from the start.

336
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,000
No, I'm going by myself.

337
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,720
Take good care of yourself then.

338
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,960
-I'm worried about you.
-All right. Goodbye.

339
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,680
I'm being petty.

340
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,200
When it comes to the woman you love,

341
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,880
it's okay to be a little petty.

342
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,840
Aren't you done with work?

343
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,480
Should I give you more work to do?

344
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,920
Well…

345
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,360
Then take these cases.

346
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,920
Yes, sir. I'll get back to work.

347
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,960
I got two more cases to work on
on top of the old ones.

348
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,680
Damn.

349
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,520
Where are you going?

350
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,320
Don't you have work to do?

351
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,360
I do.

352
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,240
Stop worrying about me.

353
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,320
I'll stop if you have
someone looking after you.

354
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,600
Hasn't he come by at all?

355
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,760
Who do you mean?

356
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,840
Your inspector.

357
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,200
He's not my inspector. We're not together.

358
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,040
I see you still walk like a duck.

359
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Me? I don't walk like a duck.

360
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,520
Hey.

361
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Be careful.

362
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,480
I can walk just fine.

363
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,520
I know.

364
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,400
But you shouldn't risk getting hurt.

365
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,200
Let me give you a ride.

366
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,320
I've drafted the settlement agreement.

367
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,160
Please take care of the rest for me.

368
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,520
Then we can set a date
for both parties to sign it.

369
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,960
I have to go, Nicha.

370
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,160
How did it go?

371
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm almost healed.
I can go back to work on Monday.

372
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
Are you happy?

373
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,680
Of course, I am.
I'm bored to death staying at home.

374
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,080
Will you head home now?

375
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,040
Do you want to go somewhere else?

376
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,400
You're in no condition to eat out yet.

377
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,600
You could've ordered it to go.

378
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,320
I haven't been outside in days.

379
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,600
I missed the outside air and all the smog.

380
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,080
Mai.

381
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,840
You could've told me. I can do it myself.

382
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,840
Then I wouldn't get to do this.

383
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,240
Mai.

384
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,120
Eat your food while it's hot.

385
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,400
You should eat too.

386
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,480
Eat lots of vegetables.
They're good for your health.

387
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,640
I'm not a child.

388
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,080
Thank you for coming
with me to the hospital.

389
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,160
Is something wrong?

390
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,160
If you're sick of staying home,

391
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,760
you can come with me tomorrow.

392
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,360
Where are you going?

393
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,400
I'm going to scatter my dad's ashes.

394
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,560
I can go by myself.

395
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,640
I'm used to it.
It's nothing I can't handle.

396
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,520
Come pick me up tomorrow.

397
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,680
Thank you.

398
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,080
I'll see you tomorrow.

399
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,760
What's the matter?

400
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,680
When you asked me to come with you,

401
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,440
I thought we'd go to Chao Phraya River.

402
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,920
I didn't think we'd come
all the way to the beach.

403
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,080
Do you want to leave?

404
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,720
It's too late for that.

405
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,120
I suppose so.

406
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,520
My butt is all sore from the long ride.

407
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,560
Where will we scatter the ashes?

408
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,920
Over there.

409
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,040
I forgive you.

410
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,320
I hope you'll forgive me as well.

411
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,719
May your soul rest in peace.

412
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,080
Eat some food, son.

413
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,280
There you go. Attaboy.

414
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,639
You have to eat lots of food.

415
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,800
So you can get really big.

416
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,920
Is it good? Do you want more?

417
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,560
There you go. Good job.

418
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,920
The monster's coming to get you!
Run as fast as you can!

419
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,720
Mai.

420
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,080
Mai, are you okay? Let me see.

421
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,560
Gosh.

422
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,560
Does it hurt?

423
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,560
It does? Let me blow on it.

424
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,800
There. All better.

425
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,280
Do you want to feed the cows?

426
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,960
Yes. They're so cute.

427
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,840
The vibe here is great.

428
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,200
I'm glad you like it.

429
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,120
What is it?

430
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,640
Are you not mad at your dad now?

431
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,160
No.

432
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,160
I forgave him a long time ago.

433
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,800
We should focus
on the future, not the past.

434
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,840
Fah.

435
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,040
Where have you been all this time?

436
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,600
You ungrateful child.

437
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,840
You didn't come to your dad's funeral.

438
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,440
You barely gave me any money.

439
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,760
Do you know how hard
my life has been since you ran away?

440
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,440
You little brat.

441
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,480
Why are you staring at me?

442
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,400
Do you want to take a walk on the beach?

443
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,000
Thank you, but I don't think I should.

444
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,480
I've walked a lot today,
my leg is starting to hurt.

445
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,000
Why did we stop?

446
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,440
Get off the motorbike.

447
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,240
What is it?

448
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,280
You can't walk
because your leg hurts, right?

449
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,360
Right.

450
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,440
Hey! Mai!

451
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,000
What are you doing? Put me down.

452
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,360
You said you can't walk,
so I'm going to carry you.

453
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,520
Put me down right now.

454
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,560
Stop wriggling or I might drop you.

455
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,640
Do you want to get injured again?

456
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,040
Serves you right.

457
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,000
You must be tired from carrying me.

458
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,480
You did it to yourself.

459
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,760
I wanted you to see the view
when the sun is setting.

460
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,960
We wouldn't have made it
here in time if I'd let you walk here.

461
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,560
It's so secluded here.

462
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,680
How do you know this place?

463
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,760
My parents took me here when I was young.

464
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,160
I have very few
good memories about my family.

465
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,680
But there are some.

466
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,880
What we did for my dad today
must've reminded you of your family.

467
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,880
I noticed that you've been quiet.

468
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,600
So I wanted to show you
the view to cheer you up.

469
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,320
Actually,

470
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,880
my family isn't much better than yours.

471
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,600
And I can't bring myself
to be nice to them like you.

472
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,840
I'm proud of you.

473
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,160
Why?

474
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Because I can never be like you.

475
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,160
All the things you did for your family,

476
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,920
I could never do them.

477
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,920
You're not only capable.

478
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,200
You're also a good guy.

479
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,600
Do you like good guys?

480
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,920
I do.

481
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,840
Everyone likes good guys.
That goes without saying.

482
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,720
Do you feel better now?

483
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,960
I'm the one who should ask you that.

484
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,320
Are you okay?

485
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm okay now that I have you here.

486
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,600
Let's go back before it gets too late.

487

KANYAMIT FOUNDATION
WOMEN AND CHILDREN PROTECTION CENTER

488
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,360
Do you feel better now?

489
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,520
I'm the one who should ask you that.

490
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,560
Are you okay?

491
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,120
I'm okay now that I have you here.

492
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Fon.

493
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,840
Fon.

494
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,600
Yes?

495
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,600
Are you spacing out?

496
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,120
Who's spacing out?

497
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,440
Who else? It's you.

498
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,880
You know, you're acting suspicious.

499
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,440
-Are you in love with someone?
-That's absurd.

500
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,000
Who would I be in love with?

501
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,160
Is it that lawyer?

502
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,000
Good morning.

503
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,920
He is such a perfect guy.

504
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,320
It's too bad he's already taken.

505
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,800
Are you okay?

506
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,680
Well…

507
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,520
I…

508
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,640
I've thought about it.

509
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,120
I think

510
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,720
we shouldn't become closer.

511
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,240
It could create problems.

512
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,960
I just think it's inappropriate.

513
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,600
Let's put some distance between us.

514
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,880
I want to make coffee.

515
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,840
Which cup can I use?

516
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,440
What about the spoon?

517
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,800
Here.

518
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,800
I don't know where the coffee beans are.

519
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,640
Coffee beans, cream, and sugar.

520
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,200
The jars have labels on them.

521
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,640
Thank you.

522
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,880
-Fon.
-Mai.

523
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,720
Is this your coffee?

524
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,000
That was close.

525
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,760
I'm really sorry. I wasn't looking.

526
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,800
Can I help you, ma'am?

527
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,280
Do you work at this foundation?

528
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,880
Yes.

529
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,480
I need your help with something.

530
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,960
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

531
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,400
Have you filed a complaint?

532
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,160
You can't let this go on
when you're abused this badly.

533
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,200
I don't dare do that.

534
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,640
If I go to the police,

535
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,200
he'll just beat me harder.

536
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,960
How long have you been abused?

537
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,680
For several months.

538
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,040
We only had arguments at first.

539
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,360
But as time passed,

540
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,240
he became more violent.

541
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,040
Didn't I tell you to stay home?

542
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,560
Did you go out to see a man?

543
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,080
I just popped out to see a friend.

544
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,200
A friend? Do you think I don't know
what you're up to?

545
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,600
Very well. I'll hit you so hard
that you'll have to stay home for a month.

546
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,720
What a scumbag.

547
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,880
Will he keep you locked up forever?

548
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,480
You've been through a lot, ma'am.

549
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,840
But I'm glad you've found the courage
to come to us for help today.

550
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,560
I can't stand it anymore.

551
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,920
I told him so many times
that I never cheated on him.

552
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,160
But he wouldn't listen.

553
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,080
He'd always find some reason to hit me.

554
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,920
And now,

555
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,440
my whole body is in pain.

556
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,120
My heart is in pieces.

557
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,120
I don't want to live anymore.

558
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,040
Please don't say that, ma'am.

559
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,960
Now you have us.

560
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,320
We won't let him hurt you anymore.

561
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,920
But first of all, you should
let us take you to the hospital.

562
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,960
Let's go to the police.

563
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,080
They will take you to get
a physical exam at a hospital,

564
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,800
so we have proof against your husband.

565
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,680
Don't worry, ma'am.

566
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,080
We will do everything we can to help you.

567
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,200
Thank you all so much.

568
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,280
I made the right choice coming here.

569
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,120
I didn't know who else to turn to.

570
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,800
What an asshole.

571
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,160
What kind of person hits their own wife?

572
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,280
He seems like a loving husband on TV.

573
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,160
I wouldn't peg him as an abuser.

574
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,640
When will people stop doing this?

575
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,440
Women will always be
at a disadvantage against men.

576
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,440
That's why there's a saying that
women are equal to men in everything,

577
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,000
except for one thing.

578
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,960
They have less physical strength.

579
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,120
So men use their strength to abuse women

580
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,880
in order to control them.

581
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,240
That's so unfair, Ek.

582
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,960
So what will you do next?

583
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,360
Maysa wants to divorce her husband
and divide the marital assets fairly,

584
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,880
so she can finally be free.

585
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,640
But I think a guy like that
will do whatever is necessary

586
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,240
to prevent that.

587
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,160
Do you know who the defense attorney is?

588
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,240
His name is Keng.

589
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,440
Is it Kengrop?

590
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,760
That's right.

591
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,400
Who is he?

592
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,280
Well, he's a very competent lawyer.

593
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,880
But he's not just a capable lawyer.

594
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:24,920
He's also a prick.

595
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,920
Damn.

596
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,120
You're still a great golfer
though you work day and night.

597
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,440
You know me.

598
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,160
I'm not an ordinary lawyer
like I used to be.

599
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,560
Right. You're even more famous
than the celebrities now.

600
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,520
Apart from you,

601
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,760
I've never met any lawyer
who's also a celebrity.

602
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,640
Well, aren't you going to answer?
It might be a client calling.

603
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,840
They're the ones coming to me for help.

604
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,760
If they can't wait,

605
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,840
they can go to someone else.

606
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,840
Kengrop is like a cancer
to the lawyer profession.

607
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,320
He may be a competent lawyer,

608
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,760
but he makes everyone think that lawyers
are parasites to the justice system.

609
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,120
He's the reason why people think
us lawyers have no integrity.

610
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,200
Is he really that bad?

611
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,920
Yes.

612
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,360
He only takes on high-profile cases.

613
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,800
He's especially interested
in cases in which the clients

614
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,440
are rich assholes.

615
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,800
What's worse is,

616
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,760
he almost never loses.

617
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,560
Do you know why?

618
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,520
It's because someone like him
will do anything to win

619
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,760
without caring about morality.

620
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,720
That's why he gets richer and richer.

621
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,280
And that's who I'm up against.

622
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,720
Sir.

623
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,640
Are you going somewhere?

624
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,800
I've been waiting for you for ages.

625
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,040
I've wasted enough time here.

626
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,680
What do you want?

627
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,160
My client doesn't want
to go to court with you

628
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,120
for some petty matter
like a sexual harassment lawsuit.

629
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,840
So I'm here to talk to you
to find an easier way out.

630
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,960
You can go tell your client
that I earn an honest living.

631
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,440
I don't sleep around for money.

632
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,960
I won't withdraw the case
or agree to any settlement.

633
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,280
My client is willing to pay you.

634
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,520
Two million baht.

635
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,200
I don't want his money.

636
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,720
I want to put him in prison.

637
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,880
How can you do that
when the affair was consensual?

638
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,800
Listen.

639
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,600
I have proof.

640
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,480
I can prove that you went out
with my client on a regular basis

641
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,600
and that you never seemed to mind
any physical or sexual contact.

642
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,200
The affair wasn't consensual.

643
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,840
I didn't dare tell him off
because he's my boss.

644
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,800
Then you won't deny that you have engaged

645
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,640
in sexual activities?

646
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,960
That's what people would think.

647
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,680
Do you know how many times
I've won this kind of case?

648
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,080
Once we go to court,

649
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,520
you'll be the one to face
the humiliation when the truth comes out.

650
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,120
Your family will also be affected.

651
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,320
Your parents are public servants.

652
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,960
They will suffer because of you
instead of getting to retire in peace.

653
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,280
And you'll never be able
to get a job anywhere else after this.

654
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,960
My client is a powerful man.

655
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,800
He really can do anything.

656
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,240
Trust me.

657
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,960
You there!

658
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,360
Take your cheque back.

659
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,360
You can't throw money at my daughter.

660
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,880
Things won't end well for you.

661
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,080
Karma will catch up to you one day.

662
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,960
Mom. Dad. Let's go home.

663
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,320
I hope you end up in prison one day.

664
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,560
A corrupt lawyer like you
deserves to rot in hell.

665
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,200
Let's go home.

666
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,560
What an asshole.

667
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,760
You have your work cut out for you.

668
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,080
I'm not scared of one evil lawyer.

669
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,600
You don't know what people can do
if they have power and money.

670
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,080
And people like him are usually good
at using those things to their advantage.

671
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,960
Kengrop may believe in the power of money.

672
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,760
But I believe in karma
and the justice system.

673
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,640
He can play dirty all he wants,
but I'll do my best to help Maysa.

674
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,840
You have my support.

675
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,080
I hope you succeed.

676
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,080
Thank you, Nicha.
I'll give it my best shot.

677
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,000
Anyway, do you have somewhere to be?

678
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,800
Can you come have dinner with me?

679
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,000
I have to go meet a friend.

680
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,400
I'll tell him I can't go.

681
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,400
What? Are you bailing on me again, Mai?

682
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,160
Sorry, man.
My colleague wants to go get dinner.

683
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,760
It's getting quite late.
I don't want her to eat alone.

684
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,720
Gosh. So it's a female colleague.

685
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,440
You always act like a hero
and make me look like a villain.

686
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,720
So where are you going?

687
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,320
Can you buy me some food?

688
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,480
Eat up, so you have the strength
to fight the case against Kengrop.

689
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,320
Strength won't help me do that.

690
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,520
Food can nourish your brain.
It will give you brain power.

691
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,960
Fine, I'll eat.

692
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,120
Hey, Mai.

693
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,760
What a coincidence.
I didn't expect to see you here.

694
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,240
Yes. What are the chances?

695
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,480
Ms. Angel Face.

696
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,880
Mai, how did you know Ms. Angel Face?

697
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,560
Why are you so surprised? She's my friend.

698
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,040
What about you?

699
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,160
How do you know Nicha?

700
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,960
Your name is Nicha?

701
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,480
What a cute name.

702
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,400
We've met before, but I don't know him.

703
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,840
We've already met,
so that makes us acquaintances.

704
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,760
Since we're all here,
do you mind if I join you?

705
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,080
I'll be right back, Nicha.

706
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,160
Come with me.

707
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,960
Get over here.

708
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,360
What are you doing?

709
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,520
Mai, tell me the truth.

710
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,880
You're not into her, right?

711
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,480
Are you two really just friends?

712
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,600
Yes, Nicha is my friend.

713
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,360
So you can't mess around with her.

714
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,160
Your friend is the girl of my dreams.

715
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,360
What?

716
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,240
Come on. She's the girl I told you about.

717
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,000
I ran into her twice already.

718
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,640
This is the third time we met.

719
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,400
-She's clearly my soulmate.
-Don't get ahead of yourself.

720
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,640
Nicha is a quiet girl,
you're not her type.

721
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,920
I can be anything she wants
except becoming like you.

722
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,120
Bee.

723
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,120
Just tell me, man.

724
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,720
Tell me what she's like
and what she's into.

725
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,720
Tell me everything. Come on.

726
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,920
Tell me what color and food she likes.
Does she like to exercise?

727
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,600
Where does she like to go?
I can already picture our wedding.

728
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,800
Just picture it. I can see her
in a wedding dress. Come on, Mai.

729
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,800
Just thinking about it makes me happy.
You have to help me, man.

730
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,280
Gosh!

731
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,280
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

732
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,280
I'm fine.

733
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,920
Where are you going?

734
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,680
-Let me go.
-What's the hurry?

735
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,200
-Let me go.
-Stay with me.

736
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,440
-Let go of me.
-Stay and have a chat.

737
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,880
Go home if you're drunk.

738
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,640
Don't harass others.

739
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,760
Yes, sir. I'm sorry. I'll get going now.

740
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,040
Thank you.

741
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,280
Inspector.

742
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,680
You're Fon's friend.

743
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,680
That's right.

744
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,000
Thank you.

745
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,840
Thank you again for earlier.

746
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,040
I don't know what I would do
if you weren't there.

747
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,440
There's a liquor store nearby.

748
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,440
So you may see drunk men
hanging around here.

749
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,080
Are you here alone?

750
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,520
I'm here with a friend.

751
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,040
I see.

752
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,360
It's good that you have
someone here with you.

753
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,000
Hey, Inspector.

754
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,800
Mai.

755
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,240
We're of the same mind
coming to the same restaurant.

756
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,040
I got harassed by a drunk man.

757
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,080
The inspector helped me out.

758
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,920
Where is he? Where did he go?

759
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,800
I'll go kick his ass.

760
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,320
He's gone now.

761
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,960
But we shouldn't resort to violence.

762
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,240
Let the law deal with him.

763
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,440
Oh, right.

764
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,960
We've got a police officer
and lawyers here.

765
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,160
So there's no need to use violence.

766
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,040
Let's use our brains instead.

767
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,520
Right?

768
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,400
I thought lawyers were busy people.

769
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,760
But you seem to have
more free time than I thought.

770
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,880
Thank you for thinking of me.

771
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,120
It's not you that I'm thinking of.

772
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,200
Yes, Fon.

773
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,240
You should've come with me.

774
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,840
I ran into Mavin
and Nicha at the restaurant.

775
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,040
They're having dinner.

776
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,680
All right. I'll see you soon.

777
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,160
Please excuse me.

778
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,120
Thank you for coming with me.

779
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,400
I'll get going now.

780
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,080
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

781
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,960
Wait, Nicha.

782
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,200
Do you need a ride?

783
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,000
No, thank you.

784
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,480
This is my business card.

785
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,240
If there's ever an emergency,

786
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,720
you can call me anytime.

787
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,160
Take it, Nicha.

788
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,360
Bee is a reliable guy.

789
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,160
You should go. It's late.

790
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,320
All right.

791
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,320
Get home safe.

792
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,320
You're unbelievable.

793
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,920
I got to hand it to you.

794
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,360
Damn.

795
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,160
What a shame.

796
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,800
It should've been me who rescued her.

797
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,400
How could I miss my chance
to be a hero in her eyes?

798
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,200
It was your fault.
You dragged me out with you.

799
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,080
Hey, Mai.

800
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,800
-Fon.
-Hey.

801
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,320
Are you hungry? Would you like anything?

802
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,920
Maybe later. Why did you want to see me?

803
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I want your advice about something.

804
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,240
All right.

805
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,520
Do you think…

806
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,280
I should let someone know

807
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,960
if I have feelings for them?

808
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,160
Do you…

809
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,000
Do you have someone you like?

810
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,720
Yes. But…

811
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,520
I don't know how he feels about me.

812
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,640
I really can't figure him out.

813
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,960
And…

814
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,480
what's the situation between you two?

815
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,960
Have you known him long?

816
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,480
Well…

817
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,680
It's Mai.

818
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,840
You see.

819
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,760
I've liked him for a long time.

820
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,640
But he let his friend
hit on me the other day.

821
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,680
You don't want us to be too close

822
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,600
outside of work?

823
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,680
All right then.

824
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,600
You can have this money

825
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,520
if you tell me what Maysa intends
to do about her husband.

826
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,360
It seems that the evidence I have

827
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,680
is enough to make your client go bankrupt.

828
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,960
I guess we'll have to try

829
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,600
and turn a crisis into an opportunity.

830
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,520
Your mother was abused.

831
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,560
But it doesn't mean all women are victims.

832
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,480
Did you look into my background?

833
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,240
