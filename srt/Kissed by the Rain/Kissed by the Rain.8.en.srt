1
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,240
You can have this money

2
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,760
if you tell me what Maysa intends
to do about her husband.

3
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,520
Your mom was abused,
but it doesn't mean all women are victims.

4
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,440
Did you look into my background?

5
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,560
It seems that the evidence I have

6
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,840
is enough to make your client go bankrupt.

7
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,800
You'll see very soon
who you're up against.

8
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,960
I guess we'll have to try

9
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,960
and turn crisis into opportunity.

10
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,400
She did indeed
steal money from the defendant.

11
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,880
The witness could've lied
about what the defendant did

12
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,400
due to their previous dispute.

13
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,080
Please don't worry.

14
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
The evidence we have
should be enough to incriminate him.

15
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,080
Please hang in there.

16
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,920
I believe everything will end well.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
You're even more evil than I thought.

18
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,360
You made up a sob story
and flat-out lied to your lawyer.

19
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,920
Can you please control your client?

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
You're no better.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
You won't make it far as a lawyer.

22
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,240
You can't even tell
that this woman can't be trusted.

23
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,600
She made things up to fool you

24
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,880
and you keep letting her manipulate you.

25
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,200
That's enough, sir.

26
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,920
Haven't you hurt your wife enough?

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,080
You're a social worker, right?

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,680
Don't you realize
you're helping the wrong person?

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
Rather than helping her,

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,120
it'd be better
to help strays on the street.

31
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,360
You are all idiots.
She's playing you like a fiddle.

32
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,800
Stop it, Mr. Phathit,
or you'll be facing another lawsuit.

33
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
Calm down, sir.

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,920
Don't stop me.

35
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,120
I'll expose this woman
for who she really is.

36
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,840
Why do you hate me so much?

37
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,800
Haven't you ruined my life enough?

38
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,400
My biggest mistake
was choosing you to be my husband.

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,080
When your life went wrong
or when your company's stocks took a dive,

40
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
you always blamed everything on me.

41
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
I think you should start blaming yourself

42
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,040
since all of this happened because of you.

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,800
Stop throwing blame at me

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,720
and stop trying to ruin my life!

45
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,320
You're the one ruining my life!

46
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
Mark my words.

47
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,080
You won't get a single dime of my money.

48
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,560
I'll make a vile woman like you pay

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,320
for the damage you caused my company.

50
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,000
An asshole like you deserves
all the punishment that comes your way.

51
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,440
I think we should go.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,760
Where are you going?

53
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,040
We're not done talking.

54
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,080
Mr. Phathit.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,760
That's enough, sir.

56
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,400
I feel so bad for Maysa.

57
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,960
Her life is ruined all because of one man.

58
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,480
I've seen a lot of cases like this.

59
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,960
They made me see that

60
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,360
some people come into our lives
as blessings

61
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,560
while some come into our lives as lessons.

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,120
Though they cause you pain,

63
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,840
they can also teach you something.

64
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,920
Am I a blessing or a lesson to you?

65
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,640
Mai!

66
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
What's going on?

67
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,640
It's nothing.

68
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,920
Mai stepped on my foot.

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,800
Be more careful, Mai.

70
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,960
Mai.

71
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,920
Can you take Nicha home?

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,240
She didn't bring her car today.

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,480
What about you?

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,640
I can get home myself.

75
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,760
It's no problem.

76
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,880
See you later.

77
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,080
Do you want to come inside?

78
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,440
It's okay, I want to go home and rest.

79
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,040
Help!

80
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,160
Somebody help!

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,160
Dad!

82
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,880
Dad!

83
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Sir, can you wait a moment?

84
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,240
Dad!

85
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,960
Dad! What happened to you?

86
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,760
Dad! Please wake up!

87
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,600
Mai.

88
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,040
Dad!

89
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,600
Let's take him to the hospital.

90
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,880
The cab's waiting outside.

91
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,800
Come on, Dad.

92
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,160
Dad.

93
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,920
Dad.

94
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,960
How are you feeling?

95
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,080
How did I get here?

96
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,800
When I got home,
I saw you lying on the floor.

97
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,360
Your blood pressure was through the roof.

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,600
I was lucky to have Mai there with me.

99
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,200
He helped me bring you here.

100
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Mai?

101
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,680
He's my friend from the law firm.

102
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,760
Hello, sir.

103
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
How are you feeling?

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
I'm better now.

105
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,640
Thank you so much

106
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,320
for bringing me to the hospital.

107
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,120
I'm just glad that you're safe.

108
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
You should rest, Dad.

109
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,200
The doctor said he'll have to monitor
your condition once you've woken up.

110
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,960
You can go home if everything looks good.

111
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,120
I'll go wait outside.

112
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,920
Get well soon, sir.

113
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,600
Is he the guy I wanted to meet?

114
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,600
I wish we could've met
under better circumstances.

115
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,200
He looks nice.

116
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,800
I like him.

117
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,800
Dad.

118
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,960
-What's wrong with the patient?
-My mom's hyperventilating.

119
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,919
Please wait outside, sir.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
Mr. Phathit.

121
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,360
You asshole.

122
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,680
This is all your fault.

123
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,040
Mr. Phathit.

124
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,160
Please calm down. We're at a hospital.

125
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,720
Calm down? How can I calm down?

126
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,600
He's the reason my mom
was so stressed, she was hospitalized.

127
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,560
I'm just doing my job.

128
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,120
This is your doing.

129
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,280
I wouldn't have filed a lawsuit
against you if you hadn't abused Maysa.

130
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,800
When did I ever abuse her?

131
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,520
I was the one being abused by her.

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,040
Gosh!

133
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,760
Why won't you listen to me?

134
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,240
You won't listen and you'll have Gee
testify against me in court.

135
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,240
My mom was mortified
and had to be hospitalized.

136
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
You're being played by that woman.

137
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,600
But I'm not surprised.

138
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,440
She also had me fooled
with all her lies and schemes.

139
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,920
You two are lawyers.

140
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,120
All you want is to win the case.

141
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,720
You don't really care what the truth is.

142
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,680
What do you mean?

143
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,040
I've never hit women.

144
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,720
I swear that's the truth.

145
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm telling you,
I'm the victim in this case.

146
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,360
I'm home.

147
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,720
Why are you still up?

148
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,840
What's this?

149
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,600
Who did you go to Hong Kong with?

150
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,840
A friend.

151
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,840
I called all your friends.
None of them went with you.

152
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,720
Tell me who you went there with.

153
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,080
You spent over a million baht in one day.

154
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,360
I told you I went with a friend.

155
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,200
Stop asking me already.

156
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,960
So you won't admit it?

157
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,960
Fine. Someone told me they saw you
in Hong Kong with a man.

158
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,160
I see.

159
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,880
Do you distrust me so much
that you hired a detective to follow me?

160
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,240
Don't change the subject.

161
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,360
And I didn't hire a detective.

162
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
You humiliated me

163
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,440
by cheating on me with another man.

164
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,760
How could you do this to me?

165
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,600
How could you do this to me?

166
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,800
Because a guy like you is boring.

167
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,640
I would've left you long ago
if you didn't have money.

168
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,800
Maysa.

169
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,840
Someone like you
is nothing without your money.

170
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,960
I have to find someone else
to satisfy my needs.

171
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,720
Well, you wanted to know the truth,
so there you have it.

172
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,080
Are you happy now?

173
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,920
You know how much I love you.

174
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,320
How could you betray my love?

175
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,320
How could you hurt my feelings like this?

176
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,960
-How?
-Let me go!

177
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,760
How could you do this to me, Maysa?

178
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,680
Gosh!

179
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,200
If you don't stop
snooping into my affairs,

180
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,280
I'll make your company go bankrupt.

181
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,920
How could one woman do
something like that to you?

182
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,320
Stop lying to me.

183
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,760
She's the one who's lying.

184
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
Then tell me.

185
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,480
If she really did all that to you,
why didn't you do anything?

186
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,840
Because of the company.

187
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,080
The company means everything to my family,

188
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,320
especially to my mom.

189
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,760
She built the company from the ground up.

190
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,800
I know Maysa is capable
of destroying my company as she said.

191
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,440
Didn't you see what happened?

192
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,600
She filed a lawsuit against me,

193
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,280
causing my company's stocks to plummet.

194
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,680
She's a cold-blooded woman.

195
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,080
She can destroy anyone if she wants to.

196
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,600
She's playing all of you.

197
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,360
If you still choose to believe her,

198
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,480
you're going to regret it.

199
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,360
You're even more evil than I thought.

200
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,680
You made up a sob story
and flat-out lied to your lawyer.

201
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,880
Can you please control your client?

202
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
You're no better.

203
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,760
You won't make it far as a lawyer.

204
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,960
You can't even tell
that this woman can't be trusted.

205
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
Mai.

206
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,880
How's your dad?

207
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,920
He's asleep now.

208
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,160
Thank you so much

209
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
for coming to the hospital with me

210
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,000
and for taking me and my dad home.

211
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,040
Don't worry about it.

212
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,280
We're friends, right?

213
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,200
Right.

214
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,440
Is something on your mind?

215
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,920
You seem kind of troubled.

216
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm thinking about
what Maysa's husband said.

217
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,960
Do you believe him?

218
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,640
I don't.

219
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,960
He can't be a good person if he chose
to hire a lawyer like Kengrop.

220
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,600
He was just messing with your head

221
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,640
to make you feel unsure about the case.

222
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,560
I should go.

223
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,400
I have to be at the court early tomorrow.

224
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,880
Mr. Phathit's sister will be testifying
for Maysa tomorrow, right?

225
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,160
That's right.

226
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,800
She wasn't at the trial today.

227
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,480
I thought she changed her mind.

228
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,560
She had an exam today.

229
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,880
I see.

230
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,480
Well, you get home safe.

231
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

232
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,680
Let's go.

233
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,280
THANYABURI PROVINCIAL COURT

234
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,560
How are you related to the defendant?

235
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,640
I'm his younger sister.

236
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,160
Are you his biological sister?

237
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
I was born to my dad's second marriage.

238
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,080
Phathit has looked after me
since I was a kid

239
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,640
because my mom died
when I was three years old.

240
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,680
You're the defendant's sister.

241
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,680
How come you're testifying
for the plaintiff today?

242
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,000
Because Maysa suffered so much.

243
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,520
She was abused
physically and mentally by Phathit.

244
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,880
You said that you saw
the defendant abuse the plaintiff.

245
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,520
Did you see it firsthand
or did someone tell you about it?

246
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,200
I saw it firsthand.

247
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,760
I saw him do it several times.

248
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,240
Gee.

249
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
How did he abuse the plaintiff?

250
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,280
He slapped her face
and punched her body with his fist.

251
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,080
You could see the bruises
on her body where he hit her.

252
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,160
No further questions.

253
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,560
The defense may cross-examine the witness.

254
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,240
You're 18 years old, is that correct?

255
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,600
Yes.

256
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,560
Do you have a boyfriend?

257
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Objection.

258
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,280
The question is irrelevant to the case.

259
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
Your Honor, I can assure you

260
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,480
this question is relevant
to the subject matter of the case.

261
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,360
You may proceed.

262
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,000
You first had a boyfriend
when you were 16.

263
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,840
You once brought your boyfriend
to sleep at your house

264
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,320
which caused you to argue
with your brother.

265
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,080
Is that correct?

266
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
He's just a friend.

267
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,080
And he only dropped by for a visit.

268
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,040
Is it true that the incident
caused your brother to scold you

269
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,960
and led you two to have an argument?

270
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,640
-Phathit--
-Please answer yes or no.

271
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,520
Please answer the question.

272
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,520
Yes, it's true.

273
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,480
You said they always got along.

274
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,600
Your Honor.

275
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,320
I'd like to enter
additional exhibits into evidence.

276
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,680
With your permission,
I'll present the exhibits to the witness.

277
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,680
Objection.

278
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
I never received copies of these exhibits,

279
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,680
so I couldn't verify
the authenticity of the documents.

280
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,280
I had no opportunity
to review or refute them.

281
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,160
You can't introduce
exhibits without notice.

282
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,560
Your Honor.

283
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,240
These documents offer
key information relating to the case

284
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,960
in which I've just discovered.

285
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,680
This is justified according
to the Civil Procedure Code,

286
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,720
Section 88, Clause 3.

287
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,480
Upon consideration,

288
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,600
the court grants you permission
to proceed in the interest of justice.

289
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,440
I'll proceed.

290
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,600
Please tell me.

291
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,560
Are you the girl in this picture?

292
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,320
Yes.

293
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,520
And what's your relationship

294
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,600
with the boy whom
you were hugging in the picture?

295
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,120
You said he's just a friend.

296
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,160
Please tell me this.

297
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,800
Is it really normal for friends
to snuggle with each other

298
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,120
and take pictures
in bed together like this?

299
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,240
Where did you get the photo?

300
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,040
I'm doing the asking.

301
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,240
Please answer my question.

302
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,280
Well?

303
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Thank you, Your Honor.

304
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,960
Is this your new car?

305
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,920
Yes.

306
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,880
I'm really curious.

307
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,760
How did you afford to buy this car

308
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,960
when your brother only gives you
30,000 baht a month as an allowance?

309
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,600
Thank you, Your Honor.

310
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,440
Why must we talk about my private matters?

311
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,600
Because your private matters
are of relevance to the case.

312
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,680
This cashier's check was written

313
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,400
for the purchase of your car.

314
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,440
The check was made out
by the plaintiff, not the defendant.

315
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,880
Did you accept money from the plaintiff

316
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,480
and agree to tell lies
about the defendant who's your brother?

317
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,120
No, that's not true.

318
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Phathit really abused Maysa.

319
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,960
Your Honor.

320
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,440
May I present another piece of evidence?

321
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,160
Permission granted.

322
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,720
What can it be?

323
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,360
Will this make us lose the case?

324
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,920
That's enough.

325
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,280
Your Honor.

326
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,120
This is what Ms. Maysa
always did to Mr. Phathit

327
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,280
every time he caught her
doing something wrong,

328
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
whether it was her embezzling
his company's money

329
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,760
or her having an affair,

330
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,720
all of which hurt
Mr. Phathit's company and family.

331
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,840
Ms. Maysa would scream curses
at Mr. Phathit and physically abuse him.

332
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,800
Then she'd hurt herself
to cover things up.

333
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,280
In the video clip that I showed you,

334
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,800
Ms. Maysa assaulted Mr. Phathit
and fractured his arm.

335
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,440
Your Honor.

336
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,120
This is a medical certificate
issued to Mr. Phathit

337
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,800
after he was assaulted by Ms. Maysa.

338
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,760
How dare you do this to me, Phathit?

339
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,600
Do you dare humiliate me?

340
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,200
I didn't have an affair.

341
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,360
I'll make you regret this, you asshole.

342
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,000
Maysa.

343
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,520
Why did you have to lie to us?

344
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,400
We were trying our best to help you.

345
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,880
Help me?

346
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,480
If I had known
how incompetent you people are,

347
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,320
I wouldn't have wasted time
pretending I needed your help.

348
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,480
How could you say that?

349
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,600
Have you no shame at all?

350
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,200
Am I wrong?

351
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,280
Don't get me started about you.

352
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,760
You were completely
caught off guard by Kengrop.

353
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
I'm telling you.

354
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,120
You'll never amount to anything
as a lawyer.

355
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,720
-Maysa.
-It's all right, Fon.

356
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,960
She was right.

357
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
But it was her lies
that caught me off guard.

358
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,880
It's not my fault that you're so naive.

359
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,400
If I lose the case,

360
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,560
I'll tell everyone

361
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,520
your foundation is too incompetent
to be of help to anyone.

362
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,400
Pathetic.

363
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,520
What a waste of time.

364
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,960
Let her go, Nicha.

365
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,360
How could you let her go

366
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
after she insulted us like that?

367
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,560
Well?

368
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,960
Are you all wised up now?

369
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,280
I told you before
that you're all too naive.

370
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
The court hasn't made a ruling yet,

371
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,080
but at least you got to see
this woman's true colors.

372
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,240
Very well then.

373
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,480
Learn from this experience.

374
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,160
It will make you better.

375
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,360
After you, sir.

376
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,240
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION
WOMEN AND CHILDREN PROTECTION CENTER

377
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,360
Won't you go home, Mai?

378
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm just thinking about stuff.

379
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,920
Are you thinking about the case?

380
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,240
Me too.

381
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,960
I'd rather lose the case
than help the wrong person.

382
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,360
Kengrop was right.

383
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,520
I'm too naive.

384
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,400
I assumed all women were victims.

385
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,360
I'm no better than you.

386
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,960
I came to work at this foundation

387
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,680
because I wanted to help abuse victims.

388
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,720
When Maysa came to us for help,

389
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,240
I believed her without thinking twice

390
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,640
because she's a woman.

391
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,320
A social worker like me
should have better judgment.

392
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,720
You're overthinking it.

393
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,200
I do feel guilty, but at least
I believe we had good intentions.

394
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,040
Think of this as
an expensive lesson for all of us.

395
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
Why are you smiling?

396
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,440
You look like a crazy person.

397
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,600
I'm smiling to cheer you up.

398
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,280
You should go home.

399
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,960
I'll head home soon as well.

400
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,400
Let's go.

401
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,960
Are you here to see Mai?

402
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,000
Mai is at the foundation.

403
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,480
I'm here to see you.

404
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,680
I thought you might've left.

405
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,720
Is there something you need?

406
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,720
Well, I'd like to ask you
to have dinner with me.

407
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,160
Okay.

408
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,160
What? Are you serious, Nicha?

409
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,360
Will you really have dinner with me?

410
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,640
Nicha.

411
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,600
I think I've used up all my luck
to have you say yes to me.

412
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,840
Please get over me.

413
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,560
I already have someone I like.

414
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,640
You agreed to come have dinner with me

415
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,120
just to immediately shoot me down?

416
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,680
Won't you let me have a little hope?

417
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,200
I don't like giving people false hope.

418
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,040
If they learned the truth later

419
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,320
that I have no feelings for them,

420
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,240
I know they'd be heartbroken.

421
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,200
I'm okay with that.

422
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,960
I'll still keep trying to win your heart.

423
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,960
I don't mind waiting.

424
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,080
I don't want you to waste your time.

425
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,760
Gosh.

426
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,120
I'm sorry,
but I have to be honest with you.

427
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,800
Since you're friends with Mai,

428
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,600
I don't want any awkwardness between us.

429
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Right.

430
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,240
I understand.

431
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Let's eat.

432
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,720
Think of me as your friend.

433
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,240
Gosh.

434
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,240
-What is it?
-Speak of the devil.

435
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,520
Mai and Fon.

436
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,040
Let's go say hi to them.

437
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,880
Let's not do that.

438
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,720
We should let those two
have some time alone.

439
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
Why?

440
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
I can't believe Mai didn't tell me

441
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,960
that he's having dinner with Fon.

442
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,200
Why should he tell you?

443
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,240
Because I'm his go-to guy.

444
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Mai tells me everything,

445
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,200
especially the stuff about Fon.

446
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,440
What do you mean?

447
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,920
You're close to Mai.

448
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,480
Do you really not know about this?

449
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,760
-Know about what?
-Come on.

450
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,080
Mai likes Fon.

451
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,280
Mai likes Fon?

452
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,680
That's right.

453
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,920
He's had a crush on her
since he was a kid.

454
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,920
Fon's the reason he pushed himself
to be where he is today.

455
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,040
He's really determined to win her heart.

456
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,280
What a guy.

457
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,920
Hats off to him.

458
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,960
I thought you already knew about this.

459
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,120
Mai never shuts up about Fon.

460
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,600
I keep telling him
he needs to stop chasing her.

461
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,600
Now he's having dinner with her.

462
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,320
I can't believe he didn't tell me.

463
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,680
I'm so happy for him.

464
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,600
Are you that bummed
that I made you join me for dinner?

465
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,840
Hurry up and finish your food,
I'm getting sleepy.

466
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,080
I'll get this for you.

467
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,080
You should eat something.

468
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm not hungry.

469
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
Then why did you agree to come?

470
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,640
You seemed down.

471
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,920
So I wanted to keep you company.

472
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,920
Are you worried about me?

473
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,400
I thought dining out might cheer me up.

474
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,240
I have nothing better to do anyway.

475
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,639
I can tell you're worried about me.

476
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,320
Mai.

477
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,960
Do you…

478
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,639
Do you like Nicha?

479
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,120
I do.

480
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,480
Really?

481
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,239
I'm so glad to hear that.

482
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,400
I like her as a friend.

483
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,239
You've mentioned Nicha to me
several times now.

484
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,880
It's like you're playing matchmaker.

485
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,960
It's not like that.

486
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,680
It's just that she seems like a nice girl
and you're also a nice guy.

487
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,480
I think you two
would be perfect for each other.

488
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,000
Do you want me to be with her?

489
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,560
Why?

490
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,000
Well…

491
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,760
I think Nicha might be…

492
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,640
interested in you.

493
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,000
Did she tell you that?

494
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,320
No. She didn't tell me anything.

495
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,080
I just have a feeling.

496
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,400
I'm a woman.
Women can tell about these things.

497
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,000
Fon.

498
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,840
If Nicha likes me,
she should tell me herself.

499
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,000
But if she didn't tell you,

500
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,680
I don't think
you should assume how she feels.

501
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,000
Bee, what are you doing standing here?

502
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,440
Mai.

503
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,520
Why would you tell Nicha that?

504
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,920
Well, she asked me.

505
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
I see that you two are close.

506
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,560
I thought I could tell her.

507
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,280
Damn it, Bee.

508
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,720
You shouldn't have told her.

509
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,200
Why not?

510
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,560
What's the big deal?

511
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,360
You and Nicha are just friends.

512
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,400
It'd be a different story
if she had a crush on you.

513
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,760
From now on, just come to me first
before you start talking

514
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,360
about me or Fon.

515
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,440
I don't want to make Fon uncomfortable.

516
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,200
Mai.

517
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,880
You're overthinking it.

518
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,160
You're blowing this out of proportion.

519
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,160
Seriously.

520
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,400
You should be consoling me right now.

521
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,240
I just got my heart broken.

522
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,880
You shouldn't be lecturing me.

523
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,080
Some friend you are.

524
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,640
Do you really expect me to console you?

525
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,080
You just caused me trouble.

526
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,040
How?

527
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,320
It's Nicha.

528
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,840
She likes me.

529
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,680
You asshole.

530
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,960
But I'm not into her.

531
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,280
I've been trying to act oblivious.

532
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,520
Then you went and told her that.

533
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,360
I don't know how she'll take it.

534
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,200
Shoot.

535
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,360
Crap.

536
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,240
Hey, Nicha.
Why are you calling so me late?

537
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,640
Fon.

538
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,440
I have something I want to ask you.

539
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,160
Sure.

540
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,200
What is it?

541
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,480
It's about Mai.

542
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,240
What about him?

543
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,280
Hello?

544
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,120
Never mind.

545
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,120
I'm sorry for calling you so late.

546
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,760
FON

547
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,960
Who's here at this time of night?

548
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,040
Fon.

549
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Toey.

550
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,880
Let's head inside.

551
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,360
What's going on, Toey?

552
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,360
How did you get in here?

553
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,160
-Wait.
-Get out.

554
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,040
-Fon! Stop!
-I'll call the police.

555
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,000
Stop it, Fon!

556
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,000
-Fon, calm down!
-I said get out.

557
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,240
Wait. Chai's here with me.

558
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,080
What?

559
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,600
You two made up?

560
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,920
That's right.

561
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,000
Toey!

562
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,600
Didn't he abuse you?

563
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,280
How could you trust him?

564
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
Why did you bring him here?

565
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,200
I don't feel safe.

566
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,400
Gosh. Chai won't hurt you, Fon.

567
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,680
Don't be scared.

568
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,800
Toey, he assaulted me once
and he also abused you.

569
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,320
That was an accident.

570
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,240
Right?

571
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,760
Seriously?

572
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,200
This is nuts.

573
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,480
Come on, Fon.

574
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,160
Chai never abused me

575
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,080
except for that day at the foundation.

576
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,000
And he happened to hurt you by accident.

577
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,240
But you were the one
who came to the foundation for help

578
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,360
to get a restraining order against him.

579
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,000
You wanted me gone that badly?

580
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,760
I really did want
to break up with you then.

581
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,640
You weren't doing anything with your life.

582
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,240
You always got jealous
and followed me everywhere.

583
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
You gave me good reason to be jealous.

584
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,200
Shut up.

585
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,480
I was tired of breaking up
and making up with you.

586
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,520
I wanted to end it for good.

587
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,560
So what happened?

588
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,560
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

589
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,440
I felt bad for Chai.

590
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,320
He really isn't that bad, Fon.

591
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,320
So did you ever hit Toey?

592
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,240
She was the one hitting me.

593
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,240
The most I did was fake-threaten her.

594
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,320
Why didn't you break up with her?

595
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,760
When I did,
she begged me to get back with her.

596
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,680
-And I caved.
-Please.

597
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,120
There were times when you begged me
to get back with you too.

598
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,080
I wasn't the only one doing it.

599
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,600
Never mind then.

600
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,760
So you two still love each other.

601
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,160
That's right.

602
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,200
Can you tell me

603
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,480
the reason why you two love each other?

604
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,440
Chai is the only one who is sincere
with me and understands me.

605
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,600
He accepts me for who I am.

606
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,720
I can't give you any reasons.

607
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,800
I just know that I love her.

608
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
You're so sweet, baby.

609
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,680
Toey, get a hold of yourself.

610
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,320
Don't be shy, baby.

611
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,520
I said knock it off, Toey.

612
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,360
I guess you two are really meant to be.

613
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,560
So what brings you here this late?

614
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,960
I had Mavin file a complaint
against Chai out of anger.

615
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,680
But I'm not angry with him anymore.

616
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,520
Can you tell Mavin
to withdraw the complaint?

617
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,480
Please help me, Fon.

618
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,000
You're here this late just to ask me that?

619
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,400
Well, that's because

620
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,320
we're going to get married tomorrow.

621
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
What?

622
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,160
Can you come to be a witness?

623
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,760
-Please.
-No.

624
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,360
Please, Fon.
I have no one else besides you.

625
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,280
Pretty please.

626
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,240
No.

627
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,720
You're here early.

628
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,600
But not as early as me.

629
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,560
So?

630
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,120
I'm not here to pester you.

631
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,920
I got here early

632
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,440
because I wanted to see you
before you had to head out for work.

633
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,440
Since you got what you came for,
I guess I can go now?

634
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,760
Where are you going today?

635
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,040
Do you need a ride?

636
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,120
It's okay.

637
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,240
-I got it.
-You got it.

638
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,160
I already knew you'd say no.

639
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,600
I'm just here to get some documents
before heading to the office.

640
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,960
Do you enjoy messing with me?

641
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,200
It seems to get your attention.

642
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,320
At least messing with you
gets you to talk to me.

643
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,880
I didn't buy this for you.

644
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,560
I bought it to help out a hawker.

645
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,800
You can have it.

646
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,480
I'll see you later.

647
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,320
Are you heading out for work?

648
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,520
Yes.

649
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,280
-Take care.
-Thank you.

650
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,200
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

651
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,520
KANYAMIT FOUNDATION

652
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,440
Fon, you're back.

653
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,960
What's up, Rey?

654
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,240
I have something to show you.

655
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,440
What is it?

656
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,880
Come with me.

657
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,480
How adorable.

658
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,080
What a cute baby.

659
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,520
How could someone abandon
such an adorable baby?

660
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,120
-I know.
-Right.

661
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,040
So tell me how you found this baby.

662
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,080
Yes, ma'am. Everything looked normal
when I got here this morning.

663
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,040
When I got back from the bathroom,

664
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,360
the baby was already there.

665
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,520
Rey!

666
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,040
Rey.

667
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,160
Someone left this baby outside.

668
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,320
What?

669
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,160
Mhai!

670
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,720
My goodness.

671
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,040
So I brought the baby here.

672
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,440
That's right.

673
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,560
Thank you so much.

674
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,680
You can get back to work.

675
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,040
Yes, ma'am.

676
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,440
Judging from the basket

677
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,440
and all the blankets
and the pillow inside,

678
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,760
the baby is probably
from a middle-class family.

679
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,960
Did you check the basket whether
there are letters or personal items?

680
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,880
I already checked,
but there doesn't seem to be anything.

681
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,520
There's only this tiny doll.

682
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,440
There's also the blanket
that the baby's wrapped in.

683
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
These items are important,
so keep them safe.

684
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,440
They can be used for identification

685
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,680
in case the family changes their mind
and comes back for the baby.

686
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,320
Fon.

687
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,720
Call the police and tell them a baby
was abandoned outside the foundation

688
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,560
and that we'll look after it for now.

689
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,040
All right.

690
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,240
Is it a boy or a girl?

691
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,680
Well…

692
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,560
Rey, open the diaper.

693
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,440
That's my specialty.

694
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,280
It's a boy.

695
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,000
That's quite a willy you got there.

696
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,480
So which nursing mom
should we ask to nurse this baby?

697
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,560
We currently have
two nursing moms with us,

698
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,760
but one of them doesn't lactate anymore

699
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,640
and the other one isn't ready to do it.

700
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Why not?

701
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,240
She's suffering from depression.

702
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,800
Then let's not trouble her.

703
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,920
So what should we do?

704
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,720
We'll look after the baby for now.

705
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,240
Hey, handsome.

706
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,880
Can I hold you?

707
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,600
Here you go.

708
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,000
Come to me.

709
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,920
Let me hold you.

710
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,600
Look at him.

711
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,600
My name is Fon.

712
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,080
Hello, Mai.

713
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Will you come
to the foundation later today?

714
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,400
No.

715
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,600
Is something the matter?

716
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,840
It's nothing.
I just thought you'd be back here.

717
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,360
I was going to ask you to buy
something for me, but it's fine.

718
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,240
I can go buy it after I finish work.

719
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,440
What do you need?

720
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,640
Are you sure? I don't want to trouble you.

721
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,560
It's no trouble.

722
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,000
Then can you go buy a baby crib for me?

723
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,800
It's for a two-month-old baby.

724
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,280
-Get the rocking kind.
-Okay.

725
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,840
Check the kids department.

726
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,640
Rey.

727
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,280
Don't bother him, Mai is busy with work.

728
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,640
I'll go buy the crib.

729
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,240
I'll drop it off at the foundation later.

730
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,240
He's not busy. He said he'd go buy it.

731
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,320
Stop it.

732
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,960
Mai.

733
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,880
You don't have to go.

734
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,360
I'll go buy the crib myself.

735
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,320
Let's do as we agreed, Mai.

736
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,960
Okay, that would be all.

737
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,600
Whose kid did you take under your care?

738
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,920
It's Fon's kid.

739
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,440
What? Whose kid?

740
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,680
I have to go. Fon's about to kill me.

741
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,520
Gosh, Rey.

742
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,400
He's fast asleep.

743
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,200
You have your own child
and you're still obsessed with babies?

744
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,600
My kid isn't a baby anymore.

745
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,680
He's like a little monkey now.

746
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,640
I wish I could shrink him
and turn him into a baby again.

747
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,960
Look at this guy.

748
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,840
He sleeps all day.

749
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,360
What a good baby.

750
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,160
You're right.

751
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,600
He barely cries at all.

752
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,520
What should we do, Rey?

753
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,280
I don't know.

754
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,200
What? Shouldn't you know
about these things?

755
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,400
I've raised one baby and he's big now.

756
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,640
I'm not that experienced.

757
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,600
Please stop crying, baby.

758
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,880
Can you hold him, Fon?

759
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,880
All right.

760
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,000
Just keep trying different things.

761
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,600
Maybe he's not comfortable,
try rocking him to sleep.

762
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,600
I have to go.

763
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,280
What?

764
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,680
Are you just going to abandon me?

765
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,960
I'm not abandoning you.
Just keep rocking him.

766
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,760
What do I do?

767
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,720
It's all right, baby.

768
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,240
Hey, there.

769
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,200
Here you are, Mai.

770
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,880
Did you get the crib?

771
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,160
I did.

772
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,480
Why are you crying, baby?

773
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,680
What is it?

774
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,880
Is this your baby?

775
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,240
Gosh, Mai.

776
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,520
Are you making a joke
or are you really that naive?

777
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,200
Did you see me go give birth?

778
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,760
I didn't know.
Why did you have to get upset?

779
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,480
I'm not upset.
Things are just a bit chaotic.

780
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,360
The baby won't stop crying.

781
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,240
I already fed him and made him burp.

782
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,520
What should we do?

783
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,760
I don't know.

784
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,320
I'll figure something out.

785
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,400
Can you stay with him?
I really need to use the bathroom.

786
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,120
-Okay.
-I'll be right back.

787
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,360
Are you uncomfortable?

788
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,680
Don't cry.

789
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,520
Don't cry, baby.

790
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,960
There, there.

791
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,480
Mai.

792
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,080
Why are you back so soon?

793
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,640
I know how to get him to stop crying.

794
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,760
How?

795
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,880
We need to find a tap.

796
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,560
He's stopped crying.

797
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,600
He's colicky just like I thought.

798
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,920
How did you know?

799
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,680
I looked it up
when I was using the bathroom.

800
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,280
The sound of hairdryers also helps.

801
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,800
But we don't have a hairdryer here.

802
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,320
Fon.

803
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,200
Yes? What is it?

804
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,480
It's your skirt.

805
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,080
I was in a rush.

806
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,320
-Let's go home.
-Let's go.

807
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,960
-Hey.
-Hey, Nicha.

808
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,320
Are you still working?

809
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,280
I want to get the complaint done today.

810
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,640
You're so hardworking.

811
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,040
Can you lock up for me then?

812
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,320
All right.

813
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,280
Has Mai left?

814
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,480
Well, I suppose he has
lots of work to do at the foundation.

815
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,760
He has his mind set
on becoming a prosecutor.

816
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,840
That takes hard work.

817
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,960
Let's go home.

818
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,000
-See you, Nicha.
-Goodbye.

819
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,600
Let's go to our usual place.

820
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,000
You're close to Mai.

821
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,720
Do you really not know about this?

822
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,000
Know about what?

823
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,600
Mai likes Fon.

824
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,720
Mai likes Fon?

825
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,040
That's right.

826
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,240
He's had a crush on her
since he was a kid.

827
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,320
Fon's the reason he pushed himself
to be where he is today.

828
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,400
He's really determined to win her heart.

829
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,040
Bee.

830
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,920
I'm not here to pester you
or to do anything bad.

831
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,880
Don't worry.

832
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,960
Then what are you doing here?

833
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,920
Just sitting.

834
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,840
So you're just sitting here doing nothing?

835
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,000
That's right.

836
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,880
I'm just hanging out here.

837
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,040
Nothing more.

838
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,760
You're sitting outside my law firm
with no intention of going in.

839
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,120
You won't say anything
unless I speak to you.

840
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,240
Don't you think this is weird?

841
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,080
Well, I just think that

842
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,720
you might want to sit in silence
rather than talk to me.

843
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,240
The reason I'm here

844
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,160
is because I can't help
worrying about you.

845
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,080
But I don't want to annoy you,
so I'm just sitting here doing nothing.

846
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,880
Why are you so worried about me?

847
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,040
I know that you like Mai.

848
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,400
How did you know that?

849
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,360
Is it Mai?

850
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,880
Did Mai tell you?

851
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,720
Yes.

852
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,200
Thank you so much

853
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,320
for coming to the hospital with me.

854
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,040
Don't worry about it.

855
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,120
We're friends, right?

856
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,440
So he knows all along that I like him.

857
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,640
But he doesn't feel the same way, so he…

858
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,120
Both Mai and Fon know.

859
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,760
I'm the only one left in the dark.

860
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,960
I'm such a fool.

861
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,560
It wasn't like that, Nicha.

862
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,200
They kept the truth from you

863
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,240
because they cared for you.

864
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,280
They didn't want to hurt your feelings.

865
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,880
They just thought that

866
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
not telling you was the best way out.

867
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,400
I'm still a fool.

868
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,040
I'm the last one to know the truth.

869
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,000
Listen.

870
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,680
You're not a fool.

871
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,760
If anyone here was a fool,

872
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,920
that'd be me.

873
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,040
Yes.

874
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,720
It's true.

875
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,240
I'm a fool

876
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,720
for sitting here with you

877
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,480
when I know you don't need me.

878
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,760
You're the last one to find out.

879
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,880
But at least now you know the truth.

880
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,880
You should eat this before it gets cold.

881
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,920
It's already cold.

882
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,720
I'm not sure whether you'll like it.

883
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,080
Give it a try.

884
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,680
That's right. One ounce of water.

885
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,080
Then add one tablespoon of milk powder.

886
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,120
Then give the bottle a shake.

887
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,440
Shake it gently so there are no bubbles.

888
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,200
This is good practice for the future.

889
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,240
You're crazy.

890
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,160
INSPECTOR NUT

891
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,960
"Inspector Nut."

892
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,440
Hello, Nut.

893
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,520
How is Jintana Phosuwan related to you?

894
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,440
Why do you ask? What did she do?

895
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,600
She claimed to be your mom.

896
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,480
All right. Goodbye.

897
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,080
What is it?

898
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,240
I need to go do something.

899
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,760
Well, I'll be right back.

900
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,080
You stay with the baby.

901
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,560
I'll be back soon.

902
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,440
SUVARNABHUMI AIRPORT POLICE STATION

903
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,920
Fon.

904
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,840
Have a seat.

905
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,560
How did my mom

906
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,040
end up in police custody?

907
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,640
She got arrested for performing

908
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,240
an illegal abortion.

909
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,880
And where is she now?

910
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,920
She's at the court.

911
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,360
Can you tell me what happened in detail?

912
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,240
This can't be your first client.

913
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,560
-Just tell me the truth.
-I already did.

914
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,280
You said you have a job and a salary.

915
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,800
Where do you work?

916
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,240
Leave the people at my work alone.

917
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,520
They know nothing.

918
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,840
Stop questioning me already.

919
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,200
Just take me to my cell.

920
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,920
Hurry up, I'm getting sleepy.

921
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,440
Come on, Officer.

922
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,360
I know someone with your last name.

923
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,840
So what?

924
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,400
That's not my business.

925
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,440
Just take me to my cell.

926
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,880
Hang on.

927
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,600
Did you mean Fah?

928
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,120
I mean Plaifon. Is it her?

929
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,800
Do you know Fon?

930
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,520
Hey, I'm Fon's mom.

931
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,040
Won't you help me out here?

932
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,640
Then why would you mention her to me?

933
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,440
-Be quiet. Let's go.
-Help me.

934
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,160
Wait.

935
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,400
Just come with us.

936
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,520
Hello, Inspector.

937
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,080
We're at the court now.

938
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,000
We're booking her into jail.

939
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,440
Her bail amount?

940
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,680
Why do you ask?

941
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,960
Are you going to bail her out?

942
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,960
Get your hands off me.

943
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,120
Why are you doing this?

944
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,280
Would you bail her out?

945
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,280
I want to help you

946
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,840
however I can.

947
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,280
I know my mom well.

948
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,240
She would do anything to get out of jail.

949
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,680
You'll be putting yourself
through trouble for nothing.

950
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,440
I've made peace with that.

951
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,040
But I have to do this
because she's your mom.

952
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,760
-Fon.
-I'm so sorry.

953
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,480
I'm really sorry about this.

954
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,760
You don't have to apologize.

955
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,720
You're not responsible
for your mom's crime.

956
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,840
Don't blame yourself.

957
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,400
I know what's what.

958
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,760
Fah.

959
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,760
Mom.

960
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,720
Do you realize how much trouble
you put a good man through?

961
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,600
Don't call me again.

962
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,760
I don't want to talk to you.

963
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,560
Can I help you?

964
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,960
I'm here to see my mom, Jintana.

965
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,360
Can you go get her?

966
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,560
Please help me out.

967
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,200
Well…

968
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,360
Ma'am, you can't go in there.
The club is closed.

969
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,640
I'm begging you, this is important.

970
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,960
What do you need, dear?

971
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,120
Do you want to go inside?

972
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,160
Come with me, then.

973
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,880
But she doesn't work here sir.

974
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,920
So what?

975
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,280
She's with me.

976
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,520
Why can't I take her inside?

977
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,200
Mr. Ruk.

978
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,920
She's not one of our girls, sir.

979
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,000
Please give her some respect.

980
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,600
It has been a while,

981
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,440
Fahnapa.

982
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,800
If it were up to me,
I'd rather you not leave my side.

983
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,160
I was sleeping.

984
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,120
Then you suddenly came
to sleep next to me.

985
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,160
Sleep on the bed tonight

986
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,960
or I'll carry you to bed myself.

987
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,240
If you don't do as I say,

988
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,880
I'll destroy everything
and everyone in your life.

989
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,120
Then I'll destroy you.

990
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,440
Her room isn't that big.

991
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,840
Where could she be?

992
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,720
