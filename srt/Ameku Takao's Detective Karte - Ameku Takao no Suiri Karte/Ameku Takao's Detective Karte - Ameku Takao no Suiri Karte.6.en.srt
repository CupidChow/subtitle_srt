<i>to save her patients.</i>

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,610
The answer to all mysteries lies right in here.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,330
Is there something on my face, Doctor?

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,050
If I had to pinpoint anything, foundation.

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,630
Wakana is asking why you're up in her business, Dr. Takao.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,470
I've heard much about you, Wakana Soma.

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,290
According to Mai,

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,260
- Kotori has been eyeing -
- Doc, please!

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,490
- Why are you up here?
- I mean...

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,370
- Yeah?
- What?

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,310
- Fine, stay.
- Thank you.

15
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,910
In any case, Wakana came to see you for advice, Doc.

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,240
My best friend was murdered.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,780
Yet her body was found, teleported elsewhere.

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,380
Around 900 cases of homicides occur in Japan within a year.

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,400
I only investigate those that use my mind
to investigate the unknown most effectively.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,790
Why, you ask? Because I am a detective.

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,250
You are a doctor.

22
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,920
Diagnosing an illness and unraveling a mystery
are one and the same.

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,730
- No one would agree.
- Listen up.

24
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,360
The notion of "teleportation" won't get me hooked on this case.

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,110
It already has.

26
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,080
This is about the nurse who was murdered
in Ota District one month ago.

[Nurse: Ms. Sakurako Sekihara]

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,170
Where did this rumor about "teleportation" even come from?

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:59,190
An officer who came to investigate the case at her apartment
mentioned it to a friend.

31
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,520
He said the body couldn't have moved, unless it "teleported".

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,320
That's your only basis?

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,850
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:12,640
Sakurako was my classmate,
and best friend from nursing school.

35
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,410
That's why I want to know the truth, no matter what.

36
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:31,880
If the case has yet to be resolved,
this mystery is the key to unraveling it.

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,950
A mystery no one has been able to solve.

38
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,290
And you think I'm not antsy to know?

39
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,190
I want to unravel the mystery of this "teleportation", too!

40
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,110
A famous example of teleportation
occurred in Mexico City, in 1593.

41
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,790
A soldier stationed in Manila
was mysteriously transported to Mexico City.

42
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,330
No talking with your mouth full.
Ms. Mazuru will scold you again.

43
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,890
What is that, anyway?

44
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,800
Drinkable Jelly, Sweet Chicken Curry flavor.

Yum! So sweet...

48
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,820
Right this way.

49
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,580
Sakurako's apartment should be behind this building.

50
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,360
I've never been there myself.

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,610
The friend I mentioned
worked at the same hospital as Sakurako.

52
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,190
Right then, let's go.

53
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,070
That's her attempt at "skipping".
She gets like that, when she's excited.

54
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,260
I will diagnose this mystery myself.

No worries.

60
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,360
And for you.

61
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,980
Coffee?

62
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,810
I don't need this bitter slop.

63
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,170
- Huh?
- I'll be drinking this Beef Curry Jelly, thank you very much.

64
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,590
Sorry about her. You have a wonderful place, by the way.

Thank you.

66
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,550
Though the rent is a bit pricy,
I'm still glad I chose to live on this side.

67
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,420
The side flanking the highway gets far too noisy.

68
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,330
Noisy?

69
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,600
Some hooligans race on the highways late at night
by the hospital.

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,070
Though the police cracked down on them for a month or so,

71
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,220
the noise has begun to pick up again.

72
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,050
Tell us about Sakurako Sekihara.

73
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,080
Could you, please? We would appreciate it.

74
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,850
The incident occurred last month on the 22nd,
right around midnight.

75
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,880
Stop that!

76
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,680
<i>I was drinking a beer on my veranda,
when I heard Ms. Sakurako screaming from the floor below.</i>

77
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,780
<i>The commotion died down as soon as I heard a loud bang.</i>

78
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,570
The police said many other residents heard the ruckus as well.

79
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,600
They didn't conclude she was murdered there
from the noise alone, did they?

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,120
No. Apparently there was quite a bit of blood
found in the room as well.

81
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:06,890
And then they found her body 10 kilometers away, by the harbor.

82
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,130
Were there any individuals who held a grudge against her?

83
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,360
- Well, I do know who killed her.
- What?

84
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,750
You know the culprit?

85
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,510
Rather than a culprit, I know she was dealing with a stalker.

86
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:27,170
She had her head in the clouds even before the incident.
And when her coworkers asked about it...

87
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,430
A man tricked me.

88
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,600
- What? Huh?
- Shush!

89
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,750
He's stalking me. I can't get him off my tail.

90
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,880
She was also the "other woman" of this relationship.

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,620
How are things with that person from the other day?

92
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,890
We've begun dating, but we can't get married.

93
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,170
At least, not with things as they are now.

94
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,920
<i>In other words, the man whom Ms. Sakurako was dating</i>

95
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,340
said he would leave his wife and marry Ms. Sakurako,
but meant none of it.

96
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,790
But when Ms. Sakurako attempted to end things,
the man refused to leave her, and became a stalker.

97
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,500
Did she ever come to you about this, Wakana?

98
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,400
I only knew she was struggling with something.

99
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,860
M-Ma'am?

100
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,980
She hopes to peek into the room below.

101
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,540
We'll be using your veranda.

102
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,070
- But...
- Fujimoto, could I borrow your restroom?

103
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,030
Sure.

104
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,570
Careful not to fall, Dr. Takao.

105
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,440
I'm not going to fall. Don't treat me like a child.

106
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,840
See? I told you!

107
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,890
Dr. Takao!

108
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,520
- See? What did I tell you?
- Are you alright?

109
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,400
Are you Wakana Soma's lover?

110
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,380
What? No.

111
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,920
We were simply classmates at nursing school.

112
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,480
- Good for you, huh?
- What?

113
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,050
This man's been eyeing her.

114
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,240
Hey, don't point me out like that.

115
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,070
Wakana's a great pick.

116
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,770
She's incredibly kind, and not scary like Sekihara.

117
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:17,860
Sekihara was notoriously harsh on the boys at our school.

118
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,180
So when I heard she was in an affair, suddenly it clicked for me.

119
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,490
She was only ever interested in gentlemen, I suppose.

120
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,570
Sorry I had to step away.

121
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,800
Did I return at a bad time?

122
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,050
- No, but Kotori was eyeing -
- Doc! Weren't you interested in the room down below?

123
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,300
Right, I almost forgot!

124
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,080
I want to see the room.

125
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,300
You've never been inside, right?

126
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,580
No. Sakurako never invited anyone over, even close friends.

127
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,790
I'm pretty sure the room has been untouched since the incident.

128
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,400
The owner of this complex is overseas,
and hasn't gotten around to cleaning the place yet.

129
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,310
- Wakana Soma. You head on home.
- Pardon?

130
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,370
I've got a bad feeling...

131
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,780
Kotori and I have an important mission to carry out.

132
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm with the police.

133
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,310
Show us Sakurako Sekihara's room.

134
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,400
Are you truly a member of the police?

135
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,600
Nowadays, young women work on the force as well.

136
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,500
If you still choose to hinder our efforts,
I'll have to report this.

137
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,060
Sir, we would truly appreciate your cooperation.

138
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,230
Please contact me as soon as you've finished.

139
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,800
Yes, sir.

140
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,760
Woah, now <i>that's</i> blood!

141
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,240
We're treading dangerous waters here, Doc.

142
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,190
Looks like the same layout as the room above.

143
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,390
This is most certainly where the crime occurred.

144
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,680
Satisfied? Great, let's go.

145
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,950
- And hurry.
- Calm down.

146
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,080
"Calm down"? You lied, and said we're the police!

147
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,480
I never said that.

148
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,340
- What?
- I said we were "with" the police.

149
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,190
And with how much we've helped them, we can claim that much.

150
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,700
That maintenance guy was the one who jumped to conclusions.

151
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,620
- That logic won't fly!
- Hup.

152
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,660
Don't "hup" me.

153
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,050
Come on, Dr. Takao.

154
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,550
You've seen enough, haven't you?

155
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,360
Hurry it up!

156
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,240
I think I've seen all I need to see.

157
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,780
Great, then let's go.

158
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,330
Fine, fine.

159
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,300
There they are. Those two said they were police, and barged in.

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,260
- It's over.
- You two are coming to the station with us.

161
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,200
Hey, long time no see... not.

162
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,690
'Sup, Sakurai.

163
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,070
You're involved in this case? Thank goodness.

164
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,620
No, I simply got word that a suspicious duo said they knew me.

165
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,010
I left my house for this, you know?

166
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,430
In any case, I'll vouch for these two.

167
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,270
Just let them go, yeah?

168
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,440
We would certainly appreciate it -

169
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,400
Like hell I could do that. You two are suspects.

170
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,200
So you don't trust us.

171
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,620
It's possible you two returned to the crime scene
to dispose of evidence.

172
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,500
I see you're stumped with this case.

173
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,230
Even the worst marksman will hit his target
if he's got the bullets to spare.

174
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:39,720
But that's only if the gun is pointed towards the target at all.

175
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,900
You ought to be giving me all the intel I need to lend a hand.

176
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,850
Sakurai would've been begging with bribes by now.

177
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,250
I bring her cakes.

178
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,190
- Cakes do the trick.
- Huh?

179
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,550
Now fess up, and get that weight off your shoulders.

180
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,530
Tell me all about this "teleportation"!

181
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,310
No shoes on the table.

182
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,950
Sorry about her. She's antsy to learn more about the mystery.

183
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,730
Terada, this case has you stumped, right?

184
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,890
Besides, I'm sure you've heard rumors of Dr. Takao.

185
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,420
Nothing's worse than being stuck on a mystery.

186
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,300
Just don't tell the higher-ups, and you'll be set. Promise.

187
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:35,370
According to our testimonies,
the incident occurred last month on the 22nd past midnight.

188
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,560
<i>We know she hit her head on her Blu-ray player</i>

189
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,060
<i>due to a bloodstain, and the fact that the player was broken.</i>

190
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,920
<i>The wound also matched the one on her head.</i>

191
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,980
Did her head wound cause the large blood spill?

192
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,880
Most likely not, as the head wound wasn't fatal.

193
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,000
Then where was she bleeding from?

194
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,740
We do not know.

195
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,170
Her body was found by the harbor, caught on a tetrapod.

196
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,950
And well... her body was submerged from the chest under.

197
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,890
In other words... how to put it...

198
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,320
She was gobbled up!

199
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,880
Gobbled?

200
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,620
The coastal marine life ate at her body, adding to her injuries.

201
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,860
That's why you couldn't figure out where she bled out from.

202
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,490
She said it all.

203
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,080
So, what do the police think happened to her?

204
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,770
We believe Ms. Sakurako was knocked out,
and then kicked in the abdomen by her assailant.

205
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,190
<i>She was then stabbed in the stomach with a knife of some sort.</i>

206
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,500
<i>The reason we believe she was abused before the stabbing,</i>

207
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,150
<i>was because we identified stomach acids
and food particles within the bloodstain.</i>

208
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,410
The culprit then stuffed the weakened victim
into a bag or suitcase,

209
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,540
and drove her off to the harbor.

210
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,590
The logic checks out.

211
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,210
But wouldn't this easily be resolved
by checking the apartment's security tapes?

212
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,620
What the heck?

213
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,580
According to the manager here,
some kids often play with a soccer ball by the entrance.

214
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,700
They must've broken the camera a while back.

215
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,930
According to our autopsy, Ms. Sakurako was left at the harbor
by 5 AM of the 22nd at the latest.

216
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:20,530
And from this footage, we can see 7 people leaving the building
from midnight to 5 AM.

217
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,210
But none of them are carrying large bags, only smaller purses.

218
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,170
Then how was the body carried out?

219
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,150
That's what we're struggling to figure out.

220
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,520
And "the body" wasn't what was carried out.

221
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,580
She was alive when she reached the harbor.

222
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,460
We have evidence of that from a scratch on the tetrapod.

223
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,940
May I?

224
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,950
Go ahead.

225
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,750
How does this sound?

226
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,500
<i>The culprit stabbed Ms. Sakurako in her room,
and thought they had killed her.</i>

227
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,760
<i>Except, she was still alive.</i>

228
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,490
<i>She desperately left in an attempt to call for help,</i>

229
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,780
<i>only to be caught by the culprit, and brought to the harbor.</i>

230
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,900
We already thought of that possibility.

231
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,820
But there was no blood found outside her apartment.

232
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,560
If Ms. Sakurako left while bleeding out,

233
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,790
her blood would have been found elsewhere.

234
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,820
Ms. Sakurako's clothes were also stained red with blood.

235
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,220
But none of the people who left sported that stain.

236
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,500
We just can't figure out how she was brought to the harbor.

237
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,790
Hence, "teleportation".

238
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:30,120
Have you identified the stalker
Sakurako Sekihara had an affair with?

239
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,080
You even know about the stalker?

240
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,640
Her stalker...

241
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,980
Her stalker was...

242
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,000
- Right.
- Much appreciated.

243
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,930
Her stalker was most likely a doctor
who worked in the same hospital as her.

244
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,080
But after searching her phone,

245
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,610
we only found messages and phone calls
between coworkers and friends,

246
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,920
leading to no such individual.

247
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,320
What we did find, however, was some skin under a fingernail
on Ms. Sakurako's right hand.

248
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,580
The DNA was that of a man.

249
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,070
So you plan on finding the culprit with sheer manpower.

250
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,620
What's so wrong about that?

251
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,670
If you don't have the brains, you're correct to rely on brawn.

252
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,880
But me? I can absolutely solve this case, no questions asked.

253
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,970
- Kotori.
- Yes?

254
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,980
We're visiting the harbor Sakurako Sekihara was taken to.

255
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,580
Have you figured something out?

256
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,570
Dr. Takao?

257
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,890
[Head injury]

258
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,280
[Large amount of blood loss]

259
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,390
[Stomach acid]
[Remains of food]

260
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,080
[No bloodstain found outside the victim's room]

261
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,300
[Apartment]

262
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,750
[Harbor]

263
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,050
Have you possibly caught on to something already?

264
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,650
I have a theory.

265
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,440
Now I'll take evidence I have, and deduce what really happened.

266
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,800
It's time I put my brain into overdrive.

267
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,020
Dr. Kotori.

268
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,030
I heard the news. Wakana got you involved in something again?

269
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,610
And I've been at Dr. Takao's whims ever since.

270
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,390
You'll entertain her despite your grievances?

271
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,600
You know how she gets when she's excited.
It's dangerous to just leave her be.

272
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,140
See what I mean?

273
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,190
Yes, I see the spark indeed.

274
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,140
You truly understand Takao to her core, Dr. Takanashi.

275
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,880
I am greatly looking forward to your future together.

276
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,100
You and your odd agenda, again?

277
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,380
Give up on Wakana.

278
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,340
What is your end goal here?

279
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,500
Dr. Takanashi. If you are serious about her, you must verbalize.

280
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,970
Women want to hear words above all else.

281
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,480
Words can shake the heart. Never forget this.

282
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,230
Excuse me, Dr. Takanashi.

283
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,570
Oh!

284
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,490
Could I have a moment of your time?

285
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,090
Of course.

286
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,010
I hear you've gathered quite a bit of intel.

287
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,390
Don't worry, Dr. Takao will have this figured out in no time.

288
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:38,200
And when all this is resolved...
would you like to join me for dinner?

289
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,580
What?

290
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,500
Sorry, forget that.

291
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:58,470
- Yes?
- <i>Kotori, come to my place. I've got business to discuss.</i>

292
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,820
Understood.

293
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,100
Sorry, I've been summoned.

294
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,950
I'll be right over.

295
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,120
Dinner... sounds lovely.

296
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,300
Please invite me again

297
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,420
once this case is over.
[Takao Ameku]

298
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,630
[Dinner for a first date! Casual to luxury dining]

299
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,510
- What are you grinning at?
- Nothing.

300
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,820
Be giddy for dinner with Wakana Soma all you want,

301
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,390
but she sure won't entertain a man with such obvious motives.

302
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,110
You were listening in?

303
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,980
Either way, your dinner hinges on our findings tonight.

304
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,240
- What?
- We're going to the crime scene to prove my theory.

305
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,030
We already did last night.

306
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,900
The other crime scene, that is.

307
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,870
What the...

308
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,290
What are you doing?

309
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,260
Dr. Takao. Hello?

310
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,140
This is dangerous.

311
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,320
Dr. Takao, watch yourself.

312
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,910
I found it!

313
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,490
Found what? You're acting like a dog.

314
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,410
How could you say that to a lady?

315
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,890
A "lady" doesn't sniff the ground on all fours.

316
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,240
I was investigating the ground, not sniffing it.

317
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,900
In any case, this is the second crime scene.

318
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,070
Huh?

319
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,680
Take a look for yourself.

320
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,140
Look where?

321
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,410
Closer.

322
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,590
A drop had coagulated and remained.

323
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,280
Is this...

324
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,340
Blood. Specifically from Sakurako Sekihara.

325
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,760
- How is that...
- All right!

326
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,420
Now we catch the culprits who dragged her to the harbor.

327
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,550
What?

328
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,280
That isn't a skip, Doc...

329
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,970
Chicken Curry Jelly, again?

330
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,820
No.

331
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,240
This one is mackerel-flavored.

332
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,440
Mackerel?

333
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,600
How much longer do we have to sit here?

334
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,240
Quiet.

335
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,220
The culprit's headed our way.

336
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,190
It's those racing idiots.

337
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,330
The nurse from yesterday mentioned them, remember?

338
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,940
<i>Some hooligans race on the highways late at night.</i>

339
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,970
<i>The noise has begun to pick up again.</i>

340
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,410
If you want that date with Wakana Soma,
don't lose sight of them.

341
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,940
Now go!

342
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,540
Are we really in the right place?

343
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,620
Yes. I saw one of the red cars pull in here.

344
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,950
- We're sneaking in for a closer look.
- Right.

345
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,220
What are you doing?

346
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,210
This stuff's good!

347
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,190
- Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.
- Right.

348
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,870
Doc?

349
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,750
What are you doing?

350
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,450
Not this one.

351
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,710
What are you looking for?

352
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,180
- Found it!
- Quiet!

353
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,580
What if they catch on?

354
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,250
This is it. Look.

355
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,050
Shine the light here.

356
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,550
- Is this...
- A luminol reaction.

357
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:47,100
I'm almost certain the blood is from Sakurako Sekihara.

358
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,690
Hey. Who the hell are you two?

359
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,820
- Oh, erm...
- We've been spotted.

360
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,640
A real shame.

361
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,140
Were you messing with my car?

362
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,780
We were admiring it, is all.

363
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,450
- No touching!
- Sorry, sir.

364
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,980
So you're the one who tossed Sakurako Sekihara into the sea.

365
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,720
The hell are you talking about?

366
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,390
Drop the futile charade.

367
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,750
You forgot to wipe some blood off your bumper, you know?

368
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,640
- Kotori.
- R-Right.

369
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,080
Yes?

370
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,050
You said you did karate, right?

371
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,350
That, I did.

372
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,370
- Wait, you don't mean...
- Go at it.

373
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,810
- Kill them.
- Kill 'em both!

374
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,540
Let's really not...

375
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,990
This counts as self-defense, all right?

376
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,550
Time to get serious.

377
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,620
Don't let him run! Go after him!

378
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,340
R-Right!

379
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,810
They got here fast.

380
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,230
- How?
- I sent them a text.

381
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,410
You better have a good reason for calling us out here
in the dead of night.

382
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:29,140
But of course. It's the moment you've all been waiting for -
the mystery-solving part.

383
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,550
Were we waiting?

384
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,600
- No.
- Right, thought so.

385
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,270
For starters, the police missed a very crucial detail of this case.

386
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,690
What detail?

387
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,120
There wasn't just one crime scene.

388
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,190
The first crime scene, as you all know,
was Sakurako Sekihara's room.

389
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,020
She was assaulted at midnight on the 22nd,

390
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,970
<i>and lost consciousness after hitting her head.</i>

391
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,610
<i>The culprit saw the unmoving Sakurako Sekihara,</i>

392
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,320
<i>and, perhaps out of fear, ran out without doing a thing.</i>

393
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,900
Then why did the victim bleed out?

394
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,510
- Kotori.
- Yes?

395
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,490
- Why would that be?
- Pardon?

396
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,120
Diagnose her condition while I explain.

397
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,490
"Diagnose"?

398
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:22,250
She lost the blood when she regained consciousness,
around 2 AM or so.

399
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,050
<i>As a nurse,</i>

400
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,410
<i>she knew she required treatment right away.</i>

401
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:33,070
<i>And the hospital across the street was her best chance at survival.</i>

402
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,560
In other words, one of the individuals
caught on camera leaving the apartment

403
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,840
was Sakurako Sekihara herself.

404
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,670
If she left bleeding out,
there should have been blood everywhere.

405
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,980
And none of the individuals who left
were bloodied in the slightest.

406
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,340
That's because she wasn't "bleeding out".

407
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,240
The blood she lost had been pooled in a bag.

408
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,960
- In a bag?
- The reason why Sakurako Sekihara lost blood

409
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,080
was because of her head injury.

410
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,110
- Her head?
- The acid.

411
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,640
Correct.

412
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,620
Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions
when dissolved in a solution.

413
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,270
[Acid]

414
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:21,810
When Sakurako Sekihara hit her head,
she ended up suffering from a Cushing ulcer.

415
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,890
<i>A stomach ulcer often associated with head injuries,
brain tumors, or neurosurgeries.</i>

416
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,320
<i>Traumatic head injuries cause an increase in intracranial pressure.</i>

417
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,130
<i>This then overstimulates the vagus nerve,</i>

418
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,640
<i>which releases gastric acid, thus harming the gastric mucosa​.</i>

419
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,980
<i>Damage to the central nervous system
weighs heavily on our bodies,</i>

420
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,250
<i>causing our adrenal cortex to release plenty of stress hormones.</i>

421
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,990
<i>As a result, ulcers are developed in rapid time.</i>

422
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,270
Then Ms. Sakurako...

423
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:55,030
She regurgitated the blood
which was pooling from the ulcer in her stomach.

424
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,700
This also explains the stomach acid found in that bloodstain.

425
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,510
- So it went out, this way?
- Sounds like it.

426
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:08,670
Now the second crime scene
was at the crosswalk before the hospital.

427
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,300
You sped in with your car, and hit Sakurako Sekihara.

428
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,080
I slammed the brakes.

429
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,990
She only grazed my bumper, nothing more.

430
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,170
- Right?
- Y-Yeah.

431
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,400
He makes a point. Nothing was broken bone-wise.

432
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,320
And she was certainly alive when she reached the harbor.

433
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,620
She was alive at the harbor?

434
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,530
I'm sure she really only suffered from a scrape.

435
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:33,260
But Sakurako Sekihara still had a pool of blood in her stomach.

436
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,510
When you hit her, she regurgitated more of that blood.

437
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,850
The evidence is on this man's bumper, there.

438
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,930
- Kotori.
- Yes, ma'am.

439
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,550
Right here.

440
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,860
The impact of the accident
and her blood loss left her unable to move.

441
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,270
<i>Assuming he had killed her, he and his buddies
abandoned Sakurako Sekihara at an empty harbor.</i>

442
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,280
<i>If they had brought her to the hospital,
she could've been saved.</i>

443
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,630
<i>But they instead chose to cover up the accident, like cowards.</i>

444
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,370
This answers the "teleportation" trick.

445
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,890
That's all for my mystery debunking.

446
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,280
Kotori. We're heading back.

447
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,970
Hey. Then who assaulted the victim at her apartment?

448
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,810
That's your area of expertise. Figure it out yourselves.

449
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,790
And I better get my appropriate payment, pronto.

450
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,810
I'd say ten cakes from "Afternoon" will suffice.

451
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,590
Whole?

452
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,810
Or slices?

453
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,200
Here's to another case closed. Isn't that right?

454
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,910
Dr. Takao?

455
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,100
[One week later]

456
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,600
Someone looks happy.

457
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,910
Woah! What brings you here?

458
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,600
I came to get a patient.

459
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,880
You look eager to clock out. Why's that?

460
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,310
No reason.

461
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,590
Perhaps you're having dinner with Wakana tonight?

462
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,980
I see. No wonder.

463
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,290
No wonder, what?

464
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,570
Nothing. Just talking to myself.

465
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,920
- Huh?
- You two enjoy yourselves tonight.

466
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,200
What?

467
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,080
Now you've got me curious.

468
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,020
[Takao Ameku: Stop by before you leave for the day.]

469
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,130
Agh...

470
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,910
Dr. Takao, I really don't have the time today.

471
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,680
I can't accompany you anywhere -

472
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,400
This is about Sakurako Sekihara's case.

473
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,980
Though the police are looking into men
who had any relation to her,

474
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,080
they haven't managed to catch her assailant yet.

475
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,460
But they have his DNA. He will eventually be -

476
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,250
DNA never tells the whole truth about a person.

477
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,710
The police will be unable to solve this case.

478
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,340
And so am I.

479
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,890
Kotori, this is a case for you to unravel.

480
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:34,970
You're the only one who can.

481
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,750
You'll be late to dinner with Wakana Soma.

482
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,220
Once you've figured it out, report back to me.

483
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,870
I'll be here, no matter how late it is.

484
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,050
May I clear your plates, ma'am?

485
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,540
Yes please, thank you.

486
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,610
And yours, sir?

487
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:03,280
Thank you again for inviting me to dinner tonight.

488
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,040
It was the perfect opportunity to get some things off my chest.

489
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:18,000
<i>You're the only one who can unravel this case.</i>

490
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,250
Dr. Takanashi?

491
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,340
<i>DNA never tells the whole truth about a person.</i>

492
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,260
Dr. Takanashi?

493
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,940
No, impossible...

494
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,390
Were you the lover?

495
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,670
Pardon?

496
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,420
Thinking back, there are several things I find suspicious.

497
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:49,400
You were never interested in <i>who</i> murdered your best friend.

498
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,130
Rather, you wanted to know what happened to Ms. Sakurako.

499
00:32:53,130 --> 00:33:00,570
And though you claim to have never visited that apartment,
you already knew where the restroom was.

500
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:07,840
For dessert, we have an ice cream using salt from the Alps,
with a cookie.

501
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,800
Enjoy.

502
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,960
This is quite salty.

503
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,390
Your portion will melt, Dr. Takanashi.

504
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,490
Fine. Let's say I was Sakurako's lover.

505
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:37,370
But how would that explain the stalker,
and the man who tricked her?

506
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,790
Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS).

507
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,070
It was all you.

508
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,880
Wakana, you are...

509
00:33:52,890 --> 00:34:00,440
<i>AIS. A rare condition where the body
doesn't react to male sex hormones, or androgen.</i>

510
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,510
<i>An individual with Complete AIS has female external genitals,</i>

511
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,840
<i>but remains genetically male.</i>

512
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,090
<i>Thus, they have no ovary nor uterus, but instead have testicles.</i>

513
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,620
I found out in my third year of middle school.

514
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:33,040
My mother, worried that my first menstruation hadn't occurred,
took me to a hospital.

515
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,600
That's when I was diagnosed with AIS.

516
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,350
My parents would say my DNA didn't define me.

517
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,350
They said I was a full-fledged woman.

518
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,800
And I myself had been living as a woman all my life.

519
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:58,880
But every person I have come to love, has been a woman.

520
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,380
Externally, I am female. Yet it seems my nature is that of a man.

521
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,160
This dilemma has eaten away at my very being.

522
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:18,840
But then one day, I met Sakurako. She changed my life.

523
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:27,050
I remember one dinner we shared together,
right at this very table.

524
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,520
Cute, right?

525
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,980
Yeah, it's adorable.

526
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,590
What's the occasion?

527
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,630
I want you to marry me.

528
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,580
I know that isn't legally possible in Japan, not yet.

529
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,430
Even so, I want to stay with you forever, Wakana.

530
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,270
<i>I was over the moon.</i>

531
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:02,380
<i>And I knew I had to tell her about my body
before I gave her an answer.</i>

532
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,230
I was certain she would accept me.

533
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,380
Sakurako?

534
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,600
- Sakurako.
- Don't touch me.

535
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,270
You're a man?

536
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,620
I never want to see you again.

537
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,780
Get out.

538
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,560
Get out.

539
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,130
<i>But I couldn't move on.</i>

540
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,200
Sakurako was all that I had.

541
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,430
She wouldn't answer any of my calls.

542
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,300
That's why, that night...

543
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,140
Why are you here?

544
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,550
Please, just listen to me.

545
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,470
Don't touch me.

546
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,790
- Please!
- Don't!

547
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,570
- Please!
- Get out!

548
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,500
- Listen to me!
- Leave!

549
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,580
Get out!

550
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,020
<i>I was terrified.</i>

551
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,340
<i>And she had rejected me so harshly.</i>

552
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,040
<i>I felt so overwhelmed, and confused.</i>

553
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,880
So I ran back to my own place.

554
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,430
Thank you for listening.

555
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,240
You are wrong.

556
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,640
What?

557
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,260
You said your nature was that of a man.

558
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,600
But those diagnosed with Complete AIS

559
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,630
usually identify as a woman, and live as a woman all their lives.

560
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,140
But I'm different.

561
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:16,600
Because I've only ever fallen in love with women.

562
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,500
You wish to live as a woman, do you not?

563
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,730
Yes, I do.

564
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,430
I've never thought of myself as a man.

565
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,640
I've always considered myself a woman.

566
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,130
I've lived my whole life as a woman.

567
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,150
And I wanted to believe I was one, too.

568
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,920
Then you are a woman.

569
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,430
How? How can you claim I am a woman?

570
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,150
How can you be so certain?

571
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:55,230
Because you have your charms as a woman.

572
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:04,090
I felt attracted to you, a woman.

573
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:15,590
You simply fell in love with women, as a woman yourself.

574
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,250
I will turn myself in to the police.

575
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:44,160
And if I am allowed another chance,
after I have atoned for my crimes...

576
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,030
I would like to begin a new life for myself.

577
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,820
One where I can stay true to who I am.

578
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,260
I am glad to have crossed paths with you, Dr. Takanashi.

579
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,850
As am I.

580
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,880
Farewell.

581
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,030
Did you resolve the case?

582
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,580
Yes.

583
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,850
Kotori. Come here.

584
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,040
Got any complaints to make?

585
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,630
No? Good.

586
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,400
W-What are you doing?

587
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,910
Really, what's all this about?

588
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,220
I knew you would be down once you solved this case.

589
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,790
So I asked Mai how to cheer you up.

590
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,150
This was what she gave me.

591
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,480
<i>One. Listen to any complaints Dr. Kotori has.</i>

592
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,980
<i>Two. Softly pat Dr. Kotori's head.</i>

593
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,760
<i>Three. Stare into Dr. Kotori's eyes for 10 seconds.</i>

594
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,630
<i>Four. Close your eyes, and tilt your chin up.</i>

595
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,380
<i>As for what happens next, go with his flow.</i>

596
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,260
<i>Dr. Kotori will be cheered up, in more ways than one!</i>

597
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:47,170
Don't really get it, but it seems like it worked.

598
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,780
Great.

599
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,230
Dr. Takao.

600
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,490
I'm in the mood for a drink.

601
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,680
Care to join me?

602
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,760
I welcome merry drinking anytime.

603
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,700
Come on up, Kotori.

604
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,810
Does curry work as a snack?

605
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,590
Curry? Absolutely not.

606
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:49,860
Takao... I'll leave finding the culprit to you.
