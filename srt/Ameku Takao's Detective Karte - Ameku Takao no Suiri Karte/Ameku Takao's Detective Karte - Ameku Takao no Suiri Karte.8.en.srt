1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,620
Have her sent to us right away.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,430
We have one operation room open.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,800
Our anesthesiologists are on standby.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,380
She's suffering from intestinal ischemia.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,160
We don't have enough surgeons to deal with an emergency.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,050
Bring her to an operation room.

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,970
I will operate on this patient myself.

8
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,460
[Operating]

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,510
Anastomosis all clear.

10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,020
Now to clean and close the incision.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,130
Takanashi, I'll handle it from here.

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,510
Stitching is an assistant's job.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,780
This patient is an old friend of mine.

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,660
I will handle her operation to the end.

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,200
Understood. I wish you the best, sir.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,080
Takanashi.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,590
- Yes, sir?
- I am once again reminded of your skill as a surgeon.

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,120
Care to join the department for good?

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,850
Sir, I've come to a realization after assisting our first-aid squad

20
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,780
while working for the I.P. Department.

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,040
Surgeons and physicians alike strive to save their patients' lives.

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,560
In which case, I hope to become a physician
who treats my patients head on.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,500
How noble.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,620
But I do wonder if that's possible
with the current state of the I.P. Department.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,730
- Strike!
- Nice!

26
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,150
You traitor!

27
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,660
- Dr. Takao?
- Takao?

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,420
- What brings you here?
- That's what I wanna know!

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,330
I heard you assisted my uncle for a surgery.

30
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,600
- You came all this way, for that?
- You weren't answering my calls!

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,670
- But, well...
- Takao!

32
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,170
No interrupting our match.

33
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,450
- But, sis...
- Come on, Dr. Takao.

34
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,440
Kotori's a traitor!

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,840
- Three outs, change.
- Kotori...

36
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,630
Talk on the sidelines.

37
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,180
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hit a good one, Dr. Fujita.

38
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,600
That man wants to shut down the department. He's our enemy!

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,860
They didn't have enough surgeons around.

40
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,990
That's no reason for <i>you</i> to help.

41
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,080
- Don't get mad at me...
- You dunce!

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,800
Assist the director when it's not even your job,

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,130
and of course she'd assume
you're returning to the surgery department!

44
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,360
- I have no...
- My uncle didn't try to win you over, did he?

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,040
- No.
- You're averting your gaze!

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,310
- You feel guilty about something.
- No.

47
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,250
I may struggle to read people, but even I'm not that dense.

48
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,970
I can read your one-track mind like it's an open book.

49
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,080
- Hey, rude!
- Now, now. Calm down, you two.

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,280
Save the marriage quarrel for -

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,080
- "Marriage"?
- Oh my god, you two are <i>so</i> in sync!

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,750
- Ow, ouch...
- Are you alright?

53
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,760
- It's just my back.
- Take it easy. The hospital still needs you, Doc.

54
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,690
But we can't sub anyone in.

55
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,560
We barely have enough players as is today!

56
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,840
- Me?
- Help Dr. Fujita off the field.

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,390
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,910
Can you stand?

59
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,170
Pinch-hitter, Takao Ameku!

60
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,260
- What?
- Huh?

No need to swing carelessly, got it?

62
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,430
Right on, sis.

63
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,730
And take off your sunglasses.

64
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,930
Thank goodness we had her sign up on paper.

65

Play ball!

66
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,060
Strike!

67

Don't swing!

68

Keep your stance tucked in.

69
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,470
No worries, give it another go.

70

71

75
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,790

76
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,420
Nice hit!

77

Doc, it's over.

85
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,750
I think you made the wrong choice with her, Ms. Mazuru.

86

Ow, ow, ouch...

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,160

88

Yes, ma'am.

94
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,520
Why am I not allowed up?

95
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,740
Because I still doubt where your allegiances lie.

96
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,590

[Patient: Natsuko Kuraishi]

102
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
- Huh?
- What's up?

103
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,660
The patient we operated on, Ms. Kuraishi,
has taken a turn for the worse.

104
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,780
Test her blood cultures, and prescribe her more antibiotics.

105
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,240
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Yesterday afternoon,</i>

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,170
<i>she broke out into a 40 degree Celsius fever,
with an increased heart rate.</i>

107
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,830
<i>She also began to suffer from chest pains.</i>

108
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,440
Though they prescribed her more antibiotics,
her condition only got worse.

109
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,470
Was it a surgical mistake?

110
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,190
No. The Director operated on her exactly the way he ought to.

111
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,110
An operation's success doesn't solely rely on skill.

112
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,540
- My arms next.
- Yes, ma'am.

113
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,830
An operation causes great harm to the patient's body.

114
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,840
And a surgeon must support those patients all through recovery.

115
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,040
- Am I wrong?
- No, ma'am.

116
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,100
Bacteria most likely entered her blood stream
from the incision made in her digestive tract.

117
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,570
It's highly possible she has a case of blood poisoning.

118
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,990
But we made sure to inject her with antibiotics post-operation.

119
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,710
With something standard, I bet.

120
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,950
It's not like you considered the possibility of an infection
and adjusted her dosage accordingly.

121
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,580
- Am I wrong?
- No, ma'am.

122
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,670
"Am I wrong? No, ma'am."

123
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,520
- You're getting bashed.
- Uncle really ought to use that brain of his.

124
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,230
Will the patient be alright?

125
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,430
I bet my uncle is injecting her with a broad-spectrum antibiotic,

126
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,380
and monitoring her health as we speak.

127
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,120
Oh, she'll recover alright.
He won't let a pawn of his die for nothing.

128

- A pawn?
- According to my sister, Natsuko Kuraishi has ties to my uncle.

129
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,630
They were probably cooking up some evil scheme together.

130
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,540
The horror.

174
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,310
Natsuko Kuraishi called for the police herself.

175
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,390
She claims you're trying to kill her.

176
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,520
You don't look surprised.

177
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,830
- Care to explain why?
- Yeah, explain!

178
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,860
If you have no warrant, you have no right to disrupt my actions
as this hospital's director.

179
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,880
My direct boss and Ms. Kuraishi were close acquaintances.

180
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,540
That's why she called us.

181
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,880
I will investigate your patient.

182
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:05,290
If your visit aggravates the patient to the point of death,
can I hold you accountable?

183
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,340
Then how about a compromise?

184
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,310
We will have Dr. Takanashi be our witness.

185
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,240
He is the perfect intermediary,
who understands both our stances well.

186
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,020
You understand my uncle?

187
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,930
- No?
- Quiet.

188
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,020
How about it, sir?

189
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,580
I only asked Dr. Takanashi to stand as witness, did I not?

190
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,840
Kotori works for the Department of Investigative Pathology.

191
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,520
Which means he's my property.

192
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,730
- Not true.
- In other words, I can join.

193
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,580
- No complaint about that, right?
- I knew this would happen...

194
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,020
Come on in.

195
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,000
Afternoon, sir.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,230
Hey, what's all this?

197
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,310
Now, now. Indoor voices.

198
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,950
- But...
- No need to get agitated. Your director will explain.

199
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,150
The police want to hear a word or two from Ms. Kuraishi.

200
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,540
The police?

201
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,620
And why is the I.P. Department with them?

202
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,280
- You are?
- Her secretary, Shioya.

203
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,070
- Then you know Ms. Kuraishi contacted us.
- Pardon?

204
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,490
She didn't inform you?

205
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,200
Then I suppose we'll have to ask Ms. Kuraishi herself.

206
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,590
Ms. Kuraishi, please wake up.

207
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,030
Stop! The patient is in no condition to speak.

208
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,850
Is that true?

209
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,010
She has not gone into septic shock.

210
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,340
- I believe she can speak briefly.
- Enough!

211
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,970
But do not agitate her.

212
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,370
- Agreed.
- Understood.

213
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,810
Ms. Kuraishi. Please, wake up.

214
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,530
- Good morning, ma'am. I am -
- Who are you? Why are you in my home?

215
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,630
Ma'am, this is the hospital.

216
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,450
Who has locked me away here?

217
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,770
Ma'am, be at ease. I am with the police.

218
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,930
The police?

219
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,400
Have you come to arrest me?

220
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,930
Ma'am, do you not remember? You called for our help.

221
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,840
You said a man was after your life.

222
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,470
Specifically, Director Owashi here.

223
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,990
- What sort of absurd...
- Yes. It's him.

224
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,380
He wants to kill me, to keep my mouth shut!

225
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,590
Keep your mouth shut, about what?

226
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,050
He forced a hospital to close down.

227
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,020
That man used my influence to prevent another hospital

228
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,240
from being built in this area.

229
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,910
Those nosy journalists. That's why he wants to kill me.

230
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,380
- Please, help me!
- Easy, ma'am.

231
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,690
Everything will be alright.

232
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,780
Mr. Sakurai, stop.

233
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,880
- Just a bit more.
- Allow me.

234
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,840
- Ma'am, it's okay.
- You promised, did you not?

235
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,110
- Now follow through, please.
- Save me...

236
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,960
Natsuko Kuraishi is likely suffering from postoperative delirium.

237
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,040
Postoperative delirium?

238
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,000
It's triggered by either anesthesia, or the operation itself.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,400
The condition lasts one to several days following the operation.

240
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,350
Symptoms include confusion, hallucinations, and delusions.

241
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,940
Her health has taken a turn for the worse,

242
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,190
no thanks to someone's lack of aftercare.

243
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,680
Yet you have the gall to act like a know-it-all? Despicable.

244
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,570
Dr. Takao, pause!

245
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,530
You're letting your personal emotions take over.

246
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,680
In other words, she was blabbering nonsense
due to her confused state?

247
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,910
I suspected as much,
as soon as she started going on about murder.

248
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,760
Now hold on.

249
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,480
I don't think it was all nonsense.

250
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,360
The thing about shutting down a hospital
had some plausibility to it.

251
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,700
Building a new medical facility
would require permission from the prefectural governor.

252
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,070
And Ms. Kuraishi, a cabinet member who has those connections,

253
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:10,210
could very well convince the governor
to do away with those plans.

254
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,850
Your thoughts, Dr. Takao Ameku?

255
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,460
I dislike my uncle.

256
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,560
No, I despise him.

257
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,810
If you asked for a reason why, I've got 108 of them.

258
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,310
- 108?
- And I'll list them off now.

259
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:29,600
Doc, I don't think that was what Mr. Sakurai was asking about...

260
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,040
- Right.
- Fine. If I had to put personal feelings aside,

261
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,670
- I have 3 reasons.
- 108, to a mere 3?

262
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,940
One. My uncle is a master proprietor.

263
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,480
Two. He has connections with many medical institutes.

264
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,990
Three. He has the influence
to negotiate his ideal form of health care.

265
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,250
It is an undeniable truth
that he excels in all three of these aspects.

266
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,890
Whether he took illegal action
is something I can't determine now.

267
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,120
Come on in.

268
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,320

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,120
- Hello.
- What is it now?

270
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,490
Some journalists wish to interview you regarding Ms. Kuraishi.

271
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,290
Tell them to begone.

272
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,030
You too, Mr. Detective.

273
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,040
I will continue to investigate this case, Director Owashi.

274
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,760
Please contact our team once Ms. Kuraishi is conscious again.

275
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,990
I will be heading to Miyagi tomorrow.

276
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:38,130
The director used to work at a clinic there,
out of hate for our family's hospital.

277
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,140
He only returned once he turned 40.

278
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,770
No one knows the exact reason why.

279
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,970
However, Ms. Kuraishi also hails from the Miyagi prefecture.

280
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,500
If we look into their past,
we may be able to uncover their true motives.

281
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,740
- Kotori, go with her.
- What?

282
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,840

283

284
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,020
We could use a break.

285
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,290

[Sea Squirt's Snacking Kelp]

289
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,540
Have Dr. Takao and the director always been on bad terms?

290
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,040
The director is a rationalist.

291
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,320
Takao is similar in that way.

292
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,060
But their personal philosophies as doctors lie on different paths.

293
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,590
Different paths, is it.

294
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,730
What path will you take, Dr. Takanashi?

295
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,420
- Pardon?
- The director approached you with an offer, did he not?

296
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,270
So you knew.

297
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,150
Sending me to the United Kingdom?

298
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,470
Indeed. Unlike Japan,

299
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,700
the UK is renowned worldwide for its medical facilities.

300
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,380
Improving your skills as a diagnostician
would reduce the strain on your fellow hospital staff,

301
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,690
and allow patients to receive the proper care they deserve.

302
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,780
If you are serious about becoming a diagnostician,
I think you ought to study with real experts.

303
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,080
I want you to stay for Takao's sake.

304
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,610
That is my wish as her sister.

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:25,340
But if I am thinking of your future,

306
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,480
then I also believe you should go to the United Kingdom.

Owashi Ameku's an old acquaintance of mine.

I've heard the rumors. So he's become a shrewd proprietor, eh?

I can almost imagine his cool demeanor,
with a forehead covered in wrinkles.

328
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,460
He wasn't always such a schemer though.

329
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:49,160
In fact, he was a doctor who would put everything on the line
to save the patient in front of him.

Her blood culture tests have returned.

342
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,200
Sir, she's negative. No bacteria was found.

343
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,590
So blood poisoning isn't hindering her antibiotics.

344
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,890
Her scans show no issue with her stitching as well.

345
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,830
What is causing this fever, and her inflammation levels to spike?

346
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,560
I am equally at a loss, sir.

347
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,160
Come in, the door's not locked.

348
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,570
What do <i>you</i> want?

349
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,780
H-Hey. Say something.

350
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,430
And back off.

351
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,470
[Patient: Natsuko Kuraishi]

352
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,470
This is certainly a mysterious case.

353
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,260
I request the Department of Investigative Pathology
to look into it.

354
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,240
I'd love to take on the request,
and I don't want the patient to suffer either.

355
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:12,690
However. If you're making a request,
you could at least sound apologetic for your past actions.

356
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,640
<i>I believe we ought to dismiss Mazuru Ameku.</i>

357
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,770
<i>I plan on shutting down the I.P. Department for good.</i>

358
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,670
Let's say... you prostrate yourself to me?

359
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,750
I don't make the request lightly. In Indian Buddhism,

360
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,080
prostration was the ultimate form of respect. In the "Wajinden" -

361
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,520
You wouldn't need such a cheap reward.

362
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,110
If you refuse to prostrate, a deep bow would do.

363
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,470
Now apologize. Apologize!

364
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:47,160
Taking on requests of this manner
is a given for this department, no?

365
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,670
If our clinics were open.

366
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,970
But right now, you're coming to me after hours.

367
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,030
What, can't even give me a bow?

368
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,990
Given Natsuko Kuraishi's condition,
I know you want to diagnose and treat her right away.

369
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,450
That's why I need an apology.

370
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,940
Not bad.

371
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,750
But you still have a ways to go with negotiating.

372
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,740
Quit stalling your loss. Now bow to me.

373
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,780
Prostrate yourself.

374
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,640
Think. If something were to happen to Ms. Kuraishi,
the police would suspect me.

375
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,650
Worst comes to worst, I may be forced to resign as director

376
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,650
to keep the hospital up and running.

377
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,630
And with you gone, this department will truly thrive...

378
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:44,240
You are the vice director. The mantle would be passed to you.

379
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,910
- Back off.
- You'll have to meet with politicians and medical leaders.

380
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,570
You'll also have to attend the annual meeting
discussing our ten billion yen revenue.

381
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,520
Hey...

382
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,230
- Not to mention...
- Not to mention, what?

383
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,030
You'd have to deal with our manager, Mazuru, on the daily.

384
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,430
Mazuru, on the daily?

385
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,040
I leave the hospital in your hands, next director.

386
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,650
I have returned, Doc.

387
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,850
Here are some souvenirs...

388
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,990
Oh gods.

389
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,940
Kotori, we're diagnosing Natsuko Kuraishi.

390
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,560
Her condition's taken a turn.

391
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,390
We have to diagnose her,

392
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,690
and give her the proper treatment, pronto!

393
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
Hurry, without haste.

394
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,390
Hurry, without haste.

395
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,260
Hurry, without haste.

396
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,130
How in the world are we supposed to diagnose her now?

397
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,250
Maybe she was taken to an ICU?

398
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,630
Dr. Takao?

399
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,160
No.

400
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,680
Natsuko Kuraishi escaped.

401
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,380
She still thinks her life is in danger.

402
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,170
Ask anyone who has the time to help.

403
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,880
Ms. Kuraishi has...

404
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,610
Understood.

405
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,620
Ms. Kuraishi? Are you there?

406
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,170
Ms. Kuraishi has disappeared.

407
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,120
- Keep things going while I search for her.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,270
Excuse me.

409
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,200
Ms. Kuraishi?

410
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,870
- Ms. Onodera.
- Dr. Konoike!

411
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,960
She's nowhere in the hospital.

412
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,330
The police are aiding with the search, but she hasn't been found.

413
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,000
Her condition is near critical. We must find her immediately.

414
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,970
She hasn't returned to her office, nor her home.

415
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,130
Her phone and wallet are also untouched.

416
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,690
We searched the entire premise,
but she was nowhere to be found.

417
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,630
She may have left hospital grounds.

418
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:04,770
We're better off narrowing down where she could have gone.

419
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,650
Let me handle this.

420
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,560
- Can you?
- I'm not giving up before I try.

421
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,320
This will rely on getting into Ms. Kuraishi's headspace,
and really thinking like her.

422
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,560
Getting into someone else's headspace, huh?
Now that's something I can't do.

423
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,600
My name is Natsuko Kuraishi.

424
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,820
- Sir -
- Don't stop him.

425
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,250
My name is Natsuko Kuraishi.

426
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,240
<i>Stay here, and I will be killed.</i>

427
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,350
<i>I must escape while I still can.</i>

428
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,600
<i>Don't panic. If I remove the IV as is, an alarm will sound.</i>

429
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,520
<i>Yes, I'll turn off the power first. Now it won't alert the staff.</i>

430
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,030
Ouch!

431
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,740
<i>Now to sneak out without being found.</i>

432
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,710
<i>The nurses are busy distributing dinner to their patients.</i>

433
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,690
<i>This is my chance!</i>

434
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,690
<i>I've made it to the elevator without suspicion.</i>

435
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,590
My destination is the first floor,

436
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,260
where I will leave out the front entrance to avoid watchful eyes.

437
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,670
Wouldn't she use the first-aid entrance out back?

438
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,170
- I wouldn't!
- "I"...

439
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,070
He's right.

440
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,070
That entrance is for emergency patients.
She'd stick out like a sore thumb.

441
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,760
It's well guarded as well.

442
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,120
- I see.
- You fail as a detective.

443
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,100
I'm a doctor.

444
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,680
I escaped out front, blending in with the crowd.

445
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,240
"Where does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest."
[T/N: quote from "Father Brown" short stories]

446
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,810
Quoting Father Brown now, are you?

447
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:38,230
Though I've managed to escape,
I must choose my next destination.

448
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,530
In front of me is a neighborhood. To my left, a train station.

449
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:46,530
Both attract crowds. To my right are parks and forests.

450
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,300
The area would be deserted around this time.

451
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,760
I begin walking to my right, avoiding suspicion along the way.

452
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,450
That's not enough information.

453
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,980
Though I begin my trek,
leaving the hospital has left me exhausted.

454
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,730
<i>I must find somewhere to hide, and quickly.</i>

455
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:08,010
<i>That is when I noticed the park right in front of me.</i>
[Hashibiro Park]

456
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,270
Here.

457
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,110
Everything leads to this spot.

458
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,900
Ms. Kuraishi is somewhere in this park.
[Hashibiro Park]

459
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,010
You're like a spiritual medium, Sakurai.

460
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,340
I am a detective. I have used my expert profiling skills to -

461
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,270
Excellent, now let us hurry.

462
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,800
Mai, update my sister on the situation.
Have an ambulance ready as well.

463
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,580
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,190
Sakurai, which way are we headed?

465
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,410
- My name is Kuraishi -
- We'll split the search.

466
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,160
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let us head this way.

467
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,950
Please don't trip -

468
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,560
Are you alright?

469
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,810
W-What is it?

470
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,880
Dr. Takao?

471
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,400
- We were looking for you.
- Huh? Oh!

472
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,480
Thank goodness. Let us return to the hospital, Ms. Kuraishi.

473
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,030
- W-What the...
- Ma'am?

474
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,520
Don't!

475
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,150
Ma'am, please calm down. We only want to help you.

476
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,090
Lies! Owashi Ameku is after my life!

477
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,410
If he's going to kill me...

478
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,530
Then I'd rather end my life here!

479
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,670
W-What do we do?

480
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,130
This isn't my area of expertise.

481
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,470
Um... erm...

482
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,610
Your hometown is Kisennuma City, in Miyagi.

483
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,510
Twenty years ago, you returned home to give birth to a baby girl.

484
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,260
Her name was Asuka.

485
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,960
However, after her birth, your daughter was afflicted
with infant respiratory distress syndrome.

486
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,430
She was in critical condition. It was a race against time.

487
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,780
Except, none of the hospitals in the area
had an operating pediatrics department.

488
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,360
That was why you had no choice
but to travel to a prefectural hospital.

489
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,430
Come back to us. Please, come back to us.

490
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,030
Doctor, you have been resuscitating the child for an hour now.

491
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,520
Come back.

492
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,780
- It's enough.
- Come back. Come back to us!

493
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,800
Come back to us!

494
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,220
Her life was lost due to the limits of small town hospitals.

495
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,240
Though you two hold different responsibilities
as doctor and politician,

496
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,460
are you not comrades
who were working towards the same goal?

497
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,810
Our stance as comrades had me privy to too much.

498
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:57,190
I became nothing but deadweight to him. That is why he...

499
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,000
Won't you listen to my side of things?

500
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,440
It is true that I used your influence
to prevent the construction of a hospital.

501
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,850
There were plans to build a medium-sized hospital
around a kilometer away from here.

502
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:24,110
But the facility in question had only monetary gain in mind.

503
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,950
No pediatricians, gynecologists - not even a first-aid team.

504
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:33,340
They only hoped to focus on profitable departments.

505
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,890
If they built such an institute nearby,
it would be a detriment to Tenikai Hospital.

506
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,160
Patients wouldn't get the necessary treatment they needed.

507
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,800
I am not ashamed of what I have done, not in the slightest.

508
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,450
As for those nosy journalists,

509
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:56,650
it seems they had been fed false rumors
from those associated with the shut down hospital.

510
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,440
We have confirmed you have taken no illegal donations.

511
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,810
We have goals left unaccomplished, no?

512
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,180
We must fight, for Asuka.

513
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,060
I will carry her. Bring the ambulance around, immediately.

514
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,860
Let's go. Nothing has been resolved, yet.

515
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,290
Ms. Kuraishi, can you hear me?

516
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,270
We can't treat her without a diagnosis.

517
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,300
Move. I'll diagnose her.

518
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,340
First, we chat.

519
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,440
The patient is in no condition to speak, Doc.

520
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,710
I can get the information I need from someone else.

521
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,670
Tell me anything you got on Kuraishi Natsuko.

522
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,840
There was one thing that weighed on my mind.

523
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,470
<i>They say the Tenikai are giving us illegal funds.
Someone leaked our plans to the press.</i>

524
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,160
<i>Was it you? Or you?</i>

525
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,650
She had been uncharacteristically irate recently.

526
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,760
She was tired, and mentioned losing quite some weight as well.

527
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,630
<i>Natsuko Kuraishi was irritated, and on edge recently.</i>

528
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,530
<i>But it wasn't an issue of her personality.</i>

529
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,860
<i>Was the cause a metabolic disorder? Hormones? I can't be sure.</i>

530
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,540
<i>She has a fever reaching 40 degrees, and a high pulse.
But her CRP is fine.</i>

531
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,260
<i>This could be the work of an infection.</i>

532
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,030
<i>But what exactly caused it?</i>

533
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,840
[Intestinal ischemia]
[Viral pneumonia - Critical bacterial infection]

534
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,760
<i>Doesn't seem right. Any potential cancers?</i>

535
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,180
[Lung Cancer - Leukemia - Lymphoma - Pancreatic Cancer]

536
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,280
<i>No, those are all wrong.</i>

537
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,020
<i>There has to be something I'm missing here.</i>

538
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,590
<i>But what?</i>

539
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,720
I got it.

540
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,070
- Woah.
- Then explain to us.

541
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,000
No time, it's a race against the clock.

542
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,960
But her primary doctor is the one who holds all responsibility
for her care.

543
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,590
If you don't give me the permission to act, I can't treat her.

544
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,020
Will you choose to trust me?

545
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:25,290
Will you entrust me with your patient?

546
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:29,530
As a human being, I do not trust you in the slightest.

547
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:36,050
But when it comes to diagnosing a patient,
I trust you with everything I have.

548
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:41,820
Though you lack as a person,
you are first-rate as a diagnostician.

549
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,230
I leave her in your hands.

550
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,090
Put this in the history books.

551
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,230
Unbelievable...

552
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,640
She needs to be cool. Get her temperature down.

553
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,880
- Yes, ma'am.
- Grab the cooling packs.

554
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,030
- Yes, sir.
- Kotori, measure her blood agents.

555
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,770
Yes, ma'am.

556
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,930
- Mai.
- Yes, ma'am.

557
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,150
- 10 liters of oxygen.
- Yes, ma'am.

558
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,140
Inject her with a cold saline solution.

559
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,400
Bringing saline solution.

560
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,410
- Prepare the artificial respirator.
- Yes, ma'am.

561
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:18,310
She may require intra-aortic balloon pump therapy.

562
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:22,200
Call a nephrologist, cardiologist, and medical engineer as well.

563
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,610
- Yes, ma'am.
- You may feel a prick.

564
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,160
First, we'll lower her temperature with a fever reducer.

565
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,170
We'll slow her pulse with a beta blocker.

566
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,820
We'll also inject her with steroids to control her inflammation.

567
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,490
- Steroids?
- You don't know?

568
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,360
- Steroids are -
- I know what they are!

569
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,810
But if she has blood poisoning,
steroids will only make it worse.

570
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,630
Quit interrupting me.

571
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,310
Her primary doctor left everything to me, did he not?

572
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,150
Finally,

573
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,230
I'll cure her with this magic shot.

574
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,940
Her vitals have returned to normal levels.

575
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,580
Her temperature is now an average 37 degrees Celsius.
She requires no oxygen either.

576
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,290
It seems my magical shot worked.

577
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,520
- What magic -
- Dr. Takao!

578
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,740
Yes, Mai?

579
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,840
What caused all this?

580
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,580
You made me work after hours.

581
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,430
I think I'll have my reward, first.

582
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,230
Reward?

583
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,100
<i>I can't eat another bite.</i>

584
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,830
<i>I'm bringing the rest back with me.</i>

585
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,070
No talking with your mouth full.

586
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,950
- I'm sleepy.
- Doc, please give us your diagnosis.

587
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,030
Kotori.

588
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,470
- You give it a shot.
- Huh?

589
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,190
Show me what you're capable of.

590
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,870
Well, she became feverish
after her intestinal ischemia operation.

591
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,330
At a glance, this could be attributed to blood poisoning.

592
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,970
But her blood tests returned negative.

593
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,220
No abnormalities showed up on her scans either.

594
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:24,110
Yet her blood pressure continued to rise,
resulting in a speedy pulse.

595
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,910
As such, it couldn't be blood poisoning.

596
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,450
Good. Continue.

597
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:33,770
Ms. Kuraishi recently was irate, tired, and lost weight.

598
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:38,240
And taking into account her Intestinal ischemia...

599
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,450
Doesn't that remind you of a specific ailment?

600
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,700
Hyperthyroidism... Basedow's disease!

601
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,280
- Bingo.
- Woah.

602
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,710
The thyroid plays an important role in our body's development.

603
00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:00,740
<i>Basedow's disease occurs
when the thyroid creates too many hormones.</i>

604
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,690
<i>Heart palpitations, weight loss,</i>

605
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,640
<i>shaking hands, and sweat are physical symptoms.</i>

606
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,400
<i>Irritation and impatience are mental symptoms.</i>

607
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,540
My magical shot was an antithyroid agent.

608
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,810
But how is that related to intestinal ischemia?

609
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,810
One symptom of Basedow's disease is an irregular heartbeat.

610
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,600
This irregularity caused a clot within the heart's atrium,

611
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,230
clogging blood flow to the intestine.

612
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:31,130
This caused a thyroid storm following her operation,

613
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,730
which put her entire body in a critical state.

614
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:38,400
<i>A "storm" occurs when the body unleashes
a massive amount of hormones at one time.</i>

615
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,470
<i>It causes high fevers, a rapid pulse,
loss of consciousness, and organ damage.</i>

616
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:49,850
<i>A thyroid storm is likely to occur
when the body is under a great amount of stress.</i>

617
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,410
Undergoing a major operation would be a prime example.

618
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,820
- There's one thing I must question.
- I'm listening.

619
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:01,920
A thyroid storm only occurs to individuals diagnosed
with a major case of Basedow's disease.

620
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,510
- That's right.
- Yet her pre-operation check up was all clear.

621
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,900
I cannot imagine she was afflicted with a storm in the first place.

622
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,710
Precisely. And yet, you're wrong.

623
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,690
Natsuko Kuraishi was already taking a remedy
for Basedow's disease.

624
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,890
Even she was unaware.

625
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,570
I'm talking about those.

626
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,730
Where do you think you're looking?

627
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,600
It's those kelp snacks.

628
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,000
What's another substance used to suppress thyroid hormones?

629
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,410
Inorganic iodine?

630
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:43,540
Precisely. Kelp is packed with iodine.

631
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:49,530
Natsuko Kuraishi must've eaten those kelp snacks often.

632
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,870
<i>These specialties feature our "Sea Squirt" mascot. Cute, isn't he?</i>

633
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:57,080
She was practically ingesting a medication
which would combat Basedow's disease.

634
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,980
As such, her symptoms never came to light.

635
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,780
Yet after the operation, she had no access to kelp.

636
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,290
With her body under an immense amount of stress,

637
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:08,520
it lead to this influx in thyroid hormones.

638
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,020
That's how she was afflicted with a thyroid storm.

639
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:17,440
This concludes my diagnosis. I'll take these cakes as my reward.

640
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,580
Kotori, grab them.

641
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,120
Yes, ma'am.

642
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,870

643
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:28,370
I truly apologize for the trouble I've caused you.

644
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,860
Do you recall anything from the last few days, ma'am?

645
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,010
Not really, no.

646
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:41,780
But I do remember your words to me, Director Ameku.

647
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,460
I believe we will only continue to face obstacles in our path.

648
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:51,310
Indeed. That is precisely why we cannot stop now.

[Sea Squirt's Snacking Kelp]

650
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,500
We shall now begin the press conference.

651
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,300
Cabinet Member Natsuko Kuraishi, if you would.

652
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:14,490
Today, I would like to explain our future prospects
for health care in the Tokyo area.

653
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,860
As you may know, medical facilities in the Tokyo area
have been facing a financial struggle.

654
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,300
Thus, I believe we must first reassess our medical resources
in this region.

655
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,630
What I would like to focus on today, is the concept of "balance".

656
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:31,200
<i>We will begin with medical facilities in western Tokyo,</i>
[Reorganizing Medical Care in Tokyo]

657

659
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,920

our softball team will be a game away
from your first place team.

Our team will win this year, sir.

665
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:16,290
Communicating with your staff is an important job, and -

666
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,770
- Things have gotten complicated.
- Pardon?

667
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,090
There's been an issue involving Takao.

668
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:31,500
Where did your love go for the department? No... for Dr. Takao?

669
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,790
Like I said - what now?

670
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:43,350
You'll leave Dr. Takao to go to the UK? I won't allow it.

671
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,110
- Yum, curry.
- What?

672
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,290
- Cold curry.
- What are you doing?

673
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,580

674
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,110
- Huh?
- Ninjas know it all. Don't underestimate us.

Who's the ninja?

676
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,780
Of course, I'd love to study under Dr. Takao as a diagnostician.

00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,750
Then you have your answer.

678
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,100
Still, studying overseas is a rare opportunity.

679
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,100
- It's a difficult choice.
- You indecisive loser!

680
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,840
Who are you calling a loser?

681
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,460
What in the world?

682
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,390
Dr. Takao? Is everything alright?

683
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,560
Back off.

684
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,600
- Huh?
- Not another step.

685
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,350
That ungrateful scumbag.

686
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,590
What happened?

687
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,130
I'm sending that damned demon to hell.

688
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,020
W-Was that a "Shadow Warriors" reference?
[T/N: a period drama]

689
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,970
Dr. Takao? Where are you going?

690
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,600
Dr. Takao?

691
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,670
"Regularly Scheduled Assembly - Itinerary".

692
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:40,980
"Final vote regarding the abolition
of the Department of Investigative Pathology"?

693
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,340
Watch it!

694
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,460
What's the big idea, Uncle?

695
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,680
Why are we talking about abolishing the department now?

696
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,150
You could at least knock.

697
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,760
Do you recall diagnosing a seven-year-old boy
named Soichiro Suzuhara about a month and a half ago?

698
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,270
He ingested too much vitamin A.

699
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,640
Chronic symptoms include nausea, vomiting, fatigue,

700
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,520
and swelling in the limbs.

701
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,700
Acute symptoms include a rise in intracranial pressure.

702
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,150
Looking into his eyes, I could see an optic swelling,

703
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:37,700
which is a sure sign of intracranial pressure.

704
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,270
You overdosed your son on vitamin A

705
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:44,440
simply because his eyesight was poor.

706
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,080
How much did you even give him?

707
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,420
Symptoms of his caliber only occur
when taking a considerable amount of vitamins.

708
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,000
Now we have a diagnosis.

709
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,700
Except, you made a misdiagnosis.

710
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,390
- What?
- You've been sued for medical malpractice.
