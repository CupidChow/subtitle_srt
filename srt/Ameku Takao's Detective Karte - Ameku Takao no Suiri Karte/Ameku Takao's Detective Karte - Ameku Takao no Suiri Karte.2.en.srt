1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,700
<i>I was diagnosed to be on the spectrum.</i>

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,620
<i>- That culprit is you.
- I'm sorry.</i>

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,330
<i>I believe they will be a great pair.</i>

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,150
<i>I plan on shutting down the Integrated Diagnosis Department for good.</i>

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,750
<i>The answer to all mysteries lies right in here.</i>

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,990
Mizugami-sama* is after me!
<i>(*God of Water)</i>

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,780
- Please... Please save my daughter!
- Oh, no!

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,780
Her arms...

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,160
- Maki!
- Let me go!

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,900
Maki!

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,990
Please stand back, Ma'am.

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,210
I am Ameku Takao, the head of the Integrated Diagnosis Department.

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,490
"Integrated Diagnosis"?

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,830
We diagnose mysterious and otherwise inexplicable symptoms.

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,900
We must begin treatment now.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,000
- Prepare the sedative.
- Yes, Sir.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,900
- Hold her down firmly.
- Ma'am, calm yourself.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,000
The IV drip is prepared.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,370
<i>Timing and Subtitles by the Diagnosis: Suspicious Team @ Viki</i>

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,140
'Tis a curse!

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,550
Sensei Takao?

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,340
- The "Village of Eight Gravestones" by Yokomizo Seishi.
- "Village of Eight Gravestones"?

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,230
Do youngsters nowadays read no classics?
<i>[Village of Eight Gravestones]</i>

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,100
You're plenty young yourself, Sensei.

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,370
"Eight Gravestones" is a must-read for any aspiring doctor.

26
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,400
- I will add it to the list.
- Don't bother.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,050
- But a curse? That's unheard of by anyone's standards.
- Who's "anyone"?

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,150
Well, common sense would suggest—

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,810
Common sense is merely a prejudice you've adopted based on your surroundings.

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,660
Our department will handle this patient.

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,730
No. This is a patient of our psychiatry department.

32
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,730
- The rules state we must hand her over to them.
- Like the rules matter.

33
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,500
We shall abide by them regardless and proceed from here.

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,800
I am Mizuhara Maki-san's attending physician, Tamura.

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,220
And this is Sensei Sumida, our department head.

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,080
Thank you for contacting us.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,810
Who called her here?

38
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,590
Why did you call my sworn enemy of all doctors?

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,890
- "Sworn enemy"?
- Tamura.

40
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,200
Ma'am, your daughter is in a precarious state.

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,380
If possible, we would like to begin treatment immediately.

42
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,700
- I understand.
- You. Didn't you want to save your daughter from this "curse"?

43
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,810
You do not need to listen to that one, Ma'am.

44
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,160
But my daughter...

45
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,940
she remains unwell,

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,900
even after taking the prescribed medicines.

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,800
Ma'am, recovery is a lengthy process—

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,430
These two won't solve the mystery.

49
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,800
- Enough—
- Look.

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,200
How would you explain these handprints on the patient's arms?

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,500
She must have grabbed herself in a panic, is all.

52
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,060
Marks of this kind are usually caused by internal bleeding.

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,900
Yet these are clear rashes. Some parts even look like burnt blisters.

54
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,800
You've explained nothing.

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,100
Are these the marks of Mizugami-sama after all?

56
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
'Tis a curse!

57
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,800
- You just want to say that, don't you?
- Wh-What?

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,560
She's quoting "Village of the Eight Gravestones."

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,480
Finally, someone of the right generation.

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,700
In any case,

61
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,700
these external symptoms call for a general medicines department like ours as well.

62
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,200
Then how about our departments work together to—

63
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,600
- We decline your offer.
- Why?

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,100
You are not doing this for the patient.

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,180
You only wish to entertain yourself.

66
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,220
You truly haven't matured, have you?

67
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,330
Mizugami-sama has cursed her, okay?

68
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,770
This mystery is one you ought to use my intellect to solve.

69
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,010
Rest assured, Ma'am. We shall care for your―

70
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,860
- Hey, hold on―
- If you resist any further...

71
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,030
What are you going to do then?

72
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,250
I shall call the manager—

73
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,940
in other words, your sister immediately.

74
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,450
- Nee-chan?
- She will need to scold you for your mischief, right?

75
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,830
Urgent business calls!

76
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,890
- Sensei Takao.
- That woman...

77
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,780
I can't believe she'd use Nee-chan, that dirty cheater!

78
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,980
I wanted to hear more about this curse!

79
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,900
In that case, there would be no problem.

80
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,030
- What?
- It seems her pleas usually fell on deaf ears

81
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,980
so your absolute insistence gave her hope, Sensei Takao.

82
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
You.

83
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,030
Now out with it. Who's this "Mizugami-sama"?

84
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,600
This is to diagnose your daughter's symptoms.

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,890
Please relax, Ma'am.

86
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,770
Mizugami-sama is a god of water

87
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,600
that has cursed our Mizuhara family for generations.

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,200
Back in the Edo era, the Mizuhara family were prosperous farmers.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,200
<i>Yet in order to maintain their yield, the Mizuhara's required lots of water.</i>

90
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,930
<i>Eventually, they resorted to changing the flow of a nearby river</i>

91
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,280
<i>to irrigate their land.</i>

92
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,390
<i>That is when the curse of Mizugami-sama began.</i>

93
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,100
<i>Soon after, three children of the Mizuhara family passed one after the other.</i>

94
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,280
<i>"That river has always been the domain of a water god,"</i>

95
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,800
<i>"who controlled the river's flow."</i>

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,200
<i>"Your family has incurred his wrath."</i>

97
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,510
<i>"How do we make amends? Please, tell us!"</i>

98
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,500
<i>"You must appease his wrath through ritual."</i>

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>"This well shall Mizugami-sama's new home."</i>

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,730
- <i>"Mizugami-sama..."
- "Oh, Mizugami-sama!!"</i>

101
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,880
But, Ma'am, child death was rather common in the Edo era.

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,810
"Children were god's property until the age of seven," as they used to say.

103
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,510
Yes. However, according to my mother-in-law,

104
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:33,550
the curse of Mizugami-sama still remains in the Mizuhara family.

105
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,800
<i>Worshipping the well did indeed prevent our children from dying.</i>

106
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,000
Yet, almost like an exchange...

107
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,220
Disaster began to strike the adults.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Those of the Mizuhara family never lived long lives.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,250
<i>All had passed before they turned the age of sixty.</i>

110
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,700
<i>It seems their deaths were quite gruesome as well.</i>

111
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,000
<i>"Mizugami-sama has cursed me to death!"</i>

112
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,660
That is the tale passed down as a warning in our Mizuhara family.

113
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,300
Then your daughter has been cursed far too early, right?

114
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Earlier this year, my husband passed away.

115
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,520
And with his death,

116
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,960
I stopped worshipping the well.

117
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,510
I thought the notion of a "curse" was beyond ridiculous.

118
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,480
But then something strange started happening to my daughter.

119
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,580
Fascinating.

120
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,250
"Fascinating"?

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,630
This began... three months ago, right?

122
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,890
Your daughter began experiencing insomnia and ill bouts,

123
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,810
as well as hallucinations about being monitored by someone.

124
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,260
I see she also took leave from work due to stress around this time.

125
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,260
That is when she first visited our hospital.

126
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,670
But she has shown no signs of recovery.

127
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,970
Her fear of this "curse" only grows.

128
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,210
And then those handprints...

129
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,960
Walk me through what happened today.

130
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,340
My daughter spends most of her time shut in at home, paralyzed by fear.

131
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,550
So I dragged her outdoors for a hopeful change of pace.

132
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,830
<i>This must be your first time out in quite some time.</i>

133
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,160
<i>Did you make sure to wear sunscreen?</i>

134
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,460
<i>What?</i>

135
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,470
<i>Ever since I got burnt in high school,</i>

136
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,070
<i>you've always made sure to ask about sunscreen, Mom.</i>

137
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,200
<i>- So overprotective.
- Call it love, will you?</i>

138
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,500
<i>I'm sorry. I shouldn't be making you worry at my age.</i>

139
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,520
<i>It's nothing to fret about, Dear.</i>

140
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,930
<i>Come on.</i>

141
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,960
<i>Two pasta lunch sets, please.
[512 Spring Food Menu]</i>

142
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,620
<i>- Certainly.
- Thank you.</i>

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,410
<i>Here.</i>

144
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,890
<i>I already sanitized my hands.</i>

145
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,390
<i>I was extra careful of her fragile health.</i>

146
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,380
<i>I had her sanitize her hands every ten minutes</i>

147
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,380
<i>and avoided crowds as well.</i>

148
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,800
What did Mizuhara Maki eat for lunch?

149
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,300
Spaghetti with garlic, chili, and seafood.

150
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,900
- What kind of seafood?
- Is that particularly important?

151
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,000
Right now, we must gather as much intel as possible.

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,600
I will then fit those clues like pieces in a puzzle,

153
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,700
and only then, will I have a blueprint for the "truth."

154
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,320
That is the job of a detective.

155
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,010
I see.

156
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,280
But we're doctors!

157
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,140
So the pasta...

158
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,050
<i>It contained squid, shrimp,</i>

159
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,840
<i>oysters, and clams as well.</i>

160
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,000
And after lunch?

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,300
We decided to take a short walk before returning home.

162
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,730
<i>- Maki?
- Mizugami-sama is here.</i>

163
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,480
<i>You're okay. There is no curse, remember?</i>

164
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,710
<i>Sensei said so.</i>

165
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,640
<i>Mizugami-sama is coming.</i>

166
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,300
<i>Mizugami-sama is coming to drag me into those depths!</i>

167
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,890
<i>Mizugami-sama is coming for me!</i>

168
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,670
<i>Maki? Maki!</i>

169
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,500
<i>Maki!</i>

170
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,660
Her immense stress caused her to lose consciousness.

171
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,500
All right, first things first, let's go meet this Mizugami-sama!

172
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,100
Pardon?

173
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,500
I'll use this here and ward off Mizugami-sama myself.

174
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,530
♫ <i>Hiding the fading wounds that won't heal</i> ♫

175
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,270
♫ <i>What should I do now</i> ♫

176
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,570
<i>[Ameku Takao's Detective Karte]</i>

177
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,800
The shrine is further up this path.

178
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,000
I will not follow any further.

179
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,360
Hey!

180
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,440
Why did I have to come along?

181
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,410
I haven't been outdoors in half a year.

182
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,800
And subordinates accompanying their boss is a given.

183
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,380
Half a year? What are you, a bear coming out of hibernation?

184
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,820
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

185
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,500
You didn't have to come if you would be scared.

186
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,000
I'd like to eventually do a resident rotation at the I.D. Department

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,310
so Sensei Takao said I ought to gain the necessary experience.

188
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,160
Is this truly "necessary"?

189
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,100
You're welcome any time, Mai.

190
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,900
My goal is to expand the I.D. Department.

191
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,820
The more we expand, the more patients we can accept.

192
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,500
And more patients means more opportunities for mysteries I can solve.

193
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,400
Exactly!

194
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,340
Sensei Takao, will you manage without a flashlight?

195
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,940
I have night vision. I'll be fine.

196
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,660
What is this doctor's deal, really...

197
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,400
What now?

198
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,100
Make sure to protect your dear junior, Sensei Kotori.

199
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,630
Not "Kotori." I'm "Takanashi," okay?

200
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,290
Ouch! Could you not pinpoint my joints like that?

201
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,640
Konoike, are you a martial artist or something?

202
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,620
- Correct. I took aikido.
- H-Hold it!

203
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,900
If something happens to us out here,

204
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,500
you're not planning to punch me and use me as a scapegoat, are you?

205
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,010
Sensei Kotori!

206
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,970
There it is.

207
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,890
Don't just leave me, you meanie. Woah!

208
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,160
Agh, jeez!

209
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,180
That must be it.

210
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,900
A-All right, I get it!

211
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,820
This must be Mizugami-sama.

212
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,290
That's a monster, no matter how you spin it.

213
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,320
In Japan, the word "god" covers many bases.

214
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,750
It's not uncommon to see folklore "monsters" deified as "gods."

215
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,800
What's most eye-catching, are these numerous hands.

216
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,900
So this monster lives at the bottom of this well.

217
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,510
Hello? Mizugami-sama? Are you down there?

218
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,640
If you are, could you pop out already?

219
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,180
- You'll seriously be cursed!
- Hello?

220
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,520
Aah! Help!

221
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,660
Sensei Takao, please calm down and don't flail around!

222
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,890
Don't kick me! Konoike, help! Help!

223
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,620
R-Right!

224
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,140
Ready and...

225
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,100
I thought I was going to die.

226
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,720
Please be careful!

227
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,440
But...

228
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,950
thanks to that, I managed to see all the way down the well.

229
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,670
The water pools far, far below.

230
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,530
We're fishing out Mizugami-sama.

231
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,610
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

232
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,410
Time to finally meet, face-to-face.

233
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,450
Show yourself, Mizugami-sama!

234
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,900
Mizugami-sama visited.

235
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,450
Maki?

236
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,080
He grabbed my hair...

237
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,500
Nice hit! Nice hit!

238
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,210
Is that the real deal?

239
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,950
You sure?

240
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,670
Seriously? Holy cow.

241
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,830
- Ball.
- Nice swing!

242
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,390
Get 'em!

243
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,220
- Ball.
- Nice call, Yamada.

244
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,100
Keep at it.

245
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,300
- Ball.
- Okay.

246
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,850
- Okay! Nice call.
- Nice call!

247
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,260
- Come on! Let's go!
- Hang in there!

248
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,910
Your pitching is quite unstable. Is everything all right?

249
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,790
I've heard the news from Sensei Sumida.

250
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,720
Mizugami-sama, was it?

251
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,010
You all seem to be acting on your own.

252
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,450
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

253
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,370
- Sensei Takanashi?
- Yes?

254
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,300
Please stop Takao.

255
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,500
We've made attempts.

256
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,350
Just be sure to watch yourselves for now.

257
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,400
For now?

258
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,900
Well, we have offered to assist the psychiatry department a number of times.

259
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,410
But they stubbornly refuse.

260
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,860
She said Sensei Sumida was a sworn enemy.

261
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,960
- "Sworn enemy"?
- When Takao was a resident,

262
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,620
she re-diagnosed her supervisor,

263
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,160
<i>Sensei Sumida's patient, without approval.</i>

264
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,530
<i>Did I do something wrong?
[Two years ago]</i>

265
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,260
The patient got better, didn't they?

266
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,080
You must inform me before taking action.

267
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,650
Not to mention you insulted my work to the patient.

268
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,700
It was a fun mystery to solve.

269
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,900
Ameku Takao!

270
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,500
You are hereby banned from the Department of Psychiatry.

271
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,400
Why?

272
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,100
Well, I suppose anyone would be furious after something like that.

273
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,000
- Agreed...
- Exactly.

274
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,670
- Sensei Takanashi.
- Yes.

275
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,700
Please keep her out of trouble.

276
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,200
I will.

277
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm disappointed in myself. And after Mazuru-san pleaded...

278
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,710
Onto the next step. We're going to examine Mizuhara Maki.

279
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,790
You only want to solve a mystery, don't you?

280
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,470
<i>But of course.</i>

281
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,180
Plenty of symptoms in the world have yet to be attributed a name.

282
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,160
In that way, a diagnosis is the same as solving a mystery.

283
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,370
I'm so glad I became a doctor.

284
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,520
Sensei Sumida is headed our way.

285
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,940
Oh? I don't think I recognize you.

286
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,990
- Are you a new hire?
- Yes, Sir.

287
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,910
What's this?

288
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,000
A fridge. We received report of a broken unit up ahead.

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,380
Really now. This thing's huge.

290
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,510
It's a newer model.

291
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,990
Then if you'll excuse me.

292
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,440
We're in the clear.

293
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,900
Come on in.

294
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,300
Excuse us.

295
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,950
Who are you?

296
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,520
Rest easy, I'm Ameku Takao.

297
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,600
She leads the I.D. Department.

298
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,000
And I don't look that way but I'm also a doctor.

299
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,920
I've come to expose Mizugami-sama.

300
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,550
But before we do that, I'd like to examine your body.

301
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,990
Sensei Takao. What is that face I often see you make?

302
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,730
It's my best smile.

303
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,600
Do you not know the fundamentals of human expression?

304
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,400
I have trained to move my facial features at will.

305
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,000
Do not fear, I will expel Mizugami...

306
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:02,560
Your next move was painfully obvious, Ameku Takao.

307
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,440
Now that's my former supervisor for you.

308
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,950
Otherwise, you wouldn't be a worthy opponent.

309
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,420
Sir, I believe you ought to inform

310
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,990
these two of the future of their department.

311
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,800
The I.D. Department will be shut down in due time, right?

312
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,530
- Wh-What?
- Were you aware?

313
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,670
Uncle, you've been director for a year now.

314
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,610
Reforms were only a matter of time.

315
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,930
I bet you've already cooked up some nefarious plot in that mind of yours.

316
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:40,430
At least, cutting unprofitable departments is objectively the right reform to make.

317
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,820
But I have just arrived here...

318
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,840
Excuse me, Ma'am.

319
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,300
I will only continue to grow the I.D. Department.

320
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,200
You found that funny? Are you okay?

321
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,350
There are mysteries only the I.D. Department can solve.

322
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,680
That is why it's a necessity for this hospital.

323
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,910
Come in.

324
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,620
I agree with her, Sir.

325
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,400
Nee-chan...

326
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,900
Are you here to back me up?

327
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,610
Yes, you tell 'em.

328
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,250
Takao.

329
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,290
In order to have my full support, we must reconsider your actions.

330
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,880
Now you will listen to what I have to say, all right?

331
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,440
Yes. Kotori will, in my stead!

332
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,940
- What?
- Takao!

333
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,890
O-One moment.

334
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,650
Erm, well...

335
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,790
Well...

336
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:50,860
Like Sensei Takao, why don't we take action for our own sakes?

337
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,810
I don't see anything so wrong with that.

338
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,510
Sensei Takao pursues mysteries she knows will use her intellect.

339
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,980
That is because she believes the answer

340
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,160
to those mysteries will surely benefit her patients.

341
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,920
Because she is fully aware that it is the reason for her existence.

342
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,020
Taking action for herself, is also for her patients.

343
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,690
In short, that connection is the key here.

344
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,010
One misstep, and that logic can crumble to nothing.

345
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:39,210
Sensei Takanashi, why do you choose to work with Takao?

346
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,970
Because...

347
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,500
I wish to see the result of her persistence myself.

348
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,680
If Sensei Takao's treatment is incorrect,

349
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,090
it will only cause the patient and her family turmoil.

350
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,950
In fact, Sensei Takao still blames this "curse"―

351
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,310
I believe she's already figured it out.

352
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,590
Sensei Takao has already deciphered the truth of the curse.

353
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,510
In her mind, that is.

354
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,810
Why aren't we here at night?

355
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,790
I don't do well in sunlight.

356
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,350
Thirty minutes of exposure, and I'm paralyzed.

357
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,090
Why did we have to come all this way?

358
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,250
Yes, really.

359
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,880
If you don't care about the truth of this curse, then leave.

360
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,060
But you're dying to know, aren't you?

361
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,510
After all, it could aid you in curing that "incurable" patient of yours.

362
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,840
Don't provoke them unnecessarily.

363
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:46,560
Well, have you really figured out the truth of this curse?

364
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,770
I've had a hunch about its identity from the start.

365
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,800
Pardon us.

366
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,420
This is water I took from the well.

367
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,300
It's also the truth behind Mizugami-sama's curse.

368
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,700
To be more exact, the curse had melted into the water.

369
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,060
Melted into the water...

370
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,200
Do you mean the water is poisoned?

371
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,450
Precisely.

372
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,910
But my husband and mother-in-law drank from the well regularly

373
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,800
with no repercussions.

374
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,000
Some poisons take effect immediately,

375
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,980
while others poison the body slowly after continuous consumption.

376
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,190
In medical terms, you would call this a "chronic addiction."

377
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,700
Something that has poisoned the well's spring...

378
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,200
Could it be arsenic?

379
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
- Correct.
- I see.

380
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,940
It's not uncommon for arsenic contained in soil to poison the water in a well.

381
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,110
And consuming small amounts of arsenic over a period of time

382
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,880
does not affect the body immediately as an acute poisoning.

383
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,650
Rather, it results in chronic arsenic poisoning.

384
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,000
<i>Chronic arsenic poisoning can cause skin discoloration,</i>

385
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,400
<i>anemia, numbness in hands and feet, deteriorating strength,</i>

386
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,280
<i>vomiting, and diarrhea.</i>

387
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,470
<i>But the biggest issue is that it can cause malignant tumors.</i>

388
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,660
<i>In other words, cancer.</i>

389
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,400
The symptoms that your family has suffered as Mizugami-sama's curse,

390
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,740
were really the symptoms of chronic arsenic poisoning.

391
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,870
That is why I came to retrieve some water the other night.

392
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,180
To prove my hypothesis.

393
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,050
And what was discovered from this sample I had analyzed?

394
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
Trace amounts of arsenic.

395
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,860
<i>[Arsenic]</i>

396
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,100
Hold on.

397
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,490
Why tell us, here?

398
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,730
Mysteries ought to be solved at the scene of the crime, no?

399
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,130
I suppose.

400
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,920
Oh, you seem to understand my refined performance!

401
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,560
In any case, you're claiming Mizuhara Maki-san's symptoms

402
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,890
- are likely due to arsenic, yes?
- Right,

403
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:18,920
but those handprints will require further investigating...

404
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,180
- No.
- No?

405
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,660
The mysterious deaths that have plagued the Mizuhara family

406
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,200
are most likely due to arsenic poisoning as you say, Sensei.

407
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,460
However...

408
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,600
Maki has not been poisoned.

409
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,650
My daughter...

410
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,470
has never taken a sip out of this well, after all.

411
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,600
This custom of deifying "Mizugami-sama"...

412
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,950
It never sat right with me.

413
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,500
That is why Maki and I drank...

414
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,810
ordinary tap water instead.

415
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,400
Of course, my mother-in-law didn't take too kindly to this.

416
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,300
But I told her.

417
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,170
I said if she

418
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,500
forced us to participate in some suspicious ritual,

419
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,200
then I would take Maki and leave the house at once.

420
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,380
I made my stand then and there.

421
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,370
So we've solved the curse.

422
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,310
But then what is afflicting Mizuhara Maki-san?

423
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,700
I told you I was only partway through unraveling the mystery!

424
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
This is your fault, Kotori!

425
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,380
Kotori, this is your fault!

426
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,290
Your fault!

427
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,640
<i>[Tenikai General Hospital]</i>

428
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,130
Get her physician first!

429
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,520
Sensei Takao! There's been an emergency.

430
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,150
Mizuhara Maki-san has taken a turn for the worse.

431
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:17,790
Though the reason why is unclear, it seems she's... drowning.

432
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,200
- Sensei Takao!
- Sensei Takao!

433
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,100
Mizugami-sama is cursing her...

434
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,000
What is happening to her?

435
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,980
I do not know.

436
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,140
Lower leg edema...

437
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,530
Heart failure and pulmonary edema?

438
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,490
Her heart failure is causing blood circulation to stagnate.

439
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,830
Her blood vessels are expelling liquids as a result.

440
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,870
I'll step in.

441
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,960
- Get her oxygen, 6 liters.
- Yes, Sir.

442
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,670
I will ready the S/P.*
<i>(*S/P: Status post; indicates a patient's condition post-treatment)</i>

443
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,080
- Excuse us.
- I'll put the mask on.

444
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,430
I will diagnose her.

445
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,250
No, I will.

446
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,470
- Stand back.
- Right, like Sensei Sumida―

447
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:19,030
No, you stand back, Tamura.

448
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:25,300
Ameku Takao's incredible knack for diagnosing is an undeniable truth.

449
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,850
With no time to waste, it is our responsibility to leave this in her hands.

450
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,500
The patient's life is on the line.

451
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,600
I'll do well to live up to your expectations.

452
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,150
I'll treat the patient.

453
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,150
Sensei Takao, you devote yourself to solving this mystery.

454
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,810
I will be touching your stomach, Ma'am.

455
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,360
Her heart rate is declining.

456
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,230
She's unable to pump blood to the rest of her body.

457
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,300
- Administer the cardiotonic agent. Prepare for intubation.
- Yes, Sir.

458
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,080
- We'll be ventilating her airflow.
- Got it.

459
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,540
- How much...
- Lowering heart rate...

460
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,270
Delusion and derangement...

461
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:04,700
Bodily pain... rashes...

462
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,500
Handprint shaped inflammations,

463
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,990
accompanied by blistering...

464
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,130
Ready.

465
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,390
- The mask.
- Yes, Sir.

466
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,170
The mask, Sir.

467
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,050
- Laryngoscope.
- Yes, Sir.

468
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,360
- Prepare suction.
- Yes, Sir.

469
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,050
I can't get a clear view.

470
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,600
I'll need more light to proceed with intubation.

471
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,560
Move it, Sensei Takao!

472
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,750
Kotori, what did you just say?

473
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,650
Something almost clicked with your words. Repeat yourself.

474
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,790
- Move it, Sensei Takao.
- Not that.

475
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,030
Erm, I'll need more light to proceed with intubation.

476
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,970
That's it, light.

477
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,610
How could I overlook such a crucial factor!

478
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,610
Sensei Takao?

479
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,640
Just work in reverse...

480
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,130
She has cardiac tamponade.

481
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:29,700
When the pericardium sac around the heart fills with too much liquid,

482
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,370
the heart is pressured, and cannot beat as fully intended.
<i>[Cardiac Tamponade]</i>

483
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:39,030
As a result, the heart is unable to pump blood to the rest of the body.

484
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,240
Why does she have cardiac tamponade?

485
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,140
I'll explain later. We have to release the pressure on her heart.

486
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,580
We're saving Mizuhara Maki.

487
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,750
Treating cardiac tamponade means...

488
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,990
Sensei Kotori.

489
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,740
You'll need these, won't you?

490
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,780
I will be performing pericardiocentesis.

491
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,230
You're puncturing her pericardium now?

492
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,660
Her circulation is already reaching levels of critical danger.

493
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,380
Not to mention her pulmonary edema is suffocating her.

494
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,020
If we don't act now, she'll suffer cerebral hypoxia​, and we'll be too late.

495
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,050
Kotori, I'll take all responsibility for what happens here.

496
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,700
Act now.

497
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,270
Yes, Ma'am.

498
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,160
Puncturing, now.

499
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,560
Her blood pressure is rising. She's escaped a critical range.

500
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,580
What... happened...

501
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,480
Maki...

502
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,500
Maki, Maki!

503
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,410
Thank goodenss...

504
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,410
You're alive...

505
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,710
Thank you.

506
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,110
Thank you...

507
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,160
What is that?

508
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,730
The cure to Mizugami-sama's curse.

509
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,530
Mizugami-sama's curse...

510
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,250
Worry not.

511
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,230
I'll expel the curse that's taken hold of your body.

512
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,060
This is Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, or steroid hormone.

513
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,280
You administered a dosage of steroids without a proper diagnosis? Unthinkable!

514
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,540
My common sense is not your common sense.

515
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,910
I determined that suppressing the symptom was the priority, over giving a diagnosis.

516
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:24,780
So you've figured out what's occurring to Mizuhara-san.

517
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,000
Hold your horses.

518
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,130
First, I'm running some checks. I'll explain it simply later for you folks.

519
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,620
We let you run your checks.

520
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,460
Now don't play hard to get and tell us your diagnosis.

521
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,520
Patience. I invited Mai and my sis to the show.

522
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,890
A crowd makes the reveal all the more exciting, you know?

523
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,620
Sensei. Please tell us.

524
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,440
I cannot understand people. It's a trait I was born with.

525
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,240
Do you insist because you're anxious to know?

526
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,490
Or because you're antsy for the reveal, like when reading a mystery novel?

527
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,680
Because I'm anxious.

528
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,330
I understand.

529
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,120
Mizuhara Maki.

530
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,680
The truth behind the curse which plagues you...

531
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,370
Is SLE.

532
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,450
Otherwise known as systemic lupus erythematosus.

533
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,570
<i>SLE is an autoimmune disease which causes a variety of symptoms throughout the body.</i>

534
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,480
<i>It can cause fatigue, and a lack of appetite.</i>

535
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,010
<i>Arthritis, rashes, cold sores, hair loss, </i>

536
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,230
<i>kidney failure, and issues in other organs.</i>

537
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:49,630
<i>And depression, loss of consciousness, and hallucinations.</i>

538
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:54,450
However, your SLE expressed stronger mental symptoms,

539
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,530
and not as much internal symptoms.

540
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,310
That's why you were never properly diagnosed.

541
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,270
You were thought to have a mental illness.

542
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,310
Then why did she suddenly suffer from cardiac tamponade?

543
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,750
Oh.

544
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,310
One of the symptoms of SLE is pericarditis.

545
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,570
An inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, which can cause liquid to accumulate within.

546
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,820
If we didn't treat the inflammation immediately, the symptoms would only repeat.

547
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,200
That's why you administered large amounts of steroids, right?

548
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,860
Great, you're a level 2 diagnostician now.

549
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,610
- Out of?
- 100, obviously.

550
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,340
Sorry.

551
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,220
Here are the results to back up my diagnosis.

552
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,890
<i>[Mizuhara Maki]</i>

553
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,390
One moment.
<i>[ANAs - Positive]</i>

554
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:39,180
I understand Maki's symptoms align with this disease.

555
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,450
But then what caused Mizugami-sama's handprints?

556
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:49,920
An acute observation. Indeed, that was the biggest mystery to solve.

557
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,400
The answer, was sunlight.

558
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,860
You have photosensitivity.

559
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:09,960
One possible symptom of SLE is skin damage when exposed to harsh lights.

560
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,380
At worst, it can even cause blistering like a burn.

561
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,610
The day you took your daughter out...

562
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,180
<i>Did you make sure to wear sunscreen?</i>

563
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,490
Was a bright, sunny day.

564
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,530
That exposure triggered her photosensitivity.

565
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,830
But Maki's marks only appeared on her arms.

566
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,640
And they're very clearly handprints.

567
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,120
But whose are they?

568
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:39,530
They would be yours, Mizuhara Maki.

569
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:48,200
Your mother began advising you to wear sunscreen after you got burnt in high school.

570
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,080
- Did I get that right?
- Yes.

571
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,260
Wearing sunscreen on especially bright days became "common sense" to you.

572
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,250
Except, one more factor got thrown into the mix.

573
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,910
- One more?
- Your hand sanitizer.

574
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,440
- Oh!
- Want to get to level 3?

575
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,850
Ma'am, you raised your daughter with cherished care.

576
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,450
That is why she never drank from the well.

577
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:22,790
And this time, worried for your daughter's well-being, you had her sanitize her hands many times.

578
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:28,880
<i>Although sunscreen cuts UV rays, some brands melt away with alcohol.</i>

579
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,710
<i>Maki-san clenched her arms many times with her sanitized hands.</i>

580
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,720
<i>Mizugami-sama is coming!</i>

581
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,590
<i>That is when her sunscreen melted away</i>

582
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,660
<i>and caused her photosensitive skin to leave handprints behind.</i>

583
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:52,580
This is the truth behind Mizugami-sama's handprints.

584
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,430
So it was never a curse, but a disease.

585
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,900
Will my daughter recover?

586
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,080
What's that expression?

587
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,750
It's her absolute best smile.

588
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,270
Autoimmune diseases are difficult to fully recover from.

589
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,400
However, with the proper treatment,

590
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,000
you'll be back to life as you knew it in no time.

591
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,010
Now we have a diagnosis.

592
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,350
You have a brand new life to look forward to.

593
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,270
Thank goodness...

594
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,480
It was never a curse.

595
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,490
Mom, thank you.

596
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,020
This is all thanks to me.

597
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,070
- Don't verbalize it.
- Why? It's true.

598
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,370
- It's not about that...
- Then what is it about?

599
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:13,820
There was apparently one lesson of mine that stuck with her.

600
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,850
I once told her if she struggled to empathize with her patients,

601
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:25,690
then the least she could do was offer a smile.

602
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,940
And she had kept that advice to heart.

603
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,730
As odd a smile as it may have been.

604
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,480
The I.D. Department should not be shut down.

605
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,980
Sensei Sumida, with your support,

606
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,730
- we can—
- The I.D. Department should remain, is it?

607
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,830
Now when did I ever say that?

608
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,100
Nothing is more risky than relying on a genius, especially in medicine.

609
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,620
Most importantly, it certainly doesn't rake in the dough.

610
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,970
Either way, the project has already begun.

614

615

Wow! Great!

616
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,750
That was amazing, Mazuru-san!

617
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,870
I could really feel your whole soul in those throws.

618
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:44,440
I've vowed to protect the I. D. Department.

619
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,750
Thinking about it added some real strength to my pitching today.

620

Sensei Takanashi. Please root for me and my efforts.

621
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,770
Of course.

622
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,580
Say, if you have some time after this...

623
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,150
Is everything all right?

00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,830
Yes, fine.

- I see.
- Why ask?

637
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,970
No reason. Do you know Yuasa Haruya-san by chance?

638
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,020
He's an anesthesiologist at Seiwa General Hospital.

639

My Nee-chan should be out of surgery by now.

Say what?

641
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,700
She went out to dinner with that guy, when her abdomen started hurting.

642
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,430
So she got admitted to that Yuasa dude's hospital and was diagnosed with appendicitis.

643
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,600
Apparently it was so bad, they operated on her then and there.

644
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,330
Why didn't she choose to get sent here?

645
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,080
She says her position as manager

646
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,640
