You wish to file a lawsuit after a local clinic failed to properly medicate you.

As such, you visited our orthopedic department

120
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,180
to receive a diagnosis as evidence for the lawsuit.

121
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,020
Yes. They directed us here after failing to reach a diagnosis themselves.

122
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,520
Our local quack said her symptoms were due to old age,

123
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,940
but my mother's condition only continues to worsen.

124
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,010
I did my own research

125
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,090
and think this could be a side effect of her cholesterol medication.

126
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,240
So you suspect her muscles are deteriorating due to rhabdomyolysis​.

She has Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)​.

138
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,140
An autoimmune disorder often seen in people above the age of sixty,

139
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,880

140
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,390

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,110

145
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,230
- Right.
- "Right"? But her kidneys are—

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,050
- You. Those are painkillers, right?
- Yes.

You overdosed your mother on prescribed painkillers.

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:34,700
In other words, this lady's kidney issues stem from her PMR and those painkillers.

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,150
<i>[Japan Pure Stream Party]
[For the adults and children of the future]</i>

173
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,490
<i>He's a former surgeon</i>

174
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,810
and will be assisting our ER team twice a week now.

175
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,870
Pleased to meet you all.

176
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,520
How did I go from physician to ER staff?

177
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,100
- I'll answer that.
- Thanks again for coming.

178
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,050
- We need all the help we can get now.
- Is that so?

179
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,820
- I expect great things from you.
- Right.

180
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,540
A 49-year-old man who was involved in an accident will be transferred here in ten minutes.

181
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,070
Though he has no external injuries, he remains unconscious.

182
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,500
Takanashi-kun, that's all you.

183
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,710
And this is Konoike, our resident.

184
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,110
All right, go at it, everyone.

185
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,140
I'll need the ultrasound and X-rays ready and fast.

186
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,820
Yes, Sir.

187
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,430
Contacting the necessary departments.

188
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,620
Please ready the scans.

189
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,900
Preparing the ultrasound.

190
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,290
How is work at the Integrated Diagnosis Department?

191
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,430
My retired husband...

192
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,220
<i>The I.D. Department is where other departments</i>

193
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,320
<i>send their most aggravating patients to complain.</i>

194
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,240
<i>No one visits for an actual diagnosis.</i>

195
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,820
Cayenne pepper? Not in my curry blend.

196
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,760
<i>And while Sensei Takao spends her free time</i>

197
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,460
<i>finding fault with the diagnoses from other departments,</i>

198
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,150
- <i>I'm left with nothing to do!</i>
- So bored...

199
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,030
So when I mentioned how free I was, she insisted I come here.

200
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,580
Great, you'll stay sharp.

201
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,650
And smart as that person may be, "eccentric" doesn't even begin to describe her oddities.

202
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,730
- Well, personally, I'm a fan of Sensei Takao.
- Fan?

203
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,260
You're lucky you get front row seats at the "Ameku Takao Theatre."

204
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,750
What I wouldn't give to be you.

205
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,620
- I'll guide our patient in.
- Lucky? How?

206
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,330
Can you hear us, Kagawa-san?

207
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,790
- Kagawa-san?
- Turning.

208
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,400
I got it.

209
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,780
Understood.

210
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,940
Lifting in three, two, one.

211
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,170
- Get him free.
- Yes, Sir.

212
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,440
Pardon the cutting, Sir.

213
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,490
Patient is shaking.

214
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,650
We are looking into any cause.

215
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,560
You'll feel a bit of a pinch, Sir.

216
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,430
His breathing and blood pressure are stable; not much blood loss either.

217
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,540
- Prepare the X-ray.
- Inserting radiation protector.

218
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,920
Lifting in three, two, one.

219
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,590
Protector in place.

220
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,730
- Taking X-ray.
- Understood.

221
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,800
No ribs are broken. I see no internal bleeding or punctured lungs either.

222
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,840
His ultrasound is also clear.

223
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,320
- Let's take a CT scan as well.
- Yes, Sir.

224
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,950
Coming through.

225
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,070
The patient has regained consciousness.

226
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,350
Kagawa-san, you are currently in the hospital.

227
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,610
Do you remember the accident?

228
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,950
Donuts... I ate an odd-tasting "Always" donut...

229
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,610
That's when I passed out.

230
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,590
Could this be related to that incident on the news?

231
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,130
Oh, my! I have to report this.

232
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,800
To whom?

233
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,090
I'm on it.

234
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,150
<i>I bet she'll be there for sure.</i>

235
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,120
<i>- Who?
- A doc who's more detective, with a penchant for stuff like this.</i>

236
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,580
Hey!

237
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,050
- There you are.
- Follow me.

238
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,390
That is Sensei Ameku Takao.

239
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,840
I'm Sakurai from Division One of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.

240
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,690
- This is...
- Okazaki from East Kurume Police.

241
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,770
You're late.

242
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,760
And you two are acquainted, how?

243
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,960
This man solved all those recent cases on his own, right?

244
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,630
He owes me.

245
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,100
Why is a doctor assisting in an investigation?

246
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,520
Victims and assailants of many cases are sent to this hospital.

247
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,800
Whenever I come to hear them out, I ask for her expertise as well.

248
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,330
So any chance he's just ill?

249
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,320
Kagawa-san was not diagnosed with epilepsy.

250
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,690
His CT scan showed no abnormalities either.

251
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,230
- Perhaps he has—
- There are an infinite number of symptoms in this world.

252
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,960
Was this another poisoning? Or an unknown illness?

253
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,100
You'd best use my genius while you have the chance.

254
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,820
Fine. Sir, tell us everything you know.

255
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,820
As I've been saying, I ate an odd-tasting donut, and before I knew it,

256
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,610
I passed out.

257
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,890
- Where did you purchase this donut?
- From the "Always" storefront.

258
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,990
We buy the frozen bundle because it's cheaper.

259
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,470
A bundle, you say.

260
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,270
Yes. My husband eats at least five donuts every day.

261
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,310
<i>This habit has continued for five years now.</i>

262
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,030
Five donuts every day for five years.

263
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,370
I keep telling my husband it's an unhealthy habit,

264
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,950
- but he refuses to—
- Don't say unnecessary things!

265
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,830
How do you know you eat at least five a day?

266
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,860
I make sure to thaw the amount I'll eat the day before to have on the job.

267
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,310
So your associates knew of this habit.

268
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,620
Yes, we did.

269
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,220
I am Yamaguchi of Shin Yamaguchi Delivery, where he works.

270
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,380
- And what of it?
- The "Always" herbicide poisonings that shocked the world.

271
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,420
They're thinking you could be a fellow victim.

272
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,380
It's a necessary caution to consider.

273
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,550
I can't think of anyone who'd poison me.

274
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,230
Although, if I had to suspect anyone...

275
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,710
Are you suspecting me?

276
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,230
I bet you just fell asleep at the wheel.

277
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,580
You ought to learn empathy from the previous President!

278
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,230
Just say I'm a nuisance.

279
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,890
Don't want me to start a strike, right?

280
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,910
- You lazy, incompetent boy!
- Say that again!

281
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,670
Oh shut it, you's.

282
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,890
<i>"You's"?</i>

283
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,760
Don't act so haughty with us!

284
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,850
"Haughty"? You're a you and that goes for everyone.

285
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,480
That's right. Sensei Takao doesn't bother with honorifics of any sort.

286
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,500
<i>She what?</i>

287
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,490
- You. I have questions.
- We still―

288
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,380
You are incredibly fat.

289
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,520
- What?
- Are you currently diagnosed with anything?

290
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,210
- No.
- Do you attend regular check-ups?

291
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,440
Have you been warned of high blood pressure or diabetes?

292
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,220
I get check-ups at the company. They warned me of neutral fats

293
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,500
and my fatty liver, but saw no major issues.

294
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,520
What? Do you have a complaint with my body?

295
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,250
Dad.

296
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,330
Sorry about that, Aoi.

297
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,320
Was there anything else?

298
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,700
Have you always been this fat?

299
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,020
I began gaining weight five years ago.

300
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,230
I started stress-eating sugary snacks I've always been fond of.

301
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,610
It was about the time this brat took over as President.

302
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,820
In any case, just investigate the donuts in my truck, alright?

303
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,900
We're already on it, Sir. We'll return once the results have come in.

304
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,380
Fascinating. Kotori, get ready to grab a blood and urine sample.

305
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,860
This man is a patient of the Integrated Diagnosis Department.

306
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,650
I will diagnose this mystery myself.

307
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,930
That patient will be sent to the Neurosurgical Department.

308
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,610
You!

309
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,610
This bastard is snatching up my fun mystery for himself.

310
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,770
If the donuts aren't poisoned, the issue is a neurological one.

311
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,090
It only makes sense that he is sent to my department.

312
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,500
This wasn't an epileptic fit nor a cerebrovascular disease.

313
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,510
But a stroke takes several days to appear on a CT scan.

314
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,240
If this were a stroke that left him unable to move, he'd still be paralyzed.

315
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,340
Not if this is a TIA.

316
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,460
Which is precisely why we should administer an—

317
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,850
I knew I could only expect so much from you.

318
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,350
Say what?

319
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,260
I entertained the ordinary man, only to receive predictable answers.

320
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,100
Then have you diagnosed his symptoms already?

321
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,840
Don't ask yet.

322
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,110
There are still truths to uncover.

323
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,470
This is no time to unravel the mystery at play.

324
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,180
- Then why exactly can't my department take him in?
- Takanashi-kun.

325
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,700
- Yes?
- A word of advice as Takao's uncle.

326
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,940
If you wish to get through to Takao, you must be as straightforward as she is.

327
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,910
Oh? What's this?

328
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,030
Our patients are not your toys, Sensei Takao.

329
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,270
But of course. We can't play with our patients.

330
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:34,770
What I mean is, I find qualm in calling our patient's condition "fascinating."

331
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,020
In any case, let us allow the expert a chance to save face, and...

332
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,940
- There, face saved.
- No, not literally...

333
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,530
Oh? Oh, was that an idiom about preserving his dignity?

334
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,920
- Yes.
- Hey, I remember. You brought me some "Always" donuts, too.

335
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,220
- Yes, I did.
- You were trying to kill me.

336
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,270
- Pardon?
- Come in.

337
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,220
Excuse me.

338
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,530
You play dirty, Uncle!

339
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,440
She'll always be around to discipline you.

340
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,530
How about the two departments split the responsibility?

341
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,460
Sensei Nose will be this patient's primary doctor.

342
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,370
The I.D. Department will assist when asked.

343
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,270
- I have no objections.
- Takao.

344
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,940
I know, Onee-chan!

345
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,120
<i>Sensei Takanashi.</i>

346
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,800
You have been with us for a whole week now.

347
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,270
We have accepted many doctors like you to assist our I.D. Department.

348
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,250
Yet most returned to their university hospitals after three days.

349
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,350
I've abandoned my role as a surgeon.

350
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,980
I've resolved to come here to become an internist.

351
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,860
Your strong conviction is admirable.

352
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,380
Tomorrow is our day off.

353
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,040
Would you happen to be free, Sensei Takanashi?

354
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,430
Yes.

355
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,870
I have a feeling I can trust you to accept everything I throw your way.

356
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,780
Everything?

357
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,930
Play ball!

358
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,770
- Nice pitch!
- All right.

359
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,530
Looking good.

360
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,260
- Nice pitch!
- She meant it, literally.

361
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,800
- Nice pitch.
- Go!

362
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,050
My hand still stings...

363
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,440
Keep at it; we still have several innings to go.

364
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,920
Yes, Ma'am.

365
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,940
- Ozuma!
- Yes?

366
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,460
- Let it fly.
- Yes, Ma'am.

367
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,400
- Sensei Kotori.
- It's Takanashi.

368
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
I'm Soma, a nurse working in pediatrics.

369
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,490
It's amazing you caught Mazuru-san's pitch!

370
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,700
Really?

371
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,790
I did karate in university so I suppose those skills carry over.

372
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,810
You must be kidding.

373
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,550
Walking our first batter? You chickens!

374
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,800
She's like a different person entirely.

375
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,220
- Ball.
- Mazuru-san.

376
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,990
- Ball.
- I'd like to ask a question.

377
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,660
Go ahead.

378
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,310
Sensei Takao only heeds your instructions. Why is that?

379
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,650
I'm curious to know as well.

380
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,460
Takao has never been good with people.

381
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,990
She practically never attended school either.

382
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:50,310
That is why I insisted on teaching her various rules to survive.

383
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,750
Rules to survive?

384
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,050
Takao is like a hurricane.

385
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,260
Get caught within the fringes, and you'll be in for a tough time.

386
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:06,220
Instead, you must persevere straight into the eye of the storm.

387
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:26,030
Sensei Takao, it's almost lunch. Shall we head to the cafeteria together?

388
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,050
I can't stand the crowds there.

389
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,690
And their curry is too spicy.

390
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,320
There's more than curry on the menu.

391
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,130
I only eat curry-flavored things.

392
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,540
What? You only eat curry?

393
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,000
Curry "flavored." Sweet things are the one exception.

394
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,450
<i>I could eat those cakes from "Cafe Afternoon" behind the hospital every day.</i>

395
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,480
What now?

396
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,970
Nothing.

397
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,470
Doctor, I have a suggestion.

398
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,600
Let's ask the other departments if they have patients for us.

399
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,780
I'm aiming to become a physician, after all.

400
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,590
If you want to study, hit the books.

401
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,080
But that won't do...

402
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,270
- Are you angry?
- I am not.

403
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,820
- You are.
- I am not—

404
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,950
I was just telling you to study if you wanted to.

405
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,070
No, well,

406
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:27,000
I only meant not everything can be learned from books.

407
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,790
My apologies.

408
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,880
Everyone always leaves me

409
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,790
eventually.

410
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,230
You ought to learn under another department as well.

411
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,870
Sakurai's back!

412
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,770
I wonder if he found any poison. Oh, I can't wait!

413
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,620
She's an enigma for sure...

414
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,460
Sir, according to our forensics team...

415
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,930
No poison was found in your donuts.

416
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,740
- No way...
- We will hand your case over to our traffic division.

417
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,870
- Something doesn't add up.
- Sensei Nose, could this be a neurological issue?

418
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,120
He has no condition which could cause tremors, nor a sudden loss of consciousness.

419
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,370
Have we considered the possibility of sleep apnea?

420
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,870
That could explain a fit or spasm.
<i>[Sleep Apnea Syndrome]</i>

421
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,090
We already checked him.

422
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,230
- He has no such issue.
- Are you blaming the accident on me?

423
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,320
That incompetent President will fire me for good!

424
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,820
I swear, it's that damn donut.

425
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,160
What a load of snacks.

426
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,890
- Are they all sugary?
- Can't you tell?

427
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,700
Guess that explains your body.

428
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,220
Sorry, I've scolded him many times, but he never listens...

429
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,980
Worried? No, I bet you're disappointed I didn't up and die.

430
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,280
Think of the insurance payout you'd get if I croaked.

431
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,200
I've had it with you.

432
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,620
You used to be so kind, Dear.

433
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,020
But now it seems you're angry all the time.

434
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,740
I've had enough.

435
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:20,970
Then we shall excuse ourselves...

436
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,050
As will I.

437
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,990
Sir, are you all right?

438
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:47,780
This is only a theory, but perhaps someone came and took the donuts

439
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,610
before the police arrived to investigate the scene.

440
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,190
That's it.

441
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,920
The culprit has to be that Yamaguchi.

442
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,480
You're my only hope, Sensei. How can I prove this?

443
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,880
The results from your blood and urine samples will come in tonight.

444
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,320
If you ingested poison, something will turn up there.

445
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,980
Sensei, could you send those results to my number?

446
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,890
According to my physician, I'm to be discharged later today.

447
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,760
My daughter says she'll come to get me after school lets out.

448
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,230
Though it hasn't been made public yet,

449
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,600
a similar poisoning occurred earlier today.

450
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,310
Sensei, I'd love to hear your opinion on the matter.

451
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,940
You wish to solve mysteries so we provide them, in exchange for clues.

452
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,970
We've established a mutually beneficial relationship, haven't we?

453
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,710
Fine, out with it already.

454
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,390
"Always Donuts" began as a small storefront.

455
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:01,550
Yet they became a huge hit after their novelty flavors were featured on TV.

456
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,840
Those who work in the "Always" factories

457
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,790
are plenty dissatisfied with their working conditions.

458
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,350
Though we suspected this was the work of an insider,

459
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,750
no trace of poison was found in the factory.

460
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,600
Yet there's no evidence of tampering from the outside either.

461
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,310
Then suspect that dissatisfied mood.

462
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,150
Many people who share a sentiment let that affect their actions.

463
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,110
I bet the culprit used that to their advantage.

464
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,710
The "mood," right?

465
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:44,220
Sakurai! Treat cakes with respect, will you?

466
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,340
"They've become a mess."

467
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,600
<i>[You have new mail]</i>

468
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,640
<i>[Results: Drugs and Poison Testing]
[Nothing deleted]</i>

469
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
What is it?

470
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,360
Finish your bite first.

471
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,750
Kagawa Shohei's blood and urine results came back.

472
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,450
- And?
- Back off.

473
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,480
Why are you so enthusiastic to hear about it?

474
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,220
- Was there any trace of poison found?
- No.

475
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,590
Now we're certain no one swapped his "poisoned" donuts

476
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,380
before the police arrived to investigate.

477
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,460
- You thought of that possibility as well?
- Even a buffoon could reach that conclusion.

478
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,900
Well, I'm sorry I'm such a buffoon...

479
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,400
Now to check our remaining theories, and...

480
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,110
What?
<i>[Hospital Directory]</i>

481
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,980
He's gone?

482
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,670
Kagawa Shohei is gone?

483
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,500
- He was discharged.
- <i>What? (English)</i>

484
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,840
Why English? And his diagnosis was all clear, so...

485
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,710
Did you run that diagnosis yourself?

486
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,220
Did you see he was "well" for yourself?

487
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,460
Don't just readily accept a diagnosis run by someone else.

488
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,430
Are you certain that the diagnosis was right?

489
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,390
A patient's life only begins after a proper and correct diagnosis.

490
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:16,490
You must hold yourself accountable and use your own judgment to reach that answer.

491
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,200
Stand.

492
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,420
Take pride in your diagnosis.

493
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,560
Now, we launch a raid.

494
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,030
Yes... Wait, what?

495
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,920
That damned neurosurgeon!

496
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,870
We can't blame him, Doctor...

497
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,190
Why did you allow that man to be discharged?

498
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,470
A-Are you all right?

499
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,630
You fool. What have you done?

500
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,640
There was nothing wrong with the patient.

501
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,230
How can you be certain? Did you—

502
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,050
Yes?

503
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,660
What?

504
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,100
- What's wrong?
- Kagawa-san has lost consciousness again.

505
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,200
He is spasming and will arrive via ambulance momentarily.

506
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,700
Sensei Takao! Again?

507
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,260
Let us hurry; without haste.

508
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,010
Hurry... without haste.

509
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,480
Exactly.

510
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,280
Hurry, without haste.

511
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,480
Hurry, without haste.

512
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,630
Hurry, without haste.

513
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,380
Hurry, without haste.

514
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,460
Something is definitely amiss.

515
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,690
Hurry, without haste.

516
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,210
- Kagawa-san, can you hear us?
- Get the portable X-ray.

517
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,010
- And prepare the ultrasound.
- Dear...

518
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,860
Dad!

519
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,030
- Dad!
- This will pinch a bit.

520
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,230
What happened?

521
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,690
He ate the donuts we brought from home, only to mention an odd taste again.

522
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,720
He felt ill and began shaking when he suddenly fainted...

523
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,670
He's my patient. I will handle this.

524
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,640
- Get out of my way!
- Excuse me.

525
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,940
Make way.

526
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,480
What is that, Sensei Takao?

527
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,950
- Just watch.
- What are you doing?

528
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,280
- Dear?
- Sensei Takao, you did it!

529
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,690
Is this... the hospital?

530
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,720
Dear?

531
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,480
So it was you. You poisoned me, right?

532
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,940
- How could you say that?
- Those donuts are the ones you brought from home.

533
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,730
- You poisoned—
- Shut it!

534
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,080
Exert yourself after I've unraveled the mystery.

535
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,560
Now let me run a question by you.

536
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,850
Did you eat anything sugary after lunch today?

537
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:24,430
No. That donut was the only thing I had.

538
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,580
It was poisoned, I know it!

539
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,130
You're right to say that donut wasn't your usual treat.

540
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,410
Someone swapped them.

541
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,430
To normal folk, it'd do nothing.

542
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:38,040
But to you, this "donut" works as a lethal poison.

543
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,480
The culprit is among us.

544
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,110
And that culprit is...

545
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,740
Move, you're in the way.

546
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,810
That culprit...

547
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,800
is you.

548
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:18,140
- Quit messing with me. Why would Aoi—
- I'm sorry.

549
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

550
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

551
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,350
- Dear, it's all right.
- I'm sorry.

552
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,290
- I don't believe it...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

553
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,860
Sensei Takao, what exactly is going on here?

554
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,110
Take his CT scan.

555
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,520
His brain is working perfectly fine. We already took an MRI.

556
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,100
The issue isn't with his brain. It's with his stomach.

557
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,870
Send the data my way.

558
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,520
So you see?

559
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,680
Now leave, this is outside your expertise.

560
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,200
- No.
- You're a neurosurgeon.

561
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,980
He is my patient. I wish to see this through.

562
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,490
Just tell me what's wrong already!

563
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,780
We found a tumor in your pancreas.

564
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,250
"insulinoma​."

565
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:49,400
It's a tumor that constantly secretes insulin.

566
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,830
Insulin is a hormone that maintains our blood sugar.

567
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:01,000
But insulinoma secretes insulin,
with no regard for blood sugar levels.

568
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,830
This is why you lost consciousness; due to low blood sugar.
<i>[Low blood sugar]</i>

569
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,970
Then I kept eating donuts for a reason?

570
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:13,150
You instinctively ingested lots of sugar to maintain your blood sugar.

571
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,560
Your symptoms from these last few days are also attributed to low blood sugar.

572
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,730
An ill feeling, tremors, and at worst, a loss of consciousness.

573
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,150
But I've never experienced these symptoms until now.

574
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,490
What was in those donuts I ate?

575
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,220
There wasn't anything added to them. If anything, they were lacking.

576
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,790
What?

577
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,770
The mood at home tipped her off.

578
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,840
I believe Aoi-chan chose to take action in secret

579
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,440
out of consideration for her mother and father.

580
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,700
Ma'am, you constantly scolded your husband for his eating habits.

581
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,260
Aoi witnessed you saying this would affect his health, time and time again.

582
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,380
That is why she bought a certain product

583
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,040
and swapped them for the donuts at home.

584
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,200
And that would be...

585
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,610
Sugar-free donuts.

586
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,930
"Always" offers both sugar-free and gluten-free options

587
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,650
that look identical to their regular dunuts.

588
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,380
<i>[Plain | Okara | Wheat | Soy]</i>

589
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,410
It's okay.

590
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,850
You were only worried about your father's health, right?

591
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:56,180
Aoi. Is everything he said true?

592
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:05,400
Sensei Takao. Earlier, you injected Kagawa-san with 50% glucose, correct?

593
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,600
<i>That's right.</i>

594
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,350
This is proof that you lost consciousness due to low blood sugar.

595
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:20,310
Then did he regain consciousness the first time because of the glucose contained in an IV drip?

596
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,600
Precisely.

597
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:28,160
This wasn't caused by stress from five years ago. The tumor simply happened to develop then.

598
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,890
The reason for your irate attitude was also because of this "insulinoma​."

599
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,350
Now we have a diagnosis.

600
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,390
All that's left is to treat it.

601
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:45,240
Sensei, will my dad get better?

602
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,150
If we remove the tumor, it's highly likely he'll recover.

603
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,740
You have a brand new life to look forward to.

604
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,560
I'm sorry.

605
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,380
You are so cool, Sensei Takao!

606
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,940
And I guess you too, Sensei Kotori. Though you did sort of steal her thunder.

607
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,820
Not "Kotori." I'm "Takanashi," okay?

608
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,740
No, you're "Kotori."

609
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,160
Why?

610
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,460
When did you suspect Kagawa-sam had insulinoma, Sensei Takao?

611
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,280
When I first spoke to him.

612
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,420
You heard his eating habits.

613
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,960
That much sugar would normally cause diabetes, which he didn't have.

614
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,930
That's why I suspected his body was secreting too much insulin.

615
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,780
Any competent diagnostician would be able to tell.

616
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,230
So...

617
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,440
When did you catch on?

618
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,630
Until you mentioned it, I hadn't noticed.

619
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,730
I'm not talking about that man.

620
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,780
I'm talking about myself.

621
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,670
When you advised me to "take pride in my diagnosis."

622
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,840
<i>Take pride in your diagnosis.</i>

623
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,810
<i>A patient's life only begins after a proper and correct diagnosis.</i>

624
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,120
That's when it clicked.

625
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,060
Sensei Takao, you put everything on the line to give an accurate diagnosis.

626
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,530
So I thought perhaps your life began from one such diagnosis as well.

627
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,550
You're an odd bloke.

628
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,250
I thought you caught on from my lack of understanding people

629
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,210
and their many feelings.

630
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,580
I was diagnosed to be on the spectrum.

631
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:08,320
Specifically, with savant syndrome.

632
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,930
You've gone quiet. Is that out of pity?

633
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,070
Is that how others have reacted?

634
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:31,340
I was just imagining how life goes for you, Sensei Takao.

635
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,170
Well, I bet I can exceed all your expectations.

636
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,760
Allow me to demonstrate.

637
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,510
When was your mother born?

638
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,330
December 23, 1958.

639
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,950
When the Tokyo Tower first opened, I see.

640
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,430
What's 1,958 times 12 times 23?

641
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,500
- What?
- It's 540,408.

642
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,210
- Favorite novel?
- "Run, Melos!"

643
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,960
"Melos was enraged."

644
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,950
"He resolved to do whatever he must to rid the land of that ruthless king."

645
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,920
"Melos knew nothing of politics. He was a mere shepherd..."

646
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,500
Hold on. Have you memorized the entire short story?

647
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,820
Want me to recite the Bible next?

648
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,330
It'd take several days, though.

649
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,500
I could recite 10,000 digits of pi as well.

650
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,790
My brain works on a different level from most humans.

651
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:28,020
The things I can and cannot do are unlike ordinary people,

652
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,070
but that is what makes me unique.

653
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:39,660
You've been blessed, Sensei Takao.

654
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,500
Precisely. This brain of mine is special.

655
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,790
I'm not referring to that.

656
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,620
All human beings are different from the moment they are born.

657
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,840
Even those who share your specific quirks are different.

658
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,630
Yet sometimes, society punishes those who are different.

659
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,700
They even try to do away with them.

660
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,710
Because those who are different supposedly disrupt the "mood" we consider status quo.

661
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,180
But you have the strength

662
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,250
to assert that the trait is your individuality.

663
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,790
And that strength

664
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:24,740
stems from the support and understanding you receive from those around you.

665
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,300
So, Sensei,

666
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,840
you've been blessed

667
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,820
by your surroundings.

668
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,790
Kotori.

669
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,110
I don't mind including you in that bunch.

670
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,670
You've stayed the longest of anyone, after all.

671
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,890

00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:12,720
Fine. I'll look after you while you're still around.

678
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,570
In that case...

679
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,230
Back off.

680
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,750
<i>Takao, who has trouble understanding others,</i>

681
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,840
and Sensei Takanashi, who excels at it.

682
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,340
I believe they will be a great pair.

683
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,710
- Sir?
- I've got someone to meet.

684
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,910
You're coming along as the hospital manager.

685
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,730
Sir, who will we be meeting?

686
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,660
You'll see.

687
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,300
Sorry to keep you waiting.

688
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:54,290
This is Kuraishi-san of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, and her secretary, Shioya-san.

689
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,510
I'm Ameku Mazuru. Pleased to meet you both.

690
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,160
Please, have a seat.

691
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,170
How about a snack before our meal?

692
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,570
These are specialties from my hometown.

693
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,510
They're called "Hoya Boya."

694
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,070
Cute, aren't they?

695
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,780
I'm a big fan of these, I tell you.

696
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,590
<i>[Hoya Boya - Snacking Kelp]</i>

697
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,080
You must be wondering why we're here today.

698
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,690
I can see your confusion.

699
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,860
It'll be faster if you take a look for yourself.

700
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,740
Here you go, Ma'am.

701
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,320
Allow me to explain in further detail.
<i>[Restructuring Hospitals in Western Tokyo]</i>

702
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,780
In short, new hospitals will not be built in this area.

703
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,730
Struggling hospitals will either be shut down

704
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,480
or be merged into your Tenikai Hospital Group.

705
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,980
Why would you propose a plan like this?

706
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,650
So she asks.

707
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,030
Money, what else?

708
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:05,190
And with this, we'll also be restructuring the departments in our hospital.

709
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,460
I plan on shutting down the I.D Department for good.

710
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,340
- Seems like they caught the culprit of the "Always" poisonings.
- What?

711
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,650
<i>["Always" Herbicide Poisonings | Culprits Arrested]</i>

712
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,750
Their goal was to short-sell "Always" stock by tanking their market?

713
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,810
Unforgivable.

714
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,810
By the way, I heard you'll remain in the I.D. Department.

715
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,360
Which reminds me. Why did you quit as a surgeon anyway?

716
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,560
Sensei Kotori?

717
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,220
Not "Kotori." I'm "Takanashi," okay?

718
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,990
ER in Tenikai General Hospital.

719
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,860
<i>[ER Entrance]</i>

720
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,490
- There you are.
- Sensei Takao? Why...

721
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,880
Our patient is Mizuhara Maki, age 28.

722
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,180
She's been seeing a psychiatrist since last month.

723
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,560
Earlier, while on a walk with her mother, she flew into a panic.

724
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,480
This is what our patient claims.

725
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,450
"Mizugami-sama* has cursed me!"
<i>(*God of Water)</i>

726
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:31,980
"Mizugami-sama is trying to kill me!"

727
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,690
- Mai, did I get that right?
- Yes.

728
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,050
Why did you tell her?

729
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:38,300
Because Sensei Takao loves this sort of stuff.

730
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,870
I sure do.

731
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,390
So you believe in curses now?

732
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,710
Try denying it.

733
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,690
"Sugawara no Michizane," "Taira no Masakado," "Emperor Sutoku."

734
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,770
These historical figures were famously haunted, and there are many traditions as well.

735
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,490
Can you deny explicitly all of this?

736
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,080
No? Then don't bother.

737
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,340
In other words, curses could very well exist.

738
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,180
Right. My apologies.

739
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:06,840
"It's a curse. Mizugami-sama has cursed me!"

740
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,740
No! Mizugami-sama is after me!

741
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,790
Lifting in three, two, one.

742
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,130
Coming through.

743
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,780
Please... Please save my daughter!

744
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,750
Her arms...

745
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,220
Maki! Maki!

746
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,200
Ma'am, please calm down.

00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,070
This is absolutely fascinating.

752
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,160
Let me go!

753
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,780
I will diagnose this mystery myself.
