and unravels their mysterious conditions.</i>

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,210
I've heard from interning in pediatrics.

00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,240
Three children staying in the same room were to be discharged,
[Kenta Miki]

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,700
except they all suddenly fell ill.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,360
Dr. Takao?

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,460
I must ask you for a favor.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,940
This is regarding the issue in our pediatrics department.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,970
Three boys staying in the same room
fell ill one after the other around the same time.

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,910
But the reason why remains unknown.

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,390
There's also been a mysterious occurrence, as I recall.

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,580
No. Don't wanna.

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,840
- No.
- Takao?

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,420
I'm not doing any favors for him.

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,440
This was a request from our pediatrics department,
to your Department of Investigative Pathology.

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,790
The I.P. Department is expected to handle cases

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,580
our other departments deem undiagnosable.

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,050

- Anytime.

We've finished all our check-ups for the day.

Dr. Takao?

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,000
Dr. Takao.

26
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,010
W-What?

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,740
We've gone through all our scheduled check-ups.

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,470
- Huh?
- You didn't notice?

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,760
Then I suppose we're done for the day.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,620
We still have the request from our pediatrics department.

31
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,030
Then go listen to what they have to say.

32
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,610
- The request came to you, Dr. Takao.
- I said, go.

33
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,810
Sorry. I didn't mean to shout.

Dr. Kotori.

36
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,860
- What?
- Where's Dr. Takao?

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,040
I was told to perform the diagnosis,
and pass her the results later.

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,590
Seriously? But there's no point if Dr. Takao isn't here.

39
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,480
- I'm offended.
- I'll go see what's up.

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,070
Wait.

41
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,560
I think you should give her space.

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,670
She's not acting like herself.

[Karte.5: Mystery of the Pediatrics Angel]

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,900
Since the department head, Dr. Kumakawa,
is busy with visiting patients,

45
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,810
Wakana and I will give you the rundown of our situation.

- Wakana.
- One moment.

Please exchange Takashi's IV then.

48
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,130
Will do.

Setting your eyes on Wakana?

50
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,660
What?

51
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,850
I can't turn a blind eye to cheating.

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,280
- I'm single!
- Pardon?

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,480
- Dr. Kotori is unfaithful.
- Not true.

- Until recently, he was -
- Woah, hey!

Let's focus on business, alright?

56
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,360
Fine. The issue is with the three kids staying in room 717.

57
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,270
The first one who fell ill was Katsuji Kihara.
[Katsuji Kihara - Age 14]

<i>One week ago at around 9PM, he suddenly began vomiting.</i>

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,900
Tatsuji?

61
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,920
<i>Vomiting? Maybe his digestive tract was still recovering.</i>

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,300
That's what we had also assumed.

63
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,560
But then we found him vomiting again, three nights ago.

64
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,070
Next was Yuichi Sakuta.
[Yuichi Sakuta - Age 13]

<i>And his history with asthma?</i>

<i>He seems to have experienced mild attacks in elementary school.</i>

69
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,620
But nothing for these past few years.

70
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,760
Finally is Atsushi Fuyumoto.
[Atsushi Fuyumoto - Age 15]

<i>He frequents the hospital for heart arrhythmia</i>

[Heart arrhythmia]

75
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,990
<i>Did he relapse due to his catheter treatment?</i>

76
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,730
<i>We're looking into that possibility, but can't find any glaring issues.</i>

77
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,860
That was his only instance of arrhythmia as well.

78
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,870
But there's a certain... other issue with these three.

79
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,510
An issue?

80
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,730
To put it in a word, they're brats.

81
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,880
As older kids, they have a tendency to act big.

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,680
They're bullies who make fun of others, and steal their toys.

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,620
Could their sudden illness be the work
of someone getting back at them?

84
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,930
Not only have kids and their parents been affected,

85
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,940
but those boys have caused unease on the team here as well.

86
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,710
I now see why the Director wanted to get to the bottom of this.

87
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,630
And I haven't even mentioned the real mystery yet.

88
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,320
Get ready to be shocked.

89
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,840
I think I'm used to mysterious happenings by now.

90
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,770
Rumor has it that an angel appears in this department.

91
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,590
Hah, angel... An angel?

92
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,350
Quiet! This issue is a taboo subject here.

93
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,270
One of our kids has started to say he sees an angel at night.

94
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,500
And not once, but thrice.

95
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,190
I'd reckon it was just a dream, no?

96
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,100
I saw the angel as well.

97
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,870
Someone must be playing tricks.

98
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,160
I thought so as well.

99
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:20,600
Those kids only fell ill after this "angel" began to appear.

100
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,390
And here I thought Dr. Takao
would come solve the mystery with a flair...

101
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,990
Alright.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,660

Ouch.

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,270
- Do I have to remind you...
- Alright, calm down.

here to check on you guys.

How were they?

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,700
Everything looked clear to me.

123

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,310
Indeed. She was absolutely worn down
by the time she came to my department.

175
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,930
That was when Kenta first arrived.
[2 Years Ago]

176
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,760
He'll be alright, ma'am. Call someone to check his nose.

177
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,220
Yes, sir.

178
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,820
<i>Kenta arrived late one night
because his nose wouldn't stop bleeding.</i>

179
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,830
<i>I had a doctor on duty cauterize his wound.</i>

180
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,690
Hey, you there. Wait.

181
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,230
Kenta Miki has been diagnosed
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

182
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,850
With the proper treatment, there's a good chance he'll be cured.

183
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm amazed you caught that.

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,490
Dr. Kid!

185
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,550
I told you, I'm no kid.

186
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,070
I am Takao Ameku, a proper lady -

187
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,700
Dr. Kid, read this with me.

188
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,310
You should take up his offer.

189
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,750
- Sure.
- Awesome!

190
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,400
Put out your fist.

191
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,440
Palms wide.

192
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,040
Again.

193
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,940
Come on.

194
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,660
<i>Kenta's attachment to Taka gradually helped her mellow out.</i>

195
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,070
And they became friends.

196
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,070
That, they did.

197
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:53,700
Although chemotherapy caused Kenta to lose his hair,
he steadily recovered enough to be discharged.

198
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,610
As a parting gift, Taka gave him a baseball cap.

199
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,630
Thanks.

200
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,920
- How do I look?
- Good.

201
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,020
See you.

202
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,260
Bye-bye.

203
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,600
Thank you again.

204
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,400
Even now, that cap is one of Kenta's greatest treasures.

205
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,770
Except...

206
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,160
He relapsed, correct?

207
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,260
Because he reacted poorly to the second round of chemo,

208
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,670
we attempted a bone marrow transplant,
with his mother as the donor.

209
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,810
But after a check up last month,
we confirmed he relapsed once more.

210
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,380
Should I rescind my request to Taka?

211
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,750
No.

212
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,970
If Takao refuses to carry out her task,
the Director will make it an issue.

213
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,770
Takao is a doctor, and head of the I.P. Department.

214
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,830
She must follow through with her responsibilities,
no matter what.

215
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:21,690
She logically understands, yet her heart remains frozen.

216
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,360
Reuniting with Kenta

217
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,380
must cause Dr. Takao more anguish than we can imagine.
[Patient: Kenta Miki]

218
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,420
Kenta will be returning home for a night?

219
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,120
We want to give him the chance while he's still able.

220
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,830
He'll be out before noon tomorrow.

221
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,140
Can Dr. Takao diagnose the other three while he's away?

222
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,080
I suppose that could be possible.

223
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,970
Dr. Kumakawa.

224
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,900
Can you please call Dr. Takao here?

225
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,150
- Ma'am...
- My son wishes to see her.

226
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,970
Ma'am. I am Takao Ameku's subordinate, Dr. Takanashi.

227
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,720
Doctor, my son considers Dr. Ameku his only friend.

228
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,700
And Dr. Takao feels the same way, ma'am.

229
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,310
But she is struggling with this predicament immensely...

230
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,550
Hey, what do you mean I'm being discharged next week?

231
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:15,050
We'll make the decision once we monitor your ECG another day.

232
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,370
If we see no issue, you'll finally get to leave.

233
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,590
Dr. Kumakawa, please move those children to a further room!

234
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,470
Ma'am, that is the only large room we have open.

235
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,710
- I'm begging you!
- Ma'am, please.

236
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,260
Let us speak in another room.

237
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,860
Right this way.

238
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,810
Did those kids do something to Kenta?

239
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,730
Back when Kenta was first admitted here,
they used to cause a ruckus in our playroom.

240
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,330
Gimme the ball.

241
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,930
- Give it back!
- Too bad.

242
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,850
- Hey, nice hat.
- Woah, he's bald.

243
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,910
But he's a kid.

244
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,410
- Baldie.
- Like my grandpa.

245
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,460
- Wait, "angels"? Are you serious?
- What are you kids doing?

246
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,540
Let's split.

247
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,290
Kenta, are you okay?

248
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:21,690
Three days later, we found Kenta's favorite picture book
cut apart in the trash.

249
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,310
Dr. Kotori?

250
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,970
I'll pass all this along to Dr. Takao.

251
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm certain she'll reason out a logical answer for us.

252
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,950
Hey! Hey, wait!

253
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,640
You don't need to rush!

254
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,060
This is the room where...

255
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,160
This is the room where the "angel" appeared.

256
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,050
Would you like to take a look inside?

257
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,670
Where did this "angel" show up?

258
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,130
Along this wall here.

259
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,020
Rumor has it the shadow of a winged individual appeared.

260
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,800
Dr. Takao? Is that all?

261
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,580
I've seen plenty.

262
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,150
Who the heck just barged in here?

263
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,270
That would be the head of my department.
She's here to investigate your illnesses.

264
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,090
Her? The head?

265
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,250
Did you three bully Kenta?

266
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,710
Who's Kenta?

267
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,180
If you don't know, then I'm done here.

268
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,130
Dr. Takao. Why didn't you check any of them?

269
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,760
I made sure to pass my eyes through your diagnosis.

270
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,000
You saw no abnormalities when you checked on them.

271
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,250
Then why bother coming here at all?

272
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,830
There was something I wanted to confirm.

273
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,470
Have you perhaps grasped the truth already?

274
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,730
Dr. Kotori! Give me your ear.

275
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,580
Ouch!

276
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,640
Kenta is coming back.

277
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,290
- What?
- He broke out in a fever on his way home.

278
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,410
What're you two mumbling about?

279
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,490
Just another moment.

280
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,500
Perhaps we could forcefully have them meet now?

281
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,590
No, that can't happen. Not now.

282
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,140
Hello?

283
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,220
Dr. Takao. Let's get you home.

284
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,690
Huh?

285
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,130
- What? Why?
- Just come.

286
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,510
Let go of me.

287
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,440
Dr. Kid!

288
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,670
K-Kenta...

289
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,260
I knew you'd come to see me.

290
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,980
Dr. Kid, I got another copy of my book I lost.
[An Angel's Night]

291
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,020
Let's read it together. Okay?

292
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,320
Dr. Kid?

293
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,210
Did Dr. Kid forget about me?

294
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,440
She didn't forget about you.

295
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,230
Dr. Takao just had a bad stomachache.

296
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,370
A stomachache?

297
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,600
She'll come to see you, Kenta. I promise.

298
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,420
You promise?

299
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,300
Promise.

300
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,060
And when she does, I know she'll be happy to read with you.

301
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,380
So could you wait just a bit longer for her?

302
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,840
Dr. Takao?

303
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,420
Dr. Takao.

304
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,170
I messed up.

305
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:27,350
I... wasn't trying to push him away.

306
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,280
My mind went blank. And before I knew it, I...

307
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
I...

308
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,180
I hurt Kenta.

309
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,160
Don't worry, Dr. Takao.

310
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,740
I promised Kenta you would come to see him.

311
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,470
Even if you couldn't bring yourself to visit today.

312
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,260
Kenta can't be saved.

313
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,100
He's only lived eight years.

314
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,150
I...

315
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,170
I can't do a thing for him.

316
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,300
Go and see him. Talk to him.

317
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,760
About what?

318
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:29,650
What am I supposed to say, if he asks about his own death?

319
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,340
What do people want from me?

320
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,560
I can never tell.

321
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,870
I might end up hurting Kenta.

322
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,520
That's why it's...

323
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,690
It's better, that I don't see him.

324
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,220
Before I came to this hospital,

325
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,220
I was looking after a patient with colorectal cancer.

326
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,070
He was a young chef, with a bright future ahead of him.

327
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,740
<i>After his operation, I had suggested he take anti-cancer drugs.</i>

328
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,280
But as a side effect, his sense of taste became distorted.

329
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,640
And as a result...

330
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,640
He chose to take his own life.

331
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,500
"As doctors, we have many patients."

332
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,490
"I can't speak to each and every one of them at length."

333
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,630
"There was nothing I could do."

334
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,930
That was what I had been telling myself.

335
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,980
But I soon realized I was only making excuses.

336
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,780
In reality, I was running.

337
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:19,130
Running, from the duty I failed to uphold as a doctor.

338
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,290
Dr. Takao.

339
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:32,620
You still have time to speak with Kenta.

340
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,460
Please don't run.

341
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,380
I...

342
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,510
- I am not -
- You're making excuses.

343
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,300
I know this is difficult for you, Dr. Takao.

344
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:53,700
Your friend is on the brink of death, and you can't do a thing.

345
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,010
But we are doctors.

346
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:05,750
We must learn to accept these difficulties as they come.

347
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,220
Dr. Takao.

348
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,370
Give me some time alone.

349
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,680
[Atsushi Fuyumoto]

350
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,450
- What happened?
- <i>Help, it hurts...</i>

351
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,330
Atsushi?

352
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,290
Atsushi? Atsushi!

353
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,950
- Let me.
- Right.

354
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,820
Atsushi.

355
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,420
- He's not breathing. Administering CPR.
- I'll bring a cart.

356
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,210
This is Atsushi Fuyumoto's ECG.

357
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,010
At 10:13 PM last night, his heart rate grew erratic.

358
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,250
His heart then stopped for 30 seconds,
and resumed beating afterwards.

359
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,950
Currently, his condition is stable, with no observed irregularities.

360
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,240
Is it possible someone snuck in,
and administered some sort of drug?

361
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,940
The three boys claim no one entered their room.

362
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,310
Their parents are beginning to suspect
our treatment is the cause.

363
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,210
Takao.

364
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:35,880
I hear you didn't properly check up on these three youths.

365
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,670
And now, there's been another incident.

366
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,550
I must say, I never expected this.

367
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,860
So you'll admit you made a mistake.

368
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,200
Me? A mistake?

369
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,720
Oh, I see now.

370
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,980
I suppose in a way, this was a mistake on my part.

371
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,200
You make a fair point.

372
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:04,280
But his heart stopping is really no big deal.

373
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,680
No big deal?

374
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,850
It was simply the result of a mistake.

375
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,550
On the culprit's part, that is.

376
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,930
So there is a culprit.

377
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,980
They're not only behind yesterday's incident.

378
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,090
They're behind the others' illnesses, and the angel as well.

379
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,030
It was all the same mastermind.

380
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,300
Taka, tell us. Who is behind this string of incidents?

381
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,040
Uncle. I'll have this case solved today.

382
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,430
Then you won't have any complaints, right?

383
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,610
You all are getting discharged tomorrow.

384
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,000
Lady, my heart <i>stopped</i> yesterday!

385
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,780
I understand the other two, but Atsushi?

386
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,460
He only went into cardiac arrest because he was here.

387
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,000
They'll be safe and sound back home.

388
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,620
But we still don't know why -

389
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,510
I said, they're leaving.

390
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,440
I'm second-in-command at this hospital.

391
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,820
They're getting discharged, and that's final.

392
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,250
Yoshida, could I get your help over here?

393
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,330
One moment.

394
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,750
I thought we'd find you guys here.

395
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,020
Why are you two doing this?

396
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,580
They're accomplices.

397
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,580
Their ringleader is Atsushi Fuyumoto.

398
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,850
I don't understand.

399
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,890
They got themselves sick on purpose?

400
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,110
Exactly. It was all their doing.

401
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:13,500
I understand how one could induce vomiting,
or even an asthma attack.

402
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,850
But Atsushi went into cardiac arrest.

403
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,560
That would be thanks to this.

404
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:23,370
It's a shot's worth of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.

405
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,670
It increases the volume of blood flow in organs,

406
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:30,130
and is used to combat dizziness and tinnitus
caused by blockages in the inner ear.

407
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,100
But there's another, more specialized use for ATP.

408
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,780
An emergency treatment
for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).

409
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:42,180
Exactly. In other words, a type of irregular heartbeat
caused by the cardiac conduction system.

410
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,030
<i>Administering ATP controls this irregular heartbeat.</i>

411
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,960
<i>But it also temporarily stops the heart.</i>

412
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,820
The heart resumes beating after a couple of seconds.

413
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,110
Injecting ATP is safe for the most part.

414
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:01,100
But it can cause vomiting, and discomfort in the chest area.

415
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,450
It can even induce attack-like symptoms
for those with a history of asthma.

416
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,730
You mean this is...

417
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,960
The reason behind their sudden illnesses.

418
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:17,290
And one of the most common causes of PSVT
happens to be Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome.

419
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,590
Otherwise known as WPW.

420
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,950
This boy has lived with the irregularities of PSVT,

421
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,350
and has frequently received ATP to combat those symptoms.

422
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,700
That's how he knew the ins and outs of ATP.

423
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,950
He knew it could be used to fake a sick feeling,
without much danger.

424
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,820
But hold on.

425
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,030
I recognize ATP can cause the heart to stop for a few seconds.

426
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,690
But Atsushi's heart had stopped for over thirty seconds.

427
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,580
That was our mistake.

428
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,320
Mine, and his.

429
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,380
Yesterday night, these two grabbed the wrong medication.

430
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,730
They hit him with this instead.

431
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,670
Dr. Takao.

432
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,860
Isn't this also ATP?

433
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,120
Look carefully. It's the dosage.

434
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,830
[40mg/2mL - 10mg/2mL]

435
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,220
Yesterday, they administered four times the usual dose.

436
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,460
- Atsushi?
- <i>Which of course caused the heart to stop in equal degree.</i>

437
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,620
Even without CPR, his heart would have revived on its own.

438
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,450
Substances like ATP aren't life-threatening, and are used often.

439
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,980
We don't keep a careful inventory count on them.

440
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,990
Which is exactly why no one caught on, until now.

441
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:38,550
Atsushi. Is everything she said true?

442
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,530
Then what about the angel?

443
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,900
Listen, your jig's up.

444
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,690
You might as well fess up yourselves.

445
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,160
Yes, ma'am.

446
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,590
This is the "angel".

447
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,680
A childish trick, isn't it?

448
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,260
These three extended their arms out that window,

449
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,590
and projected an angel into the room next door.

450
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,780
Isn't that right?

451
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:38,550
They cut out the angels from his book,
to turn the make-believe into "reality".

452
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,520
This is the whole truth.

453
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,400
It was all a childish prank.

454
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,150
Why would they do such a thing?

455
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,570
They didn't want to leave the hospital.

456
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:57,970
They had to project that angel,
even if it meant medicating themselves, or stopping their hearts.

457
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
It was all for Kenta.

458
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,470
<i>Hey, nice hat.</i>

459
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,800
<i>Woah, he's bald. But he's a kid.</i>

460
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,200
<i>Baldie.</i>

461
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,650
They're atoning.

462
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:18,280
You three hurt Kenta with your thoughtless remarks.

463
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,140
But Kenta's loss of hair was proof of his fight against leukemia.

464
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,640
And then you all heard... he didn't have long.

465
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,810
Out of guilt, you three decided to bring forth an "angel".

466
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,690
Kenta wholeheartedly believes in the angels in his book.

467
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,920
No... he wants to believe in them.

468
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,320
So you thought if you could project an angel
in Kenta's final moments,

469
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,410
he could rest easy.

470
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:54,530
We were only trying to poke fun at him.

471
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:03,450
But then we heard he... he's going to die.

472
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,080
We were awful.

473
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,640
That's why, we...

474
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,550
What a foolish stunt.

475
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:17,540
Still... to Kenta,

476
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:23,000
even the angel born of a childish trick,

477
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,620
may have helped soothe his fear.

478
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:47,480
But I have to share the blame for their mistake.

479
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,920
I had caught on to their petty trick.

480
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,070
I simply decided not to speak up about it.

481
00:34:54,070 --> 00:35:01,000
Because by keeping the truth,
I felt like I had done something for Kenta.

482
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,380
Even though I'd done nothing at all.

483
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:13,000
I... am a coward.

484
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,410
Do not disclose this case to any party.

485
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,870
Those boys administered substances themselves,

486
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,730
with a rather circumstantial motive at that.

487
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,300
I will speak to their parents myself.

488
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,390
And regarding our lack of supervision of those substances?

489
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,210
It never happened.

490
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,310
We do what we must to protect this hospital.

491
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,850
We're sorry.

492
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,800
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

493
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,500
Those three boys were finally discharged.

494
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,130
They apologized to Kenta's mother for their actions,

495
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,030
and she wholeheartedly accepted their apology.

496
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,790
I see.

497
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,500
Takanashi speaking.

498
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,800
I'll tell her.

499
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:20,800
Kenta's blood pressure has begun to drop.

500
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,610
He may not hold till tomorrow.

501
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:31,000
I don't want you to have any regrets, Dr. Takao.

502
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,920
Is Dr. Takao...

503
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,850
Doctor...

504
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,980
I can see an angel...

505
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,220
Doctor, this way.

506
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,340
Kenta.

507
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,540
Dr. Kid.

508
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,340
How many times do I have to tell you?

509
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm Takao Ameku, not "Dr. Kid".

510
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,080
Dr. Kid, you came.

511
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,100
Sorry it took so long.

512
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,330
Dr. Kid.

513
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:36,680
I saw an angel. Just before you walked in.

514
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,900
I see.

515
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,470
An angel came to visit, huh?

516
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:53,620
I think it's here to take me to heaven.

517
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,370
Yeah. You're a good kid, after all.

518
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,820
But I wish I could have stayed. Just a bit longer.

519
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,250
Dr. Kid, will you read me my book again?

520
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,160
Of course.

521

[An Angel's Night]

522
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,880
"Once upon a time, in a small hut in a far off town,

523
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:01,220
there lived a girl and her mother."

524
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:09,940
"The young girl loved her mother dearly."

525
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,590
"One night...

526
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:35,060
"'I have come to protect you two.'"

527
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,210
Dr. Takao.

528
00:40:54,510 --> 00:41:00,000
Did I do a good job?

529
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,310
Or...

530
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,820
Did I make Kenta suffer?

531
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,060
He looked at peace the moment he drew his final breath.

532
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:26,030
I'm sure he was beyond happy to see you, Dr. Takao.

533
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,830
Why did Kenta have to die?

534
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:34,150
He was only eight.

535
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,650
I am... powerless.

536
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:54,360
I believe us doctors must be fully aware

537
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,800
of how utterly powerless we are.

538
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,180
Only then can we face our patients with due respect.

539
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,240
I suppose so.

540
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,720
Dr. Takao...

541
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:28,320
Kenta's mother said this is for you.

542
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:36,780
The gift Kenta received from his only friend was his treasure.

543
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:43,800
She said she wanted you to have it.

544
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
Dr. Takanashi.

545
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,900
Please give her some time to herself.

546
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:20,960
I'm sure she'll be the Dr. Takao we're all familiar with
when tomorrow comes.

547
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,250
Kenta...
