<i>She speaks without reserve.</i>

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,170
Patients with similar symptoms are being treated with template methods.

<i>The curiosity to solve mysteries and the pride in saving patients as a doctor are her motivations.</i>

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,460
I'll use this here, and ward off Mizugami-sama myself.

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,480
There's been a murder at Seiwa General Hospital.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,080
A murder, in a hospital?

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,160
The victim is an anesthesiologist named Yuasa Haruya.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,130
The suspect is Mazuru.

Let's go.

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,830

00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,630
- What?
- You cannot simply barge in.

22
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,570
Ameku Takao from Tenikai General Hospital.

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,460
Your director, Hakamada called me here.

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,300
If you don't believe me, call him.

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,340
Just a moment.

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,420
You're acquainted with the director here?

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,790
My father was. He used to drag me here as a kid.

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,510
Yes sir, I'll let her through.

29
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,410
Miss, I've gotten his word.

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,400
Where is Ameku Mazuru?

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,090
And you are...

32
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,860
Her sister. Where is my Nee-chan?

33
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,890
I'm terribly sorry, but she is accepting no visitors...

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,260
- No, you cannot!
- Sensei Takao!

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,490
Are you alright?

36
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,530
Didn't I tell you? Family or not, no visitors allowed.

37
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,940
She wasn't arrested. Now let me see my Nee-chan.

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,400
Sorry, this is her physician's decision.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,570
I assume you negotiated with him not to let her see anyone.

40
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,570
Wanted to shut out the media and all that.

41
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,000
- Who's this?
- Quiet.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,500
Yes, sir.

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,310
Ameku Mazuru-san  is going through incredible shock right now.

44
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,830
- So, who...
- Back off.

45
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,770
Sensei Takao, perhaps we should―

46
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,330
In that case, tell me about the case first.

47
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,940
You can't get yourself involved in this one, Sensei.

48
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,420
You told my uncle this was a mysterious incident, no?

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,620
Indeed, it's right up your alley.

50
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,290
Which is exactly why I requested he keep you out of it.

51
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,010
You think I can't read between the lines?

52
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,410
"Keep me out" means you want me involved after all.

53
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,930
Your involvement would mess with the validity
of our investigation.

54
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,920
You think I'd twist the truth for the sake of saving my Nee-chan?

55
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,700
We can't deny the possibility.

56
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,340
There you are, Takao-chan! Long time no see, eh?

57
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,260
- Hakamada?
- You've grown... or not, I suppose.

58
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,280
Hands off. I'm not a kid anymore.

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,860
Come along now, Takao-chan.

60
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,740
Hey wait, I still have business with Sakurai!

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,790
Let me go!

62
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,160
- I said, let me go already!
- There, there.

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,270
- Ouch.
- So, what business do you have with me?

64
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,730
I didn't come to see you.

65
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,120
Still as hostile as ever, I see.

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,650
Say, how about some cream puffs?

67
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,340
I remember you used to stuff your face full of 'em.

68
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,720
I said I'm no longer a child. Don't treat me like a kid!

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,110
Sorry, sorry. I suppose you don't need those cream puffs then?

70
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,970
Of course I need them.

71
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,590
- Childish.
- Say what?

72
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,540
Nothing.

73
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,600
- Are these the sweet stuff?
- Sure are.

74
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,450
Here you go.

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,890
- What a kid.
- Quit treating me like a child!

76
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,260
In any case, what a troublesome bind Mazuru-chan's found herself in.

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,850
How much do you know of the incident?

78
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,180
I have a basic understanding of what occurred.

79
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,840
Tell us what happened.

80
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,460
The police ordered me to keep my mouth shut.

81
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,460
Please.

82
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,580
Because Mazuru-chan had a serious case of appendicitis,

83
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:54,220
we only proceeded with her procedure
after administering anesthesia.

84
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,130
<i>The incident occurred after her procedure when they were waking Mazuru-chan.</i>

85
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,430
- Great work, team.
- Yes.

86
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,910
Sensei Kurobe's keeping record again?
<i>[Operating Room 3]</i>

87
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,730

88
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,760
What is he doing?

89
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,050
Is he being attacked by someone?
<i>[Operating Room 4]</i>

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,510
Why?

91
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,910
- We have to save Yuasa-kun!
- Right!

92
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,220
<i>"Sensei Yuasa was fighting an unseen entity."</i>

93
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,720
<i>That's what they all had to say.</i>

94
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,930
The only other person present aside from Sensei Yuasa was Mazuru-chan.

95
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,770
Is there security camera footage?

96
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,430
Show me, now.

97
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,600
I wanna see it. I wanna see it!

98
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,460
Show me, show me, show me!

99
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,330
Throwing a tantrum won't make me budge.

100
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,970
What do they mean, "unseen entity"?

101
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,210
They're referring to an invisible person.

102
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,530
It's a rumor making its way around our staff.

103
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,590
This mystery is something I ought to solve.

104
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,520
This is a murder investigation.

105
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,250
The police may be investigators,
but they aren't medical professionals.

106
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,720
Mazuru-san is the prime suspect.

107
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,470
- We must remain -
- That changes nothing.

108
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,340
The truth is absolute. There is no room for empathy.

109
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,830
Whether I'm giving a diagnosis
or solving a mystery is no different.

110
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,250
I will use everything at my disposal,

111
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,210
and piece together the truth, considering all possibilities.

112
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,570
No matter how cruel that truth may be.

113
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:19,690
I don't believe Sakurai-san will allow us to speak with Mazuru-san, though.

114
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,630
Hakamada. Does your hospital currently have
enough surgeons on hand?

115
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,460
Not even close.

116
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,160
Then I suppose you'd appreciate any help you can get.

117
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,560
That, I would.

Of course.

Breath slowly.

174
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,640
- I'm flipping him over.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,840
From that point on, my memory gets a little hazy.

176
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,020
I did a bit of my own research on Sensei Yuasa.

177
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,970
He was originally doing research at Ryoko Uni. Hospital.

178
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,920
He then transferred to the clinical department here last April, right?

179
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:01,340
If I may ask, what sort of relationship did he share with you, Mazuru-san?

180
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,220
Simply put, he was a friend.

181
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,150
Before, we were only acquainted with each other
through gatherings held for medical workers.

182
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,460
We only got closer last March.

183
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,070
That would be when Sensei Yuasa quit his research.

184
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,810
If there is anything you know, please tell us.

185
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,980
- <i>Thank you for your hard work.</i>
- Come on in.

186
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,650
Unbelievable.

187
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,720
Do you take us police for fools?

188
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,590
You could be charged for your actions.

189
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,650
I am currently a doctor working for this hospital.

190
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,950
I was simply speaking with a patient.

191
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,730
- Listen here, Sensei.
- Mazuru-san is no murderer.

192
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,420
Well, the suspect's fingerprints
were all over the scalpel at the crime scene.

193
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,710
Do not call Mazuru-san a suspect. There must be a mistake.

194
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,790
A fool's passion is the cause of many such incidents, alright?

195
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,590
"Passion"?

196
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,420
I'm sure Sensei Ameku has told you.

197
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,040
- About what?
- In any case.

198
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,610
I'll be reporting this to the higher-ups.

199
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,970
But what do you mean, "passion"?

200
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,700
You never told me!

201
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,080
So Mazuru-san has a fiancé?

202
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,110
- Yup. He works at a hospital in Berlin.
- Are you alright?

203
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:21,180
The police ultimately think Yuasa had a thing for my Nee-chan and that led to the incident.

204
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,690
Like this is some cliché soap opera, or whatever.

205
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,030
- What now?
- You said Mazuru-san was single, Sensei!

206
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,650
I never said that.

207
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,160
Kotori, you asked if she had a boyfriend, which she doesn't.

208
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,180
And that's because she got engaged half a year ago.

209
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,830
- Has her fiancé been informed of this incident?
- Not yet.

210
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,420
He'd fly over if he knew.

211
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,580
Do you realize what's become of the outpatient care of the I.D. Department?

212
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,860
They've been juggling through all our residents
to act as her assistant.

213
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,550
- Has anyone lasted long?
- Of course not.

214
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,490
- I assumed.
- Until you arrived,  the I. D. Department was not functioning.

215
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,580
Do you realize what this means?

216
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,310
It means Sensei Takao needs you, Sensei Kotori.

217
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,950
- What a perfect pair.
- What the heck are you saying?

218
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,460
I finally get how all my aunties feel.

219
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,030
I simply can't leave you two be!

220
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,330
How old are you again?

221
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,090
- Rude!
- Who's the nosey aunty now?

222
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,320
Never ask a woman her age!

223
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,930
- What're you two mumbling about?
- Just the beginnings of a sweet, love story.

224
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,830
Like hell anything is "beginning".

225
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,180
<i>[Uncle]</i>

226
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,790
<i>This one's bound to be a less exciting conversation.</i>

227
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,320
No talking with your mouth full.

228
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:46,360
I believe we ought to dismiss Ameku Mazuru before the issue grows out of hand.

229
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,790
- Why?
- The police say she is the only possible suspect.

230
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,970
She hasn't been proven guilty yet.

231
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,400
This is a wrongful dismissal.

232
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,310
Agreed. We cannot be hasty.

233
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,660
Indeed. As for now -

234
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,530
I disagree.

235
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,100
If she is arrested, the media will storm our hospital,
and hinder our work.

236
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,300
Don't bother making a believable excuse.

237
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,310
Pardon?

238
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,420
Fire my Nee-chan, and there's no one left to defend the I.D. Department.

239
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,890
In other words, you can finally get rid of me,
and take this hospital for yourself.

240
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,840
Let us take a vote. All for her dismissal.

241
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,950
Yes sir, I am in favor!

242
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,050
- My Nee-chan―
- Mazuru-san has every right to decline your demand.

243
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,810
I won't let you fire my Nee-chan.

244
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,060
I will solve this mystery, and find the culprit myself.

245
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,850
- Who does she think she is?
- How utterly disrespectful!

246
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,930
Sensei Sumida, please calm yourself.

247
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,460
Mazuru-san can't be the culprit.

248
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,460
We have no time. Get aggressive with your questioning.

249
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,860
Gauze.

250
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,240
- Needle and tweezers.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,400
So the culprit is an invisible entity - a ghost.

252
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,620
Sorry, Yamaki-san's story intrigued me.

253
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,400
Could I hear more about this rumor?

254
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,070
Sensei Takanashi. How is the procedure fairing?

255
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,670
I'll be done shortly.

256
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,510
I should've expected nothing less from a Junsei Uni. surgeon.

257
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,660
Yamaki, learn from him while you can, you hear?

258
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,150
Say, Sensei Takanashi. Isn't our Nonoka-chan a fine worker?

259
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,630
I try to have her assist me on all my surgeries.

260
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,530
If I ever get transferred, I'd love for her to join me.

261
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,510
Though I'd welcome her as a girlfriend as well.

262
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,690
- Sensei, that is―
- I'm joking, no need to be so embarrassed.

263
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,770
How about joining me for dinner tonight at that bar I mentioned?

264
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,250
- Scissors.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,430
- Sensei Kurobe. We're in the midst of a procedure.
- Pay me no mind.

266
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,330
- That's not what I mean.
- A patient of ours passed during their operation last November.

267
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,880
- Pardon?
- I'm talking about the ghost.

268
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,940
Your hands have stopped.

269
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,640
- Right. A new thread.
- Yes, sir.

270
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,400
A 17-year-old youth was brought in for a biking accident.

271
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,040
Though we operated an abdominal surgery, we lost the kid.

272
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,040
- That was when the incidents began.
- "Incidents"?

273
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,760
A cart would move on its own,
people would see the shadow of a person... "incidents".

274
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,420
Sounds like the average ghost story.

275
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,380
Sensei Tsujino has witnessed these occurrences.

276
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,010
But she wasn't the only witness.

277
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,170
She was accompanied by the now deceased Sensei Yuasa.

278
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,680
Yamaki, we're in the middle of an operation.

279
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,020
Quit the idle chattering!

280
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,850
Sensei Kurobe believes he may be next.

281
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:09,030
- "Next"?
- The one operating on that youth was Sensei Kurobe.

282
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,710
And his anesthesiologist was Sensei Yuasa.

283
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:18,140
Sensei Yuasa was assailed by an invisible entity.

284
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,930
Right where the boy was operated on, in operating room 4.

285
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,950
The culprit, a ghost? You absolute numbskull.

286
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,830
Quit blabbering on about those rumors.

287
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,040
- Sorry.
- And pick up the snail's pace, will you?

288
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,810
Sorry.

289
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,520
Ah, right.

290
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,250
Does he always call for you,
even when you're not on shift, or on-call?

291
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:49,870
We graduated from the same medical school.
We were junior-senior on the school's rugby team as well.

292
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,480
I'm no dispatch from a university hospital like you.

293
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,660
Act out of place, and I might lose my career here.

294
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,390
- I'm done.
- Great. Now go check up on our patients in the ICU.

295
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,060
I'm heading back to our on-call room once I drink this.

296
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,640
Alright.

297
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,290
Just picking up trash.

298
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,520
What is it, Yamaki-san?

299
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,790
- What's up?
- A... A cart.

300
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,060
I saw a cart moving on its own.

301
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,170
Didn't I tell you to quit it with that?

302
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,660
But a cart rolled itself in there all on its own!

303
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,730
- Are you certain it was a cart?
- I'm positive.

304
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,110
There it is!

305
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,780
There.

306
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,390
A nurse just forgot to put it away.

307
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,850
No, it was definitely moving on its own.

308
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,280
- Impossible.
- See?

309
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,800
Woah, hey! Don't push me!

310
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,720
Go, go!

311
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,770
Don't push me.

312
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,790
- Sensei Yamaki?
- No one is here.

313
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,110
- There's nowhere to hide either.
- That's impossible.

314
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,350
Someone is in operating room 3!

315
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,170
No, I can't. Nope.

316
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,170
Not happening. Nope.

317
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,860
Hurry, hurry!

318
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,010
Something is definitely here.

319
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,440
Something we can't identify.

320
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,800
A picture...

321
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,440
Other way. This is Sensei Tsujino. Can you believe she's 47 this year?

322
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,400
Yes, I could tell.

323
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,730
- There.
- Okay.

324
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,900
- Hey, why is this guy a doodle?
- I couldn't get a picture.

325
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,320
<i>[Operating Room 4]
[Moving Cart]</i>

326
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,620
<i>[Operating Room 3]
[Scattered Tools]</i>

327
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,500
<i>[Operating Room 3
[Scattered Tools]</i>

328
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,780
<i>[Operating Room 4]
[Moving Cart]</i>

329
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,070
So Kotori saw this moving cart,
and heard the clattering tools himself.

330
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,120
How fascinating.

331
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,730
Don't enjoy this.

332
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,110
Mazuru-san has been suspected of murder.

333
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,740
The truth will remain the same,
whether I enjoy solving this mystery or not.

334
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,040
First a curse, and now an invisible entity?

335
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,010
This department seems to be an occult magnet!

336
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,930
- It is not.
- It is.

337
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,070
The supernatural refers to incidents
inexplicable by natural sciences.

338
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,160
And I combat those inexplicable incidents with logic.

339
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,780
Medical, Supernatural, Cases.

340
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,110
Altogether, they make a fascinating mystery.

341
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,720
And I crave for these mysteries.
<i>[A Fascinating Mysytery]</i>

342
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,760
I do not.

343
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,190
Sensei Kotori.

344
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,440
What was your impression of this "Akitsu Nonoka"?

345
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,070
She was charming.

346
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,410
- Like the type you'd want to protect.
- Like a girl you could save from harassment?

347
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,700
- Well...
- No! You considered it, didn't you?

348
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,110
You can't! You already have your destined partner right here!

349
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,470
- Don't go deciding that for me.
- Destiny isn't your choice!

350
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,030
What are you...

351
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,490
- Quiet!
- Sorry.

352
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,680
I'm trying to think of how to entice our target.

353
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,350
Our target?

354
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,160
Maybe we ought to threaten them.

355
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,280
- Threaten...
- Who?

356
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,360
The invisible entity.

357
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,070
It's 6 a.m. sharp.

358
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,960
The invisible entity has arrived.

359
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,980
Sensei Yamaki?

360
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,890
Why have you called me out here at this time, Sensei Takanashi.

361
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,670
So sorry for the time and place.

362
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,990
And you are?

363
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,360
I am Ameku Takao, head of the Integrated Diagnosis Department.

364
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,170
- Pardon?
- This is my subordinate.

365
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,720
I've had him infiltrate your hospital on my order.

366
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,590
I contacted you using Kotori's phone.

367
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,050
- What?
- "Kotori"?

368
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,770
My nickname, which I never approved of.

369
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,540
So you're the one who called me out here?

370
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,740
Why?

371
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,520
To solve the mystery of the invisible entity, why else?

372
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,770
I have nothing to do with that.

373
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,630
Then why have you come out here, at this time?

374
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,840
I know every stunt you pulled yesterday.

375
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,680
So I texted you the following.

376
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,790
"If you don't want me to spill your secret,

377
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:09,110
come to the Tenikai General Hospital's I.D. Department at 6 a.m. sharp."

378
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,820
"And bring your accomplice along."

379
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,050
- She really did.
- Your claims were so farfetched, I couldn't help but be curious.

380
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,850
Fine.

381
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,080
Then I'll call Seiwa General Hospital,

382
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,750
and see if my deduction is correct myself.

383
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,330
<i>Seiwa General Hospital, how may we help?</i>

384
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,240
- W-Wait.
- For what?

385
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,380
- I admit.
- <i>Hello?</i>

386
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,860
I created this "ghost".

387
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,810
- What?
- So please hang up.

388
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,560
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Never mind.

389
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,080
<i>I-If you insist?</i>

390
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,570
Jeez, took you long enough.

391
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:48,200
So have you brought your accomplice, as I requested?

392
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,630
Come in.

393
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,210
Why are you so shocked?

394
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,000
I mean, what do these two have to do
with the supernatural occurrences?

395
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,560
- Huh?
- Don't be shocked.

396
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,740
You still hadn't caught on?

397
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,040
Their stunt is something a fourth grader would pull.

398
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,430
Then please explain it
as if you were lecturing someone far younger.

399
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,060
I only need three minutes.

400
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,540
<i>I saw a cart moving on its own.</i>

401
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,530
<i>Didn't I tell you to quit it with that?</i>

402
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,290
<i>But a cart rolled itself in there all on its own!</i>

403
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,590
First you lied, and guided the two to operation room 4,

404
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,370
The cart was there all along.

405
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,290
<i>There it is!</i>

406
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,860
<i>There.</i>

407
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,680
<i>A nurse just forgot to put it away.</i>

408
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,440
<i>No, it was definitely moving on its own.</i>

409
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,570
With the halls being dark at night,

410
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:50,760
an accomplice could pull the cart into operation room 4,
using several thin strings.

411
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,760
The accomplice then retrieves the string
before the three make it into the room.

412
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,700
<i>Please don't push me.</i>

413
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,100
<i>Stay hidden.</i>

414
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,190
- <i>Sensei Yamaki?
- No one is here.</i>

415
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,390
The other two, too terrified to check for themselves,
would believe your claim.

416
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,080
Your accomplice was small.
All she had to do was stay out of sight.

417
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,800
- And before she was found...
- <i>There's nowhere to hide either.</i>

418
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,770
<i>That's impossible.</i>

419
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,550
<i>Someone is in operating room 3!</i>

420
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:34,100
While they panicked,
your accomplice escaped through the nearby exit.

421
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,850
Any objections?

422
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:44,150
Sensei Kurobe had always been scared of the ghost, so we took advantage of that.

423
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,830
But Sensei Yuasa's  case has nothing to do with us.

424
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,970
Nonoka and I have been in a relationship for two years now.

425
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,040
I see.

426
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,670
I could handle the harassment if it was just myself.
But that sleazebag...

427
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,770
<i>How about joining me for dinner tonight at that bar I mentioned?</i>

428
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,300
It was only raunchy jokes at first.

429
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,030
But as I continued to brush him aside with a smile, it escalated.

430
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,630
At one point, he almost dragged me to a hotel.

431
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,550
- Have you told the head nurse?
- Yes, and she reprimanded him.

432
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,320
But Sensei Kurobe couldn't care less.

433
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,490
I was told she could report this to our compliance committee,

434
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,980
but I hesitated on making this such a huge issue.

435
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:32,950
So you'll continue to scare him with these supernatural "tricks" like a school play?

436
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,440
If he doesn't quit, will you continue to endure his harassment?

437
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:48,390
Do you understand why this Kurobe chose you as his target?

438
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,350
The answer is simple.

439
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,270
It's because you don't fight back.

440
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,740
Don't brush him off with polite smiles. Cause a stir.

441
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,480
If your opponent rubs you the wrong way, tell them.

442
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,200
Be clear, so they don't repeat themselves.

443
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,540
Don't rely on your lover.

444
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,660
Nothing will change if you don't fight for yourself.

445
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,380
Fighting the battle requires energy.

446
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,680
But if you don't fight back, you won't ever truly be free.

447
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,690
Even if Kurobe disappears,

448
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,620
the memory of his despicable actions will remain.

449
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,800
I'll only repeat myself once.

450
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,750
Fight.

451
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,620
You just need the resolve to do so.

452
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,800
People who have resolve are strong.

453
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,830
Somehow... I feel ready to fight this battle.

454
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,350
So do I.

455
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,860
Fight with your brains, not your brawn.

456
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,870
You'll find a legal threat to be particularly effective.

457
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,830
Thank you so mcuh.

458
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,640
We will figure out a solution, together.

459
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,030
H-Hey wait a minute.

460
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,750
I'm not done with you two.

461
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,950
- Onto the real business.
- Real business?

462
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,860
There's a favor I'd like to ask of you.

463
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,090
You won't say no, will you now?

464
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,290
- Nice hit!
- Nice hit!

465
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,270
Nice going!

466
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,000
We don't stand a chance without Mazuru-san.

467
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,180
<i>[Takanashi Yu: Patient Records]</i>

468
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,390
Sensei Takanashi. Here is what Sensei Ameku requested.

469
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,820
Already?

470
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,870
It was a bit of a rush job, so I may not have copied everything...

471
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,210
This is plenty. Thank you.

472
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,790
Then I'll be going...

473
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,680
Nonoka-chan? Aren't you on the night shift today?

474
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,110
Or did you come to see me?

475
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,050
No, not necessarily...

476
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,990
Sensei Takanashi, let's talk about the incident again later.

477
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,480
I'm certain we saw it wrong.

478
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,800
Nonoka-chan, let's go get some lunch together.

479
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,570
What?

480
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,100
I was only surprised. You grabbed me so suddenly after all.

481
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,480
Right, of course. I must've surprised you good.

482
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:52,600
How about we find somewhere we can be alone
until your night shift, hm?

483
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,880
Nonoka-chan?

484
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,010
- Don't touch me!
- W-What the -

485
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,110
I'm telling you not to touch me! It makes me feel unpleasant.

486
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:10,310
- It's called being friendly.
- It's called harassment.

487
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,920
Oh? Then are you prepared to follow through?

488
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,330
And report to our compliance committee? Yes, I am.

489
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:23,230
What can a hospital committee
do against the head of a department?

490
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,180
You can do it. Don't back down.

491
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,600
If they take no action, I will sue you and this hospital.

492
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,210
Sue? You hope to take legal action? Like that would ever work.

493
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,890
Really? I'd suspect otherwise.

494
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,280
- Huh?
- What?

495
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,350
I mean, there are plenty of staff here who would take her side.

496
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,700
Like the head nurse, for example.

497
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:52,480
And if it came to that, the medical commission
would rescind your license, no?

498
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,610
Sensei Kurobe.

499
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,870
I will let your actions slide.

500
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,780
But I won't be so forgiving anymore.

501
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,720
- I understand.
- In fact, I have been in a relationship with Sensei Yamaki.

502
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,550
- What?
- So please reconsider the way you treat him as well.

503
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:18,960
Otherwise we will both sue, and put you through a terrible time.

504
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,930
I'll see you around, Sensei Takanashi.

505
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,860
People with resolve are something else, I'd say.

506
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,440
Watching her really cleared my mind as well.

507
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,210
Have the police interrogations been stressful?

508
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,790
They only seem to be curious about my relation with Yuasa-kun.

509
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,710
Sensei Takao wanted to hear about that as well.

510
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,400
Could I ask how you two got to know each other?

511
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:02,000
Last March, I saw Yuasa-kun on a train platform.

512
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,550
To me, it looked like he was about to jump.

513
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,440
At that time, Yuasa-kun denied it.

514
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,710
We met again not long after that.

515
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:26,310
I had to give up my life as a researcher.

516
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,840
Why?

517
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,270
I lost my place.

518
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,590
Wish I could just disappear.

519
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:48,010
I think we've all been through a similar experience.

520
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,220
It's like being caught in a high-rise fire,

521
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,650
and jumping from an upper floor.

522
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,010
Jumping from that height means certain death.

523
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:06,410
But the encroaching fire stokes our passion to live.

524
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,800
So we jump to our deaths, because we want to live.

525
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,240
Wanting death, is proof of that desire to live.

526
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:22,620
To want death, is to crave for life.

527
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,960
That's not sea bream, you know?
(A play on the Japanese word for "to want" and "sea bream")

528
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:40,290
Yuasa-kun said I was a witness to his lowest point in life.

529
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:45,420
So why exactly did Sensei Yuasa give up his research?

530
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,310
He was never specific about that.

531
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,430
According to the police,

532
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,930
Yuasa-kun had feelings for me.

533
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:03,910
They suspect I felt annoyed by him, because I was about to be engaged and wanted to remain friends.

534
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,420
- But that's no reason to -
- I'm still uncertain.

535
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,180
Why did Yuasa-kun do such a thing? I simply don't know...

536
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,790
Mazuru-san?

537
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,100
When Yuasa-kun was about to die,

538
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,160
he attempted to administer a muscle-relaxant drug.

539
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,500
- What?
- He tried to stop my breath, and kill me then and there.

540
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,800
Mazuru-san is not the culprit. I won't believe it.

541
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,500
Let's get this playing then.

542
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,560
I'd like to see as well...

543
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,740
I can see perfectly. Here.

544
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,340
No way.

545
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,240
Back off.

546
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,630
There, does that suffice?

547
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,680
Yes, thank you.

548
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,240
This is operation room 4? I can barely see anything.

549
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,690
It seems this is after the operation.

550
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,680
The one lying down is Mazuru-san. She's alone with Sensei Yuasa.

551
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,530
That's not necessarily true.

552
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:17,420
This camera only shows the entryway.

553
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,430
Unlike this other footage, with the meandering odd man here.

554
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,040
That would be Sensei Kurobe.

555
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,450
Whenever he jots down his surgical records,
he holes himself up in a clean operation room.

556
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,890
Is the camera in operation room 4 the only one not calibrated?

557
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,200
He really is being assailed by an invisible entity.

558
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:14,600
So the staff watching noticed the oddity,
and fixed the camera angle.

559
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,980
This is when he was attempting to administer
the muscle-relaxant.

560
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:25,720
No one came and went. They were the only ones in this room.

561
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,160
In other words, this is a locked room mystery.

562
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,050
It cuts off here!

563
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,540
She rushed to copy as much as she could.

564
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,590
- Go get the rest, now.
- The records are kept past the anesthesiologist office.

565
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,810
Isn't that why you had Nonoka-san retrieve them?

566
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,300
In any case, I'll ask her to try again tomorrow.

567
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Seems like we have no choice.

568
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,970
For now... Time for a test of courage.

569
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,580
Pardon?

570
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,700
Now?

571
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,790
This is bad. This is really bad.

572
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,720
Spineless coward.

573
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,280
You're that scared of ghosts?

574
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,970
I'm terrified of being found for trespassing!

575
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,120
If my Nee-chan is innocent, then this couldn't have been a locked room mystery.

576
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,150
You're saying the culprit was actually hiding somewhere?

577
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,580
Forensics would've found a clue left behind.

578
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,590
Maybe they missed a spot.

579
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,520
You certainly would, Kotori.

580
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,820
Now keep watch, I'll do this myself.

581
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,200
Roger that.

582
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,620
Hey!

583
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,180
- Have you found anything?
- No.

584
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,790
There seem to be no hidden pathways nor doors.

585
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,570
- Hoist me up.
- What?

586
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:15,130
I want to check this duct, so hurry and hoist me up.

587
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,550
Right.

588
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,300
Why are you groping my legs, you perv?

589
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,370
Don't say things like that! How else am I supposed to hold you up?

590
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:36,040
Are you sure you're not trying to cop a feel while you can?

591
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,140
Worry not, Sensei Takao. I have no ulterior motives, and never will.

592
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,660
What the heck is that supposed to -

593
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,970
Quiet!

594
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,980
- Are you alright?
- O-Of course I am.

595
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,800
Could you get a bit taller?

596
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,660
There.

597
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,640
You brought a screwdriver?

598
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,000
- Okay. Hold this.
- Yes.

599
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,870
This duct is connected to the other operation room, as expected.

600
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,000
Is it wide enough to allow a person through?

601
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Absolutely not.

602
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,840
- You can let me down now.
- Yes.

603
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,490
- Slowly!
- Quiet!

604
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,940
- Slowly. Slowly!
- I will, I will.

605
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,050
Careful!

606
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,580
The next thing to consider...

607
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,400
Is the possibility of the murder happening elsewhere.

608
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,890
When Yuasa was suffering,
Kurobe was nowhere to be seen on camera.

609
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:44,360
- Perhaps he was in a blind spot?
- Maybe, and yet maybe not.

610
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,190
I almost always bump this corner...

611
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:09,570
team cred.

612
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,060
- How does it look?
- There's nothing suspicious.

613
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,640
It's unlikely the murder happened elsewhere.

614
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,900
- Put me down.
- What are the other possibilities?

615
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,600
Put me down first.

616
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,880
I have insisted Mazuru-san is innocent many times now.

617
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,840
But you never agreed with me, Sensei Takao.

618
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,020
That's because I haven't ruled out the fact my Nee-chan could be guilty.

619
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,040
When she awoke from her anesthesia, her mind was still muddled.

620
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,300
<i>Breath slowly.</i>

621
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,500
When she came to, Yuasa was in her face.

622
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,270
With her marriage drawing close, she panicked at the other man,

623
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,900
grabbed the first thing she could,

624
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,600
and slashed with what happened to be a scalpel.

625
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,100
A scalpel, which caught him straight in the neck.

626
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,840
This is likely what the police have deduced.

627
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,640
And you agree with them, Sensei Takao?

628
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,900
We still know nothing of the "entity"
the victim was fighting against.

629
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:13,500
But what's adding to the theory of my Nee-chan being the culprit,

630
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,110
is that muscle-relaxant.

631
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,580
- Oh!
- Hey, watch it!

632
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,980
And how long do I have to be up here?

633
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,540
Let me down already.

634
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,700
- Slowly. Slowly!
- Stay still!

635
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,210
- Slowly, slowly!
- Yes! I got!

636
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,610
Jeez.

637
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,280
- So, what?
- Vecuronium (Bekuro).

638
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,890
The muscle-relaxant used here is Vecuronium bromide.

639
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,540
And what about it?

640
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,280
I get it now.

641
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,200
Vecuronium (Bekuro) is an anagram for "Kurobe".

642
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,700
Yuasa Haruya wanted to tell us Kurobe was the culprit.

643
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,140
Which means the drug was a dying message!

644
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,900
- Are you being serious right now?
- What?

645
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,300
If he wanted to leave a message, write a name in blood.

646
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,740
There was plenty of blood to spare. It's easier.

647
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,600
Kotori. How many people have you attended to in your career?

648
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,710
Our line of work has us deal with numerous lives,
more than we could ever count.

649
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,700
Now think back to those experiences, and those people.

650
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:24,300
Would a person on the brink of death
think about

651
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,790
leaving a message for those that come after?

652
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,710
No, they wouldn't.

653
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:34,500
A dying message only occurs in a work of fiction.

654
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,460
When facing death in the face,

655
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,200
there are only two instinctual actions a human will take.

656
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:47,090
One. They will protect someone important to them.

657
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:51,650
Two. They will fight back at their assailant.

658
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,000
And given the situation, she would have had to fight back.

659
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,100
Which means the culprit is...

660
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,800
My Nee-chan.
