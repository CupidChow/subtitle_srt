1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,370
Why are we talking about abolishing the department now?

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,070
Do you recall diagnosing a seven-year-old boy
named Soichiro Suzuhara about a month and a half ago?

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,590
You've been sued for medical malpractice.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,280
You're saying I made a misdiagnosis?

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,810
The mother cut down on her son's intake of vitamin A
as you instructed.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,780
And though the pain in his limbs have died down,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,290
the nausea and vomiting

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,390
did not completely disappear.
[Complaint]

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,410
In fact, he now occasionally faints,
[The accused: Takao Ameku]

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,790
and struggles to walk.
[The child suffers symptoms post-diagnosis...]

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,870
The boy is currently resting in our pediatrics department.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,930
There's no way I would make a misdiagnosis.

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,320
Whether you made a mistake or not doesn't matter.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,380
The issue is that a lawsuit damages our institute's reputation,

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,380
which then greatly affects the workings of this hospital.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,460
Still obsessed with money, I see.

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,240
Making sure the hospital runs smoothly is my job as director.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,780
The I.P. Department has saved many patients thus far.

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,340
I agree.

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,190
Which is why I've prepared an alternative proposal
for our board meeting.

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,930
It reads, "Limiting responsibilities of the I.P. Department".

22
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,720
You would mainly perform rounds,
and act as consultant to other departments when necessary.

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
So I'd lose the right to diagnose patients directly,

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,160
but you'd keep me around as a useful tool.

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,930
In that case, what happens to Kotori?

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,740
He didn't tell you about going to the UK?

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,980
- Oh.
- What do you mean, "oh"?

28
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,570
Well, the director gave me a wonderful opportunity
to study overseas with experts, and...

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,220
Enough. You're mine.

30
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,360
Work for me. You'll work for me, forever.

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,780
I never realized I meant so much...

32
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,620
Where else am I supposed to find an assistant as useful,
and fun to tease as him?

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,130
I'm not letting some other schmuck boss him around.

34
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,080
- Oh, that.
- Either way,

35
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,190
the proposal stems from an appeal
made by other department heads.

36
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,450
I am only trying to curb their demands to satisfy both parties.

37
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,050
Sure you are, you con man.

38
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,980
I know your true goal is to suck the department dry,
and chase me out of my place.

39
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,360
So what?

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,270
Accuse me all you wish, but everything will be decided
at our board meeting in three days' time.

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,460
Come on in.

42
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,400
Takao. We need to talk.

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,200
I am Shinozaki, your lawyer.

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,080
First, allow me to clarify one thing.
Takao, are you certain your diagnosis was correct?

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,360
Here are the kid's results from a month and a half ago.

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,520
These are symptoms of ingesting too much vitamin A.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,720
My diagnosis helped him at the time.

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,430
But it's entirely possible those vitamins
were keeping some other ailment at bay.

49
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,850
Cutting down may be causing this issue to rear its head now.

50
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,480
I never doubted you, Takao.
That was why I had Mr. Shinozaki look further into it.

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,960
I am Shinozaki, your lawyer.

52
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,550
Ma'am, the plaintiff cares very little about winning this case.

53
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,210
She simply wished to sue.

54
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,450
Why? I don't understand.

55
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,950
You must have invoked her wrath, Doc.

56
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,810
However, the plaintiff states she will withdraw her case,
if she receives a formal apology from you.

57
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,770
With no lawsuit,
all talk of abolishing the I.P. Department would cease.

58
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,880
- Kotori. We're heading to the pediatrics department.
- Yes, ma'am.

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,650
Will you really be able to apologize?

60
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,330
Why do I have to apologize?

61
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,620
Listen well. An apology serves as a way to atone for one's sin.

62
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,010
- I am aware.
- And I've committed no sin. So I have no need to apologize.

63
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,060
- Then why are we heading over to pediatrics?
- To diagnose the child.

64
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,170
Of course.

65
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,830
I'll diagnose Soichiro Suzuhara before the board meeting,
and have his mother withdraw her case.

66
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,390
I will diagnose this mystery myself.

67
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,130
Combating a lawsuit with her own diagnosis?
[Last Karte: Mystery of the Made-to-Order Poison]

68
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,940
What a badass!
[Last Karte: Mystery of the Made-to-Order Poison]

69
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,990
I see why you fell hard for her.

70
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,430
Please don't.

71
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,110
His condition has gotten worse compared to my last diagnosis.

72
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,730
He's usually a spirited kid.

73
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,260
But he falls ill once every several days like clockwork.

74
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,790
The whole situation has his guardian on edge.

75
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,680
You mean his mother who sued me.

76
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,410
Ms. Suzuhara is actually a nurse.

77
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,900
The hospital she's affiliated with has no pediatrics department,

78
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,150
so she comes to visit whenever visiting hours allows her to.

79
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,680
She gave her son too many vitamins as a nurse?

80
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,440
- She ought to hit the books.
- Right?

81
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,750
I mean, I understand being a protective parent and all.

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,510
She's raised her sickly son on her own
ever since she divorced her husband.

83
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,810
- But that's no reason to...
- Konoike.

84
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,540
This is no place to gossip.

85
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,000
I was informing Dr. Takao of the situation.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,280
You deserved that.

87
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,110
Taka. I've heard you're in dire straits.

88
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,530
I just need to diagnose the kid.

89
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,980
We've run tests for practically every ailment we could think of.

90
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,580
Nothing was amiss.

91
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,890
Soichiro Suzuhara has a history with asthma and epilepsy, no?

92
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,160
He takes medication for them both.

93
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,140
He hasn't suffered a fit in over a year.

94
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,510
- Do his medications have side effects?
- Right, like theophylline.

95
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,330
That could cause nausea from high blood levels.

96
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,780
He takes antileukotrienes for his asthma.

97
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,680
Don't forget something so crucial. <i>You</i> diagnosed the child.

98
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,540
You deserved that.

99
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,680
You suspect the carbamazepine, is it?

100
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,580
Precisely. His symptoms align with carbamazepine poisoning.

101
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,980
Have you considered his daily dosage was too high?

102
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,470
Of course.

103
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,080
But we've monitored his dosage and blood levels
for two years now.

104
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,730
They've always been average.

105
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:18,190
Which means Soichiro Suzuhara's ailment
is inexplicable given our current diagnosis.

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,750
Which room is he in?

107
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,750
He's in Room 11.

108
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,990
Are you going to see him?

109
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,150
Our records don't tell me anything.
I have to exam the patient himself.

110
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,030
But Dr. Takao, his mother is currently visiting him.

111
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,820
You...

112
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,640
So you've finally come to apologize.

113
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,700
I did not come to apologize.

114
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,800
What?

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,310
<i>You overdosed your son on vitamin A
simply because his eyesight was poor.</i>

116
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,000
Then have you come to blame me again?

117
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,850
Mom...

118
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,430
Sou, did I wake you up? Sorry dear...

119
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,940
Ms. Suzuhara.

120
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,810
Dr. Ameku has come to diagnose Soichiro.

121
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,250
Diagnose him?

122
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,630
That's right.

123
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,570
I have filed a lawsuit against you.

124
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:26,110
And? Lawsuit or not, I will examine, and diagnose your son.

125
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,000
That is my job.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,840
What's more important to you? Suing me, or saving your child?

127
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,630
Isn't that obvious? Of course I will prioritize my child.

128
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,250
Then let me examine him.

129
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,800
Despise me all you want, but I am a first-rate diagnostician.

130
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Letting me diagnose your son is your best bet.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,560
Now that you understand, move out of my way.

132
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,470
Made any new discoveries?

133
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,540
What's this?

134
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,490
A carton of apple juice.

135
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,010
What's so criminal about that?

136
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,480
Dr. Kumakawa permitted it.

137
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,510
The ingredients looked fine to me.

138
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,400
Ms. Suzuhara had requested we serve a carton
with his breakfast.

139
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,650
Do you find issue with that?

140
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,640
It may be causing his symptoms.

141
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,460
Nothing was wrong physically, and his vitals read normal.

142
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,670
Yet he still suffers from a mysterious ailment every few days.

143
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,030
Cases of this sort are usually attributed to poison.

144
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,620
Poison? Did you just say <i>poison</i>?

145
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,540
Don't raise your voice.

146
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,990
Why do I have to face such criticism!

147
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:23,180
Even nutritional substances can cause harm
if they're taken too much.

148
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,510
In other words, they become a form of "poison".

149
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,670
I'm taking all these off your hands.

150
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,150
I'll have someone in a forensics lab pick these apart.

151
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,940
Kotori, Mai. Take them away.

152
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,340
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

153
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,020
That's all from me.

154
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,640
If you'll excuse us.

155
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,180
Wait!

156
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,130
If nothing is found within those cartons of juice,

157
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,280
I'll sue for medical malpractice, <i>and</i> slander!

158
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,790
Oh, but that's not all.

159
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,370
I'll spread my story to the press,
and destroy your career for good!

160
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,760
Fine, do what you want!

161
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,100
Kotori, you can come on up.

162
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,780
Really?

163
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,170
The forensics team are getting back to us this afternoon, yes?

164
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,380
- Thankfully that's before the board meeting at 6 PM...
- Not bad.

165
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,570
This is the hospital my uncle recommended to you.
[London Central Hospital]

166
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,890
Looks like they have a pretty first-rate team.

167
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,540
None of them come close to my level though.

168
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,780
But you insisted I remained.

169
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,180
Having a place for yourself is important.

170
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:37,250
I diagnose ailments of every kind, and save my patients.

171
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,490
This is simultaneously my role in society,
my hobby, and my purpose in life.

172
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,090
That is why this Department of Investigative Pathology
is the one and only place for me.

173
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,980
A person has every right to choose where they belong.

174
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,600
Choose a place for yourself,
and you can overcome all obstacles.

175
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,350
Where I feel at peace may not be the same for someone else.

176
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,400
That's why your destination is your choice.

177
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,480
I understand.

178
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,320
Takao! What is the meaning of this?

179
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,490
Sis, knock! You're always scolding me about knocking...

180
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,300
This is no time to fuss over such formalities.

181
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,550
And what brings you here today, dear sister?

182
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,750
Back off! Please, back off.

183
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,140
Takao. Mr. Shinozaki just contacted me.

184
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,240
Ms. Suzuhara has rescinded her offer to withdraw the case.

185
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,020
I did not go to apologize.

186
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,370
I went to diagnose Soichiro Suzuhara.

187
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,200
Why didn't you apologize?

188
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,610
I never did anything that would... require an apology.

189
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,370
You'll be sued!

190
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,120
Even so, I... will not apologize.

191
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,150
B-Because logically, it is simply wrong.

192
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:15,280
Sis, you know that logic is... it's the very principle on which I act.

193
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,820
Speak to me clearly, Takao.

194
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,970
I struggle to read people.

195
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:31,010
I struggle to read the room.

196
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,010
I'm lacking in departments
that would help me get by in society.

197
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,220
That's why I back all my actions with logic.

198
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,540
It's how I make up for what I lack.

199
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:53,110
Bending my logic, means bending my own personal principles.

200
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,480
I hope you can understand.

201
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,750
I'm so sorry, Takao.

202
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,110
I was pushing you to contort yourself.

203
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,350
But at our board meeting today, this department will be...

204
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,630
It'll be okay, sis.

205
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,770
Everything will be resolved soon.

206
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,160
[Konoike]

207
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,450
What?

208
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,670
Soichiro is showing symptoms again.

209
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,240
How is he?

210
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,640
He was vomiting just before. He couldn't walk, or speak either.

211
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,200
When did his symptoms begin?

212
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,280
About thirty minutes ago.

213
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,580
I'll be examining him again.

214
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,180
Soichiro Suzuhara. Can you hear me?

215
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,790
Do you know where you are?

216
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,580
Where...

217
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,330
Where am I?

218
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,300
He's disoriented.

219
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,540
On the coma scale, he's between a 2-10 and 1-3.

220
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,940
Though he responds to light,
there's a difference between his left and right pupils.

221
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,120
And I can't get a read on his nervous system
because our words aren't processing for him...

222
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,720
What in the world?

223
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,810
- Didn't we confiscate all of these?
- Yes, ma'am.

224
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,570
This is causing his symptoms!

225
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,220
Sorry, I'm the one who gave him some.

226
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,700
You gave him some?

227
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,990
I didn't realize it was causing harm...

228
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,040
Who are you anyway?

229
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,520
I am Ryuta Kanazawa, Soichiro's father.

230
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,750
Mr. Kanazawa is an ER doctor at Nankai University Hospital.

231
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,200
This is Dr. Ameku, of the Investigative Pathology Department.

232
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,630
Could we talk?

233
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,400
Of course.

234
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,150
Do you come to visit often?

235
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,200
I try to visit after my night shift at the ER.

236
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,440
I'm often asked to replenish his supply of juice as well.

237
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,450
When did you two divorce? And why?

238
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,410
Is this relevant to Soichiro's diagnosis?

239
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,880
We need as much information as we can get... don't we?

240
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,130
Exactly.

241
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,160
We filed our divorce about three years ago.

242
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,640
Momoka was especially strict when it came to our son.

243
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,360
Eventually, I had enough.

244
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,100
Why did you give up his custody?

245
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,970
My irregular ER schedule
would leave me no time to raise a child.

246
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,850
I see.

247
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,490
I'll convince Momoka to withdraw the lawsuit
once she settles down a bit.

248
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,650
That's too late for us.

249
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,140
Sorry. When it comes to Soichiro, I have no chance to intervene.

250
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,120
Forensics will get back to me soon.

251
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,190
That will close this case once and for all.

252
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:48,060
Doctor, I really don't think those juice cartons are the issue.

253
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,760
Soichiro has been drinking that brand since he was two.

254
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,140
And he's never reacted negatively to it.

255
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,980
All we can do now, is wait to hear what's in that juice.

256
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,510
We have six hours until the meeting.

257
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,430
Dr. Takao looks a bit anxious.

258
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,730
Are you not, Dr. Kotori?

259
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,330
Or do you feel secure, because the UK is waiting?

260
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,370
- If something changes, contact me right away.
- Got it.

261
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,000
Dr. Kumakawa.

262
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,760
If Ms. Suzuhara doesn't withdraw her case,
will the I.P. Department be limited as proposed?

263
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,800
I believe so. Though some of us sympathize with Taka,
most department heads dislike her after all.

264
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,770
Takao Ameku, speaking. What were the results?

265
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,430
- Dr. Takao?
- Taka?

266
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,730
There was nothing suspicious about them.

267
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:56,040
I had them check for every detectable poison, and nothing.

268
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,850
That carton was filled with normal fruit juice.

269
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,250
Dr. Takao.

270
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,220
Are you alright?

271
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,810
I...

272
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,810
I cannot diagnose this mystery.

273
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,080
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking over Soichiro's records again.

274
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,940
There may be something we missed.

275
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,190
There isn't. The I.P. Department will be limited in what it can do.

276
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,170
It's essentially getting axed.

277
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,850
Kotori.

278
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,640
You should go to the UK.

279
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,270
I thought I'd have somewhere I could return to.

280
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,790
- Huh?
- Once I gained experience overseas,

281
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:06,930
I had always planned on returning here.

282
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,270
The assumption had come to me like it was second nature.

283
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,000
Except, I was sent from my university hospital to work here.

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,490
So why did I assume this was where I would return to?

285
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,240
But now I finally understand.

286
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,600
This department has become a place of comfort
for myself as well.

287
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,480
I'll go to the director, and officially turn down his offer.

288
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,690
I'll dedicate myself to my patients here for good.

289
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,610
I'll... I'll apologize.

290
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,530
If I apologize now,

291
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,680
Momoka Suzuhara may still withdraw her case.

292
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,810
You would do that, Doc?

293
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,800
If it's to protect this department...

294
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,020
Bowing my head is a cheap price to pay.

295
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:19,480
If you bend your own principles,
can you remain the "Dr. Takao Ameku" that you are?

296
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,640
Do you remember what you told me when I first arrived here?

297
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,550
<i>A patient's life only begins</i>

298
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,570
<i>after a proper, and correct diagnosis.</i>

299
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,210
<i>You must hold yourself accountable,
and use your own judgement to reach that answer.</i>

300
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,070
- <i>Take pride in your diagnosis.</i>
- Take pride in your diagnosis.

301
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,590
Right now what you ought to do is diagnose Soichiro with pride.

302
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Dr. Takao Ameku is a genius, is she not?

303
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,620
Then wow us with your ingenuity,

304
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,840
and diagnose this mystery like it's mere trifle.

305
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,020
You're entirely right.

306
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,130
I am a genius.

307
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,800
There's no mystery I can't solve.

308
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,140
- W-Woah.
- Hello there, you two.

309
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,330
Dr. Kumakawa said I ought to help you two for the day, and...

310
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,710
W-What in the -

311
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,700
B-But... huh?

312
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,520
Sorry to intrude.

313
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,540
Hey, you misunderstand.

314
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,530
Aw, don't mind me.

315
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,210
- I'm telling you, it's not like that!
- Pipe down!

316
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,440
We're looking over all of Soichiro Suzuhara's records again.

317
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,040
- Mai, you're helping.
- With pleasure!

318
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,450
This is no time to smile, we only have six hours remaining!

319
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,940
Nothing.

320
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,690
No ailments are attributed to these symptoms!

321
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,460
Why can't I figure it out?

322
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,110
Doc, calm down.

323
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,850
He was poisoned! It's the only reasonable answer I can think of.

324
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,220
He was poisoned, he was poisoned!

325
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,070
That boy is being poisoned once every few days!

326
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,200
But Soichiro says he hasn't ingested anything
aside from our meals and those juice boxes.

327
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,620
His symptoms always trigger in the morning.

328
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,530
- A nurse monitors his medication, right?
- Yup.

329
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,330
He's given carbamazepine for epilepsy every morning.

330
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,260
Large amounts of carbamazepine can trigger similar symptoms.

331
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,540
- Maybe the culprit is a nurse?
- No!

332
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,780
It's always a different nurse on duty when he falls ill. Check!

333
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,340
Besides, his symptoms began before he was admitted here.

334
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,460
- True.
- Then what about his father?

335
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,500
He visits in the morning,
and could pull a stunt outside the hospital.

336
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,040
- He would know about medicines as well.
- No, no!

337
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,350
Check his visitation records.

338
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,640
There's no correlation between Soichiro Suzuhara's symptoms,
and his father's visits!

339
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,240
It's true.

340
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,970
That juice is the cause, I know it!

341
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:27,620
Why can't we find anything wrong with it?

342
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,360
I got it! He's allergic to something in the hospital food.

343
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,910
No, no, no!

344
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,790
Did that look like an allergic reaction to you?
Get your eyes replaced!

345
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,170
Hey, I'm trying to rack my brains, too.

346
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,910
Then give me a more plausible hypothesis.

347
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,180
Have you learned nothing?

348
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,470
Enough with the married skit, you two.

349
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,510
- We're not married.
- We're not married.

350
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,000
Great harmonizing. Now let's calm down, okay?

351
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,060
If I recall correctly, Soichiro has no food allergies.

352
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,760
And although he's no picky eater, he is a bit averse to fruits.

353
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
He drinks a box of fruit juice every morning.

354
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,780
He only drinks that because his mother tells him to.

355
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,410
He says there's sometimes a bitter flavor
he especially doesn't like.

356
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,600
Takao, the meeting starts in five minutes.

357
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,810
Sis, give me a moment.

358
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,710
I want more time to think.

359
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,040
We can't. The fate of this department is first on the itinerary.

360
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,450
If you're not present, they'll proceed with the proposal.

361
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,080
The I.P. Department will be limited for good.

362
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,460
I'll be off.

363
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,150
Takao?

364
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,780
Repeat what you said earlier.

365
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,180
- Erm...
- Not you. Mai.

366
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,850
- When earlier?
- 46 seconds earlier.

367
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,550
Why did you say Soichiro Suzuhara was averse to fruits?

368
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,460
Because sometimes there's a bitter juice box.

369
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,070
Bitter!

370
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,360
Dr. Takao?

371
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,530
Apple, Grape, Orange, Peach, Pineapple...

372
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,450
How didn't I catch on? It's so simple!

373
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,610
Have you figured something out, Dr. Takao?

374
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,500
I knew it wasn't just poison.
There was something far more sinister hidden in plain sight.

375
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,700
If we left things be, that kid's life would've been in danger.

376
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,710
I knew it, I'm a genius!

377
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,130
- Dr. Takao?
- No time to explain.

378
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,160
We'll need to prove my point before their proposal goes through.

379
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,620
I have a mission for you both.

380
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,050
[Nurse's Station]

381
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,980
As we planned, you'll -

382
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,180
- Mission starts now.
- Huh?

383
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,390
We're terribly sorry for our tardiness.

384
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,660
You're three whole minutes late.

385
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,200
Is everything alright?

386
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,000
What is it you needed from me?

387
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,020
Dr. Kumakawa wished to speak with you, ma'am.

388
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,450
Our first topic is regarding the future of the I.P. Department.

389
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:31,240
Personally, I would not call for its abolishment.
Instead, I propose we limit its responsibilities.

390
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,110
And where is Dr. Kumakawa?

391
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,060
He's not here!

392
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,660
I believe he will return shortly.

393
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,490
Why have you summoned me before he returned?

394
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:47,980
This proposal will be put into action
with a two-thirds majority vote.

395
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,230
You don't need to get up, Soichiro.
I just need to grab some things.

396
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,140
Where are you taking those?

397
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,210
I promise we'll figure out what's happening to you.

398
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,720
Do you have any last things to say?

399
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,160
What are you doing?

400
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,310
The refrigerator was malfunctioning.

401
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:28,900
- Hold on.
- What? Oh, watch out...

402
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,810
Sorry, ma'am!

403
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,670
[Yu Takanashi]

404
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,090
- Ma'am, calm yourself.
- Move!

405
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,110
Move out of the way!

406
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,480
Do you plan on staying silent forever?

407
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,020
She's got nothing to say... Or she does?

408
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,650
Director, let us cast our votes.

409
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,270
Wait right there!

410
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,830
What do you think you're doing?

411
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,210
My badge! Where...

412
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,230
Dr. Kotori!

413
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,360
Those in favor of limiting the I.P. Department's responsibilities.

414
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,090
Ay!

415
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,110
Finally!

416
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,590
Great work.

417
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,800
What's up?

418
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,700
Come on in.

419
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,820
Oh I see. She came along too.

420
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,850
What is going on?

421
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:57,260
This doctor stole the juice boxes from my child's room!

422
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,220
What is wrong with this hospital?

423
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,980
Excuse me, ma'am.

424
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,690
- Mission clear.
- Great work, my agent.

425
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,780
Who even are you?

426
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,440
Seems like I have no business here. If you'll excuse me...

427
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,850
If I'm caught, you're staying too.

428
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,430
I'm just an intern. I can't be -

429
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,640
Dr. Takanashi. Could you explain to us what's going on?

430
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,540
- Well...
- I asked them to do this.

431
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:29,220
I needed these juice boxes from Soichiro Suzuhara's room
delivered to me, no matter what.

432
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,600
That woman, by the way, is Momoka Suzuhara.

433
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,580
She is the one filing a lawsuit against me.

434
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,300
I bought those juice boxes for my son.

435
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,380
- Give them back!
- Absolutely not.

436
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,800
- What?
- I need these to prove my -

437
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,860
If this is a personal conflict, please save it for after the meeting.

438
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,940
Pipe down, my uncle's lackeys.

439
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,070
- Say that once more.
- Pipe down, my uncle's lackeys.

440
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:00,200
- How dare you repeat yourself!
- Huh? What?

441
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,450
But you're the one who told me to repeat myself.

442
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,480
Takao. Enough.

443
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,640
Okay.

444
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,100
Folks, please give us a moment of your time.

445
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,940
This will greatly affect our voting on the I.P. Department's fate.

446
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,660
Isn't that right?

447
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,130
I will have that woman withdraw her case, right here and now.

448
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,560
- What?
- Now?

449
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,720
Do you take me for a fool?

450
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,420
I will <i>not</i> withdraw my case.

451
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,410
I will sue, and ruin your career for good!

452
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,560
You <i>will</i> withdraw your case.

453
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,060
Why? Because I'm about to prove to you
what's wrong with Soichiro Suzuhara's body.

454
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:45,400
And if I can't, I'll grovel to you right here,
and pay whatever you demand without a court case.

455
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,630
Ms. Momoka Suzuhara, yes?

456
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,980
I am this hospital's director, Owashi Ameku.

457
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,780
First, please allow me to apologize for the actions of my staff.

458
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,510
And while I am aware of the circumstances,
I must ask you one favor.

459
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,680
Would you please listen to what Dr. Takao Ameku has to say?

460
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,060
If she cannot cure your son of his ailments,

461
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,720
then I shall publicly apologize for our errors,
and cover any and all reparations.

462
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,990
- Director, you really don't -
- Dr. Sakai.

463
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,210
What do you say, ma'am?

464
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,960
Fine.

465
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,180
Great. That seals the deal.

466
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,220
Leave everything to me.

467
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,970
Will she be okay?
Forensics already proved nothing was in those juices...

468
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,200
Dr. Takao said to leave it to her. Let's believe her.

469
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,750
She's drinking the juice.

470
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,820
She's got this... I think.

471
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,110
I knew it.

472
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,390
- Dr. Takao?
- Kotori. Come here.

473
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,840
Yes, ma'am.

474
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,780
- Drink this.
- What?

475
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,540
- Just give it a sip.
- Okay.

476
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,640
- How is that?
- Bitter!

477
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,530
- Mai.
- Yes?

478
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,310
Why did you say Soichiro Suzuhara was averse to fruits?

479
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,340
Because there was sometimes a bitter-tasting flavor.

480
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,570
None of these fruit juices look like they would taste bitter.

481
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,110
Kotori. Tell us what flavor you just drank.

482
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,370
This was grapefruit juice.

483
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,220
- I see now.
- Looks like you caught on.

484
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:36,740
This is the reason behind Soichiro Suzuhara's vomiting,
nausea, and loss of consciousness.

485
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,760
<i>Soichiro Suzuhara was taking carbamazepine for epilepsy.</i>

486
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,480
<i>Combined with grapefruit juice,
this medicine causes a spike in blood levels,</i>

487
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,050
<i>triggering symptoms similar to that of intaking poison.</i>

488
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,710
Of course forensics detected no poison from these juice boxes.

489
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,870
They were only filled with fruit juice after all.

490
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,050
Then why was there grapefruit juice
inside the pineapple carton?

491
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:06,760
Though at a glance it's a simple juice,
the inside is a made-to-order poison.

492
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,450
And like these cartons, there are people we can't judge
based on their outward demeanors.

493
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,660
Though they may look upstanding on the outside,

494
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,850
they are absolutely vile within.

495
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,410
I'm talking about you, Momoka Suzuhara.

496
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,350
You have Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSbP).

497
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,380
This is your area of expertise.

498
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,750
Munchausen syndrome -

499
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,740
- Stand.
- Huh?

500
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,260
She stood up.

501
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:53,150
Munchausen syndrome is a mental health disorder
where an individual purposefully harms their body

502
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,920
to appear as though they are physically or mentally unwell.

503
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:06,940
Munchausen syndrome by proxy is, as stated,
when a caregiver does the same to another individual.

504
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:13,050
In a majority of cases,
this "proxy" is usually the caregiver's own children.

505
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,120
They often devote their time caring for their proxy,

506
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,460
as a way of seeking approval from their surroundings.

507
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,260
You wanted to play the "tragic mother".

508
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,010
No! I only wanted to...

509
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:34,780
You're a nurse. Are you going to tell me
you allowed a patient on carbamazepine

510
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,110
ingest grapefruit juice anyway?

511
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,910
- That isn't enough to -
- His symptoms began even before he was admitted here.

512
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:48,840
No one else could've given him grapefruit juice here,
and at your home.

513
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,460
Besides...

514
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,930
You insisted your son drink this juice
because you replaced some boxes with grapefruit juice.

515
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:05,490
I'm sure if we searched your home, we'd find plenty of syringes
with grapefruit staining them.

516
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:10,900
Your son also overdosed on vitamin A for the same reason.

517
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,730
But my diagnosis broke your image of the "devoted mother".

518
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,230
That's why you overreacted, and filed a lawsuit against me.

519
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,000
Now we have a diagnosis.

520
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,680
Except, there's no magic medicine I can prescribe you.

521
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,810
Kotori. Contact the police.

522
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,360
The police? No, please.

523
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,060
Anything but the police!

524
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,350
It was an impulsive act, I swear.

525
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,220
"Impulsive act"?

526
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:46,450
The only reason Soichiro Suzuhara
hasn't suffered any after-effects is because he's lucky.

527
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,230
He very well could have died.

528
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:55,240
Those afflicted with MSbP can tell the good from the bad.

529
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,070
You <i>knew</i> your actions were "bad".

530
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:06,380
So you used your knowledge as a nurse,
to expertly make sure no one would catch on.

531
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,860
All to look "good" in other people's eyes.

532
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,580
If you have any objections, I'm all ears.

533
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,020
That's how it is, Uncle.

534
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,360
So, what will you do about the I.P. Department's proposal?

535
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,670
- Nice.
- Nice.

536
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,850
Dr. Takao!

537
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,450
Our work isn't over just yet.

538
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:14,570
I will take back custody of Soichiro, and raise him myself.

539
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:23,480
Soichiro, did you maybe notice your juice boxes were odd?

540
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,440
I mean, if the package advertised another flavor,
that'd be strange, right?

541
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,360
What? Then why would Soichiro still drink the juice?

542
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,510
His mother cared for him all his life.
He only wanted to trust her.

543
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,510
Dad, when you stopped coming home,

544
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,870
Mom was all I had.

545
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,560
Give up on her.

546
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,260
Momoka Suzuhara was only thinking of herself.

547
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,670
All she had was a narcissistic love for herself.

548
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,600
There's no medicine out there to cure your mother, kid.

549
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,600
Giving up isn't a bad thing.

550
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:25,800
Giving up means... things become more clear.

551
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:33,110
I can't understand people. It's a trait I was born with.

552
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,680
I had to give up on understanding.

553
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:48,630
But giving up made it clear who I was as a person.

554
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,620
When I asked myself how I ought to live,

555
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,140
I managed to find my answer by giving up.

556
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,160
Now we have a diagnosis.

557
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,790
You have a brand new life to look forward to.

558
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,580
Never forget the pain you felt today.

559
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:27,740
It'll become one of your greatest assets. I'm sure of it.

560
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,450
From this point forward, you'll live with your head held high.

561
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,700
Soichiro.

562
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,790
I'm sorry I never noticed.

563
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,160
I'm sorry.

564
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,630
You cornered the I.P. Department on purpose.

565
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:26,850
You had them work past their full potential to avoid the lawsuit.

566
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,750
Am I wrong?

567
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,040
That, I wonder.

568
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,770
I was asked a certain request by Director Ameku here.

569
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:41,640
He hopes to invite medical experts from overseas
to help teach our doctors at home.

570
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,600
As I said before.

571
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,500
Nothing is more risky than relying on a genius,
especially in medicine.

572
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,850
Either way, the I.P. Department will be shut down

573
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,250
in due time.

574
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,580
Tenacious man.

575
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,440
Tenacious?

576
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,950
He's a tenacious man indeed.

577
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,110
But I will not stop you.

578
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,430
Takao and her companions will overcome even that wall.

579
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,830
Oh? I'd love to see them try.

580
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,240
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

581
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,620
It sure is nice having a place to return to.

582
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,730
We've successfully protected our place to be.

583
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,250
I am amazing. Be grateful.

584
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,700
Yes, we are very grateful to you, Doc.

585
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,020
Still, you proved to be slightly useful, Kotori.

586
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,620
You too, Mai.

587
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,950
Thank you, Dr. Takao!

588
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,300
What a badass. No wonder you're in love.

589
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,620
D-Did you just nod?

590
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,100
Dr. Kotori just admitted he's smitten with you!

591
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,810
Enough with the baseless rumors.

592
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,420
I.P. Department, speaking.

593
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,200
We're drinking the good alcohol tonight.

594
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,110

I will call you back in a moment.

00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:35,040
Kotori, was that call from someone who saw our page?

603
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,540
When did you get this made?

604
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,330
We got it running yesterday night.

605
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,610
- So, who sent the request?
- Right.

606
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,310
It's from a nurse who works at a long-term care hospital.

607
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:48,910
Night after night, blood packs are stolen,
only for empty ones to turn up the next morning.

608
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,180
"This has to be the work of a blood-sucking fiend!" they say.

609
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,620
Sounds quite... you know.

610
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,190
The staff there say this was the work of a vampire.

611
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,640
A vampire... like a dracula?

612
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,720
"Dracula" is no generic name for a vampire.

613
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,310
"Dracula" is the name of the protagonist
in a gothic horror novel of the same name,

614
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,370
written by Irish writer Bram Stoker in the year 1897.

615
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,740
The character is modeled after an individual
from the 15th century who -

We understand. We'll hear the full story later.

- So, will you?
- Will I what?

618
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,230
- Take on the request.
- Isn't that obvious?

619
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:30,100
There's a vampire afoot. How absolutely fascinating!

620
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,780
- This is a mystery for me to solve.
- Thought so.
