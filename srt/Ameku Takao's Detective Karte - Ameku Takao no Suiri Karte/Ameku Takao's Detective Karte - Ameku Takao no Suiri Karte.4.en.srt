1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,100
This is a locked room mystery.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,100
What's going on?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,300
Is he fighting someone off?

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,340
<i>Yuasa Haruya, an anesthesiologist for Seiwa General Hospital,
</i>

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,600
<i>was murdered in a closed off room.</i>

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,320
<i>The only other individual in the room with Yuasa
</i>

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,470
<i>was the patient coming off of anesthesia, Mazuru.</i>

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,100
The one operating on that youth was Dr. Kurobe.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,410
And his anesthesiologist was Dr. Yuasa.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,790
<i>The mystery-solving doctor, Takao Ameku,
reaches one conclusion.</i>

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,060
When Yuasa took me off my anesthesia,
he attempted to administer a muscle-relaxant drug.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,050
He tried to stop my breath, and kill me then and there.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:46,170
When faced with death,
there are only two instinctual actions a human will take.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,530
One. They will protect someone important to them.

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,640
Two. They will fight back their assailant.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,600
And given the situation, she would have had to fight back.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,900
Which means the culprit is...

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,100
my sister.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,850
We can only claim the truth
once we've exhausted every possibility.

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,730
That would mean we ought to suspect
this "invisible entity" as well, no?

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,750
Since we're already here,
how about we swipe the rest of those security tapes?

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,260
Absolutely not...

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,460
Someone is coming. Hide, hide!

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,550
Please, forgive us!

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,710
- Dr. Tsujino? Takanashi.
- Dr. Kojima?

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,700
- Here you go.
- Is this sweet?

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,150
Sure is.

28
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,110
- Hot!
- What an absolute fright you two gave me.

29
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,050
You must be the infamous Dr. Takao Ameku, I take it?

30
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,800
The director has informed me of your situation.

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
So you know why I have been sent here?

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Of course. And I would love to help in any way I can.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
I must know who murdered poor Yuasa.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,130
So you don't think Ms. Mazuru... I mean, the patient is guilty?

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,160
I am certain she's innocent.
I have been an anesthesiologist for 15 years now.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,470
A patient awaking from anesthesia cannot even lift a finger.

37
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,530
I've already told the police they do not need to monitor her room.

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,500
But they claim they're simply "protecting a key witness".

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,820
Who do you think murdered Yuasa Haruya?

40
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,190
Some suspect the dead youth - this "ghost".

41
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,950
You witnessed the ghost with Yuasa, did you not?

42
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,830
Is that truly what you two saw?

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,900
That night, I was finishing up some work, when I heard him.

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:47,000
team credits

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,900
Yuasa?

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,260
What happened?

47
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,600
T-There are tiny men...

48
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,040
Don't!

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Is everything alright?

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,200
We saw tiny men.

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,700
- Pardon?
- They rode a cart.

52
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,010
- A cart?
- They were spinning.

53
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,430
- Spinning?
- And they grew!

54
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,100
- Grew?
- They came right at me.

55
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,000
- They went into operation room 4!
- What?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,200
- I saw them as well.
- Is that so...

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,100
Give me a moment then.

58
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,610
Tiny men, riding a cart?

59
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,340
Hello? Anyone there?

60
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,400
Of course not.

61
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,300
Doctor, the room is completely empty.

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,510
But I saw them with my own eyes.

63
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,810
As did I.

64
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,800
I believe that officer spread the rumor.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,440
I told myself I was only seeing things.
That is,

66
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,100
until Yuasa's incident occurred.

67
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,670
Was there anyone who resented Yuasa?

68
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,020
Well, Yuasa was my junior from Ryoko Uni. Hospital.

69
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,770
We were close. I recommended him here,

70
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,700
when he was looking to transfer as a clinician.

71
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,100
- Why did he transfer?
- I believe he hit a wall with his research.

72
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,220
In any case, Yuasa was kind. He would never -

73
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Enough with the formalities.

74
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,160
Is there something you know, Dr. Tsujino?

75
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,030
Three months ago, Yuasa began to receive threats.

76
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,520
We believed they were from the family of the deceased youth.

77
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,850
He'd receive a letter once every two or three weeks.

78
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,020
I found this in my post.

79
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,610
[You are a failure as a doctor. Resign while you can.]

80
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,100
- From?
- It wasn't addressed.

81
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,600
The letters escalated, until finally, one was sent with a razor,

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,270
and Yuasa cut his finger.

83
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,300
When was that letter sent?

84
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,500
The day Yuasa died.

85
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,200
You told the police about this?

86
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,610
Of course.

87
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,310
Dr. Kurobe had been receiving the threats as well.

88
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,990
Dr. Kurobe too?

89
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,670
He kept it to himself.

90
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,000
Earlier, you expressed your desire to help.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,750
In that case, show us the security tapes from the incident.

92
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm sure you have access to them.

93
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,500
Unfortunately, the guards handle those tapes.

94
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,900
They've heightened security due to an intruder as well.

95
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,600
Who would do such a thing?

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,040
Who, indeed.

97
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,700
In any case, this has gotten mighty confusing.

98
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,600
I'll unravel those confusions one by one, and uncover the truth.

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,650
There is no mystery this brain of mine can't solve.

[Karte.4: Mystery of the Murdered Anesthesiologist - Resolved]

103
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Anything regarding the reason Dr. Yuasa gave up his research?

104
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,300
As I told you before, he mentioned nothing.

105
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,140
Ms. Mazuru, any tidbit could help us.

106
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,000
He must have confided in you about something.

107
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,800
When we met for dinner, Yuasa asked me a strange question.

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,700
Would you take a pet off my hands?

109
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,800
I can't keep the poor guy anymore due to certain circumstances.

110
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,380
It's a really adorable thing.
Climbs onto your shoulder when you call for it.

111
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,510
- Sorry, my complex doesn't allow pets.
- I see.

112
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,010
We were just talking about the philosophies of life and death,

113
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,600
so the topic of a pet certainly felt odd.

114
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,500
What was the pet in question?

115
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,990
It looked like a sort of squirrel,
but I never asked about the specifics.

116
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,620
I see. I will pass the information along to Dr. Takao anyway.

117
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,090
Dr. Takanashi.

118
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,600
I'd like you to have this.

119
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,190
I call this, the "Takao Ameku Instruction Manual".

120
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,090
If anything happens to me, I can no longer protect Takao.

121
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,780
- So when the time comes...
- Please don't say that.

122
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,790

No sir, I... My apologies.

- Dr. Takanashi.
- Yes?

132
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,400
How is our patient shaping up?

133
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,500
She's on a steady path to recovery.

134
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,490
Then she ought to be discharged when possible.

135
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,600
We're short-staffed as is, not to mention Dr. Kurobe is leaving.

136
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,300
- Leaving?
- He is being dismissed due to numerous reports of harassment.

We shall decline the transfer.

00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,110
<i>Though we have requested she resign,</i>

147
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,700
we may need to dismiss her if she chooses not to comply.

148
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,840
- How cold. That wasn't a compliment.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

<i>That is all from my end.</i>

He used to be quite the passionate doctor, and yet.

151
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,610
This is Haruya Yuasa's thesis.

152
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,660
When using narcotics to treat cancer pain,

153
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,160
it can cause hallucinations as a side effect.

154
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,900
As such, he was researching hormones in brains by using mice.

155
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,580
According to his professors,

156
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,130
he was a brilliant research student.

157
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,910
They were all shocked when he quit
due to "personal circumstances".

158
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,930
I must know that "circumstance", no matter what.

159
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,050

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,920
- Have you taken a bath?
- W-What sort of question -

163
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,740
"She doesn't usually bathe,
and she especially forgets when she starts concentrating."

164
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,010
That's what it says in your manual here.

165
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,090
- Penned by Ms. Mazuru herself.
- The heck is that?

166
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,170

167
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,230
So, how long have you gone without a bath?

168
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,800
R-Rude!

169
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,800
- How dare you ask a lady -
- A lady wouldn't stink!

170
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,050
I don't stink!

171
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,460
I barely sweat. I smell fine.

172
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,660
Besides, I hate water.

173
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,290
What are you, a cat?

174
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,000
- Go take a shower already.
- Quit acting like my sister.

175
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,520
I feel tears welling in my eyes.

176
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:03,750
Ms. Mazuru has jotted down everything about you, Dr. Takao.
Ever since you were little.

177
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,920
She has resolved herself for the worst.

178
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,410
And she knew she could entrust Dr. Kotori with this booklet.

179
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,720
A manual that Dr. Kotori accepted with equal resolve.

180
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,400
- It only felt right?
- Please, just tie the knot already!

181
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,150
- What knot?
- You dense man!

182
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,770
What?

183
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,630
He's right on time.

184
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,950
Come on in.

185
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,190
<i>He used to be quite the passionate doctor, and yet.</i>

186
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,030
<i>I've got a message for Dr. Ameku.</i>

187
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,290
<i>Tell her I'll swing by at midnight, on the dot.</i>

188
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,570
What an eccentric house.

189
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,530
What do you want?

190
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,560
Could I ask you to leave us?

191
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,730
I'm the master of this house.

192
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,850
You don't get to give the orders.

193
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,330
Dr. Takao, I don't mind.

194
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,710
Please save Ms. Mazuru.

195
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,290
Thank you.

196
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,860
Back off.

197
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,410
- What?
- I said, back off.

198
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,540
Ms. Mazuru Ameku will be arrested in three days' time.

199
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,390
Normally it'd be postponed until she's discharged,
but they want her out.

200
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,680
Hm, suddenly I feel like talking to myself.

201
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,820
It's like I need to monologue about something.

202
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,220
Wonder why.

203
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,160
Monologuing in someone else's home? Weirdo.

204
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,740
- Aha. Dr. Takao, he doesn't really mean to speak to himself.
- Huh, huh?

205
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,210
In other words...

206
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:59,630
I see now. You'll use the guise of a "monologue"

207
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,690
to speak of classified topics without repercussion.

208
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,330
Cowardly, but if that helps you sleep at night, be my guest.

209
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,350
Now go on with your "monologue".

210
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,620
I doubt the conclusions that our investigation team has reached.

211
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,550
The victim thrashed about before being slashed in the neck.

212
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,010
There was also bruising on his neck, like he had been choked.

213
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,940
- By who? Were there fingerprints?
- No fingerprints.

214
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,360
I feel like laying out some pictures.

215
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,530
- What's this?
- Out with them already.

216
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,940
The bruising was caused by thick fingers, most likely male.

217
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,660
But the investigative team insists the bruising occurred
before the incident.

218
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,060
What else do you have?

219
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,620
Might as well get everything off your chest.

220
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,920
- Want katsudon?
- You're no interrogator, Doc.

221
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,200
We're looking into the possibility of Haruya Yuasa

222
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,150
stealing narcotics from Seiwa General Hospital.

223
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,300
There was an anonymous reporting last year regarding the theft.

224
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,090
Apparently, some drug from an operation room had been stolen.

225
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,390
They recorded using more than administered, and stole the rest.

226
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,210
The anonymous report didn't mention any names.

227
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,700
But we do know Yuasa had visited an addiction rehab facility.

228
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,040
- Did his autopsy come up with any trace of narcotics?
- No.

229
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,810
Although, someone had ransacked his belongings
after the incident.

230
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,260
Have you searched his home?

231
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,560
His family is still suffering from shock,
so we haven't managed to get around to that yet.

232
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,180
And yet they're insisting on arresting my sister.

233
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,160
Given the circumstances, Mazuru Ameku is the obvious culprit.

234
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,090
Yet something about this reeks.

235
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,500
I can tell there's more to this case.

236
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,590
My detective's intuition says so.

237
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,080
That's all for my monologue.

238
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,810
You don't agree with your superiors, but don't plan on acting out.

239
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,040
That's why you've come to me, is it?

240
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,990
- Bingo.
- Don't think I'm so easy.

241
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,600
I have high hopes for you, Doc.

242
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,600
You'd be able to convince us all with that reasoning of yours.

243
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,640
You're the one who said my involvement
would mess with the investigation's "validity".

244
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,840
I'll treat you to a mountain-load of cakes from "Afternoon".

245
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,720
- Deal.
- Pushover!

246
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,270
Is it just me, or does something smell?

247
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,380
I was going to solve this mystery anyway.

248
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,980
Nothing wrong with adding a little incentive.

249
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,430
But I'll need the security tapes from after the incident.

250
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,010
<i>It cuts off here!</i>

251
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,120
Without them, the "invisible entity" remains a mystery.

252
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,450
Unfortunately, I must get going.

253
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,280
- Sir, please wait.
- I want to drop this.

254
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,360
- Huh?
- There it goes.

255
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Sir, you dropped this.

256
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,870
Sorry, I'm in a rush. The missus doesn't like it when I'm late.

257
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,510
See you around.

258
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,540
Sakurai, you son of a gun. Dropped some precious cargo here.

259

- Yes, sir.

00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,740
Ready, and...

263
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,010
- An incision in the neck.
- Bring the heart monitor.

- He has no rate.
- Beginning CPR.

- Dr. Yuasa.
- Excuse me.

Dr. Yuasa, can you hear us?

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,430
- Nonoka.
- Yes, ma'am.

268
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,030
- Prepare two IV feeds.
- Got it.

269
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,340
I'll locate the veins.

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,790
I've got his vein. The line.

272
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,880
Give him every drop.

Dr. Yuasa. Dr. Yuasa, can you hear us?

- Administering one milliliter of adrenaline.
- Copy that.

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,870
- Grab the laryngoscope and tracheal tube.
- Yes, sir.

- Steady.
- Yes, sir.

00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,610
Care to explain what's going on?

347
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,560
I am no murderer!

348
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,830
So? What was she taking?

349
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,530
Narcotics.

350
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,600
I didn't kill them. I did not!

351
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,730
First, let's start by unraveling this "invisible entity".

352
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,480
Take the ghosts Tsujino saw last year.

353
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,090
Cross that with the fact she's an addict,
and what do you get?

354
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,570
- You mean she experienced a bad -
- Exactly.

355
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,640
- A bad trip.
- Why did you bother asking?

356
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,550
Hey there, old-timers!

357
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,100
The old men are flying!

358
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,260
Dr. Tsujino?

359
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,230
- Dr. Tsujino, what -
- Look!

360
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,490
Look, the tiny old men!

361
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,240
Don't!

362
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,960
Is everything alright?

363
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,950
We saw tiny men. They rode a cart. They were spinning.

364
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,320
And they grew! They came right at me.

365
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,250
- They went into operation room 4!
- What?

366
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,980
I saw them as well.

367
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,750
<i>Yuasa claimed he also saw the "ghosts"</i>

368
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,780
<i>because he immediately recognized Tsujino was tripping.</i>

369
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,820
He stepped on one.

370
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,800
If Tsujino was the only one raising a fuss,
the guard would catch on immediately.

371
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,000
The fate of a doctor found taking illegal substances is brutal.

372
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,800
You'd receive legal consequences,
and have your medical license revoked.

373
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,090
That is why Yuasa covered for you.

374
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,430
The one who sent the anonymous report
regarding the stolen drugs, was Haruya Yuasa himself.

375
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,250
That's right.

376
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:27,880
Yuasa wanted her to amend her ways
without damaging her reputation. He owed her, after all.

377
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,450
This was also why he was looking into rehab facilities.

378
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,950
But you continued to use your narcotics,
and murdered Yuasa to -

379
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,530
What baseless slander.

380
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,460
You have no evidence.

381
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,710
Kotori, are you ready?

382
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,490
<i>Yes, ma'am. But is this really necessary...</i>

383
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,940
The stage has been set. It's time I solve this mystery.

384
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,920
Hey. Walk properly.

385
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,960
Great work, team.

386
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,140
You could've at least spruced the place up with some blood.

387
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,240
That would be overkill.

388
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,710
So spill the beans, Dr. Ameku.

389
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,030
What makes you believe Dr. Tsujino is our culprit?

390
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,240
It's all in that "precious cargo" you dropped.

391
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,870
The security tapes following the incident.

392
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,510
Must've dropped them at the Doctor's place. My bad.

393
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,530
I don't blame the police for overlooking this fact.

394
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,390
But if you work in medicine,
you would notice Tsujino's odd actions.

395
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,090
And it was caught, right on camera.

396
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,620
When you walked into the scene to a bloodied Haruya Yuasa,

397
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,260
why did you return to the hall to retrieve a supply cart?

398
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,220
It seems you all have caught on, but how is this "odd"?

399
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,340
The anesthesia cart was already in this room.

400
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,440
The supplies needed to resuscitate a person are all right here.

401
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,170
There was no need to retrieve another cart.

402
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,490
My mind was frazzled with all the blood.

403
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,890
And I wasn't in the room when Yuasa's neck was slashed.

404
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,180
Precisely. This was a locked room murder mystery.

405
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,680
And this locked room murder mystery...

406
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,190
is comprised of six variables.

407
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,920
One. Tsujino brought in an extra cart.

408
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,650
Two. Yuasa suddenly quit his research last March.

409
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,810
Three. Yuasa cut his finger on a razor found within a threat.

410
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,580
Four. Yuasa's locker was ransacked after the incident.

411
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,270
Five. Yuasa spilled the contents of the anesthesia cart
after the operation.

412
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,250
Six. Yuasa asked my sister to take a pet off his hands.

413
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,700
<i>Would you take a pet off my hands?</i>

414
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,380
I'm almost certain this was his pet.

415
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,990
- A squirrel?
- A degu.

416
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,200
- A tiny man.
- They're a species of small rodents native to Chile.

417
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,380
Degu's are incredibly smart, and respond well to human voice.

418
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,940
They're friendly animals, and in Japan they're often kept as pets.

419
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,300
Degu's are herbivores who eat weeds and snack on dandelions.

420
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,990
And this woman had a bag of dandelion chips in her office.

421
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,730
So the one who took Dr. Yuasa's pet was Dr. Tsujino?

422
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,210
Now here's a question.

423
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,490
When Yuasa quit his research,
he was also looking for someone to take his pet degu.

424
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:35,050
Believe it or not, the reason why is the same.

425
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:40,660
I'll give you a hint.
Degu's are known as "The Singing Rodent of the Andes".

426
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,500
Oh, mice.

427
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,440
Yuasa was doing research with mice, a rodent like the degu.

428
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,340
Yuasa parted ways with rodents.

429
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,730
But he had no choice, why?

430
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,350
Was he allergic to them?

431
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,670
Bingo.

432
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,160
And did you look into that other thing for me?

433
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,490
Yes. Haruya Yuasa was transported from his home
on March 4th of last year,

434
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:15,100
due to an immense rash, decreased blood pressure,
and hazy consciousness.

435
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,170
He was then transported to a further hospital, at his insistence.

436
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,250
He experienced anaphylactic shock.

437
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,980
He most likely got bitten by his degu, and found out then.

438
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,990
Yuasa had a life-threatening allergy to rodents.

439
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,850
More specifically to the lipocalin found in a rodent's nasal fluids.

440
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,640
In this way, lipocalin can be deadly to human beings.

441
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,310
If his colleagues knew, they would have him quit his research.

442
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,700
Which is why he insisted on being taken to a further hospital.

443
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,300
Were you able to contact the doctor who attended to Yuasa?

444
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,970
Yes, but they're unable to disclose patient information,
unless absolutely necessary.

445
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,790
Then get that later. If my theory's correct,

446
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,410
that doctor was someone he knew from Ryoko U. Hospital.

447
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,670
This doctor most likely warned him
to never conduct research with rodents ever again.

448
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:04,500
And if he did, the doctor would report Yuasa to the university.

449
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,100
But Yuasa had to inform Tsujino.

450
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,120
She was hiring him as a clinical professional.

451
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,030
So when she thought to kill him,

452
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,900
she recalled Yuasa's allergy, and plotted a cruel scheme.

453
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,300
<i>First, she sent the threat.</i>
[You are a failure as a doctor. Resign while you can.]

454
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,110
<i>She sent a similar note to Kurobe,</i>

455
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,000
<i>as if it were from the family of the deceased youth.</i>

456
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,500
This was all to throw the trail off herself.

457
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,000
<i>Please stop this, ma'am.</i>

458
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,260
If you continue abusing these substances,

459
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,200
I will report this to the higher-ups.

460
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,070
Echo, echo...

461
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,060
<i>Receiving her final warning from Yuasa,</i>

462
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,540
<i>Tsujino sent the threat with the razor.</i>

463
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,000
<i>Luckily for her, Yuasa cut his finger on the razor.</i>

464
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,900
<i>This was when she set up her lethal weapon.</i>

465
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,700
She had coated the inside of a glove with plenty of lipocalin.

466
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,400
- Good work.
- You too.

467
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,500
She's starting to breathe on her own.

468
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,020
I will begin waking the patient.

469
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,700
Ms. Mazuru? Ms. Mazuru.

470
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,800
Ms. Mazuru.

471
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,300
I'll leave the rest to you.

472
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,800
Ms. Mazuru. Your operation was a success.

473
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,900
<i>The lipocalin entered his system from his wound,</i>

474
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,600
and soon caused a deadly allergic reaction.

475
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:34,680
Yuasa realized he was going into anaphylactic shock.

476
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,810
The second bout of anaphylactic shock
is usually worse than the first.

477
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:43,500
And the drug which combats anaphylaxis, is adrenaline.

478
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,000
However, the adrenaline necessary was missing from the cart.

479
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,110
That's because this woman took them all,
when she planted the lipocalin coated glove.

480
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,400
One moment.

481
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,600
I won't deny Yuasa could suffer anaphylaxis
if all that occurred.

482
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,200
But Yuasa died because his throat was cut.

483
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,480
He was suffocating.

484
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,600
The most lethal, and terrifying symptom of anaphylaxis...

485
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,500
is the suffocation caused by a swollen throat.

486
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,890
A human instinctively grabs for their throat when suffocating.

487
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,660
The bruising left on his throat was caused by Yuasa himself.

488
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,510
And because he was wearing gloves,
no fingerprints were left behind.

489
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,000
He was backed to a wall. But

490
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,570
as a practiced anesthesiologist,
Yuasa knew he had one last option.

491
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,650
He had no choice but to bet his life on this risky move.

492
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,510
You don't mean...

493
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,400
A tracheotomy...

494
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,050
But with how short for breath he was,

495
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:58,150
making an incision to his trachea was impossible.

496
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:07,600
This is the truth behind the "invisible entity",
and the locked room mystery.

497
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,320
You had angled

498
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,440
the security camera
towards the entryway beforehand.

499
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,300
Your goal? To make it less obvious
Yuasa was suffering

500
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,000
from anaphylactic shock.

501
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But that's why you were equally as confused.

502
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,600
- Why?
- <i>His actions went beyond your calculations.</i>

503
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,810
We have to save Yuasa!

504
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,940
<i>What was supposed to look like an accident,
now looked like an incident.</i>

505
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,500
<i>That's when you began covering up the evidence.</i>

506
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,300
<i>First, it couldn't be known there was adrenaline missing
from an anesthetic procedure.</i>

507
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,000
<i>This was why you brought in another cart.</i>

508
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,900
Readying the IVs.

509
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,060
<i>Next, you needed to cover up his anaphylaxis.</i>

510
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,300
<i>By administering large amounts of adrenaline into his body,</i>

511
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,700
<i>you would effectively flush out any evidence of his anaphylaxis.</i>

512
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,250
- Administering one milliliter of adrenaline.
- Copy that.

513
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,500
This was how you created the perfect locked room mystery.

514
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,800
You're also the one who ransacked Yuasa's belongings.

515
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,630
Those who have experienced anaphylactic shock

516
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,300
usually carry an adrenaline shot with them.

517
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,050
So you made sure to retrieve it, before the police would.

518
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,640

519
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,400

520

521
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,600
Kotori.

522

523

We caught you right on camera.

There you are, trying to kill my sister.

525
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,940
The security cameras make it less obvious,
so we got another angle.

526

Unfortunately for you, my sister's IV wasn't connected to her.

<i>I had the monitor controlled remotely, to show a false reading.</i>

Ms. Mazuru Ameku is in critical condition!

533

You'll be coming with us, Doctor.

540
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,250

- Sis.

Please continue to teach Dr. Takao
whatever life lessons she needs.

546
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,680
I will find my own way to handle her.

547
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,550
I understand.

548
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:09,400
So, I'm still a bit lost, since I was kept out of the loop.

549
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,300
Why did Dr. Tsujino attempt to kill Ms. Mazuru?

550
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,800
Remember how...

551
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,490
Takao.

552
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:30,800
Remember how she was pleading for my sister's innocence?

553
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,480
That's because she needed those police away from her door.

554
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,340
She wanted to kill her - make it look like the work of an illness.

555
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,400
But Ms. Mazuru was to be arrested. So why?

556
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,010
Following her arrest, the police would begin searching

557
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,800
for concrete evidence to prosecute her.

558
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,190
Evidence of Tsujino's addiction or

559
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,330
Yuasa's allergy
could have made themselves apparent.

560
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,040
Tsujino wanted to avoid that at all cost.

561
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,660
But if my sister died, it'd change the whole story.

562
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,700
With the suspect dead, that closes the case.
There's nothing left to investigate.

563
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,600
That's why I gave that Tsujino the chance of a lifetime.

564
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,170
First, in order to send my sister to an ICU,

565
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,400
I had her claim she was ill.

566
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,880
Then I had Yamaki swap my sister's blood test,

567
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,660
with that of a research batch.

568
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,410
I see. And why wasn't I informed?

569
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:25,000
Your desperation convinced Tsujino her plan had worked.

570
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,700
Great job, Kotori.

571
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,400
You might recall I also said I had a "bad feeling".

572
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,100
How didn't you catch on then?

573
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,600
I rely on logic, not intuition.

574
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,030
I'll be sure to jot that down in my manual.

575
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,660
What are you talking about?

576
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,620
Takao. I want to ask you one question.

577
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,860
Why did Yuasa attempt to administer a muscle-relaxant to me?

578
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,430
It was his dying message.

579
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:00,220
Dr. Takao, you said dying messages were a fictitious thing...

580
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,200
Did you catch on?

581
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,650
Yuasa wasn't trying to kill you.

582
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,930
He was trying to save you.

583
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,400
<i>It was a complete locked room, and he had cut his own neck.</i>

584
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,400
<i>He'd unfortunately dropped the scalpel on you as well.</i>

585
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,970
<i>If he left things be, he knew you'd be made the suspect.</i>

you wouldn't be able to move.</i>

588
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,550
<i>No one would think you slashed him with that scalpel.</i>

589
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,900
He was thinking of you, Ms. Mazuru.

590
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,220
Right until his last breath.

591
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,130
A muscle-relaxant would only stop your breathing,

592
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,600
if administered a certain amount.

One. They will protect someone important to them.

Two. They will fight back their assailant.

I struggle to understand people at the heart.

598

But I know there was no logical reason for Yuasa to attack you.

599

There was, however, a person he may have wanted to protect.

<i>To want death, is to crave for life.</i>

601

He wanted to protect the very person he owed his life to.

602
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,470
Dr. Yuasa's final act

603
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,870
was his desire for you to live on.

604
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,200
