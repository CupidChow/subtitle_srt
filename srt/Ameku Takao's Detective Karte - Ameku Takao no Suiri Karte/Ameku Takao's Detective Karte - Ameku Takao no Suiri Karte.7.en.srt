1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,670
I cannot understand people. It's a trait I was born with.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,440
<i>Though she has struggled to understand people all her life,</i>

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,210
<i>Takao Ameku is an undisputed genius
who diagnoses even the most puzzling symptoms.</i>

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,230
<i>At times, she even solves mysteries the police have difficulty with.</i>

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,040
I can absolutely solve this case, no questions asked.

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,600
Takao...

7
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,390
I'll leave finding the culprit...

8
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,640
To you.

9
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,480
You can relax now, Dr. Hio.
[One month ago]

10
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,510
Did you find any abnormalities, Takao?

11
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,350
Your premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)
have gotten more frequent.

12
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:51,230
So my organs are failing due to a build up of amyloid proteins.

13
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,610
It seems I have Amyloidosis.

14
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,950
A common sign of things taking a turn for the worse, I'd say.

15
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,760
Now, how will you treat this body of mine?

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,810
The main issue is that the effectiveness
of your left heart pump is decreasing.

17
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,890
Do I increase your dosage of diuretics?

18
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,180
Except...

19
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,270
There is the risk of anticancer agents...

20
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,860
[Patient: Hio Mikogami]

21
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,240
My apologies, Dr. Hio. She is currently lost in her own world.

22
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,150
As I recall, you were one of Dr. Takao's teachers
when she was a student, yes?

23
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:35,440
Indeed. She was a resident when I taught general medicine
at Teito University Hospital.

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,830
What was she like as a student?

25
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,420
She was exactly like she is now.

26
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,470
Treading through the world with self-centered righteousness.

27
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,050
With her vast comprehension of medical knowledge,

28
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,820
she would critique treatments and diagnoses,
even from senior doctors.

29
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,090
Everyone could only shrink away in terror.

30
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,720
Then I suppose she truly hasn't changed.

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,320
We could attempt stem-cell therapy? But the success rate...

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,330
Before Takao, I had never encountered an individual like myself.

33
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,380
She was the very first.

34
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,030
Like yourself?

35
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,030
Indeed. Like Takao, my mind works unlike the average person.

36
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,440
Though I suppose I seem "normal" when pitted against her.

37
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,380
What we lack in, we make up with experience.

38
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,200
I recall being quite self-centered in my twenties as well.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,080
But my edges have rounded out with age,
and the responsibility of being a hospital director.

40
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,040
Do you imagine Dr. Takao will mellow out like you have?

41
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,650
That, I have to wonder.

42
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,020
Takao is far more sprightly than I was in my youth.

43
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,680
She owes it to her place
in the Department of Investigative Pathology.

44
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,800
Not to mention your presence as well.

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,680
Me?

46
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,130
Right then.

47
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,950
Let's increase your dosage of furosemide by 40mg.

48
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,530
Rather than risking dehydration,
easing the pressure on your heart should help in the long run.

49
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,420
A heart, which lasts only thanks to this pacemaker of mine.

50
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,620
Thank you for the thorough diagnosis.

51
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:35,250
So, how long do I have left?

52
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,880
Taking your heart into account,
I would say about six months or so.

53
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,180
If only we had a battle of wits before my body deteriorated.

54
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,480
A true shame.

55
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,270
I would have greatly enjoyed a clinical bout with you.

56
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
I share the same sentiments.

57
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,100
Until next month, Dr. Hio -

58
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,100
I have a favor to ask of my reliable disciple.

59
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,830
If I die earlier than the time frame you have given me,

60
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,580
know that I did not die a natural death.

61
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,160
Assume that I have been murdered by a certain individual.

62
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,350
And when the time comes, I would like you to solve the mystery,

63
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,350
and uncover the culprit.

64
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,980
What are you talking about?

65
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,170
I'm only speaking of the what-ifs.

66
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,730
Just keep it in the back of your mind, will you?

67
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,490
[One month later, present time]

68
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,260
This floor is for hospital executives.

69
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,870
My aunt has told me much about you, Dr. Ameku.

70
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,100
Please, take a look into her office.

71
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,100
[Director's Office]

72
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,240
It has a similar vibe to Dr. Takao's place.

73
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,320
What's that?

74
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,190
That is the door to a safe.

75
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,120
My aunt had it installed
when this new building was built three years ago.

76
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,340
- Why on the floor?
- I do not know.

77
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,360
My aunt called the safe "Pandora's Box",

78
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,620
but never informed anyone of what was within.

79
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,110
A blood clot caused by an irregular pulse reached her brain,

80
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,410
blocking the way to her middle cerebral artery.

81
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,690
Tell me more about the day Dr. Hio collapsed.

82
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:10,290
We began the day discussing the ways
I could treat some patients of mine.

83
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,430
<i>My aunt was also head of our General Medicines department,
alongside her role as director.</i>

84
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,020
One moment.

85
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,830
Understood.

86
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,350
I have business to attend. I'll be in our basement.

87
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,750
All right.

88
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,000
<i>We had a meeting with department heads scheduled at noon.</i>

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,170
<i>But my aunt was nowhere to be seen.</i>

90
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,480
<i>She wouldn't even pick up her hospital phone.</i>

91
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,650
<i>I immediately assumed the worst had happened to her.</i>

92
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,080
<i>I made my rounds in the basement,
with my final stop being our clinical records room.</i>

93
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,470
<i>This is where we keep all our old paper records.</i>

94
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,660
<i>The room is usually locked shut,
like a forbidden chamber of sorts.</i>

95
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,480
<i>Yet on the dust-covered floors, were one set of footsteps.</i>

96
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,120
I called the other doctors, and we treated her right away.

97
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,280
But it was too late.

98
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,230
Leave this to me, Dr. Hio.

Our clinical records are stored this way.

102
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,860
I believe she will be sweeping through this floor first.

106
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,040
There are six sets of footprints, three male, three female.

107

One of those footprints went further in, but never returned.

108
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,950
If I surmise this one was Dr. Hio,

109
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,470
it would mean the other five carried her out.

110
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,240
- Am I correct?
- How could you tell?

111
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,520
Analyzing footprints are a given for any detective.

112
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,000
You are a doctor.

Yes.

Send me the tapes later.

116
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,060
I need to see you're telling the truth,
and confirm what happened before and after the incident.

117
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,660
You doubt me?

118
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,020
Of course. As of now,
I doubt every person who interacted with Dr. Hio.

119
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,450
There's dust underneath these records.

120
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,450
They must've fallen to the ground recently.

121
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,970
Perhaps my aunt was looking into something?

122
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:56,800
If Dr. Hio was murdered as she predicted,
there is a certain enigma we must unravel.

123
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,450
That being the fact this room was a "locked room".

124
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,670
But when I arrived, this room was unlocked...

125
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,700
Consider a page from the "Locked Room Lecture".

126
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,980
A body is found in a place barricaded by snow.

127
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,190
Yet the only footprints to be found, are that of the victim.

128
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,850
And in our case,

129
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,920
the only footprints left were the ones in dust.

130
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,700
Dr. Hio knew someone was after her life.

131
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,870
Any idea who that might be?

132
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,920
I can think of one individual.

133
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,560
Who?

134
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,170
I thought no one usually comes in here.

135
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,480
That is correct.

136
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,600
Uncle...

137
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,270
This is Chinu Mikogami, my uncle
and vice director of the hospital.

138
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,250
He was also Aunt Hio's older brother.

139
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,190
Chinu, is it?

140
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,020
I reckon that's derived from the other name for a black porgy.

141
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,630
What are you doing here?

142
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,890
I am Takao Ameku, from the Tenikai Hospital.

143
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,200
I've come to investigate Dr. Hio's fate.

144
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,750
- Hio died of natural causes.
- No.

145
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,810
I believe someone triggered a stroke, and murdered her.

146
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,910
- What are you...
- This was Dr. Hio's own prediction.

147
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,730
If she died early, I was to assume it was done with intent.

148
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,030
She was obviously being delusional.

149
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,990
That one's always been a bit strange in the head.

150
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,670
She could never read the room, nor show respect to her elders.

151
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,480
And she would obsess over the strangest things.

152
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,930
But she was never one for common sense.

153
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,250
She was the black sheep of our whole family.

154
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,620
Is that all?

155
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:56,100
I am the director here.
I will not allow you to run amok in my hospital.

156
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,610
You are not the director, Uncle.

157
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,220
And you think you're a candidate, fresh out of your residency?

158
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,510
I ask that you folks leave, now.

159
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,140
And if I say no?

160
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,560
Don't get cocky.

161
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,170
This isn't worth my time.

162
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,560
As the temporary director, I'm already busy as it is.

163
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll have our security toss you out.

164
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,570
And I'll be sure to send a complaint to Tenikai as well.

165
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,600
Something seemed off.

166
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,720
He lost his composure seeing these older records.

167
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,520
Perhaps he knows what Dr. Hio was searching for.

168
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,720
I'll ask our older staff to see if they know more.

169
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,880
In any case, I now see who had the motive to kill Dr. Hio.

170
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,690
Indeed. I suspect my uncle.

171
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,200
He has despised Aunt Hio for a long while now.

172
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:07,700
My uncle was never regarded highly,
especially with that personality of his.

173
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:14,220
Which was why my grandfather, the previous director,
called for Aunt Hio as his successor.

174
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,980
So that man lost the succession.

175
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,820
My uncle attempted to sabotage Aunt Hio's reputation
in a number of ways.

176
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,560
Sounds familiar.

177
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,980
Four years ago, he suffered a hemorrhage
which caused paralysis in his legs.

178
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,550
But that incident only pushed him to crave for more influence.

179
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,690
Aunt Hio always complained
about how she never wanted to become the director.

180
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,680
But she was against his core values. She couldn't quit.

181
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,230
- And his core values are?
- Simply put,

182
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,380
he is driven by money.

183
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,030
Sounds even more familiar.

184
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,450
I will be sure to caution her.

185
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,500
The vice director of the Mikogami General Hospital called.

186
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,590
It seems Takao suspects the director was murdered.

187
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,930
- Leave her be.
- What?

188
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,350
I hear vice director Mikogami had a certain scheme in the works.

189
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,090
He was pushing for a treatment system,
which prioritized high payers.

190
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:33,180
He would target cancer patients with incurable symptoms,
and prey off their immunotherapy.

191
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,570
A bastardization of the very concept of receiving care.

192
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,290
I cannot imagine a regional hospital would do such a thing.

193
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,850
Let's observe what will become of the situation.

194
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,640
Is everything all right?

195
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,150
Some reporters got ahold of us.

196
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,010
They say the Tenikai are giving us illegal funds,
and that I am a pawn for you people.

197
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,300
Is that the truth?

198
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,680
No matter what we say or claim,

199
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,620
people will always believe what they want to believe.

200
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,020
Someone leaked our plans to the press to sabotage me.

201
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,280
Was it you? Or you?

202
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,690
Could you two leave us be?

203
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,170
We must put our plans on hold.

204
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,070
That isn't an option for us.

205
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,480
But with how things are...

206
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,840
Ms. Kuraishi. Slow breaths.

207
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,690
Dr. Hio looks to have died of natural causes.
Do you truly believe she was murdered?

208
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,950
Fine. It seems my disciple needs a quick test.

209
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,940
I'm not your disciple, I am your subordinate.

210
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,070
Let's assume someone artificially triggered a stroke.

211
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,530
What could possibly clog a blood vessel to cause it?

212
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,230
An embolism?

213
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,490
- Correct!
- Hey!

214
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,450
Inject a spongey gelatin and clog the blood vessel

215
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,250
like they would to treat liver cancer.

216
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,600
But realistically, how would that be possible?

217
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,700
You would need to see into the blood vessel,
using an angiogram.

218
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,180
- Exactly.
- Watch it.

219
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,500
It'd be an impossible feat to accomplish in the records room.

220
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,120
- My eye...
- Which debunks the theory of using an embolism.

221
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,180
If, after considering a multitude of theories,

222
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,580
I deem a murder was impossible,
then I will declare this a natural death.

223
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,220
Dr. Hio entrusted me with unraveling the truth.

224
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,510
And as her disciple, I must follow through with her request.

225
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,020
Right.

226
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,700
- I'm craving alcohol.
- Not fair.

227
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,540
Be considerate of me, the driver.

228
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,460
So I'm drinking to Dr. Hio alone?

229
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,780
I'll join you for a glass once we've returned.

230
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,560
Sounds like we're partying tonight.

231
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,980
I'm only drinking a glass.

232
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,200
You said you'd take it easy, so what's this?

233
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,300
I didn't bring my wallet. You pay.

234
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,390
We'll split the bill later.

235
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,950
Split the bill?

236
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,990
Pay for what you drank.

237
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,270
Cheapskate.

238
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,940
I wouldn't call that being a cheapskate.

239
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,480
Evening.

240
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,430
Your total today rings up to 23,530 yen.

241
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,870
- Card, please.
- Thank you.

242
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,960
We're dedicating the next drink to Dr. Hio.

243
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,040
- You better be ready.
- I'm only drinking a glass.

244
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,750
A glass that will become two, three, four, and more, right?

245
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,140
No! Just one drink!

246
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,670
Apologies, sir.

247
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,080
But it seems your card is having some trouble going through.

248
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,300
Could I ask for another payment method?

249
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,860
Of course.

250
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,860
I've come to collect your debt.

251
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,330
Pipe down, please.

252
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,120
That's no way to talk to your benefactor.

253
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,210
If I didn't pop in, you could've been arrested
for dine and dashing.

254
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,570
I know, and I'm thankful you were there.

255
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,850
- How much do I owe you?
- Three.

256
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,470
Here you go.

257
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,560
Much appreciated.

258
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,430
And I see Dr. Takao is...

259
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,450
Yeah. She's been like that the past several days now.

260
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,160
[Ayuna Mikogami]

261
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,510
- Hello?
- I discovered why my uncle was so concerned

262
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,270
with those old medical records.

263
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,110
There was a case of medical malpractice.

264
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,140
A veteran surgeon cut an artery
while treating for pancreatic cancer,

265
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,120
<i>and lost the patient soon after as a result.</i>

266
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,700
<i>The surgeon resigned immediately,</i>

267
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:59,470
but the one who actually made the mistake,
was the surgeon's assistant - my uncle.

268
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,720
He pushed the blame onto the surgeon?

269
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Rather, he pressured them into retirement with money.

270
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,100
Then Dr. Hio was attempting to bring this truth to light.

271
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,900
It would put my uncle's rampage to an end.

272
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,030
Except, we cannot find any record pertaining to this incident.

273
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,360
The relevant files may have already been taken.

274
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,740
How are things going on Dr. Ameku's end?

275
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,450
She hasn't figured out anything groundbreaking yet.

276
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,990
I'll be sure to update you first thing when she does.

277
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,880
Dr. Takao.

278
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,190
Dr. Takao?

279
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:45,790
A locked room... Was there somewhere to sneak in?

280
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:52,950
Or was the culprit's footprints mixed into those other six?

281
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,990
Dr. Takao?

282
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,610
But how did they cause the stroke?

283
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,680
How could they have breached her skull in that room?

284
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,590
I'm a bit surprised Dr. Takao is really stewing over this case.

285
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,900
Dr. Takao struggles with human emotion, especially with grief.

286
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,720
This is simply her way of processing the sadness she feels.

287
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:28,070
Dr. Hio taught Dr. Takao how to utilize her abilities for the world.

288
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,430
She feels obligated to solve the riddle her mentor left behind.

289
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,890
Still, she needs to know her limits.

290
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,930
If she trudges on, she'll only continue to spiral downwards.

291
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,520
I've advised her to take a break plenty of times already.

292
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,650
- I can't stop her.
- No.

293
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,530
You can.

294
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,160
I know it.

295
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,850
No one understands Dr. Takao better than you do.

296
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,330
I like the look on your face.

297
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,020
- Now go!
- Woah, hey!

298
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,720
Dr. Takao, please take a break.

299
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,480
A bit of sugar will get your brain churning again, I promise.

300
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,570
- Dr. Takao.
- Leave me alone, Kotori.

301
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,880
This is none of your business.

302
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,310
None of my business?

303
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,000
This is between me and my mentor.

304
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,250
It's not your place to butt in.

305
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,930
Then what about my stance with my mentor?

306
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,810
You said I was your disciple, didn't I?

307
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,760
I understand how important Dr. Hio was to you.

308
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,920
But in my eyes, you are <i>my</i> important mentor.

309
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,280
And I can't stand to see you breaking down like this.

310
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:49,150
Dr. Hio listened to your diagnosis the other day, did she not?

311
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,580
Then why not listen to your disciple as well?

312
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:02,910
You make a valid point.
Low blood sugar isn't good for brain activity.

313
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,410
I suppose I'll take a break.

314
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,110
- Great, I bought some cakes from "Afternoon" for you.
- What?

315
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,430
Why didn't you say so?

316
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,560
I did, multiple times.

317
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,960
Then repeat yourself, again!

318
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,500
And you call yourself my disciple? Pathetic!

319
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,640
What? But... hey!

320
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,490
Dr. Takao. Konoike is in your territory.

321
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,140
Mai's allowed.

322
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,700
Why?

323
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,000
That confession was delicious, thanks for the meal.

324
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,360
- No, I didn't mean -
- Now, now. I understand.

325
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,820
- Where's my slice?
- Why do you assume you get a slice?

326
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,950
Why not?

327
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,320
Hang on. Your debt had interest to it,

328
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,160
but I'd take this cake as payment.

329
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,140
Fine, take it.

330
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,920
Yay! You're the best, Dr. Kotori.

331
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,320
I should have bought another one.

332
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,680
If only I carried more cash.

333
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,360
Are you <i>that</i> broke?

334
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,670
No, but for some reason,
my card isn't working at the ATM either.

335
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,160
Card...

336
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,280
A locked room...

337
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,480
The stroke...

338
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,050
A trap...

339
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,370
A force we can't see?

340
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,330
- Dr. Takao?
- Shush.

341
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,030
- Kotori, we're going to Mikogami General Hospital.
- Yes, ma'am.

342
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,470
Detectives aren't something you get delivered, you know.

343
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,170
And from what I've heard, this really doesn't sound like a case.

344
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,620
Though I am joining as this hospital's representative,

345
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,290
know you are only being caught up in my sister's delusions.

346
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,610
I am now going to enter your clinical records room.

347
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,320
Do not peek inside, no matter what.

348
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,440
This isn't the "Crane's Return of Favor", you know?
[T/N: Japanese folklore]

349
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,190
No, it's the "Falcon's Story of Revenge".
[T/N: The "taka" in "Takao" means falcon]

350
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,430
You're making no sense.

351
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,100
Kotori.

352
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,310
Bring everyone inside after five minutes have passed.

353
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,690
Yes, ma'am.

354
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,960
Five minutes, sir.

355
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,990
Dr. Takanashi. I have a message for Dr. Ameku.

356
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:30,280
We will be releasing my aunt's will this Sunday.
Would Dr. Ameku please join us?

357
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:37,120
It seems Aunt Hio had instructed her attorney
to invite Dr. Takao at around this time.

358
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,470
That is an odd request.

359
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,250
Truth be told...

360
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,560
I am quite jealous of Dr. Ameku.

361
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,850
Because I lost my own mother at a young age,

362
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,780
Aunt Hio became my mother figure of sorts.

363
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,560
My aunt can be quite the eccentric individual.

364
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,490
And I had always assumed I understood her best of anyone.

365
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,680
But I was naive.

366
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,630
One day, without warning, I lost my place at my aunt's side.

367
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,680
You must be referring to Dr. Takao, when she was still a resident.

368
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:21,720
My aunt would talk so happily about Dr. Ameku every day.

369
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,460
I was incredibly jealous of her.

370
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,620
But that is because they share the same trait.

371
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,490
I understand.

372
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:34,340
I know my aunt and I are fundamentally different at the core.

373
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,830
That is why Aunt Hio confided not in me, but in Dr. Ameku.

374
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:47,190
Perhaps she never trusted me at all.

375
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,750
Think she's about to tell us a ghost story?

376
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,360
- What's with these lights?
- Not another step.

377
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,110
You'll listen to my explanation from there.

378
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,010
From here?

379
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:20,600
The trap that killed Dr. Hio is still active in this room.

380
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,620
It's also how she was "murdered".

381
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,240
Ridiculous.

382
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,390
There's no trap here which could trigger a stroke.

383
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,230
Here, I have a handful of iron sand.

384
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,390
Now watch carefully.

385
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:07,800
This is the force that took Dr. Hio's life.

386
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,430
It was "magnetism".

387
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,960
Normal people can handle levels of magnetic force
with no issue.

388
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,810
But there are rare instances of death caused by magnetism.

389
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,910
Dr. Hio had a pacemaker within her body.

390
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,590
Strong levels of magnetism are taboo for individuals like her.

391
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,840
<i>A pacemaker's wire passes through veins to reach the heart.</i>

392
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,560
<i>With a strong magnetic force, these wires heat up,</i>

393
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,270
<i>causing the blood within to clot.</i>

394
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:42,260
<i>This clot then blocked the path
to the brain's middle cerebral artery.</i>

395
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,140
Was this the culprit's intent?

396
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,500
I believe the culprit's real goal was to destroy her heart itself.

397
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,070
Causing the stroke was an unexpected factor.

398
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:59,080
That's why even a genius like myself
had some difficulty identifying the "weapon" used.

399
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,140
Then how did you catch on?

400
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,100
I owe it to Kotori's dine and dash incident.

401
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,690
Dine and dash?

402
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,650
I paid.

403
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,250
We went to eat after investigating this room the other day,

404
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,010
when Kotori's card wouldn't work at the register.

405
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,490
This is because his cards were ruined
by the strong magnetism in this area.

406
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,430
This wall contains that much magnetic force?

407
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,970
It's not technically from the wall.

408
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,550
It's from the device on the other side.

409
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,000
[Clinical Records Room]

410
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,750
The magnetic force leaking from the MRI is the cause.
[MRI Scan Room]

411
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,890
An MRI relies on a strong magnetic force to scan the body.

412
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,280
It lets off this force without fail,

413
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,900
even when it's not in use.

414
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,830
But I've never heard of an MRI's magnetism leaking
and causing an accident.

415
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,670
That's because there's normally a magnetic shield
built into the wall.

416
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,790
But this small section here is our exception.

417
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,540
It's also placed right about where the chest would be.

418
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,820
This placement was clearly done so with intent.

419
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:08,390
<i>It was done to mess with Dr. Hio's pacemaker, and kill her.</i>

420
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,500
This new building was built three years ago.

421
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,680
Our culprit had influence over the building's construction.

422
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,130
And their hatred for the victim was worth the time and labor.

423
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:23,030
There's only one individual who meets all these conditions.

424
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,030
And that would be you, Chinu Mikogami.

425
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,640
What?

426
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,490
No, I did no such thing. I am innocent!

427
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:36,250
I reckon you had an accomplice lure Dr. Hio here

428
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:41,610
with the information that your mistakes were kept on record.

429
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,590
Enough with the accusations! Show me the proof!

430
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,120
The police will dig that up in no time.

431
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,370
When they see I'm innocent, I'll sue.

432
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,520
I'll destroy your career!

433
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,570
Now, now. Calm down a bit, yeah?

434
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,810
It's a bit dusty in here.

435
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,510
Let's chat elsewhere.

436
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,810
- Y-You're going to arrest me?
- No, no.

437
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,660
Wait. Wait, I say.

438
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,970
I am being misunderstood.

439
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,230
I am easily misunderstood!

440
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,650
I hear you, sir.

441
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,040
This was what you wanted. Right, Dr. Hio?

442
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,020
Is something the matter?

443
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,820
No, it's just...

444
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,080
I wonder if my uncle truly did murder Aunt Hio.

445
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,830
I have the same doubt.

446
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,640
But I'm unable to verbalize why I'm feeling this way.

447
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,790
Tell me what you think.

448
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:44,970
I will not deny my uncle deeply detested Aunt Hio.

449
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,830
She was likely an obstacle to his greater scheme.

450
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:54,010
But my aunt only had six months left to live.

451
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,860
Even if my uncle prepared this trap,

452
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,640
did he not once consider simply waiting until she passed?

453
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,020
The hemorrhage.

454
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,300
Did that man undergo a clipping treatment?

455
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,920
Yes, he did.

456
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,320
What is it?

457
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,850
I've failed as a detective.

458
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,340
No, I've failed as a doctor.

459
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,380
I let prejudice cloud my eyes to the truth.

460
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,420
No, perhaps I caught on,

461
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:36,450
but my heart wasn't ready to accept it.

462
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,710
Dr. Takao!

463
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,640
Wait.

464
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,310
I was wrong.

465
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,820
You didn't murder Dr. Hio. You aren't the culprit.

466
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,150
But you said he was, moments ago.

467
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,350
This man wheeled himself into the area I was standing in

468
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,380
of his own volition just the other day.

469
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,380
If he knew of the trap, he'd avoid it like the plague.

470
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,520
This man has undergone a surgical procedure for a hemorrhage

471
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,220
which involves clipping into an aneurysm on the blood vessel.

472
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,720
He is equally in danger in the presence of magnetic force.

473
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,590
I should have noticed from the headache he suffered.

474
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:31,800
This man also has something on hand
that should remain far from MRI.

475
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,600
No, more accurately...

476
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,920
He rides in one.

477
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,900
The magnetic force could've pushed his wheelchair aside,
causing a major accident.

478
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,610
I already told you I was innocent.

479
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,130
Then who killed Aunt Hio?

480
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:57,350
I can't think of anyone else with the motive
to kill my aunt with a trap like that.

481
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,640
I can think of just one person.

482
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,540
This individual caused the incident,

483
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,560
in hopes I would declare Chinu Mikogami the culprit.

484
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,730
In fact, that was their goal all along.

485
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:20,270
The true culprit held a deep love for this hospital.

486
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,550
But they were also backed into a corner.

487
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,140
They were running out of time, after all.

488
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,220
No, it can't be...

489
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,480
The culprit is Hio Mikogami.

490
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,340
That false locked room was a way of taking her own life

491
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,080
devised by none other than Dr. Hio herself.

492
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,550
Dr. Hio committed suicide.

493
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,830
Dr. Hio didn't trust me.

494
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:16,660
Her masterplan hinged on the fact

495
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,760
that I would declare Chinu Mikogami guilty.

496
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,680
Or did she think I would bend the truth

497
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,870
in favor of some emotions?

498
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,350
I am Hio Mikogami's lawyer, Saito.

499
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,440
Before I begin with Dr. Hio's will, I must ask for everyone's -

500
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,380
Enough with the preamble. Tell us what's written in there.

501
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,020
Before I read her will, I have a message from Hio Mikogami.

502
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,160
Allow me to read it aloud.

503
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,060
"Before I announce my will to the folks at the table,"

504
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,610
<i>I have something you must all be informed of.</i>

505
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:03,580
<i>My brother, Chinu, plans to turn this hospital
into a moneymaking scheme.</i>

506
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,460
<i>A tool, simply to fill his own pockets.</i>

507
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,350
<i>My brother is a disgrace to all doctors in the world.</i>

508
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,760
Enough!

509
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,490
Do you plan on pinning me with something so baseless?

510
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:21,460
Interrupt again, and all of my client's inheritance
will be given to her charity of choice.

511
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,120
Thank you for understanding.

512
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:34,770
"Before we proceed, I will inform the room
of the code to the safe in my office."

513
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,610
"55 to the right, 21 to the left..."

514
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,700
"Chinu."

515
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,670
<i>I have kept evidence of all your evil deeds in this safe.</i>

516
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,730
- I-Impossible.
- <i>But it is, possible.</i>

517
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,570
<i>You assumed you had gotten rid of it all,</i>

518
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,840
<i>did you not?</i>

519
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,870
<i>Well, the inside of this safe will surprise you.</i>

520
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:09,170
<i>It is my Pandora's Box to guarantee your demise, brother.</i>

521
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,880
So he has left.

522
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,950
Let's see, in the case Dr. Chinu leaves at this moment...

523
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,600
She wrote her will, simulating what would happen next?

524
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,200
Ah, here we are.

525
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,310
<i>Takao.</i>

526
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:38,260
<i>Knowing you, I assume you have declared the true culprit
without using my scapegoat.</i>

527
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,310
<i>Well, take this as my final selfish request to you.</i>

528
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:48,400
<i>I only wish we could have clashed before my life was lost.</i>

529
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,690
<i>Now then, Takao. Can you stop me?</i>

530
00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:01,220
<i>I will wish only the best for my dearest disciple.</i>

531
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,120
This concludes my client's message.

532
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,570
The battle isn't over?

533
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,800
Why did she warn him, before directing her message to me?

534
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,190
Why the safe?

535
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,280
Kotori, Ayuna Mikogami. Follow me!

536
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,820
Yes, ma'am.

537
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,330
We're on a time crunch. If we don't hurry, it's game over!

538
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,530
To the director's office!

539
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,090
Open up!

540
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,520
I know you're in there!

541
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,240
It's a trap. Think about why the safe is on the floor!

542
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,600
The MRI is right below you!

543
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,400
The door is the magnetic shield.

544
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,470
If you open it up...

545
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,490
There's nothing in here!

546
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,750
Shut it!

547
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,970
Shut the door already!

548
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,000
It... It won't close!

549
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,930
We're taking extreme measures.

550
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,590
Kotori, follow me.

551
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:28,210
Dr. Ameku, will my uncle be saved?

552
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,010
Of course.

553
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:36,220
I'll win our first and last battle of wits,
and prevent Dr. Hio from becoming a murderer.

554
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,540
W-Who are you people?

555
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,690
- There's been a magnetic emergency.
- Pardon?

556
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,420
The vice director is being affected.
Call Ayuna Mikogami and you'll know.

557
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,030
We'll overload the MRI with liquid helium.

558
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,490
It'll force the magnetism to a halt.

559
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,280
Are you seriously doing this?

560
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,200
It's our only choice.

561
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,240
H-Hey!

562
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,010
Get off. You're suffocating me.

563
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,270
My apologies.

564
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,400
Ayuna Mikogami, do you read me?

565
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,220
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

566
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,470
We destroyed the MRI's magnetic field.

567
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,020
- Chinu Mikogami...
- Are you okay, sir?

568
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,590
Is he alive?

569
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,430
Sir, can you hear me?

570
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,560
He's conscious.

571
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,340
He's alive!

572
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,580
I see.

573
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,360
That's good to hear.

574
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:08,050
I win, Dr. Hio.

575
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,780
[Hio Mikogami]

576
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,220
Things are finally taking a turn for the better.

577
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:19,340
Our board has taken my uncle out of the running for director.

578
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,230
That doesn't surprise me, given his behavior the other day.

579
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,040
I feel as though everything went according to Aunt Hio's plan.

580
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,550
I believe she knew you would stop her
from becoming a murderer as well, Dr. Ameku.

581
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:43,590
She trusted her disciple, from the heart.

582
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,800
I only hope you're right.

583
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,600
Thank you for your patience.

584
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,800
I will now disclose Dr. Hio's will you two were absent for.

585
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:07,430
"I, Hio Mikogami, will donate all the money in my account
to charities of my choosing."

586
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:15,830
"And I will entrust the hospital and its shares
to my niece, Ayuna Mikogami."

587
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,020
I also have a message for you from Dr. Hio.

588
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,430
<i>I know you can do it.</i>

589
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,110
<i>I trust that you will.</i>

590
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,600
<i>So I will simply say, do you best.</i>

591
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,050
Aunt Hio...

592
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,000
I also have one, final message to you, Dr. Ameku.

593
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,010
She leaves only a short phrase.

594
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,620
I enjoyed myself.

595
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,020
As did I.

596
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,570
I truly did, Dr. Hio.

597
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:37,920
We will continue our observation of Mikogami General Hospital.

598
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,030
I cannot understand your actions in the slightest, sir.

599
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,660
[Natsuko Kuraishi's Secretary - Shioya]

600
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,150
Have her sent to us right away.

601
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:58,370
We have one operation room open.

602
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,050
Our anesthesiologists are on standby.

603
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,990
We don't have enough surgeons to deal with an emergency.

604
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,210
Bring her to an operation room.

605
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,170
I will operate on this patient myself.
