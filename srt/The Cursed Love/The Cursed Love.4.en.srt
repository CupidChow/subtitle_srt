♫My love for you never evanesces♫

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,400
Mr. Siwat?

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,880
Has Khun already taken you to the hospital?

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,800
Don't you have eyes?

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,800
Nosy jerk.

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
Even if what happened between us was true

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,840
or that Tambralinga city
is truly in Khao Luang,

23
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,640
I'll bury that city with my own hands

24
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,680
so that it doesn't cause
any chaos to my forest!

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,120
But fate brings the Yoni stone
and the Shiva lingam quartz together.

26
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,600
Soon, the Four Element Benders will appear.

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,840
And once the gate to
Tambralinga opens again,

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,100
we will use these two stones
to awaken Kalakal's atman.

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,480
This is reality,

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,400
not your imaginary world!

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,300
- Just trust me...
- But I won't.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,840
Siwat just rode off all of a sudden,

33
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,000
and Khun sped after him!

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,640
Don't know what's going on between them.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
You won't stop

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,800
until I take you there?

37
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,640
Yes.

38
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,880
And even though
I don't have your Shiva lingam necklace,

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,720
I won't just abandon my lifelong curiosity.

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,900
Why does the lost city
have something to do with my power,

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,320
and why does the man
I dreamed of look like you?

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,720
Those answers are hidden there.

I'll take you there.

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,040
You happy now?

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,640
Otherwise, you'll never stop making me worry.

59
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,560
I'll take you to the ruins
you've been dying to see.

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,400
But under one condition.

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,960
What is it?

62
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,280
I'm not telling you.

63
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,800
Just do what I say.

64
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,880
Deal.

65
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,360
Wait, hold on.

66
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:26,495
You haven't told me

67
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,800
when we'd go into the forest.

68
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,880
After I train you to control your powers.

69
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,760
Hey, wait.

70
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,480
You didn't mention that in our deal.

71
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,760
If we're going into the forest,

72
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,040
I have to make sure you're qualified

73
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:41,686
and won't bring any harm to my forest.

74
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,840
Think about this...

75
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,000
Hey, both of you!

76
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,360
Go to sleep!

77
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,900
Gosh.

78
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,080
Let's go to bed, shall we?

79
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,920
You too.

80
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,600
Why am I sleepy all of a sudden?

81
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,520
Now listen.

82
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,880
If you go into the forest
while you can't even control your powers,

83
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,120
your fire will burn it all to ashes.

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,160
You get that?

85
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,280
Yeah.

86
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,980
I'll train with you, then.

87
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,400
Good.

88
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Give me your bag.

89
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Do you wanna train or not?

90
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,320
And this is your final warning.

91
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,720
Stay away from Thakoon.

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,358
Go get some rest.

93
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,380
Tomorrow's gonna wear you out.

94
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,160
[Tambralinga City]

95
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,074
Hey, you ready?

96
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,939
- Yes.
- Yeah.

97
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Where's Thara?

98
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,000
He said he had some business in town.

99
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,220
The same old excuse.

100
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,800
You'd better dock his paycheck for that.

101
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,920
What about the newcomer?

102
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm here.

103
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Been waiting for ages.

104
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,960
Think you can handle it?

105
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,200
We'll find out soon enough.

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Get ready.

107
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
Pun wins!

108
00:10:57,976 --> 00:10:58,600
Hey.

109
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,640
Look.

110
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,656
The stares.

111
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,160
Like they're gonna tear each other apart.

112
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,640
Yeah, I know.

113
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,440
You guys ready?

114
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,200
It's a draw.

115
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,440
Yay!

116
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,720
Kor, it's a draw!

117
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
What the heck? Let go!

118
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,755
Ah! What is it?

119
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,960
You woke me up this early.

120
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,200
What's so damn urgent?

121
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,680
Since when did you start working
for Professor Thakoon?

122
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm just helping him
before I get into my master's.

123
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Calm down, man!

124
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,440
You're upset about Siwat, aren't you?

125
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
I know

126
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,040
you and Khun are serious
about finding the city.

127
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,640
- But...
- Tell me everything you told Siwat.

128
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,226
Well, I only said that...

129
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,920
Tambralinga was ruled by the Four Benders.

130
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,000
Aside from the Four Benders ruling the city,

131
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,380
what else did you tell him?

132
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
That was all, I think?

133
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,800
He seemed desperate to find the city.

134
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,720
Did he tell you why?

135
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,680
Aside from the search for the city
and his father's promise...

136
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,320
He didn't mention anything else.

137
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,960
If anything comes up, call me.

138
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,560
Alright.

139
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,480
Thara!

140
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,241
Professor?

141
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,222
Apo...

142
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,120
The key to summoning your powers

143
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
is concentration.

144
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,240
You must channel all your power
into a single point.

145
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,920
What the heck is this feeling?

146
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,920
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

147
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,640
Sh*t...

148
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,520
What the heck is this feeling?

149
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,349
Do you even exercise?

150
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
I work all the time.

151
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,120
I don't have time for that.

152
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:09,886
No wonder you're so tiny and skinny.

153
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,480
Like those skinny jeans?

154
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:15,593
If so,

155
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,680
you'd be the baggy ones.

156
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,480
You saying I'm fat?

157
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,680
Nope.

158
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,359
Just saying...

159
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,316
Who's ever gonna look as good as you?

160
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,520
But what kind of training is this?

161
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,040
Is being naked necessary?

162
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,520
The human body is made up of four elements:

163
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,560
earth for the bones,

164
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,840
water for the fluids,

165
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,360
air for the breath,

166
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,600
and fire for the metabolism.

167
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,920
The key to summoning your powers

168
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,680
is concentration.

169
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,720
You must channel all your power
into a single point,

170
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,240
which is your palms.

171
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,160
Alright, now you try it.

172
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,910
Close your eyes.

173
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Close your eyes!

174
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,920
It's not working!

175
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,560
That's not enough concentration.

176
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,655
Try this.

177
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,560
Focus your mind

178
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and look at me.

179
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,760
It worked!

180
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,200
Put it out.

181
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,400
What?

182
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,980
If you can start it, you can put it out.

183
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,700
How do I do that?

184
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,840
I can't.

185
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,696
Give me your hands.

186
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,280
♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

187
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,260
♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

188
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,720
♫But there's one thing still remains♫

189
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,840
♫That's my only one true love♫

190
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,680
♫Through hundred thousand years♫

191
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,640
Let's call it a day.

192
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,430
What? I haven't even mastered it.

193
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,280
You've reached your limit today.

194
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,490
I have not!

195
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,720
Your mind was all over the place.

196
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,160
Don't argue.

197
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,920
Though today's not a bad start at all.

198
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,480
♫No matter how long it takes♫

199
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,960
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

200
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,402
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

201
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,480
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

202
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,960
♫Never want to change, alright♫

203
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,840
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

204
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,760
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

205
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,160
Your legs are already shaking from this,

206
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,950
and you're going into the forest?

207
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,700
You won't last long.

208
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,541
Are you done talking?

209
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,880
I'm exhausted.

210
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Go take a shower

211
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and have some food.

212
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,610
Mm.

213
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,480
Wait.

214
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,160
Aunt Kate asked me to tell you that...

215
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,160
the water is not running in your room.

216
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,640
Use the communal bathroom.

217
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,880
Is that all?

218
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,404
Yeah,

219
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
you want anything else?

220
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,360
Give me some space, will you?

221
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,710
Come on, let me be close to you for a sec.

222
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Rub my back.

223
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,920
That's good.

224
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,320
Oh, Thara?

225
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,012
You're back?

226
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
Yeah, I had some business

227
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,360
at the museum.

228
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
You went there?

229
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,640
What an excuse, slacker!

230
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,720
None of your business.

231
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,228
Oh!

232
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,040
Whoa!

233
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,080
You're something else, bro.

234
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
F*ck you looking at?

235
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,520
Just do your thing.

236
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
I'm done.

237
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,159
What the f*ck are you looking at?

238
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,000
- The f*ck do you want?
- Come get me!

239
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,200
Come on!

240
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,400
Have you ever seen Tambralinga before?

241
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,680
When Khun and I were young,
Uncle Singkhon took us

242
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,880
into the Khao Luang forest

243
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,000
and showed us a place.

244
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,120
He told us

245
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,320
it was just city ruins.

246
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,400
So you've seen the ruins?

247
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,320
Well,

248
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,720
if the answer you're looking for
is in the Khao Luang forest,

249
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,480
I think I can help you.

250
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,400
Why would you help me

251
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,200
when you probably treasure this forest
just like Khunkhao does?

252
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,075
I'm not sure,

253
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,520
but ever since the day I met you,

254
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,320
I've felt like we're connected
in some kind of way.

255
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,360
It's almost like I've met you before.

256
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,215
What are you two doing?

257
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,680
Are you done?

258
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,920
Your mom needs you.

259
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,240
Are you blind or what?

260
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,280
Slacking off all day, huh?

261
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,320
Hurry up

262
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,440
and go eat.

263
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,007
I know what to do.

264
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,080
Are you and Thara
keeping something from me?

265
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,840
You're gonna watch me shower or what?

266
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,120
Get out.

267
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,960
The three of us were the Benders
from the legend of Tambralinga.

268
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,000
We are bound by the past.

269
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,960
I don't wanna hear that.

270
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,840
But I do.

271
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,000
We will use these two stones
to awaken Kalakal's atman.

272
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,360
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

273
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,080
What the heck now?

274
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,240
Oh? It's our LINE MAN order.

275
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,120
Yes? You're here?

276
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,320
Right this way!

277
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,520
Come here!

278
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,180
Your fried chicken, sir.

279
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

280
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,651
140 baht, please.

281
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,480
How would you like to pay?

282
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,200
By scanning, please.

283
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,120
Okay.

284
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
Hey, Kor, since you're rich,

285
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,080
it's your treat today.

286
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,320
Here, sir.

287
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,720
I'm always the rich one, huh?

288
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,800
- How much?
- 140 baht, sir.

289
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,400
Have you got it?

290
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,320
Yes, sir.

291
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,600
Please enjoy.

292
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
- Sure.
- Thank you.

293
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,096
Oh, looks good!

294
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,137
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

295
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,004
It's so big.

296
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,320
The human body is made up of four elements:

297
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,240
earth for the bones,

298
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,440
water for the fluids,

299
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,120
air for the breath,

300
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,360
and fire for the metabolism.

301
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,720
The key to summoning your powers

302
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,640
is concentration.

303
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,640
You must channel all your power
into one single point,

304
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,840
Sh*t!

305
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,630
Was that a fluke?

306
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,325
Whoa...

307
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,400
What is it?

308
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,840
I forgot to tell you

309
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,003
that Khunkhao's Shiva lingam quartz

310
00:31:20,123 --> 00:31:21,560
and Siwat's Yoni stone

311
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,200
could guide us to Tambralinga.

312
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,080
How can I be sure it'll work?

313
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
If you want to find out,

314
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,840
fetch those two stones
and have Professor perform the ritual.

315
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
If it works,

316
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,200
it might answer your questions
about Tambralinga.

317
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,840
Fine.

318
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,880
Mind, where's Khun?

319
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,880
He was going to Siwat's.

320
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,680
He sounded interested.

321
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,640
If he manages to fetch them...

322
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,920
We will use these two stones
to awaken Kalakal's atman.

323
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,080
Khunkhao,

324
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,080
I can control my powers now.

325
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,382
Show me.

326
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
I don't have to look at you, too.

327
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,640
Whoa.

328
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,420
You're good.

329
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,280
Why didn't you tell me he possesses powers?

330
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,720
Wait,

331
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,240
why is Thara...

332
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,560
He possesses the water abilities.

333
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,520
Why did you tell him, but not me?

334
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,760
I never meant to tell anyone, even,

335
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,623
but Khun discovered it by chance.

336
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,560
If all of this matches
Professor Thakoon's memo,

337
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,680
I'll definitely find Tambralinga.

338
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,200
The three of us were the Benders
from the legend of Tambralinga.

339
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,960
We are bound by the past.

340
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,840
Coming here,

341
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
seeing the visions,

342
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,670
and meeting you two...

343
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,040
It has shown me that

344
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,960
my fire powers aren't a curse,

345
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,280
but a spark that begins our journey
to uncover the mysteries of our past.

346
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
So that's why...

347
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,120
I felt such a connection to you.

348
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,788
It's because the three of us

349
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,840
are bound by the same past.

350
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,600
I want to know what really happened.

351
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,690
Seeing these visions of the past...

352
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:09,142
There must be a reason
we crossed paths again.

353
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,000
Don't you both wanna know what happened?

354
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,440
I don't.

355
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,700
But I do.

356
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,680
Earth told me that

357
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,480
Thakoon knows how to use these two stones.

358
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,247
I think...

359
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,280
we need Thakoon's help.

360
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,400
If we're gonna let him help,

361
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,000
we need to be careful.

362
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,880
Go tell him

363
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,000
that you and Siwat will do it his way.

364
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,039
We will bathe the Shiva lingam quartz
and the Yoni stone in moonlight

365
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,680
to worship Siva,

366
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,400
for the Lord will graciously
open up the way to the city.

367
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,880
Om...

368
00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:17,508
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

370

♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

371
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,828
♫But there's one thing still remains♫

372
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:07,948

Thanks.

409
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:53,782
Oh?

410
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:54,832
What?

411
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:00,388
I told you,

412
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:02,188
I don't want anyone
to know about your powers.

413
00:39:02,788 --> 00:39:03,668
I was just...

414
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,508
Excited.

415
00:39:06,088 --> 00:39:07,564
It's not too late to change your mind.

416
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:10,468
I think it's too risky for you.

417
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:11,908
I'm not afraid,

418
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:13,453
and I'm not changing my mind.

419
00:39:13,988 --> 00:39:15,788
We'll need Professor Thakoon anyway...

420
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:18,028
I don't want him to find out
about your powers.

421
00:39:19,428 --> 00:39:20,628
I am aware of that.

422
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:22,878
What were you excited about, though?

423
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:30,301
'Cause you were close to me?

424
00:39:32,888 --> 00:39:33,788
No.

425
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:38,901
Then, was it because...

426
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:40,108
you have a crush on me?

427
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:41,108
Whoa...

428
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:48,028
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

429
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:49,028
I've had enough.

430
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:52,468
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

431
00:39:52,508 --> 00:39:55,908
♫Never want to change, alright♫

432
00:39:55,948 --> 00:40:00,788
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

433
00:40:00,828 --> 00:40:03,628
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

434
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:04,527
Is that yours?

435
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:05,508
I'll take it.

436
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:06,319
Hey!

437
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:16,508
Siwat mentioned he had visions
when he came here.

438
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:19,308
Did he tell you what he saw?

439
00:40:20,088 --> 00:40:21,028
He didn't.

440
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,428
And you?

441
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:26,788
What did you see?

442
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:28,348
Nothing.

443
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,348
What would I see?

444
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:32,268
Then all we can do is wait.

445
00:40:33,628 --> 00:40:35,868
Once we find Tambralinga,

446
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:40,228
we'll know what really happened in the past.

447
00:40:41,468 --> 00:40:42,748
Don't underestimate them, though.

448
00:40:43,268 --> 00:40:45,748
We'll use Thakoon to lead us to the city.

449
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:49,548
I'll keep Siwat close.

450
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,228
I'll back you two up.

451
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:00,948
It's Earth.

452
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:02,573
Answer it.

453
00:41:03,868 --> 00:41:04,668
Hey.

454
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:06,988
I was about to call you.

455
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:10,868
I want to find out
the truth behind those two stones.

456
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:13,428
What?

457
00:41:15,148 --> 00:41:17,828
You want me to take
the Shiva lingam quartz from Khun?

458
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:22,468
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

459
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:28,330
Earth, too.

460
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:29,668
We can't trust him.

461
00:41:43,488 --> 00:41:44,488
Let's get started.

462
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,388
Why are you so excited?

463
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:16,428
I've lived my whole life
wondering if it was a curse.

464
00:42:17,028 --> 00:42:19,428
And now that I know
you're all connected to it,

465
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:21,828
I'm even more excited and terrified.

466
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,068
No matter what happens,

467
00:42:26,348 --> 00:42:28,348
Thara and I will have your back.

468
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,108
Don't worry.

469
00:42:52,908 --> 00:42:53,828
You should hurry.

470
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:04,708
Professor, do you know
why Tambralinga fell and became lost

471
00:44:05,428 --> 00:44:08,428
despite being under
the rule of the Four Benders?

472
00:44:10,228 --> 00:44:11,588
The city lost its balance.

473
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:15,428
Three of the Benders,

474
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:17,872
namely Asuni,

475
00:44:18,348 --> 00:44:19,348
Suriya,

476
00:44:20,988 --> 00:44:22,108
and Apo,

477
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,068
joined forces in rebellion,

478
00:44:26,028 --> 00:44:28,988
killing Brahmin Kalakal
and shattering his atman.

479
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:32,868
As punishment,
Siva cast judgment upon the city,

480
00:44:33,388 --> 00:44:35,108
bringing about its downfall.

481
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,569
But...

482
00:44:37,748 --> 00:44:39,708
Why did they rebel?

483
00:44:40,328 --> 00:44:41,668
We'll find that out today.

484
00:45:28,808 --> 00:45:30,508
So, what are we doing now?

485
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:36,748
We will bathe the Shiva lingam quartz
and the Yoni stone in moonlight

486
00:45:36,788 --> 00:45:38,228
to worship Siva,

487
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,988
for the Lord will graciously
open up the way to the city.

488
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:48,868
We may start the ritual.

489
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:02,988
Om...

490
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:02,028
This part of the forest
is veiled by unseen powers.

491
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:04,228
That's why Khun's performing
the unveiling ritual

492
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:05,628
to lead us to the missing.

493
00:47:05,748 --> 00:47:06,548
What's wrong?

494
00:47:06,828 --> 00:47:07,668
I'm not sure,

495
00:47:08,548 --> 00:47:09,780
but I have a bad feeling

496
00:47:10,368 --> 00:47:11,368
that something might go wrong.

497
00:47:11,668 --> 00:47:12,308
Hey!

498
00:47:16,508 --> 00:47:17,508
Help!

499
00:47:19,188 --> 00:47:19,988
Help me!

500
