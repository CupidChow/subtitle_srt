00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:42,789
♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:49,799
♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,379
♫But there's one thing still remains♫

4
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,399
♫That's my only one true love♫

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,190
♫Through hundred thousand years♫

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,889
♫It's still only you, not anyone else♫

7
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,929
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

8
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,640
♫I'll be there to be by your side, your side only♫

♫My love for you never evanesces♫

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,939
It's pathetic
seeing you all protecting each other.

18
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,749
No matter how hard you try to lie to us,

19
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,669
I won't buy it.

20
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,819
Guess you'll have to see for yourselves.

21
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,780
(Casting a spell)

22
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:05,018
Datula...

23
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:08,509
It's a deadly flower that feeds on blood
and gnaws at the human heart.

24
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,396
If it's not removed,

25
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,010
it'll consume Siwat from within
and kill him.

26
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,756
Why are you so desperate
to go after such a dangerous place?

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,989
I need to see it with my own eyes.

28
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,759
You might die before you do.

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,509
Everything must return to the beginning.

30
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,380
The beginning?

31
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,116
(Casting a spell)

32
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,272
(Casting a spell)

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:58,421
(Casting a spell)

34
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:12,538
(Casting a spell)

35
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:18,260
(Casting a spell)

36
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:33,350
(Casting a spell)

37
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,860
(Casting a spell)

38
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:43,740
(Casting a spell)

39
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:50,690
Surrender yourselves to me,

40
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:52,203
and you shall be spared.

41
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,210
Suriya!

42
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,619
May Siva vanquish the darkness
that has consumed Tambralinga,

43
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,407
and may Kalakal's body and atman
be bound and sealed,

44
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,065
never to be reborn
to bring decay upon the people

45
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,989
from this moment forth!

46
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:11,025
I shall return
and take my revenge on all of you.

47
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:25,940
So that his body shall never again
join with the atman,

48
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:29,381
we must bury him within the sacred land.

49
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,260
Such an act

50
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,220
is tantamount to accepting betrothal to Apo.

51
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,592
Suriya is mine.

52
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,330
He loves me, not you.

53
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,640
I shall not allow my beloved
to be taken from me.

54
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:27,460
Suriya,

55
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:29,796
you need to choose between me and Asuni.

56
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,701
Suriya!

57
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,320
Suriya...

58
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,330
You...

59
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,101
The rebels shall meet their end.

60
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,207
Kalakal!

61
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:13,287
Kill me!

62
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,778
And Suriya shall fall with me.

63
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:27,294
With his body,

64
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:30,981
I shall slaughter every soul
on the land you hold dear.

65
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,276
You cannot do that.

66
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,250
Asuni...

67
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:49,229
Suriya?

68
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:55,629
Draw him out,

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,127
and bind him with the Heart of the Vedas.

70
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,069
Apo.

71
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,320
We two are the keepers
of the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone.

72
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:49,156
Through every life

73
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,501
and across a thousand years,

74
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:56,327
our duty is to protect this city
from the darkness.

75
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,396
One day,

76
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,540
we will return to restore it again.

77
00:11:26,872 --> 00:11:27,600
Siwat...

78
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:28,494
Siwat!

79
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,396
What's wrong?

80
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,061
I'm okay.

81
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,461
Pun!

82
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:52,661
Wait...

83
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:53,847
Is that Kor?

84
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,887
Right here!

85
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,683
We're over here!

86
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,618
- Ouch!
- Hey!

87
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,600
I thought you were dead
and that I'd never see you again!

88
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,487
You're safe now, Mind.

89
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:19,490
You're all safe, right?

90
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,283
Is everything okay?

91
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,992
I think we should hurry,

92
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:31,180
or it'll be too late.

93
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,690
Siwat's getting worse.

94
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,290
Wait,

95
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:36,145
someone needs to take Mind home.

96
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,981
What about you?

97
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:41,883
You know they need me.

98
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:43,180
You're right.

99
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,723
Pun, can you take her home?

100
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:49,180
Of course.

101
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,450
Leave that to me.

102
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:52,269
I'll be back as soon as possible.

103
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:53,389
No need.

104
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,778
I'll take care of this.

105
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,109
I'll see you at home.

106
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:57,180
Understand?

107
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:58,610
Yes.

108
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:01,658
We'll split into two teams.

109
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:04,130
Thara and Earth, you two come with me.

110
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:05,505
Dean,

111
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,010
you lead Kor and Waii the other way.

112
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:09,180
Alright, let's go.

113
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:13,180
Take care of yourself, okay?

114
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:15,040
You, too.

115
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:21,580
Kor.

116
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,545
What the h*ll?

117
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,425
Take care of yourself, okay?

118
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,280
I'll see you at home.

119
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,807
Alright. Go now.

120
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:55,939
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

121
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:03,876

132

Stop!

133
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:03,905
Dad!

134
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,523
No!

135
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:10,263
♫No matter how long it takes♫

136
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:13,003
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

137
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:33,924
Hey...

138
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:37,692
You alright?

139
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:40,804
I'm fine.

140
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:43,888
Let me see.

141
00:15:54,963 --> 00:15:56,593
The closer we get to Tambralinga,

142
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:00,223
the more I see the past,

143
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,528
when we sealed Kalakal.

144
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,404
Now I can see the whole past.

145
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:19,226
We must find the city gate immediately,

146
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:21,924
before he unites
the atman with its mortal form.

147
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,163
Khun!

148
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,204
Thara!

149
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:56,928
We're entering the fog forest,

150
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,088
the final territory.

151
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:01,683
Once we make it out,

152
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,252
we'll reach Tambralinga.

153
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,175
But the fog is toxic,

154
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,906
so we need to make it out
as fast as we can.

155
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,553
That's why...

156
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:21,323
my father sealed this forest

157
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,283
after he brought Thakoon here.

158
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:28,717
I came here once

159
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:30,746
after my father died

160
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,179
'cause I wanted to know
if what he was protecting with his life

161
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,528
really existed.

162
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,873
And I found this out.

163
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:46,803
I barely made it out.

164
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,212
Earth,

165
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:56,913
it's still not too late to leave.

166
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,583
Khun and I
can take care of Siwat from now on.

167
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:03,706
But I'll never leave my friends behind.

168
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:07,328
Khun,

169
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,008
I found a way.

170
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:11,546
There are fresh footprints over there.

171
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:13,263
Follow me.

172
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:15,561
Be careful, guys.

173
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:38,572
Hey!

174
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,723
Step back.

175
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:27,888
Hey!

176
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:28,899
Siwat!

177
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:30,877
Siwat!

178
00:19:37,563 --> 00:19:38,295
Go!

179
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:39,833
Now!

180
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:46,266
What's this smell?

181
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:48,106
It's the toxic fog forest

182
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:51,736
that the mad scholar told us about.

183
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:56,724
Wait.

184
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,263
That son of a b*tch is here.

185
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:00,790
I mean your son.

186
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:06,899
Careful.

187
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:08,172
The fog is toxic.

188
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:11,042

Come on!

Stop!

192

You think you're so tough, huh?

193
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,652
Fine, I'll take you down first.

194
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:39,563
No, Maria!

195
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,470
Stop!

196
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:41,563
Let go of me.

197
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:43,975
Dad!

198
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:46,273
No!

199
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:49,095
You're next.

200
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:49,917

Tell me it's not true.

209
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,746
Maria said you betrayed me.

210
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:28,281
I shouldn't have, Dad.

211
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,081
Is this yours?

212
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:40,870
I found it at the camp.

213
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:46,084
- Go.
- Dad!

214
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,292
Go now.

219
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:56,259

I can't...

223
00:23:01,706 --> 00:23:03,153
I can't even move.

224
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:05,204
You need to go now.

225
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:06,644

No matter how much time passes,

377
00:43:49,883 --> 00:43:51,142
I'll never forget him.

378
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:31,963
Excuse me.

379
00:44:32,756 --> 00:44:34,116
Are you here for the interview?

380
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:39,178
Yes.

381
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,138
Sh*t!

382
00:44:44,902 --> 00:44:46,991
Well, that's not my name.

383
00:44:46,992 --> 00:44:48,029
I'm Peem.

384
00:44:54,752 --> 00:44:55,832
He looks just like him.

385
00:45:00,882 --> 00:45:01,978
Did you say...

386
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:03,643
your name was Peem?

387
00:45:03,942 --> 00:45:04,625
Yes.

388
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:07,142
Let's shake hands.

389
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:18,712
Welcome to the team.

390
00:45:21,658 --> 00:45:23,582
Does that mean I got the job?

391
00:45:25,752 --> 00:45:27,316
Welcome to the team.

392
00:45:31,003 --> 00:45:32,160
Thank you.

393
00:45:33,152 --> 00:45:35,447
Wait, did you guys...

394
00:45:35,796 --> 00:45:37,149
hire him already?

395
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,625
He hasn't even been interviewed yet.

396
00:45:38,807 --> 00:45:42,042
Meanwhile, I had a full-day interview
and barely made it through.

397
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:43,811
Jeez.

398
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,163
You're d*mn lucky, man.

399
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:50,618
Oh, thanks.

400
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:55,483
Anyway, thank you.
