00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,560
♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,540
♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

3
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,000
♫But there's one thing still remains♫

4
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,120
♫That's my only one true love♫

5
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,960
♫Through hundred thousand years♫

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,240
♫It's still only you, not anyone else♫

7
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,600
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,440
♫I'll be there to be by your side, your side only♫

9
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,200
♫Please hear my plead♫

10
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,760
♫No matter how long it takes♫

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,240
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,682
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

14
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,240
♫Never want to change, alright♫

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,120
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,240
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,680
This part of the forest
is veiled by unseen powers.

18
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,840
That's why Khun's performing
the unveiling ritual

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,040
to lead us to the missing.

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
What's wrong?

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,320
I'm not sure,

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,400
but I have a bad feeling

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
something might go wrong.

24
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,360
Help me!

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,640
Help...

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,440
Professor!

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,419
The lightning born from the power
of the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone led me here

28
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,040
to seek what has been lost.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,920
That's...

30
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,600
a copy of the Vedic scriptures...

31
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,560
you discovered years ago.

32
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,000
(Casting a spell)

33
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,960
I now call upon Brahmin Kalakal
to reclaim his body.

34
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:14,280
(Casting a spell)

35
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,160
Aunt Kate,

36
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,800
there's something you need to know.

37
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,120
What is it?

38
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
It's Siwat...

39
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,160
Professor!

40
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,040
That's...

41
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,560
what I was gonna tell you.

42
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,765
Siwat possesses powers
like Thara and Khunkhao do.

43
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
I'm sorry.

44
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,520
I really can't control it.

45
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,891
Are you sure that everything you told me,

46
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,080
about the four Brahmins

47
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,080
and the powers you three possess,

48
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,840
is connected to Tambralinga?

49
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
All that we've witnessed

50
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,360
leaves no room for doubt.

51
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,680
It's all real.

52
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,760
The moment our noses bled,

53
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,840
it felt exactly like
the lightning that freed Kalakal.

54
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,561
He's been freed again, hasn't he?

55
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,200
We need to figure out
how to deal with him.

56
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,800
If he manages to possess...

57
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,920
any of us,

58
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,200
the rest will be in danger.

59
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,240
All of our past happened in Tambralinga.

60
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,888
Once we locate it,

61
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,960
we'll know how to deal with him.

62
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
Wait,

63
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,000
are you...

64
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,160
trying to find that city?

65
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,080
I think we need to do it.

66
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,924
You can't.

67
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,840
If that city gets mentioned again,

68
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,160
treasure hunters
will come swarming into the forest.

69
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,700
If that's your concern,

70
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,960
we promise we...

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,020
I'm worried that...

72
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,520
I'll lose my family again,
like I lost Singkhon.

73
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,800
All of us...

74
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,920
will be targeted.

75
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,400
These treasure hunters will stop at nothing

76
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,960
to take the Shiva lingam and Yoni stone,

77
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,770
and everyone here will be at risk.

78
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,380
What if we go in quietly?

79
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,680
You know, just to find out
why the three of us had to meet again.

80
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,680
You've forgotten, haven't you,

81
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,840
that Michael had to die

82
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,440
because of that city?

83
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,360
Mom!

84
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,060
It took us ten long years

85
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,520
to come to terms with Singkhon's death.

86
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Have you forgotten the agony we felt, Khun?

87
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,960
I want you to start fresh

88
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,720
and leave the past behind.

89
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,560
If we keep bringing up that city,

90
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,520
how could Khun and Siwat

91
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,720
ever forget about Singkhon and Michael?

92
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,520
But...

93
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,200
if you know full well that what you're after

94
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,640
will ruin everyone here,

95
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,920
and you still refuse to stop,

96
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,720
then I can't stop you.

97
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,000
But if we're to suffer losses once again,

98
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,200
be prepared for the consequences.

99
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,240
Who are you?

100
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,600
Why are you spying on my family?!

101
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,800
Nearly 20 years have passed,

102
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,280
and the lone huntress of Nakhon Si Thammarat

103
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,730
has become nothing more than a legend.

104
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,760
Aisoon!

105
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,960
What do you want?

106
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,720
Do you think Khunkhao will ever know

107
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,200
who was responsible

108
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,960
for his dad's death?

109
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Shut up!

110
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,880
You'll need to beg me to keep quiet forever,

111
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,720
like you always have.

112
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,597
Otherwise,

113
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,640
Khunkhao will hate you for life.

114
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,600
You already took Singkhon's life,

115
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,000
what more do you want?!

116
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,080
Bring me Siwat,

117
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,040
the Shiva lingam, and the Yoni Stone,

118
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,880
and I'll take this secret

119
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,400
to my grave.

120
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,840
Thara!

121
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,440
What?

122
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,600
Well,

123
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,160
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

124
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,400
If you're talking about the past,

125
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,520
it doesn't matter.

126
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,640
But I killed you with my own hands.

127
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,840
You didn't kill me.

128
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,920
Kalakal did.

129
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't worry about it.

130
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,400
The more I see the past,

131
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,480
the more I fear...

132
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,945
that I might end up hurting you.

133
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,960
The past may have returned

134
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,400
so that we can deal with Kalakal.

135
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,600
Uncle Singkhon once said that

136
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,560
our deaths would mark the end of everything.

137
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,680
So today, I'll begin anew.

138
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,240
I won't let the past
steal away the person I love,

139
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
or you, again.

140
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,260
I'm heading to bed now.

141
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,360
You should get some rest, too.

142
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,809
I thought Thara would walk you here.

143
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,880
You've been through a lot today.

144
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,480
Go get some rest.

145
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,327
Don't worry.

146
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,840
Hang on.

147
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,800
Will you forgive my father?

148
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,920
I know it's not an easy thing to do...

149
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,160
but it's possible, isn't it?

150
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,320
♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

151

157
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
I ran out of breath.

158
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:35,180

No...

168
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,920
No!

169
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,381
No...

170
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,160
No!

171
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
Give me back my necklace.

172
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,328
No...

173
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,920
Don't take it away.

174
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,360
Give it back to me.

175
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,360
Khunkhao!

176
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,360
Hey!

177
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,280
What happened?

178
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:05,750
Khunkhao?

179
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,840
Khunkhao...

180
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,280
- Dad...
- Yeah?

181
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,400
My necklace...

182
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
My necklace...

183
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,520
Aisoon.

184
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,800
Kate.

185
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,640
Take Khunkhao to the hospital.

186
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,844
Singkhon,

187
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,800
where are you going?

188
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,720
I'll go get the necklace back.

189
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Watch out!

190
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,440
Singkhon!!

191
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,320
Dad!

192
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:00,080
Dad...

193
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,160
Dad!

194
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,560
Khunkhao.

195
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,520
I dreamed of my dad.

196
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,120
It was just a dream.

197
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,280
If I had protected the Shiva lingam necklace,

198
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,260
my dad wouldn't have had to die.

199
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,760
It's my fault...

200
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,840
that he died.

201
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,720
I want to know what exactly happened.

202
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,720
There's someone who knows that very well.

203
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,120
Come closer and you'll die.

204
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,840
Aunt Kate!

205
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,720
Kill him.

206
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:46,093
♫No matter how long it takes♫

207
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,733
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

208
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:10,373
Singkhon...

209
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,213
I'm sorry.

210
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:22,333
I really didn't know
what to do at the time.

211
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,723
Are you crying?

212
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:49,533
Is everything okay?

213
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,173
I...

214
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,333
just miss Singkhon.

215
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:08,293
I also dreamed of him last night.

216
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:19,773
Do you remember...

217
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,413
how much Singkhon

218
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,733
cherished Khao Luang forest

219
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,013
and Tambralinga?

220
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:29,433
I do.

221
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:33,173
He never wanted anyone to invade

222
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:34,473
or ruin it.

223
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,293
If you know that...

224
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,533
But Tambralinga means a lot to me,

225
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:39,773
Thara...

226
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:43,453
and Siwat as well.

227
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:51,173
No matter what happens,

228
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,853
I'll face the consequences.

229
00:21:58,253 --> 00:21:59,633
Please don't stop us.

230
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,733
Aunt Kate,

231
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,933
may I speak with you?

232
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,693
Have a seat.

233
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:03,293
Thank you.

234
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:10,933
I love this place.

235
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:15,933
I wanna stay here
with Khunkhao, Thara, and you.

236
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:20,733
I know no one can ever forget
the pain of losing their parents.

237
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:29,013
I just can't do anything.

238
00:23:31,753 --> 00:23:33,270
Unable to change the past...

239
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,273
And unable to move forward.

240
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:44,773
Why did my father hurt Uncle Singkhon?

241
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,373
I want to know what exactly happened.

242
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:56,413
There's someone who knows that very well.

243
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:36,573
I'm here.

244
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:41,653
I'm not getting out until I see you.

245
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:43,693
I'm right here.

246
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:51,693
Aisoon?

247
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,013
I'm sorry.

248
00:24:57,373 --> 00:25:00,173
He wouldn't show himself
if I didn't bring you with me.

249
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:02,813
As soon as I get out of the car,

250
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,213
drive away immediately.

251
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,413
But what about you?

252
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:08,173
Just go. Don't worry about me.

253
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:39,053
Where are the Shiva lingam
and the Yoni stone?

254
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,173
Aunt Kate!

255
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:03,613
Aunt Kate!

256
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:05,013
Siwat...

257
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,773
Come closer and you'll die.

258
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:12,653
Aunt Kate...

259
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:13,533
Aunt Kate!

260
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:20,653
Have you seen my mom?

261
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,133
No, bro.

262
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:26,491
Mind, have you seen my mom?

263
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:28,693
No.

264
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:30,453
Where could she be?

265
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:31,933
Her phone's off.

266
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:32,773
Lookwaii,

267
00:26:32,973 --> 00:26:33,893
have you seen Siwat?

268
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:36,013
He's not home and won't pick up my calls.

269
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,093
- No.
- Wait.

270
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:42,453
Are you not gonna tell us
about the powers Siwat possesses?

271
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:54,253
Khun,

272
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,133
someone just sent a picture to our page.

273
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:00,173
Hey...

274
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,453
That's Aisoon,

275
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:05,653
one of Michael's people.

276
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:07,693
With my mom and Siwat.

277
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:11,142
What's going on?

278
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:19,813
How much longer
will you keep hunting me down?

279
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:22,133
Until the day you die.

280
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:30,013
Maria?

281
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:32,835
Get rid of him.

282
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:57,075
Get her.

283
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:58,856
No...

284
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:00,453
No!

285
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:01,693
Leave me alone!

286
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:05,653
Let go of me!

287
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:08,053
Kill him.

288
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,653
But we haven't obtained the stones yet.

289
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:13,173
We have her.

290
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:14,693
We'll keep her as our bargaining chip.

291
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,020
Siwat has his powers.

292
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:18,813
Do you wanna be burned alive?

293
00:28:24,393 --> 00:28:26,333
I'll take you to someone...

294
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:29,413
who can tell you the truth
about Singkhon's death.

295
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:33,773
But for your safety,
don't wear your Yoni stone necklace.

296
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:55,893
Dean?!

297
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:57,813
No, Dad...

298
00:28:57,973 --> 00:28:58,813
Kill him!

299
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:02,973
Dean...

300
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,253
Do it!

301
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:05,693
I told you to kill him!

302
00:29:09,843 --> 00:29:11,289
Give it to me.

303
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,453
Do it!

304
00:29:13,573 --> 00:29:14,493
Shoot me!

305
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:15,533
Sure!

306
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:17,086
I'm fine with that!

307
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:19,573
You asked for it,
so I'll make sure you get it.

308
00:29:19,613 --> 00:29:20,333
Dean...

309
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:27,853
Hey!

310
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:43,653
How did you get here?

311
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:45,013
Thanks, Dean.

312
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:53,159
Aisoon,

313
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:56,253
what happened to my dad 19 years ago?

314
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:58,013
What are you talking about?

315
00:29:58,873 --> 00:29:59,873
I have no idea.

316
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:01,413
You drugged me

317
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:04,453
to steal the necklace for Michael,
didn't you?

318
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,093
I didn't drug anyone.

319
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,573
The one who did it...

320
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:13,093
was her.

321
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:19,053
Liar!

322
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:21,773
My mom would never drug Khun.

323
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:23,213
You're lying!

324
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:25,693
Your mom drugged Khunkhao

325
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:28,133
so I could get the Shiva lingam.

326
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:31,173
And Singkhon had to die...

327
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:32,853
because...

328
00:30:33,593 --> 00:30:35,253
he was betrayed by his own sister.

329
00:30:36,013 --> 00:30:36,853
That's not true.

330
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,653
Mom, tell us he's lying!

331
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,173
You didn't betray Uncle Singkhon,
did you?

332
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:53,892
I'm sorry.

333
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:10,093
Dad!

334
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:11,413
They're running away!

335
00:31:55,073 --> 00:31:57,133
If you'd been honest with my dad,

336
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,570
he wouldn't have had to die.

337
00:31:58,773 --> 00:32:00,213
I'm really sorry, Khunkhao.

338
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:04,333
Khun...

339
00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:09,271
♫No matter how long it takes♫

340
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:11,911
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

341
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:19,471
I know you had your reasons.

342
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:21,871
Tell me the truth.

343
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:24,071
Tell everyone

344
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,191
what really happened.

345
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,591
Searching for Tambralinga...

346
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,212
has always been Singkhon's dream.

347
00:32:39,311 --> 00:32:41,252
A check for five million baht will be yours...

348
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:42,031
[Singkhon Sriwichit]

349
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,911
if you agree to work with me.

350
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:48,271
We needed the money

351
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:50,751
for Thara's heart surgery,

352
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,914
so he said yes.

353
00:32:53,951 --> 00:32:54,845
Fine.

354
00:32:55,136 --> 00:32:56,071
I'll do it.

355
00:32:57,631 --> 00:32:59,151
But I have one condition.

356
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,991
Once we discover the ruins of Tambralinga,

357
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:04,391
we must absolutely keep the location secret

358
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:07,111
until I decide the time's right.

359
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:09,911
I won't allow Khao Luang forest
to be destroyed,

360
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,831
not by those treasure hunters.

361
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:14,651
Deal.

362
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:18,551
Finding Tambralinga
has always been my dream, too.

363
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:22,191
I don't want the forest
to be destroyed, either.

364
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,311
After years of searching Khao Luang forest,

365
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:48,391
Aisoon discovered something.

366
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:51,671
He realized that the Yoni stone
Michael obtained when he adopted Siwat,

367
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:53,951
and Khunkhao's Shiva lingam,

368
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:56,111
were connected to Tambralinga.

369
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:58,791
We set out immediately.

370
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:35,071
I'm okay.

371
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:36,711
Don't worry.

372
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:07,871
Please take some medicine.

373
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:29,191
Thanks.

374
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:43,471
How's he doing?

375
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:47,971
Not good.

376
00:35:50,151 --> 00:35:51,391
We can only ease the pain.

377
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:56,031
But not long after entering the forest,

378
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:58,231
Michael contracted cerebral malaria

379
00:35:58,271 --> 00:35:59,831
and had to return to the UK for treatment.

380
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:01,191
He never came back.

381
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:05,991
But Aisoon did,
a day before Thara's surgery.

382
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:14,111
Thara!

383
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:14,991
Mom!

384
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:15,871
Mom!

385
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:17,930
Are you sure?

386
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:22,951
If you fight me,

387
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:24,591
your son dies.

388
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:26,431
Let me go!

389
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:28,711
Mom!

390
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:34,151
Mom...

391
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:37,231
Don't you ever hurt Thara!

392
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:43,991
Here, Khun.

393
00:36:44,591 --> 00:36:45,711
Have some hot cocoa.

394
00:36:46,311 --> 00:36:47,591
Thank you, Aunt Kate.

395
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:55,471
He forced me to drug Khunkhao

396
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:57,871
so he could steal the Shiva lingam.

397
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:08,591
Khun...

398
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,311
How do you feel, Khun?

399
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,511
You're just very sleepy, aren't you?

400
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,371
Yes.

401
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:25,095
Khun,

402
00:37:25,631 --> 00:37:27,031
just take a nap right here.

403
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,951
I'll check if Singkhon's ready.

404
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:00,871
No!

405
00:38:01,311 --> 00:38:02,071
No...

406
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:04,111
No!

407
00:38:04,811 --> 00:38:05,671
No...

408
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:09,351
No!

409
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,191
Give me back my necklace.

410
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:18,751
Once Aisoon had the necklace,

411
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,671
he wouldn't let Thara go.

412
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:22,671
In the end,

413
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:24,711
I had to tell Singkhon the truth.

414
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:28,191
We hunted him down in Khao Luang forest

415
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,911
to save Thara.

416
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:33,031
Where's Thara?!

417
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:34,911
Answer me!

418
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:40,151
Watch out!

419
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:43,871
Singkhon...

420
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,821
Watch out!

421
00:38:58,351 --> 00:38:59,311
Singkhon!

422
00:39:04,591 --> 00:39:06,031
Singkhon!!

423
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,091
Singkhon!!

424
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,631
Singkhon...

425
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:19,311
Mom!

426
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:20,471
Thara?!

427
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:34,991
After Singkhon died,

428
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,392
when I found Thara...

429
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:43,871
he was nearly dead too.

430
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:47,711
But...

431
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:52,311
why didn't my father know that
Aisoon took Uncle Singkhon's life?

432
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:54,991
I was ashamed,

433
00:39:55,231 --> 00:39:57,751
so I didn't let anyone know.

434
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:01,991
I never thought Aisoon
would dare work for Michael again.

435
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,031
Before Michael passed away,

436
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:12,311
he asked me
to take him to look for the city again.

437
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,391
He wanted to help you, Siwat.

438
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:20,610
If you'd been honest with my dad,

439
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:23,631
he wouldn't have had to die.

440
00:40:25,051 --> 00:40:26,191
I was scared.

441
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,351
Too afraid to risk it.

442
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:36,711
I'm really sorry, Khunkhao.

443
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:44,118
Khun...

444
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:06,231
Professor!

445
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:09,111
Fetch me the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone!

446
00:41:12,206 --> 00:41:16,726
♫No matter how long it takes♫

447
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,366
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

448
00:41:27,086 --> 00:41:28,726
You guys suck.

449
00:41:30,606 --> 00:41:31,846
You too.

450
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:33,606
Got the nerve to crawl back, huh?

451
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:40,966
Thanks to your son,

452
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:43,126
everything's f*cked up.

453
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:44,386
No Shiva lingam.

454
00:41:44,426 --> 00:41:45,526
Nothing at all.

455
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:48,526
There's still a chance.

456
00:41:49,686 --> 00:41:51,286
After all the times you've messed up,

457
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:52,606
you've got countless chances, huh?

458
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:54,686
Come on. Without me,

459
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:57,766
you'll never get the Heart of the Vedas,

460
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:00,206
that priceless gem
that could make you crazy rich.

461
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:01,886
And?

462
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:03,166
I haven't even gotten it yet.

463
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:04,246
Who's to blame?

464
00:42:04,786 --> 00:42:05,486
Well,

465
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:06,886
then kill me.

466
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:09,766
Sure.

467
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:11,006
As you wish.

468
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:11,926
Yeah.

469
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:13,406
Go ahead and kill me,

470
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:16,846
then go back to being
an invisible MILF model

471
00:42:17,386 --> 00:42:19,243
with no Michael's money backing you up.

472
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:22,366
Kill me.

473
00:42:23,406 --> 00:42:24,846
Don't you dare try me.

474
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:29,446
Maybe...

475
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:32,040
you have to choose between killing me

476
00:42:32,646 --> 00:42:33,926
or walking forward with me.

477
00:42:37,246 --> 00:42:38,686
So, what's your plan?

478
00:42:41,766 --> 00:42:43,486
They've got both stones,

479
00:42:44,686 --> 00:42:46,886
and Siwat will surely go after the city.

480
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:48,246
We just need to ambush them.

481
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:52,806
After all those years following Michael,

482
00:42:52,846 --> 00:42:55,206
you still haven't laid eyes on the ruins.

483
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,519
But someone has,

484
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:57,606
you know?

485
00:42:57,646 --> 00:42:58,926
And he knows where it is.

486
00:43:04,726 --> 00:43:07,046
That Professor Thakoon or something?

487
00:43:10,086 --> 00:43:13,046
He's as obsessed with Tambralinga as Michael.

488
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:16,406
He even visited the city ruins in the forest
with Singkhon

489
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:18,846
and tried to document it in a book,

490
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,126
insisting to the scholars
that the city was real.

491
00:43:22,486 --> 00:43:23,806
But no one believed him.

492
00:43:24,373 --> 00:43:27,253
Then he became known as a mad scholar.

493
00:43:30,386 --> 00:43:33,846
Are you sure
he's gonna lead us to the city?

494
00:44:13,706 --> 00:44:14,566
Professor!

495
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:40,686
Brahmin Kalakal...

496
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,966
I've long awaited
the moment I could stand before you.

497
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:48,366
What is it that you desire from me?

498
00:44:50,046 --> 00:44:53,006
I wish to serve you loyally, Brahmin Kalakal,

499
00:44:54,046 --> 00:44:56,406
the Earth Bender of Tambralinga.

500
00:44:57,846 --> 00:44:59,166
Whatever you ask,

501
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:01,806
I will obey.

502
00:45:03,686 --> 00:45:06,366
Bring me Suriya and the others.

503
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:10,326
You may now enter my body,

504
00:45:12,366 --> 00:45:14,006
and I shall handle it myself.

505
00:45:26,406 --> 00:45:27,286
This is crazy!

506
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:28,446
My goodness!

507
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,326
He's gone crazy!

508
00:45:31,926 --> 00:45:32,711
Khun...

509
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,286
Khun must not know about this.

510
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:39,766
Professor...

511
00:45:44,246 --> 00:45:45,246
Professor!

512
00:45:46,526 --> 00:45:47,406
Professor...

513
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:50,046
Fetch me the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone!

514
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:52,286
Professor...

515
00:46:10,526 --> 00:46:11,686
Who the hell are you?

516
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:15,022
If you want the Shiva lingam
and the Yoni stone,

517
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:16,686
I can get them for you.

518
00:46:19,086 --> 00:46:20,526
We truly can.

519
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,766
You're their enemies, aren't you?

520
00:46:23,686 --> 00:46:24,966
But in exchange,

521
00:46:25,806 --> 00:46:28,246
you must take us to Tambralinga with you.

522
00:46:30,806 --> 00:46:32,356
Show me...

523
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:37,046
how you're gonna obtain both of the stones.

524
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:44,646
I've got a plan.

525
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:01,206
If they know we're the Benders,

526
00:47:01,246 --> 00:47:02,726
then what's their plan?

527
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,046
We can't avoid it.

528
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:05,726
Then we must face it.

529
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:06,447
Hey!

530
00:47:07,246 --> 00:47:07,966
Wait...

531
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:15,046
Everything must return to the beginning.

532
00:47:15,406 --> 00:47:16,486
The beginning?

533
00:47:16,686 --> 00:47:19,006
It's pathetic
seeing you all protecting each other.

534
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:21,606
No matter how hard you try to lie to us,

535
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:22,966
I won't buy it.

536
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,006
Guess you'll have to see for yourselves.

537
00:47:25,246 --> 00:47:29,486
(Incanting)

538
00:47:29,526 --> 00:47:33,966
♫No matter how long it takes♫

539
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:37,446
