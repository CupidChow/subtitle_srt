00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,760
♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

2
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,740
♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

3
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,200
♫But there's one thing still remains♫

4
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,320
♫That's my only one true love♫

5
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
♫Through hundred thousand years♫

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,440
♫It's still only you, not anyone else♫

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,800
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

8
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,640
♫I'll be there to be by your side, your side only♫

9
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,400
♫Please hear my plead♫

10
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,960
♫No matter how long it takes♫

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,440
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

12
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,882
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

13
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,920
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,440
♫Never want to change, alright♫

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,320
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

16
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,400
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

17
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,440
I want to know what exactly happened.

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,440
There's someone who knows that very well.

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,720
Come closer and you'll die.

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,560
Aunt Kate...

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,440
Kill him.

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,680
If you'd been honest with my dad,

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
he wouldn't have had to die.

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,760
I'm really sorry, Khunkhao.

25
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Professor!

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,600
Fetch me the Shiva lingam
and the Yoni stone!

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
Mom...

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,120
I used to be really mad at you

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,320
for loving and caring about Khun

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,720
more than me.

31
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,680
I never knew

32
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,480
you were trying to make up

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,120
for taking Uncle Singkhon away from him.

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm sorry, Mom.

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm sorry

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
I made you live with that guilt

37
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,520
and let it haunt you.

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,520
If I had known the truth,

39
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,680
I wouldn't have tried to compete with him

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,960
or done the terrible things I did.

41
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,000
I wanted to tell you and Khun
the truth all along,

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,840
but I was afraid

43
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,680
that if I did, he would cut me off

44
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,840
and never let me take care of him again.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,160
He's already lost his dad.

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,280
Without me,

47
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,099
what would his life be like?

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,820
I've always been terrified of this day.

49
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Right now,

50
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,840
I don't even know how to face him.

51
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Khunkhao.

52
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,160
I misunderstood Michael,

53
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,000
thinking he murdered his friend.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,920
Aunt Kate should've been honest with me.

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,840
We're family after all.

56
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,560
If she had told you earlier,

57
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,360
would you still be this angry?

58
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,480
I would've cut ties with her right away.

59
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,080
That's why she didn't tell you.

60
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
She must've had no choice.

61
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,092
Besides,

62
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,410
she's been trying
to make it up to you all this time.

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,787
I don't even know

64
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,720
if I can ever
look at her the same way again.

65
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
I honestly don't.

66
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,240
I've misunderstood
your father all this time.

68
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,136
What I said about him

69
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,360
must've hurt you.

70
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,080
I'm glad to have you.

71
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Khun,

72
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,728
something serious happened.

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,960
What is it?

74
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,880
I think...

75
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,440
I really have to go.

76
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,360
Thara!

77
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,680
Where are you taking your mom?

78
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,772
Hey, take it easy, Khun.

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,520
We're still one family, sweetie.

80
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,680
Where are you taking her?

81
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,040
I don't know,

82
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
but it's better than staying here
and making you feel uncomfortable.

83
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,917
Don't try to think for me.

84
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,840
If I'm not okay, I'll tell you myself.

85
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,240
- Easy, kids.
- Can you forgive my mom, then?

86
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,640
I lost my dad

87
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,572
and I lost my trust because of you.

88
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,040
I don't even think

89
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,600
I'd ever be able to forgive you.

90
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,680
But if you took her away,

91
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,960
who would I have?

92
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,800
I've already lost my dad.

93
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,520
I don't want to lose
anyone else in my family again.

94
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,200
I'm sorry, Aunt Kate.

95
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,320
Please stay here with me.

96
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
I'm begging you.

97
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,360
We're still a family,

98
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,840
thanks to your forgiveness, Khun.

99
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm sure Singkhon would be proud of you.

100
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
Pudding,

101
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,320
that was such a great speech!

102
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm so proud of you.

103
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Babe, you're amazing.

104
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,720
Are you so touched that you're crying?

105
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,560
The f*ck you mean? I'm not.

106
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,280
It's just dust.

107
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,080
Someone as cool as me
isn't that sensitive.

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,123
It used to hurt me

109
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,840
knowing that everyone loved him more

110
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,360
and that I was always second to him.

111
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,000
But now,

112
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,360
I finally see why he won.

113
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
He didn't win you over.

114
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,040
He won over himself.

115
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,600
He overcame all his anger

116
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,240
with the love he has for his family.

117
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,600
Too cool, isn't he?

118
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,880
Just hearing that makes me realize
how completely I've lost.

119
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,720
You and him are even.

120
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,720
You embraced all of Aunt Kate's mistakes

121
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,040
and were willing to let go
of everything you hold dear.

122
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,720
You'd go that far for Khunkhao.

123
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
If I'm even with him for that,

124
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,560
what about the other matter?

125
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,504
Am I also even with him?

126
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,440
What do you mean by that?

127
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,230
It's Earth.

128
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,480
Pick it up.

129
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Hello?

130
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,600
Professor Thakoon
has information about the rebellion

131
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,487
in Tambralinga

132
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,932
by the Four Benders,

133
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,840
if you're curious.

134
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,200
Well, then I'll come to you with Thara.

135
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
So...

136
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,840
if they know we're the Benders,

137
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,240
then what's their plan?

138
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,400
We'll need that information
to deal with Kalakal anyway.

139
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,280
We can't avoid him.

140
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,840
Then we must face him.

141
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
What did they say?

142
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,960
Thara and Siwat will come here tonight.

143
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
You may leave now.

144
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,880
You're not going to team up with them
to kill Siwat, are you?

145
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Leave.

146
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,840
Thara said you guys
have something to tell me.

147
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,360
Please take this.

148
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,240
Hold on,

149
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,840
aren't you just going to see Thakoon?

150
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,400
Do you have to go this far?

151
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,680
Should I be worried?

152
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,160
I think he wants these two stones,

153
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
believing they're the key to the city.

154
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,840
I want to keep them safe

155
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,160
with someone I trust.

156
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,040
But he called us in,
knowing that the three of us possess powers.

157
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,680
I think he must have a plan to deal with us,

158
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,480
and I'm afraid we won't keep up.

159
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,200
Just to be safe, Mom.

160
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,400
See you all worried like this...

161
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,760
makes me uneasy.

162
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,880
We'll be back as soon as possible.

163
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:53,240
We're off.

164
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,240
Be careful, okay?

165
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,160
If you're not out in 30 minutes,

166
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
I'm going in.

167
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,280
Thara,

168
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,800
take care of him for me.

169
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, I already know that.

170
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,800
Hey, Earth!

171
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,640
Earth?

172
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm sorry.

173
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,720
(Casting a spell)

174
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,240
Khun!

175
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
You're also here?!

176
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,480
Yeah, I want to know the info as well.

177
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,440
The three of them are still talking.

178
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,880
You should wait out here.

179
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,920
What did Thakoon do to them?

180
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,160
He...

181
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,640
Nothing.

182
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,040
(Casting a spell)

183
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,760
(Casting a spell)

184
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,920
It's pathetic
seeing you all protecting each other.

185
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,520
No matter how hard you try to lie to us,

186
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,640
I won't buy it.

187
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,560
Guess you'll have to see for yourselves.

188
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,398
(Casting a spell)

189
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:29,228
This is a needle holder.

190
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:32,428
Hold it with your thumb, index finger,
middle finger, and ring finger.

191
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:35,548
Grasp the needle
at three-quarters of its length,

192
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:37,108
then insert it at 90 degrees.

193
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:38,988
Now, you try it.

194
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:46,028
I can try it now, but I won't have the guts
when I actually have to do it.

195
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:47,828
You have to practice anyway,

196
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:50,508
so you'll be able to do it
when the time comes.

197
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:53,508
Give it a try.

198
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:56,708
So, if I can do it,

199
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,428
will I get something in return?

200
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:00,748
What do you want, then?

201
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:07,868
Really?

202
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:11,468
You need to do it first.

203
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:17,668
What a lovey-dovey couple you are.

204
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:19,188
Shut up, Pun.

205
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:20,108
This is about girls.

206
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:22,788
It's about girls. You're not one of them.

207
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:28,828
Wait...

208
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:30,628
What?

209
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:33,308
Babe!

210
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:35,468
What's going on?

211
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:36,828
It's a gunshot.

212
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:39,948
Call the police and Khunkhao now!

213
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,988
And you two, stay inside.

214
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:42,828
Do you need backup?

215
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,388
- No, just rush into the house.
- Got it.

216
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,548
Aunt Kate!

217
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:14,508
- Stop!
- Aunt Kate...

218
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:16,468
Still got that touch, huh?

219
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:18,628
Aisoon.

220
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:25,908
- Aunt Kate!
- Aunt Kate!

221
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:28,428
You could've killed her by now.

222
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:29,788
What a waste of time.

223
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:31,708
Mind!

224
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,289
- Come here!
- Leave me alone!

225
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,428
Let go of me!

226
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:35,228
Let go!

227
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,228
Hand over the Shiva lingam
and the Yoni stone,

228
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:41,148
or she dies.

229
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:28,148
Aunt Kate...

230
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:30,988
They were trying to draw Khunkhao out.

231
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:34,148
Pun, are you okay now?

232
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:36,900
I am.

233
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,708
Take Aunt Kate to the hospital.

234
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:40,508
Kor and I will go rescue Mind.

235
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:42,326
Got it.

236
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:43,588
Come on.

237
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:44,788
Take it easy.

238
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:50,601
Aunt Kate...

239
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,508
Just tell us what you want.

240
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:01,508
It's pathetic
seeing you all protecting each other.

241
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:05,108
Especially you, Apo.

242
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:09,348
The friend you cherished most,
Asuni, betrayed you.

243
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:16,628
No matter how hard you try to lie to us,

244
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,028
I won't buy it.

245
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:21,668
Guess you'll have to see for yourselves.

246
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:35,548
(Casting a spell)

247
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:41,268
(Casting a spell)

248
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:46,983
(Casting a spell)

249
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:27,028
Tomorrow's ceremony

250
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:29,588
concerns the bond between our two clans.

251
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,188
It is our duty, yours and mine.

252
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,988
And yet this ring...

253
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:43,068
I bestow upon you
with a heart that is pure and sincere.

254
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:50,508
Apo...

255
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:52,748
I...

256
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:06,228
Together, we shall stand

257
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,388
and keep Tambralinga at peace for eternity.

258
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:26,508
Apo.

259
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:33,228
How fared your inspection of the provinces?

260
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:34,948
All went well.

261
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:38,068
Tomorrow marks an important day
for me and Suriya.

262
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:49,708
Why has it been brought forward?

263
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,788
You said it would be months hence.

264
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:54,588
Our clans decreed it,

265
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:57,108
so it would align
with the Maha Shivaratri festival.

266
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:01,090
I sent word to you,

267
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,508
but it appears
you were already returning.

268
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:09,148
Fortunately, you have returned in time.

269
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:15,348
There you are.

270
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:19,308
Brahmin Kalakal has revolted

271
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:21,228
and sent his forces to seize you.

272
00:26:14,348 --> 00:26:17,200
Should Kalakal continue
wielding the Heart of the Vedas incantation,

273
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:20,228
the entire land shall fall under his power.

274
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:23,308
He's trying to cast the Vedic mantra

275
00:26:23,588 --> 00:26:26,908
to strike down every life in Tambralinga
that opposes him,

276
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:30,068
coercing us into summoning
the Heart of the Vedas,

277
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:31,708
a power he cannot invoke on his own.

278
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:33,988
We shall let him have his way

279
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:37,428
before we bind him

280
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:39,291
and summon the Heart of the Vedas.

281
00:26:39,868 --> 00:26:42,828
The Heart of the Vedas
is the very pillar of Tambralinga.

282
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,908
Should we act thus...

283
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:48,788
Tambralinga will be buried
and lost along with him.

284
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:52,748
I shall not allow one so wicked

285
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:56,148
to wield Tambralinga's forces
to massacre the people of our land.

286
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:08,605
Surrender yourselves to me,

287
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:10,500
and you shall be spared.

288
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:04,348
Kalakal!

289
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:06,668
You betrayed the city

290
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:09,548
and broke the oath you made
to protect Tambralinga.

291
00:28:20,828 --> 00:28:22,108
Do you know what this is?

292
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:26,468
Datula,

293
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,828
a deadly flower.

294
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:43,708
Earth...

295
00:28:44,588 --> 00:28:45,468
Yes, Professor?

296
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:48,548
Keep an eye on them.

297
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:50,788
Understood.

298
00:28:56,548 --> 00:28:57,362
Siwat,

299
00:28:57,828 --> 00:28:58,668
hang in there.

300
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:22,508
Earth,

301
00:29:23,168 --> 00:29:24,748
how could you do this to your friends?

302
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:28,788
I'm sorry.

303
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:37,308
Dean?

304
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:39,868
Thanks, Dean.

305
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:40,744
No worries.

306
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:43,745
Thara,

307
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:45,788
you should go check on Mrs. Kate
at the hospital.

308
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:52,268
Mom?

309
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:07,028
Datula...

310
00:30:07,428 --> 00:30:10,428
It's a deadly flower that feeds on blood
and gnaws at the human heart.

311
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:11,428
If it's not removed,

312
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:12,988
it'll consume Siwat from within
and kill him.

313
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:19,736
♫No matter how long it takes♫

314
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,496
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

315
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:34,376
What's wrong?

316
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:37,103
I...

317
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,229
My whole body aches.

318
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,256
Where exactly?

319
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:46,376
Right now, it's mostly my back.

320
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:48,536
Let me see.

321
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,696
Sh*t...

322
00:30:58,376 --> 00:30:59,576
Do something!

323
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,216
If I knew what to do,
I'd have done it by now.

324
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:06,776
What the hell is this?

325
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,336
Datula.

326
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:13,196
Datula...

327
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:16,571
It's a deadly flower that feeds on blood
and gnaws at the human heart.

328
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:19,576
If it's not removed,

329
00:31:20,136 --> 00:31:21,616
it'll consume Siwat from within
and kill him.

330
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:26,256
You knew how much harm he'd cause,

331
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:28,194
so why the hell did you still help him?

332
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:29,456
- Huh?!
- Hey!

333
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,136
I'm sorry!

334
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:32,736
If I'd refused,

335
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:34,656
he would've killed me.

336
00:31:42,716 --> 00:31:44,176
So do you know how to remove it?

337
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:48,456
You need to take Siwat to the ruins

338
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,717
where Uncle Singkhon
once led Professor Thakoon,

339
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,096
to find the artifact

340
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:55,936
that can remove
the datula from Siwat's body.

341
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:57,896
What is it?

342
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:01,776
The Heart of the Vedas.

343
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:21,776
Get me the wheelchair.

344
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:22,536
Sure.

345
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:26,416
Aunt Kate?

346
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:28,776
Dean,

347
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:29,696
look after Siwat for me.

348
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:00,976
How are you feeling, Aunt Kate?

349
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:03,496
She's much better now,

350
00:33:03,696 --> 00:33:05,136
so the doctor let her recover at home.

351
00:33:06,936 --> 00:33:08,456
The bullet only grazed her muscle.

352
00:33:08,976 --> 00:33:10,656
It didn't reach any internal organs.

353
00:33:13,996 --> 00:33:15,216
I'm sorry

354
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:16,936
I wasn't there with you.

355
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:18,816
I'm fine. Don't worry.

356
00:33:19,696 --> 00:33:21,216
But Aisoon has taken Mind.

357
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:23,096
We need to get her out immediately.

358
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:26,034
You should stay here with your mom.

359
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:27,336
I'll go get Mind back.

360
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:29,556
I don't think you can do this alone.

361
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:31,656
I'm safe now.

362
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:34,856
You two should focus on your duty,

363
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:37,696
protecting our family
and Khao Luang forest.

364
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:38,896
Got it.

365
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:39,776
Okay.

366
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:42,356
Take care of each other, okay?

367
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:44,536
We will.

368
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:09,136
You pathetic cowards!

369
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,456
Having me won't save your life.

370
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:13,616
Once Khun gets here,

371
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:14,656
you're all dead.

372
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:18,159
What's all the fuss about?

373
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:22,936
Yeah, that's much better.

374
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:27,216
- Hey.
- What?

375
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:28,666
Why bother capturing her?

376
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,736
Obviously,

377
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:32,896
we need a hostage to cover our backs.

378
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:36,096
Those guys will catch up to us soon, anyway.

379
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:38,736
You'd better keep her under control.

380
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:43,796
If she starts kicking up a fuss,

381
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:45,536
I'll just end her.

382
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,056
Easy.

383
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:51,816
Ohm,

384
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:53,256
a cup of coffee.

385
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,256
Right away.

386
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:44,296
Just how extraordinary
is the Heart of the Vedas?

387
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:50,776
Any wish in the three realms,
if one asks for it,

388
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:53,596
the Heart of the Vedas will grant it.

389
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,816
An artifact of absolute power,

390
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:02,359
capable of commanding anything.

391
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,576
Then can it control that madman?

392
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:31,177
Why are you so desperate
to go after such a dangerous place?

393
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:32,456
I need to see it with my own eyes.

394
00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:34,096
You might die before you do.

395
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:36,896
Everything must return to the beginning.

396
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:37,905
The beginning?

397
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:42,164
♫No matter how long it takes♫

398
00:37:42,204 --> 00:37:44,924
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

399
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:09,284
You have three days to reach the ruins.

400
00:38:10,764 --> 00:38:12,564
It's the only chance to save Siwat.

401
00:38:12,844 --> 00:38:14,004
We need to make it in time.

402
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:16,844
Pun,

403
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:18,884
this time,

404
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:21,324
even we don't know
if we'll make it back alive.

405
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:22,244
What?

406
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:24,644
We don't want you
to risk your life for nothing.

407
00:38:25,544 --> 00:38:26,804
Hear me out.

408
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:29,644
If I get to be there with you guys,
it's worth it.

409
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,584
I'm just an orphan

410
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:34,571
who's made it this far
because of you guys and Aunt Kate.

411
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:38,004
Let me do something for you,
just for once.

412
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:41,044
We helped you because you're our friend.

413
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:43,244
We never expected anything in return.

414
00:38:44,604 --> 00:38:45,844
But I do.

415
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,324
I do hope you won't stop me.

416
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,044
I'm doing this to support my friends.

417
00:38:53,484 --> 00:38:54,284
Alright.

418
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:21,364
I'm mad at you for helping Thakoon.

419
00:39:22,044 --> 00:39:24,244
You brought those people in
to ruin the forest

420
00:39:24,524 --> 00:39:26,604
and put my family in danger.

421
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:30,404
But I understand you.

422
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:33,084
He threatened and forced you.

423
00:39:33,684 --> 00:39:35,244
Now that you're free, stay away from him.

424
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:38,724
You can go now.

425
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,938
I've spent years researching
Tambralinga with Professor Thakoon.

426
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,684
I can really be useful to you.

427
00:39:43,844 --> 00:39:47,124
Why are you so desperate
to go after such a dangerous place?

428
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:48,724
I need to see it with my own eyes.

429
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:51,404
You might die before you do.

430
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:52,724
I'm not scared.

431
00:39:54,084 --> 00:39:55,084
Let me come with you.

432
00:39:56,124 --> 00:39:57,124
Please.

433
00:39:59,704 --> 00:40:00,704
If you can't keep up,

434
00:40:01,204 --> 00:40:02,204
we won't wait.

435
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:13,204
It's still not too late

436
00:40:13,364 --> 00:40:14,644
to change your mind.

437
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:07,764
Let's go.

438
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:09,844
And be careful.

439
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:39,684
How can you be so sure they're after us?

440
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:43,044
What?

441
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:47,364
This tracker...

442
00:41:47,574 --> 00:41:48,964
It was your son, wasn't it?

443
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:50,004
What?

444
00:41:50,284 --> 00:41:51,484
Open your f*cking eyes.

445
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:56,324
Son of a b*tch.

446
00:41:58,004 --> 00:41:59,204
It's a good thing, though.

447
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:01,204
I want them to find us.

448
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:17,644
They're about 200 meters away.

449
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:22,964
You guys should wait here.

450
00:43:23,324 --> 00:43:24,724
Thara and I will go rescue Mind.

451
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:35,844
Keep an eye on him.

452
00:43:36,524 --> 00:43:37,244
Got it.

453
00:44:01,284 --> 00:44:01,884
Hey,

454
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:03,204
what are you trying to do?

455
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:12,884
I'm sorry...

456
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:17,004
for dragging you into all this mess.

457
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:20,379
It's not your fault.

458
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:24,164
It must be the fate we're meant to face.

459
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:33,173
Wait.

460
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:37,124
You two go around and get Mind over there.

461
00:44:38,684 --> 00:44:40,284
Thara and I will handle things here.

462
00:44:55,204 --> 00:44:56,204
Take Mind now.

463
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:57,284
Shoot them!

464
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:00,404
Shoot them now!

465
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:02,604
Do it.

466
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:03,484
You b*stard!

467
00:45:04,764 --> 00:45:05,623
Give it to me!

468
00:45:05,778 --> 00:45:06,513
Come on.

469
00:45:09,784 --> 00:45:10,924
Wait, where's Thakoon?

470
00:45:11,324 --> 00:45:12,324
He's gone!

471
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:13,804
Go find him.

472
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:15,524
He has the necklaces.

473
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:18,204
Go.

474
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:16,964
They already have
the Yoni stone and the Shiva lingam.

475
00:46:17,584 --> 00:46:19,724
Why would they want me to go to the ruins?

476
00:46:35,204 --> 00:46:36,844
Professor Thakoon once told me that

477
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:41,204
everything must return to the beginning.

478
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:45,204
The beginning?

479
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:09,764
Now I can see the whole past.

480
00:47:09,964 --> 00:47:11,865
We must find the city gate immediately,

481
00:47:12,044 --> 00:47:14,244
before he unites the atman with its mortal form.

482
00:47:24,284 --> 00:47:24,884
No, Maria!

483
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:25,524
Stop!

484
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:27,364
Dad!

485
00:47:27,404 --> 00:47:27,947
No!

486
00:47:28,684 --> 00:47:29,284
Dad!

487
00:47:29,524 --> 00:47:31,324
We're entering the fog forest,

488
00:47:31,524 --> 00:47:32,629
the final territory.

489
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:34,204
But the fog is toxic.

490
00:47:36,324 --> 00:47:37,164
Siwat!

491
00:47:37,284 --> 00:47:41,724
♫No matter how long it takes♫

492
00:47:41,764 --> 00:47:45,204
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

493
00:47:45,244 --> 00:47:52,444
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

494
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:56,684
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

495
00:47:56,724 --> 00:48:00,284
♫Never want to change, alright♫

496
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:05,164
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

497
00:48:05,204 --> 00:48:09,844
♫My love for you never evanesces♫
