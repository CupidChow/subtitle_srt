♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,940
♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

4
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,400
♫But there's one thing still remains♫

5
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,520
♫That's my only one true love♫

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,360
♫Through hundred thousand years♫

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,640
♫It's still only you, not anyone else♫

♫My love for you never evanesces♫

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,884
Ever since the day I met you,

19
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:58,320
I've felt like we're connected
in some kind of way.

20
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:01,015
It's almost like I've met you before.

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,160
The three of us were the Benders
from the legend of Tambralinga.

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,080
We are bound by the past.

23
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,840
We will bathe the Shiva lingam quartz
and the Yoni stone in moonlight

24
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,360
to worship Siva,

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,360
for the Lord will graciously
open up the way to the city.

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,360
Om...

27
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,880
Hey!

28
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,040
What's that?

29
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Let's go check it out.

30
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hey, don't go near it!

31
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,051
Why can't we?

32
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,661
We have no idea what it is.

33
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,640
- Hey!
- Hold on.

34
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,312
Hey!

35
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:24,520
No way!

36
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,252
Hey!

37
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,913
How's this possible?!

38
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,900
Run!

39
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,000
Bring the stones back.

40
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
Get the necklaces.

41
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,740
Come back here!

42
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,400
I said come back here!

43
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,120
Hurry. Get in the car.

44
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,400
Professor!

45
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,560
Professor.

46
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,400
Come back!

47
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,353
The atman of Kalakal within me
has yet to awaken.

48
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Come back!!

49
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,480
I said come back!!

50
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,479
Did you hear the roar
when the lightning struck?

51
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,960
Yeah, I did.

52
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,760
What could Professor Thakoon be after,

53
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,040
performing the ritual with these two stones?

54
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,760
We already had both stones in our hands...

55
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,240
Damn it!

56
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,097
Professor...

57
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
At least now I know
that the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone

58
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,040
could lead us back to Tambralinga.

59
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,600
If they hadn't taken the stones back,

60
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,800
I would've awakened the atman of Kalakal!

61
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,520
Through Kalakal's ancient memo...

62
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and the ruins I once stood upon,

63
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,280
I've come to believe that

64
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,440
every clue I uncover

65
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,800
will bring to light the past glory of Kalakal,

66
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,600
the Earth Bender of Tambralinga.

67
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Could it be that...

68
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,920
he's also one of the Benders?

69
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,120
But when the lightning struck,

70
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,160
he didn't show any signs like we did.

71
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,640
That roar...

72
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,280
made me feel like...

73
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,320
the ritual

74
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,720
just woke something up.

75
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,320
The worst part is...

76
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,560
he's witnessed the powers we possess.

77
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
So that means...

78
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,640
the fall of Tambralinga

79
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,920
was caused by the loss of its equilibrium.

80
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,560
What really happened
thousands of years ago?

81
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,120
Suriya, Asuni, and Apo rose up against Kalakal.

82
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,600
The memo from the Tang dynasty archives

83
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,994
mentions a place called Danmaling,

84
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,520
or Tambralinga,

85
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,400
after the city's mysterious disappearance.

86
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,640
It was once said that Tambralinga
was stronger than any other kingdom,

87
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,080
for it was ruled by Kalakal, the mighty warrior
who possessed the power of earth

88
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,880
and ruled as the supreme sovereign.

89
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,320
However, the other three Benders,

90
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,520
Suriya, Asuni, and Apo rebelled against him,

91
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,280
casting a Vedic mantra

92
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,400
to sever his atman

93
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,360
and hide it within a sacred land.

94
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,356
When the equilibrium
of the four elements was broken,

95
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,760
Tambralinga collapsed,

96
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,800
was swallowed by the earth

97
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,660
and buried for eternity.

98
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,840
As of today,

99
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,200
I've done everything I could
to bring the four elements together again.

100
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,760
And once you've gathered them all,

101
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,400
what will you do?

102
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
Right this way!

103
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
- God...
- Wait...

104
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,440
What happened to him?

105
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
Wait, what's that?

106
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
He wasn't like this
the last time I saw him.

107
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
What happened?

108
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,480
I have no idea.

109
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,280
The lightning was striking nonstop,

110
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,200
and when he touched that box,
he ended up like this.

111
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,760
We found a dead man.

112
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
Notify the police immediately.

113
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Wait...

114
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,320
Where did they go?

115
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,172
What? Where are they?

116
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,120
- Go find them!
- Okay.

117
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,600
Damn, it's too early for this.

118
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,480
I'm gonna throw up Tambralinga at this point.

119
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,960
I've never had to read this much
in my entire life.

120
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
Yeah, 'cause you're an idiot.

121
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,040
Oh, please.
You almost didn't graduate, just like me.

122
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,320
Still, Professor Thakoon
probably knows a lot more than we do.

123
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,360
At least now we know what he's capable of.

124
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,000
We must be careful.

125
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,567
If anything happens,
we tell each other right away.

126
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,000
So we can handle it together.

127
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,000

128
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,440

- Quick, quick, quick.
- Has our network reported in yet?

136
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,520
Three locals went into the forest to forage.

137
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,550
One was found dead in a strange way

138

What about the other two?

141
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,880
They went to get help from the rangers

142
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,600
but vanished and lost contact completely.

143
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,880
The rangers searched the area
but found no trace,

144
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,000
so they asked us to back them up.

145
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,440
Any photos or leads?

146
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,640
There's one last photo the rangers sent
before the two disappeared.

147
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,600
I'll send it to you.

148
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,520
Shit,

149
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,080
someone got struck by lightning?

150
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
That's terrifying.

151
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,560
- Quick, quick, quick.
- We're leaving.

152

Yes, Professor.

184
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:50,868
Is everything okay?

185
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:55,228
I'm not sure.

186
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:56,988
I don't think...

187
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:59,108
that lightning strike was a coincidence.

188
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,508
It must have something to do with our past.

189
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:39,508
There are no wounds other than burn marks.

190
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,308
It's just my assumption, though.

191
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:44,188
From the way his body's positioned,

192
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:45,388
I'd say he died in terror.

193
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:48,748
Could it be that
he was attacked by a wild animal?

194
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:51,988
That's impossible.

195
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:53,748
There are no signs of that.

196
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:54,788
You idiot.

197
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:55,711
You moron.

198
00:16:57,748 --> 00:17:00,668
Let's split up and search for the other two.

199
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:03,188
I think...

200
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:05,548
if they're still alive,
they can't be far from here.

201
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:07,788
I agree.

202
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:12,868
Mind, Siwat, you stay.

203
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:14,868
We'll divide into two teams.

204
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:18,388
But here's what bothers me...

205
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,828
Boat said they searched all night
and still couldn't find them.

206
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,428
Could it be that the forest...

207
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,548
- is hiding itself?
- Is hiding itself?

208
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:31,762
The forest is hiding itself?

209
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:35,188
Get ready.

210
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:36,228
I'm starting the ritual.

211
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:56,268
This part of the forest
is veiled by unseen powers.

212
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,148
That's why Khun's performing
the unveiling ritual

213
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:01,028
to lead us to the missing.

214
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:06,748
I have a feeling danger's waiting for us.

215
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:10,308
Be careful.

216
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:11,731
Okay.

217
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:14,108
You two, stay here and secure the scene.

218
00:19:14,148 --> 00:19:15,908
The rest of you, go get a stretcher.

219
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:17,748
- This way. Follow me.
- Okay.

220
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:20,108
That's him!

221
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:33,148
He's dead.

222
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:35,428
Sh*t...

223
00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:37,708
I think we're on the right track.

224
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:40,028
The other local should be around here.

225
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:41,148
He might still be alive.

226
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:42,588
I'll go find him myself.

227
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:43,268
Hey!

228
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:44,948
I'm coming with you.

229
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:47,108
Come on, Kor.

230
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:48,948
No need. Just stay here.

231
00:21:49,148 --> 00:21:50,148
Leave it to me.

232
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,508
You're so good, huh?

233
00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:57,788
What killed him?

234
00:21:58,728 --> 00:22:00,068
Hard to tell for now.

235
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:01,988
We'll need to wait for the autopsy report.

236
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:07,428
One of them is found dead.

237
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:08,468
We need backup now.

238
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:47,988
Hey!

239
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:51,188
Hey!

240
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:55,828
Hey.

241
00:22:58,028 --> 00:22:59,028
Are you okay?

242
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:00,708
Look...

243
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:01,708
Hey!

244
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,868
Help me!

245
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:16,788
Help!

246
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:33,308
Help me!

247
00:23:35,908 --> 00:23:37,308
Please help!

248
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:38,228
Over there.

249
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:39,364
- Sh*t!
- Help!

250
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:40,750
Bro!

251
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:06,048
Hang on.

252
00:24:06,408 --> 00:24:07,188
He's injured.

253
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:10,388
Mind...

254
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:11,348
Yes?

255
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:12,588
We've found the missing person.

256
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,508
We need more medical supplies.

257
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:17,448
Head south from the scene, ten minutes out.

258
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:18,613
Roger that.

259
00:24:19,448 --> 00:24:20,828
We've found the missing!

260
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:21,668
Let's go!

261
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,948
Then don't move this body yet

262
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:26,228
until all the rangers get here.

263
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:27,828
- Yes, sir.
- We'll go help the rest.

264
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:47,348
Help!

265
00:24:49,028 --> 00:24:49,748
Help me!

266
00:24:56,296 --> 00:25:00,817
♫No matter how long it takes♫

267
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:03,296
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

268
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:28,976
They told us to come here,

269
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:30,616
but where are they?

270
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:37,995
That's a person!

271
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:05,616
(Casting a spell)

272
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:13,341
(Casting a spell)

273
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,176
May Kalakal's body and atman
be bound and sealed,

274
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:27,736
never to be reborn
to bring decay upon the people

275
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:28,896
from this moment forth!

276
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:53,176
Yeah, right there.

277
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:54,605
Got it.

278
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:00,736
The other rangers have reached the body,

279
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:03,336
and your rescue team is on their way.

280
00:27:10,256 --> 00:27:11,176
What's wrong?

281
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:13,536
I'm not sure,

282
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:15,336
but I have a bad feeling

283
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:17,216
something might go wrong.

284
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:24,256
I've been waiting a thousand years
for this day,

285
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:26,536
the day you would return.

286
00:27:27,656 --> 00:27:28,576
Suriya,

287
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:30,296
set me free!

288
00:27:55,496 --> 00:27:56,216
- Ugh...
- Ugh!

289
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:57,016
Mr. Siwat!

290
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,056
Hey, let go of me!

291
00:27:58,096 --> 00:27:58,896
- Hey!
- Mr. Siwat!

292
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:08,056
Mr. Siwat...

293
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:23,336
Hey!

294
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:26,776
What's wrong with you?!

295
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:27,896
Let go of me!

296
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:29,256
Let go of me, Mr. Siwat!

297
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:32,134
Hey!

298
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:33,896
Hey, let go of her.

299
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:34,776
Please...

300
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:39,456
Mr. Siwat!

301
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:44,536
Hey...

302
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:45,736
Please...

303
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,016
Let go!

304
00:28:47,056 --> 00:28:47,696
Hey!

305
00:28:53,096 --> 00:28:53,856
Let go!

306
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:55,816
Lookwaii,

307
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:57,376
I need help!

308
00:28:58,456 --> 00:28:59,296
- Lookwaii!
- Mind?

309
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:00,896
- Help me!
- What's going on?

310
00:29:01,736 --> 00:29:02,576
Mind!

311
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:16,936
She's not answering.

312
00:29:17,996 --> 00:29:19,176
You can go check on them.

313
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,296
Leave this one to me.

314
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:23,616
Come on, guys.

315
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:25,376
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

316
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:28,176
Help!

317
00:29:29,456 --> 00:29:30,376
Help me!

318
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:32,878
Help...

319
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:39,776
- Siwat!
- Help!

320
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:46,816
It's me.

321
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,856
It's me.

322
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:52,136
- Siwat.
- Help me!

323
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:06,696
Suriya is mine.

324
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:10,696
He loves me, not you.

325
00:30:44,896 --> 00:30:45,616
Hey!

326
00:30:48,296 --> 00:30:49,096
Sh*t!

327
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:47,336
Siwat, come back!

328
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:51,696
Get a grip!

329
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:15,576
Suriya,

330
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,616
you need to choose between me and Asuni.

331
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:03,936
Khunkhao!

332
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:07,576
You're back.

333
00:33:16,016 --> 00:33:17,216
Thank you.

334
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:35,536
Everything's okay now.

335
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:41,096
Siwat was so scary.

336
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,476
Does it hurt badly?

337
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:47,696
Let me address your wound.

338
00:34:09,696 --> 00:34:10,896
You're safe now.

339
00:34:11,656 --> 00:34:15,096
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

340
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:22,538

346

♫My love for you never evanesces♫

352
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:25,576
Kalakal was also one of the Benders.

353
00:35:27,096 --> 00:35:29,256
Why would we have to bind him anyway?

354
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:34,496
How could we have turned
into his enemies?

355
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:41,016
But one thing's certain.

356
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:42,896
I've finally found the reason

357
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:45,976
why I felt a bond with you
when we first met.

358
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:50,016
I've found the answer
I've been searching for.

359
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,216
Anyway, what do we do with this thing?

360
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:57,416
We'll bury it here.

361
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:01,216
Do you see what I see, Professor?

362
00:37:02,884 --> 00:37:07,404
♫No matter how long it takes♫

363
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:09,644
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

364
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:28,404
We'll bury it here.

365
00:37:29,444 --> 00:37:31,484
But it'll be found someday anyway.

366
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:33,764
Leave it to me.

367
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:32,644
Begone!

368
00:38:46,544 --> 00:38:47,474
That...

369
00:38:49,164 --> 00:38:50,724
Do you see what I see, Professor?

370
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,044
Let's go, Kor.

371
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:28,564
- Mind, I...
- Oh...

372
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:30,404
Let's get something to eat.

373
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:40,164
Don't worry about it.

374
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:48,724
Can't blame her for being scared of me.

375
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,284
This one has cats.

376
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:11,164
This one's a dog.

377
00:40:15,964 --> 00:40:16,964
I'll take this, too.

378
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:17,844
Sure.

379
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,564
What are those, Pun?

380
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:23,564
What?

381
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:25,404
OTOP bags, you know.

382
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:26,764
A dog and cats.

383
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:28,044
They're cute, right?

384
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:30,964
Cute, huh?

385
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:32,004
A**hole.

386
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:44,844
You've got over 200 M-Stamps.

387
00:40:44,884 --> 00:40:47,204
Would you like to redeem them
to get this premium collection?

388
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:50,044
You can choose
between Hello Kitty and Butterbear.

389
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,764
Which one would you like?

390
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:53,844
The pink one, please.

391
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:54,957
Alright.

392
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:55,924
What the hell?

393
00:40:55,964 --> 00:40:57,884
You'll be taking the Hello Kitty tote.

394
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:01,724
You need 99 M-Stamps and one baht
to redeem this tote.

395
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:03,164
Show me your code, please.

396
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:04,124
Here you go.

397
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:07,204
- It's so cute!
- And one baht, please.

398
00:41:07,237 --> 00:41:08,357
Give her the freaking one baht.

399
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:12,284
- Here you go.
- Alright.

400
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:16,444
- It's all done. Here, sir.
- I'll use it now.

401
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:20,124
Aw, gosh...

402
00:41:25,124 --> 00:41:26,484
I couldn't help but scream!

403
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,044
Look at that adorable pink.

404
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:31,764
Mind,

405
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:33,204
which one would you like?

406
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:35,884
This one.

407
00:42:01,044 --> 00:42:03,324
Are you that scared of him?

408
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:05,124
He's thrown off now.

409
00:42:07,764 --> 00:42:09,164
Well, you didn't see it.

410
00:42:09,524 --> 00:42:11,244
You didn't see how terrifying he was.

411
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:16,324
The flames suddenly appeared in his hands,

412
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:19,244
and his gaze changed.

413
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:23,644
I think...

414
00:42:24,404 --> 00:42:27,044
he's got to be like Khun and Thara.

415
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:29,064
You think so?

416
00:42:30,244 --> 00:42:31,484
It was really frightening.

417
00:42:33,204 --> 00:42:34,604
I have no idea what to do now.

418
00:42:37,084 --> 00:42:38,084
It's nothing.

419
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:39,444
Don't worry about it.

420
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:41,444
Come on, let's pay.

421
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:01,924
Look,

422
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:04,764
I've got some OTOP bags.

423
00:43:06,324 --> 00:43:08,404
Don't stress over things you can't change.

424
00:43:09,224 --> 00:43:10,442
Everything's gonna be okay.

425
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:16,004
Come on, let's go home.

426
00:43:52,444 --> 00:43:53,444
Aunt Kate,

427
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:55,884
there's something you need to know.

428
00:43:56,544 --> 00:43:57,344
What is it?

429
00:43:57,724 --> 00:43:58,724
It's Siwat...

430
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,884
(Casting a spell)

431
00:44:50,924 --> 00:44:54,124
I now call upon Brahmin Kalakal
to reclaim his body.

432
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,204
Professor!

433
00:44:55,724 --> 00:44:57,684
All of our past happened in Tambralinga.

434
00:44:58,044 --> 00:44:59,604
Once we locate it,

435
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:01,465
we'll know how to deal with it.

436
00:45:01,884 --> 00:45:04,484
I won't let the past
steal away the person I love,

437
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:06,324
or you, again.

438
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:09,945
Will you forgive my father?

439
00:45:18,564 --> 00:45:23,004
♫No matter how long it takes♫

440
00:45:23,044 --> 00:45:26,484
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

441
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:33,724
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

442
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:37,964
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

443
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:41,564
♫Never want to change, alright♫

444
00:45:41,604 --> 00:45:46,444
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

445
00:45:46,484 --> 00:45:51,124
♫My love for you never evanesces♫
