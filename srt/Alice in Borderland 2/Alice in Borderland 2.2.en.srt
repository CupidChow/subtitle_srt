19
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,238
Uh...

20
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,867
What was our, uh, score today?

21
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,036
Five hundred points.

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,680
- Five hundred? That's high.
- Whoa.

23
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,581
Maki only earned three.

24
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,960
- I'm worth at least five.
- That's hilarious.

25
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,043
Brutal.

26
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,422
Hell of a show though, huh? We crushed it.

27
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,842
- The crowd was really into it.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,137
Okay, listen up.

29
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,806
- Listening.
- We need today's driver, yeah?

30
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,684
- We'll point at them on three.
- Yeah?

31
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,810
- You point.
- Point?

32
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,395
- Yeah, on three. Shit.
- Okay.

33
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,278
- Whoever did the worst today.
- Yeah.

34
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,773
- Right?
- Okay.

35
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,109
- On three.
- I know who I'm picking.

36
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,610
- You ready?
- Sure.

37
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,405
- Let's...
- Okay!

38
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,198
One, two...

39
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,463
We're the citizens of this country.

40
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,426
Citizens?

41
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,094
Sure. Citizens.

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,096
What do you mean?

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,681
We're all living here, right?

44
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,349
Who can say?

45
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,645
In this place, I'm the leader.

46
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,732
We created this game.

47
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,235
That man, Shitara? All his idea.

48
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,031
Well, to be fair,
this is a brand-new experience for us.

49
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,575
We haven't played a game of it yet
as a team.

50
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,872
What does that mean?
We're competing against citizens now?

51
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,498
Us against the five of you?

52
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,582
Yeah.

53
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,169
When you play a face card game,

54
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,172
you're competing against citizens
fighting for their lives.

55
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,549
Anyone who loses is killed.

56
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,133
So...

57
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:43,097
these are games of life or death
for us citizens as well.

58
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,977
It's time to begin.

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,731
The game we'll be playing is...

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,027
<i>Difficulty, King of Clubs.</i>

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,737
<i>Game...</i>

62
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,073
<i>Osmosis.</i>

63
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,077
Osmosis...

64
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,281
Now, the rules are simple.

65
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,535
The game lasts two hours.

66
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,787
Both teams try to collect points.

67
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,082
The team with the highest total
at the end of the game wins.

68
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,420
Each team begins with 10,000 points.

69
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,341
Players divide these points
amongst themselves before the game begins.

70
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,386
The minimum amount is 100 points.

71
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,014
You're free to divide them up
any way you want.

72
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,224
Talk it over as a team and decide.

73
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,355
Points distribution is a key element
of strategy in this game.

74
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,903
How does one earn points?

75
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,782
There are three ways
you can do so in this game.

76
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,745
Battle, items, and base.

77
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,121
Hold on!

78
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,873
Yeah, you got a question?

79
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,459
How do we remember all this?

80
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,252
Right.

81
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,297
I guess it's easier once you do it, huh?

82
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,550
A demonstration.
You've got random points for now.

83
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,721
Your bracelet shows
your individual points.

84
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,016
Let's try a battle.

85
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,185
ARISU

86
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:38,106
A battle's outcome depends entirely
on your current points.

87
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,443
To initiate one,
all you need to do is touch your opponent.

88
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,653
Hey!

89
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,493
NIRAGI 2,000
KYUMA 3,500

90
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,787
Whoever has more points wins.

91
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,790
The winner steals 500 points
from the loser.

92
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,675
<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

93
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,850
The King of Clubs team
is now leading by 1,000 points.

94
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,317
ARISU

95
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,320
So you don't know
your opponent's score until you battle.

96
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,865
No. You know what that means, right?

97
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,159
It means these battles are a huge gamble,

98
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,786
where you're unable
to see your opponent's strength.

99
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,290
Something else you can try
is to pair up with a teammate.

100
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,375
For example...

101
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,004
You two. Try holding hands.

102
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:51,012
Oh wow, what's this?
A bit nervous, are ya?

103
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,359
Would you look at that? Cute couple.

104
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,948
All right.
If teammates hold hands like this,

105
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,576
they're able to battle
using their combined points,

106
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,829
allowing them to beat an opponent
they couldn't defeat on their own.

107
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,669
The winners get the 500
divided between them.

108
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,883
Cuties.

109
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,260
On to items!

110
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,721
ITEM

111
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,893
There are items for you to find, six
of them, hidden amongst the containers.

112
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,522
Ugh, this area's huge!

113
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,775
There are only six items
in all these shipping containers?

114
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,111
Touching an item
will earn your team some points.

115
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,697
And finally, we come to these poles.

116
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,950
Bases are a big part of the game.

117
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,910
They can turn the tide.

118
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:04,210
This pole is your base.
Ours is on the other side.

119
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,336
BASE

120
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,549
If you manage to touch
your opponents' base,

121
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,260
10,000 points are yours.

122
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,264
10,000 points?
Don't both teams start with that?

123
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:20,184
Exactly why you need to keep someone back
to protect your base.

124
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:25,147
But while a player is touching
their own base, they have infinite points.

125
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,149
Infinite?

126
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,028
How do you battle someone
with infinite points?

127
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,741
Come here.

128
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,385
ARISU 2,250
KYUMA INFINITE

129
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,139
I was touching my base,
so you lose 10,000 points.

130
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,515
ARISU -7,750
KYUMA 3,500

131
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,225
And I gain 10,000.

132
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,354
ARISU -7,750
KYUMA 13,500

133
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,064
Hang on...

134
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,817
So what would happen to him?

135
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,986
His score would have dropped below zero.

136
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,821
Pyeeow.

137
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,405
Shot down.

138
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,828
If you try to touch the other team's base

139
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,833
and their goalie manages to touch you,
you lose 10,000 points.

140
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:31,464
You die, and the opposing team
gains 10,000 points?

141
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,008
That's way too risky.

142
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,761
If you pull it off,
you can change everything.

143
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,724
Something else.

144
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,478
After completing a battle
or touching the other team's base,

145
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,241
players are temporarily out of commission.

146
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,230
INACTIVE

147
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,150
During this time, their points are frozen.
They're immune.

148
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,028
If you touch an opponent
while they're out of commission...

149
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,491
...your wristband will give you
an electric shock.

150
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,661
Enough to knock you out, so be careful.

151
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,080
Once you touch your own base,

152
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,124
your status is reset
and you can resume play.

153
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:15,299
So, you know the rules. Split up
your points now, then the game begins.

154
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,389
Hold on.

155
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,062
I'm Arisu.

156
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,022
Kyuma...

157
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,778
tell me something, before we fight.

158
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,616
If we beat all the games here,

159
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,704
will we go back to our world?

160
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,460
Your world? What is your world?

161
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,631
The way that you're speaking about it,

162
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,594
you're making it sound
like your world must be the real one.

163
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,390
What are you talking about?

164
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,934
Tell me something.

165
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,521
How many real conversations did you have?

166
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,815
How many heart-to-hearts did you have?

167
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,360
Our flaws, our pride.

168
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,114
Those are exposed here, in this world.

169
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,034
When we look death in the eye,

170
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,663
we face true human nature and reality.

171
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,005
This world is more real
than any you left behind.

172
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,841
These games are conversations.

173
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,761
Let's really talk, you and I.

174
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,388
Let us expose our true hearts.

175
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,472
Arisu.

176
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,976
You want the truth, yeah?

177
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,229
Face me with everything you have.

178
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,659
All right, then.

179
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,455
I'll play your game.

180
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,968
Is it just me,
or was Kyuma being nice to us?

181
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,512
Just like a normal guy.

182
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,640
Buck naked and crazy. Yeah, real normal.

183
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,142
This game'll be a bloodbath,
just like all the others.

184
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,103
Okay.

185
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,564
Let's distribute the points.

186
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,818
How many do we each get? Got any ideas?

187
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,321
Split 'em five ways, no?

188
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,074
We're not going to win
splitting them evenly between us.

189
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,078
Usagi's right.

190
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,290
It's like Kyuma said.
It's an important decision for the game.

191
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,084
The initial point split is crucial.

192
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,336
You got a plan or what?

193
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,680
<i>Game start.</i>

194
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,700
Whooooo!

195
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,423
<i>Here's the plan.</i>

196
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,884
<i>The faster runners get fewer points.</i>

197
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,678
<i>Slower runners get more.</i>

198
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,309
<i>The guard at the base
gets the least number of points possible.</i>

199
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,731
<i>We go out in pairs,
one fast runner with one slower runner.</i>

200
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,859
Why'd you pair up with me, anyway?

201
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,944
You like me that much, huh?

202
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,822
Please. Because I won't care
if you die in front of me.

203
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,076
<i>Pairing up for battles
has many advantages,</i>

204
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,788
<i>but one of the biggest
is they can only see your combined points.</i>

205
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,458
<i>They won't know
how many points you each have.</i>

206
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,849
We've got 5,000 between us.

207
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,517
He won't have more than that.

208
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,895
They'd be crazy
to give one person half their points.

209
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,523
- Let's get him.
- Yeah, let's get it done.

210
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,783
Uh-oh...

211
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,411
Huh?

212
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,333
Guess he didn't have that many after all.

213
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,972
Nothing here either.

214
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,601
No. Come on.

215
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,529
Hey. Why'd you pair up Usagi with Niragi?

216
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,612
Strategy.

217
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,282
What's going on with you two?

218
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,034
What do you mean?

219
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,203
Arisu...

220
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,416
If something's changed
between you and Usagi,

221
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,917
shouldn't you tell us?

222
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,087
No, we're fine. It's fine, okay?

223
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,965
If you say so.

224
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,595
Oh!

225
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,014
Is that an item?

226
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,118
KUINA
ITEM

227
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,458
2,000 points!

228
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,333
Awesome!

229
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,920
- Yes!
- Yes!

230
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,132
<i>The player team
has secured an item.</i>

231
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,386
<i>The player team is now leading
by 2,000 points.</i>

232
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,056
- We're winning!
- Yeah, that's pretty cool!

233
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,268
Congratulations.

234
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,442
Look, we can't avoid each other forever.

235
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,735
You wanna battle or what?

236
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,822
ARISU

237
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,824
KUINA

238
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,548
Stay close, Arisu.

239
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,676
It's two on one. We'll take it slow.

240
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,512
Yeah.

241
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,600
I couldn't help but overhear.

242
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,602
Sounds like there's an issue.

243
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,271
You're fighting
with one of your teammates.

244
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,112
Arisu,

245
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,825
you have a certain strength about you.

246
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,120
The look of someone who has faced death.

247
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,747
A man will do whatever it takes.

248
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,291
That's why it's so strange.

249
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,628
Your confidence...
Why on earth would it be shaken now?

250
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,718
The five of us were in a band before.

251
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,721
Sometimes we would disagree,

252
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,641
and yet they'd be behind me
at the end of the day.

253
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,770
And so...
I learned something about being a leader.

254
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,607
You can't push people
into following you for no reason.

255
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,735
You have to be ready to listen.

256
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,529
Wait for them to come to you.

257
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,868
Do that,
and they'll know they can depend on you.

258
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,208
Now,

259
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,502
let's go.

260
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,636
Don't hesitate! Not today!

261
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,182
We could die. We all could.
Me, my friends, and you.

262
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,265
Arisu.

263
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,686
Let's not end our lives with regret.

264
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,854
If you're gonna die,

265
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,191
wouldn't you rather give it
everything you've got?

266
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,247
Arisu?

267
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,626
Kyuma.

268
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,212
You said that

269
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:18,258
to learn the truth, I have to face you
with everything I've got.

270
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,384
Yeah.

271
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,640
I wanna learn more about who you are.

272
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,392
So battle me alone, Kyuma.

273
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,775
Arisu?

274
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,489
You've got it.

275
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,922
ARISU 4,600
KYUMA 2,000

276
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,840
Gah!

277
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,551
<i>- The scores have been updated.</i>
- I lost!

278
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,428
2,000 points?

279
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,223
<i>The player team is now leading
by 3,000 points.</i>

280
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,808
ARISU INACTIVE

281
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,937
Wait a sec.

282
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,273
Did you give everyone equal points?

283
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,693
Yeah, everyone got 2,000.

284
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,654
I thought this was
a game of life or death.

285
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,075
Here's what I think.

286
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,703
My four teammates and I are equals.

287
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,871
We live or die together.

288
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,546
So, Arisu,
did you learn something just now?

289
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,199
Oh!

290
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,001
Ha!

291
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,753
Ah! You got me!

292
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,754
Gah!

293
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,341
- Yeah!
<i>- The scores have been updated.</i>

294
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:27,179
<i>The player team is now leading
by 4,000 points.</i>

295
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,638
Okay.

296
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,119
<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

297
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,403
- Yes!
<i>- The player team is leading...</i>

298
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,915
I'm sorry.

299
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,171
All right, you guys!

300
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,507
Things are going great so far.

301
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,635
This is a King game? Don't make me laugh.

302
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,886
- Yeah!
- Hah!

303
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,346
Yeah! Yeah!

304
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,889
Pretty crazy to think...

305
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,767
But I almost forgot
you're one of the bad guys, Niragi.

306
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,850
Huh.

307
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,661
ARISU

308
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,329
Well, what'd you learn?

309
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,838
- They split the points evenly.
- Evenly? Are you sure?

310
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,377
2,000 each, yup.

311
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,797
We need to keep the pressure on.
And find more items if we can.

312
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,382
- Right.
- Yeah.

313
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,467
Tatta, you got this, buddy.

314
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,803
Thanks.

315
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,610
They're up by 5,000. I can't believe it.

316
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,904
This is absolute bullshit!

317
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,949
So, what do we do, o leader? Huh?

318
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,035
They're certainly not bad.

319
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,704
Huh? Oh, this is funny to you?

320
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:20,167
Splitting the points up evenly
was your plan, Kyuma. You figure it out!

321
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,835
Hey, chill out, dude.

322
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,338
This isn't some dictatorship.
He didn't decide for us.

323
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,258
We did it together.

324
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,761
Just like we've always done,
and just like we're going to keep doing.

325
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,889
Absolutely!

326
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,056
So what do we do?

327
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,807
Yo, Maki!

328
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,394
Yeah, man, we all heard you.

329
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,937
So why don't you say something?

330
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,783
I do have one idea.

331
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,819
Me too. I've got an idea,

332
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,821
if you don't mind something crazy.

333
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,951
How funny would it be
if it was the same idea?

334
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,163
Well, how about if we say it on three?

335
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,289
Let's go.

336
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,292
One, two...

337
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,633
<i>The player team has secured an item.</i>

338
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:14,971
<i>The player team is now leading
by 6,000 points.</i>

339
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,932
Yes!

340
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,115
Hey.

341
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,771
Why are you all here?

342
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,065
We're here so we can win, man.

343
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,627
TATTA
INFINITE

344
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,797
You...

345
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,592
I've got...

346
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,468
I've got infinite points!

347
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,933
You get tagged here...

348
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,935
and you'll die!

349
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,151
You're right.

350
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,279
And since it's a game of life or death,

351
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,532
why don't you tell us
who dies by your hand?

352
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,203
What? But you'll be killed!

353
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
You'll die!

354
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,751
Stay back!

355
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,129
No! Don't!

356
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,928
Ah! Ah!

357
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,809
<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

358
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,234
<i>The King of Club team
is now leading by 4,000 points.</i>

359
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,569
They overtook us.

360
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,364
What the hell?

361
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,493
<i>One player
on the King of Clubs team</i>

362
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,079
<i>has had their score fall below zero.</i>

363
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,964
You picked me?

364
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,061
You better use this to win.

365
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,606
If I die in vain, I'm...

366
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:16,319
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you
in the afterlife, man.

367
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,155
<i>It is game over for the player.</i>

368
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,329
Shitara.

369
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,915
You were my good friend.

370
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,626
I'll never forget what you did for us.

371
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,508
Later, man.

372
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,748
Shitara.

373
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,160
Shitara.

374
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,600
They sacrificed a member of their team.

375
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,854
Now three of them have 10,000 points each.

376
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,982
Couldn't even guard one pole, huh?

377
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,609
Fucking useless.

378
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,153
Trash is always gonna be trash.

379
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,822
You piece of shit!

380
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,450
- Lay off of him. He did the best he could.
- The best he could?

381
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,037
You get a chance to kill one of them,
obviously you kill Kyuma!

382
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,081
It's not that. We underestimated them.

383
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:37,669
He was nice and we got sucked in,
so we forgot the most important thing.

384
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,671
Kyuma is the King of Clubs.

385
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,465
We forgot
that we're gambling with our lives.

386
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,510
They're prepared to die.

387
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,595
They've just shown us that.

388
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,057
If we don't do something,
we're all finished.

389
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,649
Only one hour left on the clock.

390
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,071
We can turn this around
if we attack their base.

391
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,365
We can't get to their base
if they're defending it.

392
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,743
- Yeah, Niragi's right.
- Then how do we win this thing?

393
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:16,165
Split up again.
Forget battling. Items are the key.

394
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,085
That's the only way
we're getting out of this alive.

395
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,296
Come on. Hurry!

396
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,072
<i>The King of Clubs team

398
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,330
Well, that ain't good.

399
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,182
Got ya.

405
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,678
You alone?

406
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,102
Let's do this, you and me.

407
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,271
You ought to know

408
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,856
I'm making you work for this.

409
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,198
All I need is one punch.

410
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,701
You win this battle,

411
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,786
you'll be out cold for the rest.

419
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,302
Snooze, you lose.

420
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,225
Yes! 3,000!

421
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,728
The most valuable item.

422
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,940
What the hell?

423
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,400
If you're both here, then...

424
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,818
Wait.

425
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,739
There's no one guarding your base?

426
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,822
Nope.

427
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,035
We figured that you wouldn't have
the guts to invade ours.

428
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,828
And we were right, weren't we?

429
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,665
I can't believe this.

430
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,255
You told me
you wanted answers, Arisu.

431
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,677
The games are cruel. You know that.

432
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,515
The value of a single life
is meaningless here.

433
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,390
Look at me.

434
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,894
I just lost my best friend.

435
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,898
His name was Shitara.

436
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,234
He was my bandmate.

437
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,612
We used to live in this dirty apartment.

438
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,658
The venues we played at were small.

439
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,702
Certainly not the stuff of legends.

440
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,122
But we had fun.

441
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,089
By choosing to join this game,

442
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,385
you get to know
who the other players truly are.

443
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,429
It bares their souls.

444
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,683
Like music does.

445
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,145
Maybe I...

446
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,941
just wanted to expose
people's true humanity.

447
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,740

We have to do something!

I'm not sitting here waiting to die.

463

Tatta still has
over 10,000 points.

- We could pair up and battle...
- Fuck that!

Whose fault is it
we're in this position now?

Ah, it doesn't matter anyway.

468
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:45,179
We can't make up 12,000 points

00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,579
We have to stop being afraid.

486
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,581
Believe in the plan.

487
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,584
What are you talking about?

488
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,794
The difference between us and them

489
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,297
is whether we let our fear stop us.

490
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,301
We break free, and we push the fear out!

491
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,180
It's too risky. I can't do it.

492
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,808
I won't throw our lives away like that.

493
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:17,021
But if we don't go,
then we're dead, and that's it.

494
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,940
If we want to win, we have to take a risk.

495
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,526
You're my teammates.

496
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,403
And my friends.

497
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,114
I don't want any of us to die.

498
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,825
But I would risk my life

499
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,620
to be able to save yours.

500
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,790
Well, I'm in.

501
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,631
Not because of all this mushy shit.

502
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,256
It's more.

503
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,470
I'm not the kind of guy
to ever let fear get in my way.

504
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,185
I wanna win.

505
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,065
I can't stand aside. I want to win this.

506
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,112
Then it's settled.

507
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,491
I can't let you take all the glory.

508
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,577
I...

509
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,791
Tatta.

510
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,294
You protect the base.

511
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,340
Okay.

512
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,567
If we guard this piece of metal,
then we're gonna win.

513
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,449
Huh?

514
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,327
Bet you can't catch me again!

515
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,500
She's got 50 points left, max.

516
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,462
One more hit and you're a goner!

517
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,009
Goken, wait!

518
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,969
Don't let her provoke you like that.

519
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,681
Come on, victory's ours either way!

520
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,606
Aah!

521
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,614
Yes, I'm alive!

522
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,744
Let's party!

523
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,053
There's another one.

524
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,544
You bored yet?

525
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,382
You must be craving some fun.
You're looking for a rush, aren't you?

526
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,970
You know us so well!

527
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,888
Isn't that right, Arisu?

528
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,231
KYUMA
INFINITE

529

MAKI

530

UTA
INFINITE

531
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,737
It'll never work.

532
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,764
Huh?

533
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,050
Whooo!

534
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,813
All set?

535
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,357
Uh-huh.

536
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,012
Yaah!

537
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,082
ARISU
INACTIVE

538
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,087
You were out of commission!

539

<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

540
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,649

541
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,567
Yes! Come on!!

548
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,988
Congrats on 10,000!
Too bad it's not enough!

549
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,824
Well done, Arisu.

550
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,701
Your team had a good go.

551
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,037
But your plan has failed you.

552
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,415
You could get
the remaining items, of course,

553
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,501
but it won't be enough.

554
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,589
And we're not giving you
a chance to win now.

555
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,551
We're guarding the base with
everything we've got till time runs out.

556
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,596
Better accept it.

557
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,932
<i>Twenty minutes remain.</i>

558
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:55,187

559
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,249
I'm sorry.

560
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,086
This is my fault.

561
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,882
No.

562
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,969
We gave it all we had.

563
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,765
My plan just wasn't good enough.

564
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,517
I'm sorry.

565
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,646
So... So, what? That's it?

566
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,903
Because of you,
we're all gonna fuckin' die, asshole.

567
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,417
I'll look for items.

568
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,711
There's no point.

569
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,714
Maybe not, but I have to do it.

570
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,799
For me.

571
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,847
I have to fight.

572
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,892
See it through to the end.

573
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,821
She's strong.

574
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,658
I sure couldn't do that.

575
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,780
"You're my teammates. You're my friends."

576
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,161
What a crock of bullshit.

577
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,998
Fuck!

578
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,552
I was so stupid.

579
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,899
Well, either way,

580
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,402
I don't have much time left.

581
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,958
Isn't there anything we can do?

582
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:00,807
I got it!

583
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,821
<i>The player team has secured an item.</i>

584

<i>The King of Clubs team is now leading
by 500 points.</i>

585
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,914
Usagi found the final item!

586
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,210
Just 500 to go.

587
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,253
Think! Come on!

588
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,631
We gotta do something!

589
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,761
Kyuma's base... I have to go.

590
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,096
Why?

591
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,765
Five hundred.
That's nothing! We can do this!

592
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,142
It's all over.

593
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,562
If I'm going to die,
I'll do everything I can.

594
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,397
Arisu.

595
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,442
Huh.

596
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,153
I have to say,

597
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,697
before I go to at least try...

598
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,618
Tatta.

599
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,122
I love your positive attitude.

600
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,958
You've always cheered me up, Tatta.

601
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,672
Thank you, friend.

602
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,353
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

Niragi?

606
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,047
Yeah, poor Niragi.

607
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:01,511
- I found the last item. We just need 500...
- It's a waste of time.

608
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,264
Well, I'm not giving up.

609
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,689
We're all gonna die.

610
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,983
Me, you.

611

Everyone's gonna die.

612
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,329
You're better than all of us.

613
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,832
That's what you think, isn't it,
that you're better than us, huh?

614
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,589
Am I really so unclean?

615
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,465
Huh?

616
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,511
Everyone looks at me like that now.

617
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,857
<i>I don't know if they hated me
because I was twisted,</i>

618
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,236
<i>or if I became twisted
because they hated me.</i>

619
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,702
I guess Kyuma was right.

620
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,874
Only by facing death
can you learn who you are.

621
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,880
I get it now.

622
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,089
I know who I am.

623
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,885
I'm not the kind of person
with friends to rely on.

624
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,390
I'm not the kind of person
with hopes and dreams.

625
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:31,851
I'm garbage.

626
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,170
Me and you can finally finish
what we started!

627
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,259
We can have one last screw,
right here, you and me,

628
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,428
