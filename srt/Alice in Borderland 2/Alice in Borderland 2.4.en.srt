1
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,259
These cookies taste better.

2
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,138
Hey,

3
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,100
would you mind telling me
what my symbol is?

4
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,235
That guy you hang out with?

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,572
You should know that he's a murderer.

6
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,493
- What?
- His name's Sunato Banda.

7
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,953
It was in the newspaper.

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,166
Murdered four women, so,
that makes him a serial killer.

9
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,628
And, you know, that's punishable by death.

10
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,506
That's a filthy lie.

11
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,757
No. It's true.

12
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,426
Know what I think?

13
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,804
I think he's the Jack of Hearts.

14
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,766
There's only five of us left.

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,185
Time is running out,

16
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,687
so the Jack's gonna start
to get aggressive now.

17
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,233
Might as well share symbols.

18
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,949
For the moment, you're in a good position.

19
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,285
The Jack still trusts you.

20
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,622
So if anyone is going to lie to the Jack,

21
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,873
it has to be you.

22
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,167
Which means

23
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,920
this game can only end one way.

24
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,381
The key player here is you.

25
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,681
I'm sure this is a lot,
and you don't trust me yet.

26
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:24,018
For what it's worth,
there's no advantage for me to lie,

27
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,312
so I'll tell you the truth
about your symbol.

28
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,108
Don't you wanna make sure
that Banda's telling you the truth?

29
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,904
What makes you think
that I would trust you over him?

30
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,824
You don't have to if you don't want to.

31
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,244
If I were in your shoes,
I'd want to weigh my options.

32
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,664
And I've got no reason to lie to you.

33
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,168
Banda's a murderer, and that's a fact.

34
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,881
I still don't trust you.

35
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,464
Fine.

36
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,303
You'll see for yourself,
once the next round is over.

37
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,890
You're a spade, just so you know.

38
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,146
So, will you tell me mine?

39
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:16,196
Come on. I told you what yours is.

40
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,282
I never agreed to this deal.

41
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,957
Heart.

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,723
What's happening?

43
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,691
I think the Jack of Hearts is...

44
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,069
is that guy right there.

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,075
I thought he was suspicious too.

46
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,453
Well, don't worry.

47
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,083
He'll die this round.
You can trust me on that.

48
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,429
That kid Banda.

49
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,726
He's the one we need to watch out for.

50
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,650
You know that emo kid
who lied first to kill that big guy?

51
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,279
Banda's the one
who convinced him to lie to the man.

52
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,781
- I saw him do it.
- Huh?

53
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,368
He whispered in his ear.

54
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:52,292
Banda looks innocent, but he's got
no actual empathy for anyone else.

55
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,546
He can only process human emotion
through logic and reason.

56
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,676
He's certifiably psychopathic.

57
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,390
He's the Jack of Hearts. I'm sure of it.

58
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,052
There are only five of us left,

59
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,930
and unfortunately, my partner's dead.

60
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,310
I asked that guy Matsushita
what my symbol is,

61
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,312
but he told me he doesn't trust me,

62
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,983
and I'm pretty sure that he lied to me.

63
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,609
Sort of a hunch, I guess.

64
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,073
So, would you mind
telling me what my symbol is?

65
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,617
I know this is kind of a big ask.

66
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,873
But if you want, I promise to tell you
your symbol in exchange.

67
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,959
I... don't mean to presume,

68
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,379
but you strike me as an honest person,
at least from over here.

69
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,680
Also, that Yaba guy strikes me
as a bit of a conman,

70
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,392
and since you're aligned with him,
I thought you should know.

71
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,950
Let me get right to the point.

72
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,912
Are you the Jack of Hearts or not?

73
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,707
I'll only say this.

74
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,335
I might be the Jack of Hearts,

75
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,255
but the fact that you're bringing it up
means it could be you.

76
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,055
I know one thing.
You and I will never get along.

77
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,641
<i>Your symbol</i>

78
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,977
is a heart.

79
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,105
Now, what about mine?

80
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,192
It's a club, right?

81
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,454
These taste better, you know.

82
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,381
Five people left,
and only two pairs.

83
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,842
The Jack's definitely going
to make a move this round.

84
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,968
Yeah...

85
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,732
I guess that this is the last round.

86
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,625
Heart.

87
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,426
Thank you very much.

88
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,356
Diamond.

89
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,868
Spade.

90
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,298
All right, and now it's my turn.

91
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,471
Spade.

92
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,102
<i>It is time to answer.</i>

93
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,773
<i>Please enter a solitary confinement
cell of your choosing.</i>

94
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,330
I bet Matsushita lied to me.

95
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,790
I'm sure he did.

96
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,128
And Kotoko, she totally ignored me.

97
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,924
Meaning that... it's a diamond,

98
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,801
or a spade, right?

99
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,304
Hmm.

100
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,223
Ah, well...

101
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,143
I'll go with my gut.

102
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,246
<i>Please give your answer.</i>

103
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,712
I won.

104
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,799
Huh!

105
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,861
I had a feeling
you were the Jack of Hearts.

106
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,740
But how did you...

107
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,700
You teamed up with Banda from the start,

108
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,203
and he's a murderer,
so it just made sense.

109
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,872
We should be a team.

110
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,502
<i>Even if somehow,</i>

111
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,588
you were moved
by Banda's little monologue,

112
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,549
I knew you wouldn't trust him.

113
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,927
You don't trust strangers.
And certainly not as fast as that.

114
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,057
Most people
won't even talk to a guy like me.

115
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,934
But you wanted to kill me.

116
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,022
I could sense that in you right away.

117
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,484
So I wanted to see if you were smart,
or just stupid,

118
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,528
or whether you were a true psychopath.

119
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,821
You mean...

120
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,325
You thought you were controlling me
this whole time.

121
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,621
But I was manipulating you
into thinking that way.

122
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:38,586
Ultimately, it was your huge
superiority complex that gave you away.

123
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,590
That kind of self-importance
usually comes

124
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,592
from being put in a special position.

125
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,760
Something that made you feel untouchable.

126
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,221
Like being chosen as the Jack.

127
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,265
You guys are wrong about this.

128
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,768
- Banda is the Jack of Hearts!
- Sorry, kid.

129
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,900
It's not Banda.

130
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,579
You and Kotoko were connected.

131
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,999
I told Kotoko what her symbol was.

132
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,169
And yet, she still died.

133
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:28,510
Which means Kotoko was being manipulated
by someone other than me.

134
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,764
Well, then,

135
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,683
you should be accusing this guy instead.

136
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,810
Every time I went to the cafeteria,

137
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,941
you and Kotoko would always be there,
getting snacks at the same time.

138
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,109
This break
couldn't come soon enough.

139
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,254
- I don't...
- I'm scared. Aren't you?

140
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,998
- When you trust...
- I don't know what's going on.

141
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,033
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

142
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,576
You can trust me.

143
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,412
Every time I get through it,
I think, "I made it."

144
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,581
<i>And each time,</i>

145
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,960
<i>you'd get the exact same kind of snack.</i>

146
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,596
<i>You and Kotoko were secretly
communicating in the cafeteria.</i>

147
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Spade.

148
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,770
Both of you were just pretending
that you were being controlled.

149
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,656
<i>There were four different flavors
of the snack.</i>

150
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,369
<i>You would confirm your symbols
by checking the packaging,</i>

151
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,622
<i>using those snacks
as a code with each other.</i>

152
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,290
<i>I caught on pretty quickly.</i>

153
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,933
<i>And then,</i>

154
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,437
you told Kotoko
to give me the wrong symbol.

155
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,522
Diamond.

156
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,861
<i>I really did trust her.</i>

157
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,698
Except at the end.

158
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,870
When did the three of you guys
start working together?

159
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,081
Well, the very first announcement said

160
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,209
that this game is about
how much we can trust one another.

161
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,337
So we simply followed that principle.

162
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,551
In order to gain someone's trust,
you can't

163
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,764
control, or manipulate,
or guide them in any way.

164
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,517
You can't brainwash or hypnotize them,

165
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,811
lie to them or instill fear.

166
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,357
It's called equality.

167
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,949
I know one thing.

168
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,910
You and I will never get along.

169
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,870
Tell me.

170
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,873
I want to know

171
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,752
why you're here
playing the games in this country?

172
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,800
I'll tell you why I'm here.

173
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,677
I've never seen a place
more beautiful than this one.

174
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,183
I'm here because I...

175
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,813
because I believe that this world
is a place that is worth conquering.

176
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,694
Well, then, you and I might be
more alike than you think.

177
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,409
I'm starting
to get that feeling too.

178
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,372
Trust is the most important thing
in this game.

179
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,752
We'll be good for each other.

180
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,297
Intellectual equals,
and trustworthy partners.

181
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,723
Wait a sec.
What makes you so sure it's me?

182
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,476
The Jack of Hearts
could easily be one of you guys.

183
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,397
Okay, maybe I did try to blame everything
on you by setting you up, but look!

184
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,857
But that's not enough, huh?

185
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,068
You guys don't have any proof
that I'm the Jack of Hearts, huh?

186
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,612
- You sure about that?
- Huh?

187
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,073
Just think about it.

188
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,828
If they suspected that you were the Jack,
then why did you survive this last round?

189
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,540
Why didn't Banda lie?
Tell you the wrong thing?

190
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,501
The reason you're still alive
is because you're the Jack.

191
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,050
And these guys planned to keep you alive

192
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,346
because they decided they wanna
get information out of you.

193
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,488
<i>Round 14, start.</i>

194
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,744
What are you doing?

195
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,748
There have been so few opportunities

196
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,500
to really get to talk
to the citizens of this place.

197
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,545
We need you to tell us
the ins and outs of this country.

198
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,803
I'm sorry that
we won't be able to kill you, but...

199
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,683
there are a lot of other ways to have fun.

200
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,406
We didn't get very much out of him.

201
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,994
I can't believe he just gave up
like that and said the wrong answer,

202
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,664
even though we told him
what the real answer was.

203
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,043
He certainly gave up
faster than I expected.

204
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,545
Hmm. Yeah.

205
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,351
<i>My name is Kaito Kameyama.</i>

206
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,913
<i>- Fireworks...
- I'll try to get out.</i>

207
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,606
<i>It's lots of fun here.</i>

208
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,403
<i>There are no laws,
so we can loot and kill as we please.</i>

209
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,697
<i>When I play the games,</i>

210
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,074
<i>It's like, "I don't fuckin' care!"</i>

211
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,200
<i>Total freedom. Oh yeah!</i>

212
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,995
<i>It feels pretty great.</i>

213
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,290
<i>I hate it here.</i>

214
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,793
<i>That's why I'm smoking weed...</i>

215
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,380
<i>...and just flipping out!</i>

216
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,968
<i>What is this world?</i>

217
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,096
<i>What are these games?</i>

218
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,640
<i>Who's behind all of this?</i>

219
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,393
<i>You guys are fucking crazy.</i>

220
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,644
<i>I'm gonna kill you!</i>

221
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,690
<i>Hey! Stop filming and help me here!</i>

222
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,484
<i>It's okay!</i>

223
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,860
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

224
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,821
<i>- Come here! I'm gonna kill you!
- Wait! Don't...</i>

225
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,198
<i>- I'm gonna...
- Hey! Don't!</i>

226
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,498
<i>Life is totally meaningless here.</i>

227
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,462
<i>Human beings are worthless.</i>

228
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,925
<i>Is that what this world
is trying to tell us?</i>

229
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,035
Arisu. Do it.

230
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,759
Do we go back where we came from?

231
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,580
<i>Otherwise everyone will die!</i>

232
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,141
There.

233
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,684
Thank you.

234
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,109
You know...

235
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,031
when Kyuma and I were talking
at the end of the game,

236
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,452
I figured something out.

237
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,248
They were all players to begin with,

238
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,126
and then eventually,

239
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,546
they started making the games themselves.

240
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,469
I mean that...

241
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,264
we might not be able

242
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,600
to ever get home...

243
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,521
even if we beat every single game.

244
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,276
Because...

245
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,406
our world might not even exist anymore.

246
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,785
Which means that...

247
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,664
Tatta sacrificed himself

248
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,459
for nothing.

249
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,975
That might not be true.

250
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,355
There might still be a way to get back.

251
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,899
I'll keep trying.

252
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,152
I'll keep playing the games.

253
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,740
Tatta won't have died in vain.

254
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,255
Are you really going?

255
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,174
I'm worried
about Ann and Chishiya.

256
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,510
I'm gonna go look for them.

257
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,307
We need more friends if we're gonna
take down the King of Spades.

258
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,185
And the more games that we beat,

259
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,105
the closer we'll be to our goal.

260
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,484
Don't worry.

261
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,444
We'll see each other again.

262
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,114
Usagi.

263
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,908
You need to rest.

264
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,581
Arisu. Take care of Usagi.

265
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,670
Well, be safe.

266
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,806
<i>You know,</i>

267
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,976
<i>I'd be down with going
to a deserted island.</i>

268
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,899
I'd be down with zombies
showing up in Shibuya.

269
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,860
Everyone here gets bitten,
and they all turn into zombies!

270
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,446
Stop it with the zombie talk, will ya?

271
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,658
If zombies did show up here,
only Karube would survive.

272
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,035
You'd knock 'em out with one punch.

273
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,453
I doubt that.

274
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,538
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

275
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,956
Me? Why's that?

276
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,585
Because I know you'd outsmart 'em.

277
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,347
<i>What?</i>

278
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,851
Why are you acting like your life is over?

279
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,937
Huh?

280
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,941
Why are you making that face?
You look like it's the end of the world.

281
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,403
I was wondering what was on your mind.

282
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,155
So fuckin' stupid.

283
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,658
Is your life so pathetic

284
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,202
that getting a job
will be the end of the world for you?

285
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,537
Don't worry so much.

286
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,247
Use your dad's connections.

287
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,834
Just do whatever you have to do
and leave the deep thoughts for later.

288
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:32,835
Arisu,

289
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:36,881
sometimes life
seems like it's at a dead end,

290
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,760
but there's always another path
you can take, even when things go wrong.

291
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,847
Huh?

292
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,478
Not really convincing coming from
a part-time bartender, though.

293
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,064
Do you have anything smart
to add? I highly doubt it.

294
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,858
Let me see...

295
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,777
See, you got nothin'.

296
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,447
- What you said was still really cool.
- Shut up.

297
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,533
- Hard to do on the spot.
- Don't give me your shit.

298
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,578
- See?
- Keep your mouth shut, then.

299
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,655
Oh.

300
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,452
Mugwort.

301
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,191
Hey, do you wanna come hunting?

302
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,070
We don't have any food left.

303
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,198
I managed to pick this,

304
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,992
but we won't survive on plants alone.

305
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,295
Hey!

306
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,967
If you wanna eat meat,
then you need to help.

307
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,574
Arisu! Get it!

308
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,223
Arisu, would you get serious about this?

309
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,519
We don't have food for tonight.

310
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,030
Arisu, look! Over there!

311
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,493
Ah!

312
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,294
It's there! Look, look!

313
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,760
Ah! Aah!

314
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
Uh...

315
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,181
Oh, there's one.

316
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,150
Ah, you were so close!

317
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,361
You're terrible at this, you know?

318
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,950
Shit.

319
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,450
Huh.

320
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,205
- What?
- Over there!

321
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,665
This way? Oh!

322
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,792
- Usagi, it's there!
- Huh?

323
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,086
Ah!

324
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,712
Arisu!

325
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,339
Oh, shoot!

326
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,175
Arisu, there it is.

327
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,265
Ah!

328
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,142
Oh, man. I give up.

329
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,895
Damn it.

330
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,106
No meat for you, I guess, huh?

331
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,942
Oh, I'm starving.

332
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,867
Come on.

333
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,852
Are you okay?

334
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,441
Film...

335
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,277
- Huh?
- What film?

336
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,965
In here?

337
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,867
He must have been a photographer.

338
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,249
This is eight millimeter film.

339
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,670
Do you watch it with this?

340
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,088
<i>My name is Kaito Kameyama.</i>

341
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,675
<i>For some reason,
electronic devices don't work here.</i>

342
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,430
<i>So I'm using this eight millimeter camera
to make a record of this place.</i>

343
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,681
<i>To document it.</i>

344
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,726
<i>To figure out what's going on.</i>

345
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,315
<i>Lots of fun here.</i>

346
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,692
<i>There are no laws,</i>

347
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,320
<i>so we can loot and kill as we please.</i>

348
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,113
<i>When I play the games,</i>

349
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,907
<i>it's like, "I don't fuckin' care!"</i>

350
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,408
<i>Total freedom. Oh yeah!</i>

351
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,994
<i>It feels pretty great.</i>

352
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,580
<i>I hate it here.</i>

353
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,584
<i>That's why I'm smoking weed</i>...

354
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,921
<i>...and just flipping out.</i>

355
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,554
<i>It's been 26 days
since everyone disappeared.</i>

356
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,526
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

357
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,778
Ann?

358
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,290
<i>Excuse me, miss.
Is there something wrong?</i>

359
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,086
<i>There are a lot more fish now.</i>

360
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,338
<i>The plants
are starting to cover everything.</i>

361
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,966
<i>It's like the further
we get from the city,</i>

362
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,176
<i>the more that nature is growing rampant.</i>

363
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,929
<i>Is that because
all the humans are gone?</i>

364
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,098
<i>Well, sure, that's definitely part of it.</i>

365
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,059
<i>But the plants have been growing
way too quickly.</i>

366
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,397
<i>The people that are here
all came at different times.</i>

367
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,525
<i>Certain things are rotting
more quickly than others.</i>

368
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,902
<i>Time doesn't seem
to work the same way here.</i>

369
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,615
<i>Where are you going?</i>

370
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,162
<i>I'm going to try to get out of Tokyo.</i>

371
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,998
<i>I wanna know what's behind all this.</i>

372
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,091
<i>It's been 33 days
since everyone disappeared.</i>

373
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,011
<i>I got a tip from a man I ran into.</i>

374
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,223
<i>Apparently, there's a whole community
outside of Setagaya.</i>

375
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,850
<i>I'm headed there right now.</i>

376
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,910
<i>Hi. I came here
because I heard a rumor</i>

377
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,913
<i>about someone who has a memory
about what happened to us.</i>

378
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,248
<i>Could you take me to them?</i>

379
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,334
<i>Sure, it's just over here.</i>

380
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,132
<i>Do you know
what it is they remember?</i>

381
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,345
<i>Do you remember the day
you arrived in this world, huh?</i>

382
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,514
<i>Yeah. I think so.</i>

383
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,850
<i>Did you see something in the sky?</i>

384
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,020
<i>- The fireworks?
- Fireworks?</i>

385
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,566
<i>Yes, I remember. I saw them.</i>

386
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,779
<i>Yeah, I saw them too.</i>

387
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,491
<i>This way. Come on.</i>

388
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,298
<i>This woman has a pretty crazy story
about them. Come on.</i>

389
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,968
<i>She's there. Over there.</i>

390
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,557
<i>This guy wants to hear
about the fireworks. Can you tell him?</i>

391
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,643
<i>Huh?</i>

392
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,477
<i>Oh.</i>

393
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,730
<i>The fireworks.</i>

394
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,780
<i>I have a story about them.
Would you like to hear it?</i>

395
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,740
<i>Yes.</i>

396
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,954
<i>I must be the only one who remembers.</i>

397
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,582
<i>Oh?</i>

398
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,128
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>

399
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,381
<i>I had a brain operation,</i>

400
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,050
<i>so they drilled a hole, a little one,</i>

401
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,844
<i>right here into my skull.</i>

402
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,306
<i>Maybe that's the reason.</i>

403
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,727
<i>I'm the only person</i>

404
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,314
<i>who seems to remember
everything about that day.</i>

405
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,234
<i>When...</i>

406
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,069
<i>those...</i>

407
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,655
<i>fireworks flew up into the sky...</i>

408
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,450
<i>I saw them.</i>

409
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,328
<i>They flashed,</i>

410
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,705
<i>and they looked real.</i>

411
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,457
<i>But...</i>

412
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,710
<i>but...</i>

413
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,005
<i>they weren't actually...</i>

414
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,848
<i>It's the King of Spades!</i>

415
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,050
<i>This documentary...</i>

416
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,721
<i>is the only proof that I ever existed.</i>

417
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:42,810
<i>I'll do whatever I can to keep it safe
until it's found.</i>

418
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,427
What's that sound?

419
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,610
Arisu, this way!

420
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,325
Watch out! That way!

421
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,056
Usagi!

422
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:14,984
Hey!

423
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,642
Usagi?

424
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,356
Who's there?

425
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,260
Are you a citizen?

426
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,679
Huh?

427
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,807
I guess you're not.

428
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,314
Why did you attack me?

429
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,193
You woulda gotten killed
if you'd kept running like that.

430
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,822
I told him to leave you behind.
We don't need dead weight.

431
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,327
But guess what?
He wanted to carry you all the way here.

432
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,871
Who did?

433
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,131
You'd better thank him, Arisu.

434
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,676
How do you know my name?

435
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,553
That's what he called you.

436
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,602
Oh, watch out.

437
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,232
He's in a pretty foul mood
since you messed up our plan.

438
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,528
Aguni?

439
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,657
Hey, newbie.
