1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,691
Allow me to introduce my game to you.

2
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,821
This game,
the one that we're all about to play,

3
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,239
is called...

4
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,283
...The Queen of Croquet!

5
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,869
Croquet?

6
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,997
Lawn billiards
is what they used to call it

7
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,167
in 19th-century England,
at the height of its popularity.

8
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,296
I don't believe that it was ever
quite so popular in Japan.

9
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,924
We don't know the rules.

10
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,886
That's all right.
You don't really need to.

11
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,971
Don't worry.

12
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,683
It doesn't matter which one of us wins!

13
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,434
What?

14
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,897
Clearing Croquet is simple.

15
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,315
You just have to complete

16
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,652
three little sets of croquet games
without withdrawing.

17
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,197
If you decide to give up, game over.

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,032
Weapons are also allowed here.

19
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,118
It's so simple.

20
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,329
Just three little rounds of croquet.

21
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,252
W... We just have to finish three rounds?

22
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,130
We don't even have to win?

23
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,590
Exactly! Simple, huh?

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,804
Now, why don't we begin?

25
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,673
Each side has two balls,

26
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,343
one blue and black,
the other red and yellow.

27
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,764
To win, you need to pass your balls
through the six hoops in a certain order,

28
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,601
then hit the final finishing peg
before your opponent does.

29
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,965
Yes!

30
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,975
The first set's mine.
Better luck next time.

31
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,314
We clear the game
by finishing three sets without quitting.

32
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,984
I'm not gonna forfeit.

33
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,820
There are two sets left.

34
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,656
What is she thinking?

35
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,622
All right, round two now.

36
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,480
It looks like she's dragging
the game out, making it last.

37
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,067
I think she's playing with us.

38
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,236
I need to get a move on.

39
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,673
Oh! This is so much fun!

40
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,803
Lovely!

41
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,098
At this rate, we'll be playing forever.

42
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,079
All right!

43
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:44,862
I did it!

44
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,946
I won!

45
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,162
It looks like I lost the second set.

46
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,456
You are really talented!

47
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,835
Okay, time for round three.

48
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,169
Hmm...

49
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,755
That was just exhausting.

50
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,633
What say we have some tea, hmm?

51
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,468
Tea?

52
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,689
Forget about the tea.
Let's play the game.

53
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,900
But teatime is tradition.

54
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,278
It's proper croquet etiquette.

55
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,614
Now, please, help yourselves.

56
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,421
When this game is over,

57
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,048
will we return to our world?

58
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,094
You'll find out
at the end of the game.

59
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,264
Don't talk to her, Arisu.

60
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,350
Don't pay any attention to her.

61
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,435
Remember.

62
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,104
We just need to finish.

63
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,107
Why do you want to know so badly?

64
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,988
My best friends died.

65
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,449
They never got to learn the truth.

66
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,579
So I need to find out.
I'm doing it for their sake.

67
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,583
- That's why I made it this far.
- You want to know.

68
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,628
But you also want to return

69
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,546
to your world.

70
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,923
Can we return?

71
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,052
Aww...

72
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,388
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

73
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,893
For all you know,

74
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,230
this could be the ruins
of your original world.

75
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,774
See, you say that.

76
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,527
But I bet you don't know anything either.

77
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,904
Yes, I do.

78
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,160
Hmm.

79
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,413
I guess I have no choice.

80
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,833
If you want to know so bad,

81
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,628
then I'll tell you everything.

82
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,006
The whole truth about where we are.

83
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,435
However, when I start,
there's no going back.

84
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,897
Remember that you had to know the answer.

85
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,859
You asked for this, Arisu.

86
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,660
Tell me, have you ever thought...

87
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,246
pictured what the future would be like?

88
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,707
- Future?
- Yes.

89
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,460
Nanotechnology and renewable energy,

90
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:51,007
pluripotent cells, virtual reality,
cryogenics, terraforming.

91
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,678
The science and technology from your era

92
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,889
bursts with mountains
of hope and potential.

93
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,977
Perhaps you should be celebrating,

94
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,063
because all of those things
became a reality.

95
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:11,152
What's more, technology
rapidly advanced and progressed.

96
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,698
Within 30 years, the economies
of developing countries grew,

97
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,827
and the inequality of living standards
was eventually eliminated.

98
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,665
Fifty years later, gene manipulation
extended the human lifespan.

99
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,084
Wait a second.

100
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,046
What are you saying?

101
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,966
What are <i>you</i> saying?

102
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,137
I am simply providing information.

103
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,185
I'm telling you about
1,000 years of human history.

104
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,563
A thousand years?

105
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,815
In the future?

106
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,779
After humanity
acquired more advanced knowledge,

107
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,616
it persisted in making
new discoveries in every field.

108
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,077
And so, in short,

109
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,914
approximately ten years after
what you believe is the current year,

110
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,042
virtual reality and avatars

111
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,587
begin to take over
all aspects of people's lives.

112
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,591
After 50 years, cures for dementia,
cancer, and many other maladies

113
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,635
become possible through genetics.

114
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,846
After a hundred,
natural disasters are eliminated

115
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,724
thanks to environmental
and weather control technologies.

116
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,520
After 200 years,
the mechanism of the brain is analyzed.

117
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,231
Memories and thoughts can be transplanted.

118
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:34,110
After 300, humanity
finally conquers natural death

119
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,737
and extends their lifespan to 300 years.

120
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:41,033
After 400,
due to a perfect understanding of physics,

121
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,953
humanity unlocks all laws of causality.

122
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,288
Coincidence and fate are no more.

123
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,668
After 500,
there are no irregular occurrences.

124
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,505
Humankind is perfectly able
to control its whole world,

125
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,674
basically becoming immortal.

126
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,971
In the 500 years that follow, as long
as they are supplied with dopamine,

127
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,764
humans can live forever.

128
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,016
That's the world in 1,000 years.

129
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,455
<i>Right now, you are playing
this game within a virtual reality.</i>

130
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,334
<i>You are so deeply immersed
that you've forgotten.</i>

131
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,548
<i>This particular simulation is
the most popular virtual reality package</i>

132
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,509
<i>a thousand years in the future.</i>

133
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:26,472
<i>After more or less achieving eternal life,
people started losing their drive to live.</i>

134
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,893
<i>And yet, we were enamored with
the period of time a thousand years ago.</i>

135
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,188
<i>A time when people feared death
and the end of the world.</i>

136
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,023
<i>It continued to fascinate us.</i>

137
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,612
Oh, and...

138
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,365
I'm the administrator of this system.

139
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,999
I'm just joking.

140
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,584
Not a word was true.

141
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,837
Huh?

142
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,673
Just quit fucking around.

143
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,260
This is the truth.

144
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:11,058
Genetically modified plants developed
sudden mutations and exploded with growth.

145
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,978
I'm sure you must have noticed.

146
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,729
The city?

147
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,191
It's completely overrun with vegetation.

148
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,069
What's more,

149
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,322
the mountains surround us and close us in.

150
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,081
All of that was the work of aliens.

151
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,417
Aliens?

152
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,380
They captured all of humanity
and wiped our memories.

153
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,716
Forced us to play countless games.

154
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,011
All so they could conduct
behavioral experiments on us.

155
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,888
Is that...

156
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,806
Is that true?

157
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,393
Of course it is.

158
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,729
Except

159
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,357
a rumor started circulating
among the players.

160
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,402
The ones forced to compete in the games.

161
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,905
A rumor that that wasn't the whole story.

162
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,699
A nuclear apocalypse
had wiped out most life,

163
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,910
and the wealthy elite living underground

164
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,996
had created androids
with artificial memories.

165
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,333
These androids compete in games
on the surface,

166
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,669
and the wealthy place bets
on who would survive.

167
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,803
A real nail biter,
wouldn't you agree, sir?

168
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,390
Miss? Excuse me.

169
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,435
- Can I place a bet?
- Yes, of course.

170
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,688
The players believe
that they are humans,

171
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,942
being forced by aliens
to play these games.

172
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,319
But actually, they...

173
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,197
and you

174
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,866
are simply androids with a collection

175
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,994
of artificial memories.

176
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,122
So is that actually the truth?

177
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,335
No! Just kidding.

178
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,171
We need to finish one more set.

179
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,840
Don't listen to what she's saying.

180
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,135
You don't even know
the real answer, do you?

181
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,640
You just might be right.

182
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,020
Do you want the truth so badly?

183
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,651
You want the truth
for the sake of your dead friends?

184
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,284
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

185
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,788
It's written all over your face.

186
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,209
They were tremendously important to you,
weren't they?

187
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,174
You should know,

188
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,428
I'm the one who made that game for you.

189
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,932
I designed the Seven of Hearts
because you three were so close.

190
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,853
Arisu!

191
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,730
It's all right.

192
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,440
Please don't stop him.

193
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,775
Let him hate.

194
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,945
Hate is the most incredible motivator.

195
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,097
It's all part of your plan, isn't it?

196
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,855
You want to get killed.

197
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,566
I'm supposed to shoot you now.

198
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,861
If I kill you in this game,

199
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,447
we won't win.

200
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,948
We won't clear it.

201
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,784
There won't even be a game over.

202
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,744
That means

203
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,997
I would make this game go on forever.

204
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,500
If that happens,

205
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,296
all the other players are doomed
to wait until their visas expire.

206
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,383
You want that.

207
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,512
You want us to fall into despair.

208
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,181
You want us to lose all hope.

209
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,273
Tell me something.

210
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,943
While you were playing the games,

211
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,988
did you really care
about the rest of the world?

212
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,160
Were you thinking about how
the world works or what its purpose is?

213
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,329
Your own goals?

214
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,040
Or did you lose interest? Huh?

215
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,293
Did you start to accept
that it didn't matter?

216
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,090
The answer doesn't matter.

217
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,968
And I think you know that.

218
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,514
Arisu. Don't listen to her.

219
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,349
- I wanna know the answer.
- Arisu!

220
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,851
Are you really sure?

221
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,146
Yeah.

222
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,281
It seems like you're prepared
to accept reality.

223
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,580
So be it, then.

224
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,459
I'll stop dodging your questions
and tell you what you want to know.

225
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,672
Let's start with the big one.

226
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,968
The world,
this world in front of your face,

227
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,887
none of it is real.

228
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,889
It's an illusion.

229
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,104
You want me to believe
all of this is a trick?

230
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,483
Arisu, were you never once suspicious
since you arrived?

231
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,404
The desolate city,
and the science far too advanced?

232
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,947
The mysterious games?

233
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,574
Is it humans, or aliens?

234
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,659
That doesn't make any sense, does it?

235
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,538
Even if they were behind all this,
why would they choose to run these games?

236
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>Tag, hide-and-seek,</i>

237
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,545
<i>they're children's games.</i>

238
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,633
<i>Nothing beyond your imagination
is possible here.</i>

239
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,393
It is no surprise that you were right.

240
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,063
You were always meant
to survive this long.

241
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,483
It's simple, really.

242
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,946
This is all taking place in your mind.

243
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,657
This is all in your head, you see.

244
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,327
In a brain
that barely weighs 1,500 grams.

245
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,929
Arisu.

246
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,098
Don't listen to her.

247
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,809
If this were an illusion,

248
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,353
that means I'm not real.

249
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,232
I can't just be something you invented!
Listen, I'm alive and I'm here!

250
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,234
Of course you are.

251
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,821
You exist, all right. Of course you do.

252
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,490
But you're somewhere else.

253
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:27,035
That is not the reality
Arisu is looking at right now.

254
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,704
Huh?

255
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,623
Arisu.

256
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,711
What happened in that moment?

257
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,338
You remember, don't you?

258
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,719
When you lost them.

259
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,848
Those friends
that were so precious to you.

260
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,851
The shock of it

261
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,520
wiped your memories.

262
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,276
I'm your doctor.

263
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,446
My name is Mira Kano.

264
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,072
Remember me?

265
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,283
Your psychiatrist.

266
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,244
I'm helping you.

267
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,955
We are doing therapy together.

268
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,293
You just

269
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,296
don't remember.

270
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,258
You don't remember anything.

271
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,849
So?

272
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,561
What about now?

273
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,231
Your memories...

274
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,985
Are they coming back?

275
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,665
Arisu, how are you?

276
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,711
Tell me about your memories.

277
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,255
Are they coming back to you?

278
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,345
Chota.

279
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,681
Karube.

280
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,944
You're both two peas in a pod.

281
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,114
She's always checking in.

282
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,243
She really worries about you.

283
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,500
She also lost
someone very precious to her.

284
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,588
So she's been hospitalized here.
Just like you.

285
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,094
Now,

286
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:33,930
tell me.

287
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,811
Tell me what happened to you, Arisu.

288
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,316
On that day with the fireworks.

289
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,031
Go on.

290
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,576
Try to remember.

291
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,916
Fireworks...

292
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,545
- Whoa! Get off!
- Put me down.

293
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,130
- Quick!
- You guys are crazy!

294
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,528
Watch out! Watch out!

295
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,304
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Aah! Uh, uh...

296
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,555
Look! Fireworks!

297
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,682
- Okay.
- Run for your lives!

298
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,855
Huh? Huh? Huh?

299
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,358
Huh? Huh...

300
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,844
It was my fault.

301
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,056
And now they're dead.

302
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,685
It seems like you remember now.

303
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,692
I'm the one who killed them.

304
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,111
My fault...

305
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,823
The answer you're trying to find,

306
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,951
it's not about this world.

307
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,495
Why it exists.

308
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,583
The answer you're really searching for

309
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,420
is what you are.

310
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,215
You want to know why you're alive.

311
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,385
Why you lived.

312
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,305
You want to know why you exist.

313
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,436
You grew up starved for love.

314
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,773
You've been seeking that answer
a long time.

315
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,986
Long before you came here.

316
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,366
So what did you do?

317
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,870
You manifested these games

318
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,872
in your fantasies,

319
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,083
these childlike games
you made for yourself.

320
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,677
And as you kept surviving the games,

321
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,596
you developed the desire

322
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,265
to know the truth about this place.

323
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,063
And that overlapped with your search
for meaning in your own life.

324
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,066
They became intertwined in your head.

325
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,988
Tell me, Arisu...

326
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,825
in this whole world,

327
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,578
is there anyone who needs you?

328
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,833
I'm not sure I'm ready.

329
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,087
Don't be silly.
You've prepared, haven't you?

330
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,481
- I have, but I...
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,007
I just...
I don't know how much...

332
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,929
<i>Is there a reason
you exist in this world?</i>

333
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,181
I've never had any concerns
about you, son.

334
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,475
<i>Does your life have any meaning?</i>

335
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,700
What's your life's purpose, son?

336
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,375
How long are you going
to pass your days like this?

337
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Hey.

338
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,927
Is there a reason you're alive?

339
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,557
<i>And now</i>

340
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,393
<i>you're the one who survived.</i>

341
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,985
I don't know why.

342
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,697
There's no reason for me to live.

343
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,536
They're the ones

344
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,622
who should have survived.

345
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,836
Karube.

346
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,672
Chota.

347
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,011
Instead, it's me.

348
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,599
I survived. The one with no reason to.

349
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,442
I shouldn't be alive at all.

350
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,868
Arisu.

351
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,454
You need to wait outside for your turn.

352
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,790
We'll be seeing you soon.

353
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,794
- Arisu!
- Leave him alone.

354
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,006
He is trying to remember everything
right now.

355
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,927
Hey, hey! Wake up!

356
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,678
- Hey!
- I said stop that!

357
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,977
Arisu's remembering his past
so that he can recover.

358
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,605
And you're interfering with that.

359
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,525
- No!
- Step back.

360
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,405
Now,

361
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,825
Arisu...

362
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,871
why don't we make this go away?

363
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,252
All you need to do
is tell me that you're giving up...

364
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,631
and the game will end.

365
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,720
The game will... end.

366
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,229
That means it's real.

367
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,107
It wasn't an illusion.

368
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,450
I was a player in that game too.

369
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,097
Now,

370
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,891
Arisu.

371
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,689
Let me be absolutely certain.

372
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,318
You're forfeiting?

373
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,155
You're quitting the game, right?

374
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,180
You'll feel better
after you take your medicine.

375
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,100
Go on.

376
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,151
After that,

377
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,862
you can answer.

378
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,716
Arisu, stop it.

379
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,513
Arisu, no!

380
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,780
I would put that down.

381
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,496
Arisu...

382
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,669
you promised.

383
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,507
You promised you'd protect me,
no matter what.

384
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,847
Don't listen to her.

385
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,308
I am definitely here with you.

386
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,937
I'm alive!

387
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,278
But if you believe what she says...

388
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,076
then our time together wasn't real.

389
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,790
It was just something
you created in your mind.

390
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,339
And if you made it all up, then...

391
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,721
then that means I don't matter to you.

392
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,058
And what I do shouldn't affect you.

393
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,650
Arisu!

394
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,487
Wake up.

395
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,679
Arisu.

396
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,481
Arisu.

397
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,651
You have to come back.

398
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,822
Please.

399
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,664
What a truly touching display.

400
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,042
However,

401
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,796
the feeling you call love is powerless.

402
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,012
Arisu.

403
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,432
Please.

404
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,811
I shouldn't be here.

405
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,898
I shouldn't be alive.

406
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,652
I have no reason to live.

407
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,332
Come back...

408
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,920
Arisu.

409
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,475
The answer you're looking for...

410
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,771
a reason to be alive...

411
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,319
Forget all of it, Arisu.

412
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,035
The... the truth is

413
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,122
everyone has a different answer.

414
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,751
It doesn't matter now.

415
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,171
You... you don't need

416
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,882
a... a reason to live.

417
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,432
This whole time
that we were looking for answers...

418
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,228
...we've been searching side by side.

419
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,404
That alone was all I needed.

420
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,907
That was enough.

421
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,711
You helped me realize what was important.

422
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,842
It was you.

423
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,306
It was you, Arisu.

424
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,303
You poor thing.

425
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,603
Looks like I've won.

426
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,571
You'll be forfeiting now.

427
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,075
Isn't that right, Arisu?

428
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,383
And then...

429
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,970
...our game will be over.

430
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,893
Usagi.

431
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,068
Usagi...

432
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,114
I want to feel your hand.

433
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,368
Just one more time.

434
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,918
Walk side by side.

435
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,712
One more time.

436
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,095
And I want to eat next to you.

437
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,937
Me too.

438
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,158
Tomorrow...

439
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,082
I just want...

440
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,836
to say good morning to you.

441
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,218
I want to laugh with you every single day.

442
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,264
And some day...

443
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,311
I want us to climb a mountain.

444
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,731
Just being with you...

445
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,486
that's more than enough, Usagi.

446
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,740
We may fight.

447
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,496
But some days, that might be nice.

448
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,877
I want you to live.

449
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,549
I want that.

450
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,902
I want to keep protecting you.

451
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,923
Game on.

452
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,802
Last round.

453
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,897
Arisu.

454
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,358
It's okay now.

455
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,706
Here, take it.

456
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,219
How beautiful that was.

457
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,893
I do mean that.

458
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,318
Let's finish off the game.

459
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,489
Let's both do it for her.

460
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,732
Yes!

461
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:32,956
Okay.

462
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,964
Yes!

463
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,503
Gah!

464
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,093
Yes!

465
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,096
Hmm! I win!

466
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,074
Well done.

467
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,619
You finished three sets.

468
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,832
You didn't quit or forfeit the match.

469
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,589
Congratulations, Arisu.

470
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,594
<i>The game has ended.</i>

471
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,099
Finally...

472
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,687
Is it over?

473
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,404
Yeah.

474
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,033
We won, Usagi.

475
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,675
Well?

476
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,722
What is this place? Can you tell me now?

477
00:48:58,977 --> 00:48:59,978
Arisu.

478
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,608
You'll find out soon enough.

479
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,616
You will be given two choices.

480
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,495
No matter which one you pick,

481
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,539
you will learn the answer.

482
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,878
And you'll learn who you really are
when you choose.

483
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,340
You'll soon find out.

484
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,053
Life is just...

485
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,431
a game we play together.

486
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,645
You should try to enjoy it.

487
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,136
<i>Congratulations.</i>

488
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,473
<i>All of the games have now been cleared.</i>

489
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:34,299
<i>All surviving players
will be presented with two choices.</i>

490
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,095
<i>Players must now all decide</i>

491
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,848
<i>whether to accept
permanent residency in this country,</i>

492
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,850
<i>or decline it.</i>

493
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,311
<i>Once again,</i>

494
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,983
<i>players must now decide
whether to accept permanent residency,</i>

495
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,735
<i>or decline it.</i>

496
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,034
I decline.

497
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,609
And I...

498
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,863
don't want it!

499
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,807
I decline.

500
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,249
Let's go back together.

501
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,473
I accept, naturally.

502
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,517
I will gladly take it as well.

503
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,610
I want

504
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,571
to turn it down,

505
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,281
I think.

506
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,578
What are you gonna say?

507
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,798
I decline.

508
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,081
I decline.

509
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,169
I'm choosing not to stay here.

510
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,675
Same for me.

511
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,055
I don't want it.

512
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,159
You want the usual?

513
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:32,911
Sure, thanks.

514
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,415
Here you go.

515
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:39,877
Hey.

516
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,380
What?

517
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,470
One big-ass nose hair...

518
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,929
Wait, what?

519
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,013
Really?

520
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,100
- No.
- Aw, you're such a piece of shit!

521
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,775
Ah, you just looked so depressed.

522
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:06,780
Listen, did you know you can
pull out your nose hair with wax?

523
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,449
- That would hurt so bad!
- And they never grow back?

524
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,034
Nah, they still grow back!

525
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:13,203
- Then using a trimmer is way better.
- Oh, sure.

526
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,955
What if something
falls on top of you while you're doing it?

527
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,626
- That would hurt even worse.
- Well, not as badly as an explosion.

528
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,045
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

529
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,301
I'm sorry.

530
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,262
I'm sorry.

531
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,599
It's my fault.

532
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,393
I'm sorry.

533
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,313
Oh, his fault, he says.

534
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,066
Someone thinks highly of himself.

535
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:47,362
I bet you think you're alive because
you're, like, a chosen one or something.

536
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:50,323
I don't! It's thanks to you guys.

537
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:55,245
Come on. That makes it sound like we all
sacrificed ourselves to keep you alive.

538
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:58,415
Chota, hey. Wasn't that a little harsh?

539
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,750
Arisu's missing
the whole point, seriously.

540
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:03,878
What the hell?

541
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,423
What are you trying to say?

542
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,467
Just tell me, come on.

543
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,264
Listen, man, it's like this.

544
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,561
Across all these games,
there hasn't been a single one,

545
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,646
not one, that you cleared on your own.

546
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,566
You could go on thanking us
for the rest of your life

547
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,359
and it still wouldn't be enough.

548
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,277
Okay...

549
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,990
Should I apologize
for the rest of my life, then?

550
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,367
Don't be an idiot.

551
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,037
We want you to live your life, man.

552
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,707
Live it to the fuckin' fullest.

553
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,255
All right.

554
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,049

I'd be down with zombies
showing up in Shibuya.

565
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,266
Everyone here gets bitten,
and they all turn into zombies.

566
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,602
Stop it with the zombie talk,
will ya?

567
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,980
If zombies did show up here,
only Karube would survive.

568
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,525
You'd knock 'em out with one punch.

569
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,569
I doubt that.
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

570
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,446
Me? Why's that?

571
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,949
'Cause I know you'd outsmart 'em.

00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,759
Okay, run! Run!

591
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,942

592

Can you hear me? Sir!

593
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,523
- Can you hear me?
- I need a check here!

594
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,006
- His vitals?
- Now!

595
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,216
Copy that.

596
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,218
We've got a pulse!

597
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,762
He's breathing!

598
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,432
He's alive! We need a stretcher!

599
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,475
- Resume CPR.
- Okay.

600
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,269
We need a gurney here!

601
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,521

And I get to live?

615
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,971
Don't beat yourself up.

616
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,891
It'll only make it worse.

617
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:36,854
Survivor's guilt.

618
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,607
It's a hell of a thing to deal with.

619
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,861
"Why me? Why am I alive?"

620
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,782
"Why couldn't they have been saved too?"
You know?

621
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,829
Apparently, it happens
to most people after disasters.

622
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,456
They end up blaming themselves.

623
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,587
But when they finally
found your body,

624
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,757
your heart had completely stopped.

625
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,721
A whole minute went by.

626
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:18,437
Apparently, for a minute,
the borderlands had taken you.

627
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,316
A minute?

628
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,234
Yeah.

629
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,827
A minute?

630
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:38,624
You know...

631
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,169
it felt like...

632
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,590
a lot longer.

633
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:50,595
Like I'd gone away for a long time.

634
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:58,686
You know, uh...

635
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,147
Dad cried.

636
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,775
The last time he cried

637
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,820
must've been when Mom died.

638
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,774
What do you want?

639
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:50,696
It looks to me like you must have
experienced a cardiac arrest.

640
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,742
What are you, a doctor?

641
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,246
Well, I did too.

642
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,626
What a coincidence.

643
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,714
So we both almost died.

644
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,842
You feel any different now?

645
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,595
I don't know.

646
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,183
I mean, I look a lot worse.

647
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:21,893
What about you?

648
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:28,818
I've been thinking a lot about my life.

649
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,946
Choices I had to make.

650
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,074
Pretty sure I'm gonna
be turning my life around.

651
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,787
Or something like that.

652
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:45,042
You were a piece of shit, too, huh?

653
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,460
You fucked up?

654
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:48,878
I did.

655
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:09,900
Huh. After his cardiac arrest,
it's a miracle he's come this far already.

656
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,528
- Could you get me some gauze, please?
- Yes, doctor.

657
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,704
Is it someone you know?

658
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,247
No. Not really.

659
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:29,920
But I do understand.

660
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:33,049
I bet he's trying to survive too.

661
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:35,384
He is.

662
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,698
Commencing cardiac massage.

663
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,102
Get the defib ready, now!

664
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,078
- Right away, doctor!
- Miss Ann, can you hear me?

665
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,996
- Miss Ann!
- Clear!

666
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,248
Still no pulse!

667
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:10,086
- Again! Charge it!
- Yes, sir! Charge complete!

668
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,629
Clear!

669
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,216
We have a pulse!

670
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,344
Normal sinus rhythm.
Heart rate is holding between 80 and 90.

671
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,637
She's back!

672
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,013
Resume operation!

673
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,807
- Forceps.
- Here, doctor.

674
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,986
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

675
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,239
There's no need to rush at all.

676
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:39,865
- You're doing very well.
- Okay.

677
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,623
You came back to us.

678
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,313
Hikari.

679
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:18,756
<i>...has released two trillion yen
from the national treasury</i>

680
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:20,174
<i>for emergency relief.</i>

681
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:25,012
<i>A week has passed
since the meteorite exploded over Tokyo.</i>

682
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:30,601
<i>Even now, all metro and railway operations
have been suspended in Tokyo,</i>

683
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:34,271
<i>and many major roads
have been shut down as well.</i>

684
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,060
Sorry...

685
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,562
Do you mind if I use it?

686
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,190
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

687
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:46,802
Hey, wait.

688
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,013
Your change.

689
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:52,682
Oh!

690
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:54,643
Thanks a lot.

691
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:08,531
Um...

692
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,243
Sorry, but have we met before?

693
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,872
I don't think so.

694
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,461
Wait.

695
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:27,259
Are you sure that I don't know you, miss?

696
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,510
Uh...

697
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,976
Are you, uh,

698
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,479
flirting with me?

699
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:40,731
Uh, no.

700
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,107
It's not like that.

701
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,779
Uh, wait. Wait. Stop!

702
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,446
Um, miss.

703
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:51,241
Would it be all right if I was?

704
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:52,493
Flirting with you?

705
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,795
I'm sorry.

706
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:05,130
That wasn't cool of me.

707
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:13,389
I think maybe we have met before.

708
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,851
Uh, was it last year?

709
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,104
Or was it...

710
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:22,398
When was that?

711
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,776
I don't know.

712
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,153
But we've met.

713
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:40,874
Uh, the sun's out. It's pretty nice.

714
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:46,171
Do you want to maybe step out?
Go for a walk?

715
01:13:47,464 --> 01:13:49,007
Mm. Mm-hmm!
