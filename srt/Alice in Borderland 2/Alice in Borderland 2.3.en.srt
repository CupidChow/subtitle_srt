1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,023
Hey, this isn't tight enough.

2
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,775
- Right. Sorry about that.
- And look there.

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,236
That jack's in the wrong position, man.

4
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,447
Someone could get hurt.

5
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,033
I already explained this to you.

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,036
Why can't you do anything right, huh?

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,245
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,584
Kato keeps riding my ass
like I'm a stupid newbie.

10
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,921
I can't work every day of the week
with no time off.

11
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,549
I'm not like my dad.
He died from working too much.

12
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,470
I'm doing this now,
but once I get enough money,

13
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,180
I'm gonna take some courses,

14
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,765
and I'll quit that dump.

15
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,558
Then I'll do something really worthwhile.

16
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,143
I'm sorry you feel like that.

17
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,607
I plan to keep on
working hard at that dump.

18
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,776
I like it there.

19
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,070
Oh. I didn't...

20
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,114
Kato keeps riding you
because you have a bad attitude.

21
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,077
You might learn to do the job right
before shitting on it.

22
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,455
Sure, it might not be
the most exciting job,

23
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:24,125
but I work my ass off every single day,
get my paycheck,

24
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,461
and go home to my grateful family.

25
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,465
Has anyone ever
been grateful to you for anything?

26
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,849
Hurry up now.

27
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,935
- Move it.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,687
I'll take off the splash shield.
You remove the jack.

29
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,189
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:07,919
Get him out!

31
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,963
Hey, move! Get the car up!

32
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,381
- Okay, go!
- Get it up!

33
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,465
Get it up!

34
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,092
- A whole turn!
- Hang on, Kato!

35
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,427
- It's up! Hang on, almost there.
- Okay!

36
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,096
- It's up. It's up.
- Kato, you okay?

37
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,389
- Move it. Move!
- Come on.

38
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,598
- Easy. Easy...
- Okay.

39
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,683
- Get him out.
- Come on.

40
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,977
Easy.

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,270
You're okay.

42
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,353
- It's okay.
- Ugh!

43
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,815
- Don't stand there! Call an ambulance!
- Are you all right?

44
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,066
- Are you okay?
- Kato!

45
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,442
- Kato!
- Look at his arm!

46
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,320
The jack slipped!

47
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,614
- Kato, hey!
- Hang in there, man!

48
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,700
Hold it! Easy. Easy. Don't try to get up.

49
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,451
<i>Kato decided to quit.</i>

50
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,078
Why?

51
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,082
What do you think? He has no choice.

52
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,627
His hand is completely useless now.

53
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,091
You should leave. Get out!

54
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,819
- Thank you.
- There it is.

55
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,476
- Yeah.
- Guys, break out those shocks.

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,704
- You know the ones?
- Anyway...

57
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,815
- I don't know when he's coming back.
- Do you know, uh... <i>if </i>he's coming back?

58
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,491
- It kind of slipped out, man.
- Yeah.

59
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,744
That Tatta is an idiot.

60
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,288
I don't know. I don't know if...

61
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,169
- ...they rushed him to the hospital...
- He's all right...

62
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,230
<i>Nine minutes remain.</i>

63
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,525
<i>The King of Clubs team is leading
by 500 points.</i>

64
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,763
Aah! You bastard!

65
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,682
What the fuck are you doing?

66
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,976
I just wanted to have a little fun
with your girlfriend

67
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,394
before this stupid game was over!

68
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,855
You asshole!

69
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,525
Sure, you act like a hero.

70
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,153
But I know you're just like me!

71
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,073
I fucking hate how you walk around
like you're full of hope.

72
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,701
Except now I can finally see
that hope draining out of you.

73
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,371
And I'll die happy
knowing how pathetic you are.

74
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,555
Eight minutes left.

75
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,934
Seems like the enemy is laying low.

76
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,521
It's over, I guess.

77
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,358
What a letdown, huh?

78
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,943
That's just how the game goes.

79
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,237
There's no time left
for them to do anything.

80
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,741
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

81
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,765
This feels like an eternity.

82
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,060
Just waiting here to die.

83
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,956
Arisu. I'm sorry.

84
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,749
I couldn't fight.

85
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,878
I couldn't help you in the end.

86
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,463
Usagi,

87
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,798
I should apologize to you.

88
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,925
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,946
<i>I'm sure</i>

90
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,325
if we went back, I'd still hate it there.

91
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,285
No, staying here won't change that.

92
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,703
Usagi...

93
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,166
You can't push people
into following you for no reason.

94
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,585
You have to be ready to listen.

95
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,129
Wait for them to come to you.

96
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,426
<i>Seven minutes remain.</i>

97
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,786
You decided to come.

98
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,167
Something told me
that I would see you here.

99
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,799
Something told me the same thing.

100
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,553
That's why I came.

101
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,098
To see if you might be
waiting for me here.

102
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,186
The ocean is wide.

103
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,856
That's why we're drawn to it.

104
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,360
We want to commune
with something bigger than we are.

105
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,914
Your team beat ours.

106
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,921
So do you have any regrets?

107
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,925
To be honest,

108
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,554
I'm a bit disappointed.

109
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,017
<i>Five minutes remain.</i>

110
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,022
Please, tell me, Kyuma.

111
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,777
I need to know the answer.

112
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,697
Before I die.

113
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,950
You know that I can't.

114
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,786
You've given up.

115
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,417
I thought you'd say that.

116
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,634
Well, then...

117
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,137
what about

118
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,474
one last handshake

119
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,684
before I go?

120
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,063
What would you say to that?

121
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,523
Handshake?

122
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,859
The game isn't over yet.

123
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,445
If we shake hands now,

124
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,947
we would have to battle, and I'd win.

125
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,331
I finally realized something about myself,

126
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,627
because of what you said.

127
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,923
I should have been ready to listen.

128
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,386
I should have waited
for them to come to me.

129
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,972
Let them know they could depend on me.

130
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,769
And maybe we could've

131
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,480
understood each other
a little better then.

132
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,947
I know we're enemies.

133
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,035
You're my opponent.

134
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,458
And I know it might seem
like I'm being crazy.

135
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,549
But I still really want to say thank you.

136
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,679
Thank you for helping me
realize those things.

137
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:12,314
I know that... I don't have much time left
to do anything else.

138
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,027
I know I'm gonna die.

139
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,448
So please,

140
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,327
let me shake the hand of the one...

141
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,039
...who showed me my true self.

142
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,513
All right.

143
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,059
Since it's my opponent's dying wish,

144
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,645
I'd be honored to grant it to you.

145
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,443
Thank you, Kyuma.

146
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,321
Arisu.

147
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,491
Getting to battle with you

148
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,951
was a great pleasure.

Huh?

152
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,687

14,950 points?

157
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,541
What kind of trick is this?

158
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,418
It's not a trick at all.

Stop!

163
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,562
It's no use.

164
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,023
I can't get it off.

165
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,526
Pathetic.

166
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,613
Arisu.

167
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,364
You gotta do it.

168
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,493
What do you mean, get it off?

169
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,289
Well, I figured out a plan.

170
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,583
There's 10,100 points here.

171
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,338
If you hold onto it hidden in your pocket,
it'll be like there's two of us.

172
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,424
Then our team might be able
to win that way.

173
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,302
Tatta, I can't. No!

174
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,847
They never said anything
about taking the wristband off.

175
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,311
Please, Arisu!

176
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,190
I don't think I can do it.

177
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,817
Please, there's no time!

178
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,694
Do it for me!

179
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,123
We can win this way.

180
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,170
Everybody's life is on the line here!

181
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,254
What are you waiting for?

182
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,840
<i>Six minutes remain.</i>

183
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,385
Otherwise everyone will die!

184
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,305
Arisu!

185
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,515
Do it!

186
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,771
You've just gotta do it, okay? Hurry!

187
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,606
I can't.

188
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,485
Please, or you'll kill everyone!
Do it for them!

189
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,321
Just go!

190
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,532
Do it!

191
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,160
Arisu!

192
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,706
Do it!

193
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,655
Tatta!

194
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,906
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,366
I'm sorry!

196
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,118
No.

197
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,162
I'm sorry I made you do it.

198
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,080
I'm sure it was hard.

199
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,757
- Quick, take it.
- I've gotta stop the bleeding!

200
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,258
Just take it!

201
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,896
Arisu.

202
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,691
Remember when you thanked me earlier?

203
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,236
I felt so much joy.

204
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,990
It was like

205
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,326
I was the hero for once.

206
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,789
I promise I'll be fine.

207
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,957
Don't worry, I'm not gonna die from this.

208
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,587
Hurry up, or everyone else will die!

209
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,297
Go on!

210
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,801
Go!

211
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,593
Just go!

212
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,327
Whoa...

213
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,707
You are way more screwed up
than I thought.

214
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,504
I won the game, thanks to my friend.

215
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,636
Wow. I guess we finally lost the game.

216
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,184
So even someone as wise as you

217
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,729
is still afraid of death?

218
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,357
No.

219
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,611
I'm thinking about my friend Shitara,
who died earlier.

220
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,826
He said that if I let him die in vain,

221
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,454
he'd beat the shit out of me
in the afterlife,

222
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,873
and I know he meant it.

223
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,169
And all my teammates
are gonna be disappointed in me.

224
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,133
I'm sorry.

225
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,806
You were the one who set the tone.

226
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,394
We were all equals in this game,
and we gave everything.

227
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,771
With all our hearts.

228
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,525
I've never had this much passion
for anything.

229
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,905
And you showed me how.

230
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,491
Kyuma,

231
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,787
you guys were a team before this,
weren't you?

232
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,378
Kyuma, you asshole.

233
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,341
I guess he dropped his guard
right at the end.

234
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,179
Well, aren't you the one to talk?

235
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,599
Yeah, you're right.

236
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,976
Without Kyuma,

237
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,105
none of our sorry asses
would have made it this far in the game.

238
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,651
We can't hold him responsible
for anything.

239
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,945
That's right.

240
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,615
Thanks, Kyuma.

241
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,534
It was pretty fun.

242
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,748
We'll do some more stupid shit
on the other side.

243
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,093
<i>Kyuma.</i>

244
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,889
<i>You love your friends
as much as I love mine.</i>

245
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,561
And with every single game,
you kept on risking your lives.

246
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,314
But you kept winning,

247
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,150
and progressing more.

248
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,279
We're all doing the same thing.

249
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,365
Everyone just wants to stop
playing the game.

250
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,869
Isn't that right?

251
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,711
But it seems like,
even if you win them all,

252
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,047
you still just become
citizens of Borderland.

253
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,383
So do we get to go back
to where we came from?

254
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,054
Tell me the truth.

255
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,891
Do we get to go back?

256
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,859
If that's what your intuition is saying,

257
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,112
then maybe that's your truth.

258
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,287
What kind of an answer is that?

259
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,251
Come on, man.

260
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,345
So there's...

261
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,557
there's no point
in playing any of these games.

262
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,935
Do you think you'll find out
if you stop playing?

263
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,650
Well, what is it all supposed to mean?

264
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,325
I don't think I can do it.

265
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,539
I'm never gonna be as strong as you are.

266
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,126
You'll never be like me, Arisu,

267
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,253
and you shouldn't want that.

268
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,715
You're playing your own game.

269
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,718
You're the master of your own fate.

270
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,058
<i>No time remains.</i>

271
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:19,356
<i>It is game over for the King of Clubs
team, as they ended with fewer points.</i>

272
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,857
Arisu.

273
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,277
Good luck to you.

274
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,663
I don't want you to die!

275
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,543
When we first met,

276
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,587
we knew that one of us was going to die.

277
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,966
If we hadn't met playing this game,
who's to say...

278
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,468
The only reason we became this close

279
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,304
was because we met playing the game.

280
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,226
But if we had met somewhere else,

281
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,773
then maybe we could have
actually been friends.

282
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,696
We've been friends this whole time.

283
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,490
Arisu.

284
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,036
I hope you figure it out.

285
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,040
How to live by your own rules.

286
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,376
Your life is yours.

287
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,463
Don't follow someone else's path.

288
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,601
It was an honor playing with you.

289
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,326
So this is the end.

290
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,746
I had a great life.

291
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,794
I lived it without a single regret.

292
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,676
And I know that I'm ready to die.

293
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,097
Kyuma.

294
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,143
<i>The player team wins.</i>

295
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,863
Usagi? Usagi!

296
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,329
Kuina.

297
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,205
We won.

298
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,585
What? Really?

299
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:12,964
PLAYER TEAM
CONGRATULATIONS

300
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,300
Arisu must have saved us somehow.

301
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
We won?

302
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,733
Tatta, are you okay?

303
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,942
Tatta!

304
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,444
Hang on, Tatta!

305
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,326
Just hang on.

306
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,246
Tatta.

307
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,502
Tatta.

308
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
Tatta,

309
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,298
we won.

310
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,551
We won,

311
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,929
and it's all thanks to you.

312
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,807
Sweet.

313
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,479
Hey, come on, Tatta.

314
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,481
Keep it together, all right?

315
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,273
Tatta.

316
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,945
You see?

317
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,031
When I try,

318
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,032
I can

319
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,119
be great.

320
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,956
Yeah. You are great.

321
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,291
We won because of you, Tatta.

322
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,504
Thank you.

323
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,347
Hey, Tatta!

324
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,517
Tatta! Don't go!

325
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,977
Don't you go!

326
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Tatta!

327
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,523
Tatta!

328
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,192
Oh no. Just hang on, Tatta!

329
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,111
Tatta!

330
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,488
Come on!

331
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,240
Tatta!

332
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,617
Tatta!

333
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,538
Tatta,

334
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,999
don't leave me.

335
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,788
It's a pretty view.

336
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,125
This is a nice place to rest.

337
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,919
Yeah.

338
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,390
We can't...

339
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,394
let his death be for nothing.

340
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,192
We need to keep going,

341
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,070
to keep Tatta's memory alive.

342
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,172
I'm so fucking pissed off that I survived,

343
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,758
and it's all because of you.

344
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,469
Even so,

345
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,683
I guess I'm grateful that I'm still alive.

346
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,816
So thank you.

347
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,059
TEIO PRISON

348
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:19,020
PUT ON A COLLAR AND GO UPSTAIRS
TO THE CENTRAL GUARDROOM

349
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,795
<i>Difficulty level,
Jack of Hearts.</i>

350
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,425
<i>Game, Solitary Confinement.</i>

351
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,888
<i>Rules. Guess the card suit
that appears on the back of your collar.</i>

352
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,268
<i>However, you may not look
at the symbol yourself.</i>

353
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,647
I can't see anything.

354
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,151
<i>The time limit is
one hour per round.</i>

355
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:53,948
<i>In the final five minutes,
enter your cell and disclose your symbol.</i>

356
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:16,137
<i>If you do not answer
with the correct symbol, it is game over.</i>

357
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,348
<i>The collar will explode, and you will die.</i>

358
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,560
<i>Additionally,
when the time limit reaches zero,</i>

359
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:26,439
<i>the symbol on the collar will reset
and change for each round.</i>

360
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,861
Wait a sec. So that means we just have
to ask each other what our symbols are.

361
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,696
That's easy, huh?

362
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,323
I'm not so sure.

363
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,409
They haven't told us
what the conditions to win are yet.

364
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,286
<i>The Solitary Confinement game</i>

365
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,498
<i>is about how much
you can trust your fellow players.</i>

366
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,585
<i>Be aware that your opponent,
the Jack of Hearts,</i>

367
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,254
<i>has already been placed among you.</i>

368
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,007
Oh, that's good.

369
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,844
So one of us

370
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,680
<i>is </i>the Jack of Hearts?

371
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,475
<i>How to win.</i>

372
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,478
<i>Rounds repeat every hour.</i>

373
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:10,274
<i>You win the game
when the Jack of Hearts dies.</i>

374
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,738
<i>Prohibited actions.</i>

375
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,408
<i>Looking at your symbol
with a reflective surface is cheating.</i>

376
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,622
<i>Players may not use weapons or violence
to kill fellow players.</i>

377
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,085
This means
that the only way this game will ever end

378
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,088
is if the Jack gives the wrong answer.

379
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,382
So, basically,

380
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,928
no one here is getting out alive,
unless they lie to the Jack.

381
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,764
<i>There is no limit
to the number of rounds.</i>

382
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,224
There's no limit?

383
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,686
<i>Enough food has been provided.</i>

384
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,271
What?

385
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,241
<i>While participating in this game,</i>

386
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,536
<i>no days will be removed from your visas.</i>

387
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,290
So we need to start lying,

388
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,126
find the Jack of Hearts,
and kill them off,

389
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,879
or we'll live out the rest of our days
in this prison.

390
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,633
Solitary for life.

391
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,845
<i>The game will now commence.</i>

392
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,471
ROUND ONE

393
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:26,100
<i>You can roam freely
until it is time to enter your cell.</i>

394
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,277
Is this for real?

395
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,616
Hey, man.

396
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,454
Would you mind telling me
what my symbol is?

397
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,039
And then I can tell you yours.

398
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,581
Okay.

399
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,544
So, the 20 of us
need to eliminate each other

400
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,256
until we somehow figure out
who the Jack of Hearts is.

401
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,719
What makes you think
that anyone is trustworthy?

402
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,391
Do you wanna go downstairs?

403
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,911
I have an idea.

404
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,206
How about we get together
and make teams to tell each other?

405
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,000
So that way, nobody can lie.

406
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,168
Good idea.

407
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,004
Um, would you mind
if I joined up with you?

408
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,339
Me too?

409
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,633
Excuse me. I'd like to join as well.

410
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,594
Sure! The more the merrier!

411
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,845
Can I join too, please?

412
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,556
Hey. I want you to tell me
what my symbol is.

413
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,849
Um... Okay.

414
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,936
Tell me what my symbol is, man.

415
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,063
Go on.

416
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,189
- Uh...
- Huh?

417
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,734
Why, can't you tell me?
Then I'll look at yours.

418
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,318
Huh?

419
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,907
Okay, now tell me mine.

420
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,701
- All right.
- Come on.

421
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,869
Hey, wanna tell each other the answer?

422
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,290
If you're trying to survive,

423
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,334
I would examine all the people here
a little more carefully.

424
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,714
Make sure you keep
the ones who don't lie close.

425
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,135
For all you know,
I'm the one who might be the Jack.

426
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,805
You see?

427
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,433
They all started breaking off into groups.

428
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,437
Everyone wants to know
who's trustworthy and who's not.

429
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,358
Take those two.

430
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,111
Listen.

431
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,238
If you wanna be safe...

432
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,325
Before the game started,
you wanna know what they were doing?

433
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,003
What?

434
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,674
That guy wants to control everything
she does to exert power over her

435
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,012
so that she can't interact
with any of the other players.

436
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,432
Which is smart, in the long run.

437
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,060
If you've got someone
you can trust that much,

438
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,811
that's how you can win the game.

439
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,895
Hey.

440
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,277
- Doesn't look like you have a partner yet.
- Hearts...

441
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,696
Tell me what my symbol is,
and I'll tell you yours.

442
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,656
- I don't know.
- Spades.

443
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,825
Clubs.

444
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,120
That's a pretty aggressive
attitude to take.

445
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:34,954
Huh?

446
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,793
That kind of childishness
makes you painfully transparent.

447
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:44,256
You're ashamed of the darkness inside you,
which makes you petty and jealous.

448
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,301
You try to keep yourself safe
behind those bangs.

449
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,764
You hide your face so that
people won't see your ugly, empty soul.

450
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:58,062
You're a pathetic excuse of a human being
who judges others to feel better.

451
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,567
Pathetic and small.

452
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,028
But that's what I like about you.

453
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,830
We should be friends.

454
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,968
Hey.

455
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,928
Do you wanna join our team?

456
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,181
No pressure or anything.

457
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,267
It's not that I don't want to.

458
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,770
Okay. We'll join the group.

459
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,732
- Do you wanna join us?
- Yes.

460
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,317
Welcome to the group. Welcome.

461
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,530
So I'm gonna go first, okay?

462
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,616
I hope you'll all give me
the right answer.

463
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,828
Oh, Urumi, yours is...

464
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,954
is a heart.

465
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,205
- Heart.
- Heart. Heart.

466
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,289
- Heart. Yes.
- Yeah.

467
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,295
Okay, will you please do mine next?

468
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,421
Yours is a heart too.

469
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,881
- Heart, yes.
- Heart.

470
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,257
Heart.

471
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,217
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll go next.

472
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,263
- You're a spade.
- Yes. Spade.

473
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,848
- It's a spade.
- See, it's a spade.

474
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,142
- Uh, may I go next?
- Sure. Yeah.

475
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,744
- Diamond.
- Diamond?

476
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,455
- Yes, yes, diamond.
- It's a diamond.

477
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,605
Yes, a diamond.

478
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,733
Yes. Diamond. Diamond.

479
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,816
- That's it.
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,637
- Club.
- You're a club. That's it.

481
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,447
- A club, yes. It's a club.
- Club, yes.

482
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,407
Oh, okay, I'll go next.

483
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,328
<i>It is time to give your answer.</i>

484
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:42,124
<i>Please enter a solitary confinement cell
of your choosing.</i>

485
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,518
<i>Please give your answer.</i>

486
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,061
Diamond.

487
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,797
Wow.

488
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,383
That was so easy.

489
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,768
- Ah, thank goodness!
- Let's do this every round.

490
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,936
Yes.

491
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,480
Oh my gosh. I'm so relieved.

492
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,815

<i>Round two begins now.</i>

494
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,887
- Thank you so much. Let's do that again.
- Yes, thank you so much.

495
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,331
- Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
- Yes, thank you.

496
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,684
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

497
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,044
- An answer!
- Thanks everyone, for being honest.

498
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,379
I feel very relieved.

499
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,841
I keep wondering
how long this is going to go on for.

500
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,720
Either the Jack will start to kill,

501
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,889
or someone who's afraid of the Jack
will start to kill.

502
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,013
...stick together...

503
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:26,145
Until either or both of those things
happen, this will never end.

504
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,813
Exactly.

505
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:33,277
As long as we keep being honest
with each other, we'll be all right.

506
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,446
Or not.

507
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,531
What the fuck?

508
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,828

Tell him he's a club.

511
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,011
Looks to me
like you want another beating.

512
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,728

513
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,064

- Club!

518
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,628
Don't wait so long next time.

519
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,767
Shh!

520
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,688
Now the game is really starting.

521
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,456

522
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:11,999
Yeah.

with our group instead?

I know him.

532
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,540
- I'm so scared.
- That bully.

533
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,412
- I wonder who's gonna be next.
- Okay, great.

534
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,541
- Do you think it could be me?
- What? I don't get it.

I don't know.

536
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,503
He hit that guy.

537
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,546
Lo... look. Someone's missing.

538
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,108
- That big dumb guy, right?
- Is that right?

539
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,467
Yes, yes, it was him, yes.

540
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,220
- Remember, we're a team.
- Yeah.

541
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,481
If we keep
telling the truth, then...

542

- It was me.
- ...everyone will be okay.

543

Hey.

544
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,102
...what his suit was, that's all...

545
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,647
That guy must be the Jack.

546
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,482
Yeah, I know.

547
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:02,277
- He lied to that big bully and killed him.
- Someone has to...

548
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,697
- Okay, we stay together.
- I don't know who to trust.

549
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,034
I think we'd better kill him next turn.

550
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,786
- What do you think?
- What?

551
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,206
- You tell me...
- Are you saying...

552
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,751
- ...trust each other...
- ...we should lie to him?

553
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,955
- How are we supposed to know?
- What...

554
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,296
Of course.

555
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,049
He's definitely the Jack.

556
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,510
And if not, he's still dangerous.

557
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,097
We should eliminate him
while we have the chance.

558

It seems he has a problem with how I work.

658
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,572
But...

659
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,743
If we don't get rid of him right away,
we'll all be in danger.

660
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:36,207
<i>Round nine is almost over.</i>

661
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:40,503
I think we should
eliminate her, now.

662
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,967
We're all in danger because of her.

663
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,763
We can't keep letting that psycho

664
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,515
do whatever she wants to us.

665
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,492
- This, uh... This is for you.
- Oh.

666
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:11,868
Um, here's something to drink.

667
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,453
What else did you bring me?

668
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,372
And some crackers too.

669
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,459
Oh, you have no taste.

670
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,045
I have cookies.
Would you like a cookie?

671
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,588
I hate cookies.

672
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,673
I think we should kill them both.

673
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,008
I hate chocolate.

674
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,343
What do you say?

675
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,804
What else would you like?

676
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,498
You're a spade.

677
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:00,959
Diamond.

678
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:03,878
Diamond.

679
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,713
It's spade.

680
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:07,799
Diamond.

681
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,427
Thanks, guys.

682
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,012
You're the only people I can trust now!

683
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,189
<i>Please give your answer.</i>

684
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,361
Diamond.

685
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,530
Spade!

686
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,666
URUMI AKAMAKI

687
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:42,749
MOTOHIKO KANEKO

688
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,136
Spade.

689
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,347
Club.

690
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,693
They all fell
for the Jack of Hearts' trap.

691
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,073
Once team members start killing
each other, the trust is broken,

692
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,909
and the group is destroyed.

693
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,872
Well, I don't think
that we have that problem.

694
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,456
Right.

695
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,585
You don't need to worry about that.

696
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,087
Not while I'm protecting you.

697
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,926
Thank you, master.

698
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,566
I don't think I can keep
playing this game.

699
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,278
Diamond.

700
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,995
How much longer, man?

701
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,504
It's so messed up.

702
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:15,843
I thought that...

703
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,514
people were much better than this.

704
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,269
Man, you led a charmed life.

705
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,439
I'm sorry.

706
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,568
But this is our reality now.

707
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,320
Maybe we won't get out of this alive.

708
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:40,410
But even so, all we can do for now
is help each other

709
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,705
so that we can get out of this game.

710
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,253
Okay?

711
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,006
We can do this.

712
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,137
Okay.

713
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,056
What's my symbol?

714
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:12,984
Heart.

715
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,670
I can't do it.

716
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,135
I can't.

717
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,263
I can't do this.

718
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,933
<i>Please give your answer.</i>

719
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,490
I won't do this.

720
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,038
IPPEI OKI

721
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:21,969
You were too kind for this world, Ippei.

722
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,685
Well, that's settled.

723
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,521
Seems I've lost my partner.

724
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,749
Looks like I'm screwed.
