1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,425
<i>Arisu!</i>

2
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,391
Arisu!

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,696
Arisu!

4
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,429
Aguni.

5
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,683
Hey, newbie.

6
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,063
You're alive.

7
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,358
Not by choice.

8
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,070
Saw Niragi out there.

9
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,825
So he survived too, huh?

10
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,665
And what about the others?

11
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,503
We broke off from Ann and Chishiya.

12
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,382
Kuina went to track them down.

13
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,302
Tatta didn't make it out.

14
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,642
And me, I'm... going to look for Usagi.

15
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,770
I see.

16
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,483
Where are you going?

17
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,779
I'm taking down the King of Spades.
We could use a hand.

18
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,865
How are you gonna do that?

19
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,534
He's just a man, isn't he?

20
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,786
All men have weaknesses.

21
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,497
He's too strong.

22
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,374
Yeah.

23
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,669
So it's perfect for me.

24
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,798
One last battlefield
for those of us looking to die.

25
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,842
A last battlefield?

26
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,178
I should've died in the fire at the Beach.

27
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,347
I've got nowhere to go...

28
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,391
and nowhere to be.

29
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,898
Well, I don't have a death wish yet.

30
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,907
Arisu, I have to ask.

31
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,827
What are you living for, anyway?

32
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,496
What's driving you, Arisu?

33
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,375
Do you really wanna go back to our world?

34
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,628
Or are you just running after a girl?

35
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,172
Aguni.

36
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,885
I don't need a reason to live.

37
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,851
My purpose doesn't make a difference.

38
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,438
Even if it's gone...

39
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,610
Aguni, I need to keep living.

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,366
That's a weak existence.

41
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,827
Humans wanna live, don't they?

42
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,414
I guess.

43
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,209
I'm jealous, Arisu.

44
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,947
- Wait a sec.
- Wow!

45
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,324
- Your nails are so cute.
- Adorable!

46
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,534
Where'd you get them done?

47
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,870
- This place really close to the station.
- Yo, invite them!

48
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,098
- No, you!
- Incoming.

49
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,122
Hey, hey, hey.

50
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,251
Barbecue on Sunday. Wanna come?

51
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,295
- Barbecue!
- Barbecue?

52
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,547
- You know it!
- Meat on the grill, ladies!

53
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,091
We need memories
of our last high school summer.

54
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,534
- Yeah!
- We can camp by the river.

55
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,792
- I'm sorry.
- What do you say?

56
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,888
That's the anniversary
of my mother's death.

57
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,181
Oh. Brutal.

58
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,726
We didn't know. Our bad.

59
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,688
Yeah, that's because no one knows.

60
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,898
Like I want people to hear that bitch died

61
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,319
while on a trip with someone
she was cheating with.

62
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,489
Anyway, who the hell would wanna grill
meat outside when it's this fucking hot?

63
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,700
- Wow, that was harsh.
- Seriously?

64
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,744
They just want us to grill their meat.

65
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,955
You think you got a shot with us?
What are you, idiots?

66
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,458
Aw, hey, I kinda feel bad.

67
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,168
- Was that mean?
- You're terrible.

68
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,711
Have fun with your meat!

69
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,799
What? Don't you need
to go to archery club today?

70
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,885
No, I don't feel like it.

71
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,221
Oh, so apparently,
Meg broke up with her boyfriend.

72
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,892
You're kidding. With Odaken?
They were, like, so in love.

73
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,185
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

74
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,936
Not <i>so </i>much in love.

75
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,230
- Huh?
- Huh?

76
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,858
- Do you know something?
- What are you talking about?

77
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,402
He said he was over it.

78
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,780
And then he said he was into me!

79
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,700
Wait, did you sleep with Odaken?

80
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,119
- So what? He came on to me first.
- Please!

81
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,538
- Insane.
- You knew what you were doing.

82
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:17,085
God, you <i>really </i>won't let anything
stand between you and a guy.

83
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,661
Right? She can't help herself!

84
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,131
I can't compete with this...

85
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,344
Huh?

86
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,002
PLAYERS, PLEASE GATHER
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD

87
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,507
ONE PER PERSON

88
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,126
PLEASE WAIT FOR THE GAME TO BEGIN
CURRENT TOTAL: 17 PARTICIPANTS

89
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,878
Game? What is this?

90
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,132
What's happening?

91
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,051
Where did everyone go?

92
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,431
You wanna survive, girl?

93
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,143
Then you're gonna have to beat the game.

94
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,734
<i>Difficulty, Seven of Spades.</i>

95
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,070
<i>Game, Boiling Death.</i>

00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,615
<i>Rules. Escape.</i>

<i>The game ends
when the arena fully collapses.</i>

98
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,502
Fully collapses?

99
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,806
What's... What's going on?

100
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,769
Oh! What...

101
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,149
This can't be happening.
I can't... I'm out of here!

102
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,109
I don't wanna play!

103
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,287
Come on, run!

104
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,326
It's hot! It's hot!

105
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,172
I gotta pull it out.

106
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,338
You can do it!

107
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:17,570
I know that I wasn't the best person
before. I know!

108
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:23,075
Someone sent me to this nightmare
because I wasn't good?

109
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,705
I don't deserve
to die like this!

110
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,418
It's all that bitch's fault...

111
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,447
This isn't who you are.

112
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,123
Takeru.

113
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,682
Why are you here?

114
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,812
You think working with them will help you?

115
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,652
You even bothered to save Arisu.

116
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,072
Maybe you've got death on your mind?

117
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,201
You're trying to make up for all those
people you killed

118
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,911
back at the Beach, aren't you?

119
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,501
The King of Spades isn't like you or me.
He's a mighty warrior.

120
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,463
You don't deserve to die like a hero.

121
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,348
You wanna die so damn bad?

122
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,144
You should put a bullet
through your skull.

123
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,540
Aguni.

124
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,209
We have to stop this.

125
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,921
No more innocent people have to die.

126
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,340
Too many have already.

127
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,970
All right, I get it.

128
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,723
Please just go now.

129
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,516
Are you awake?

130
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,943
Hey, are you a virgin or what?

131
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,444
No!

132
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,209
All right...

133
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,462
Um, which way to the city?

134
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,382
Huh? You're leaving already?

135
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,300
I'm looking for someone.

136
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,012
Like a girl someone, right?

137
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,972
Usagi?

138
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,891
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

139
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,269
Hmm!

140
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,694
Do you think I'm cuter than her?

141
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,445
What?

142
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,033
That sounds like a yes.

143
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,203
- No.
- Are you blushing?

144
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,371
No, I'm not.

145
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,632
You seem nice enough.

146
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,052
- Huh?
- And you're pretty cute too...

147
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,096
- All right, let's do it.
- Whoa, hang on! Hey!

148
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,851
We have to live in a world where we don't
know if we'll survive the day, you know?

149
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,437
- And besides, it's been so long...
- Get off me!

150
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,438
- Gah!
- Come on!

151
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,902
Uh...

152
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,572
This... This isn't what it looks like.
It's nothing!

153
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,866
Don't look at me like that! You...

154
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,035
You already said no, so...

155
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,495
We're on the move. Get up.

156
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,042
What? I'm not going with you.
I'm going to look for Usagi.

157
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,544
You should be worried
about yourself right now.

158
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,340
As soon as he gets us in his sights,
he's gonna attack.

159
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,801
He might even be tracking us here already.

160
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,302
I don't know.

161
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,805
But we definitely have to keep moving.

162
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,142
We'll lead him up
into the mountains somewhere.

163
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,477
Then we'll strike.

164
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,689
More people means more chances. Here.

165
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,860
Hey, wait!

166
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,198
Oh my God. He's so cool.

167
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,663
The King of Spades
is always on the move,

168
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,749
looking for more players to kill.

169
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,753
But it's not random, right?
It feels targeted.

170
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,797
I bet he's keeping tabs on us.

171
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,800
We'll find a good spot to ambush him.

172
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,225
The King of Spades is never going to stop.

173
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,936
He's already killed so many.

174
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,482
I figured we'd be safe
if we stayed out here in the woods,

175
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,276
but that didn't stop him.

176
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,951
The compass is saying
we should be near Kichijoji Station.

177
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,953
You sure?

178
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,486
Killed himself
before his visa could run out.

179
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,283
That son of a bitch didn't even fight.
He just took the coward's way out.

180
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,578
In a world like this,
can you really blame him?

181
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,541
All I know is I'll never make that choice.

182
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,171
You ever lose someone you were close to
in a game?

183
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,175
No, I haven't.

184
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,720
What I lost...

185
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,349
was an important piece of who I was.

186
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,613
<i>Akane.</i>

187
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,496
Mom?

188
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,918
What the hell are you doing here?

189
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,389
<i>Akane!</i>

190
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,694
<i>Come to me.</i>

191
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,539
Can I trust you, Mom? Huh?

192
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,864
It's not hot.

193
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,042
<i>I was the only survivor
of my first game.</i>

194
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,965
<i>My mom, that cheating bitch,
her ghost saved my life.</i>

195
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,658
The color's getting weird.

196
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,080
I'm gonna die.

197
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,623
It's gonna kill me.

198
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,503
That is some advanced gangrene.

199
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,389
That leg has to go.

200
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,224
At least, if you wanna survive.

201
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,102
You a doctor?

202
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,938
Can you help me, then?

203
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,399
What, help you for free?

204
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,110
Do you want money? How can I pay?

205
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,405
Hah! Adorable.

206
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,866
Like I have any use for money here.

207
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,993
Come on.

208
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,802
Okay, then...

209
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,600
Just do something for my leg!

210
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,067
Aah!

211
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,166
I owe a debt
to the me who survived that day.

212
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,502
I'm here because of what she did.

213
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,464
So I'll survive, no matter what the cost.

214
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,509
I'm never gonna take the easy way out.

215
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,846
I have to keep living.

216
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,235
We already looked. There's nothing.

217
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,749
If you want, help yourself.

218
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,759
Thank you.

219
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,847
He's yours?

220
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,520
I found him all alone
while I was playing tag.

221
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,190
And your parents?

222
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,200
I think they might be dead.

223
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,746
He doesn't have much time
left on his visa.

224
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,748
I couldn't leave him alone.

225
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,542
In that case,

226
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,837
even if he makes it back to our world,

227
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,548
it'll be hard.

228
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,637
His life won't be easy.

229
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,681
But

230
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:29,230
I have to believe that his parents want
their son to live and make it back safe.

231
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,152
They must want him
to find happiness there.

232
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,905
I know it.

233
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,638
Yuzuha.

234
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,682
Yeah?

235
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,184
If something happens and I disappear,

236
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,479
promise you won't be sad.

237
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,107
What are you saying?

238
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,817
It's what I want.

239
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,361
It's my dream to die in the mountains.

240
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,613
Don't say that.

241
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,200
I don't wanna die like...

242
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,537
...an old man in the hospital.

243
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,460
Ah, if the mountains kill me,

244
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,672
then that's just proof I lived well.

245
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,259
And so if that happened,

246
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,470
I want you to live
as full a life as possible.

247
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,805
To go on.

248
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,993
We must be around Yokohama right now.

249
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,431
Is this forest ever going to end?

250
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,404
We'll lure him here.

251
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,697
Here?

252
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,700
This is a cliff.

253
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,077
Nobody asked you.

254
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,546
A smoke bomb?

255
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,840
The traps warn us of incoming attacks.

256
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,676
We'll be alerted by them, even at night.

257
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,637
It's too bad we don't have any grenades.

258
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,140
Set up all the wires we have.

259
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,767
Why just use wire?

260
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,062
A trap doesn't have to be real
to be effective.

261
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,107
As long as it makes the enemy go
where you want them to go.

262
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,860
You know a lot.

263
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,362
- Sure do.
- I taught her.

264
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,490
You keep watch at the tent.

265
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,605
Was I bait for you?

266
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,231
You have a talent for it.

267
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,903
He invincible?

268
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,613
It's a bulletproof vest.

269
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,865
My guess is he's a mercenary.

270
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,618
We'll cover each other
while we lead him to the cliff.

271
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,287
Go.

272
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,834
Arisu! Run!

273
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,342
Arisu!

274
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,218
Aguni!

275
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,568
Usagi!

276
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,952
Ah!

277
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,334
I'm sorry.

278
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,361
- That's it!
- Yeah! We did it!

279
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,406
All right!

280
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,783
- All right! We did it!
- Yeah!

281
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,577
Yeah! Yeah!

282
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:15,913
We won this!

283
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,164
Run!

284
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,500
- We got this!
- I'm done!

285
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,210
- I can't do it.
- Keep going!

286
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,837
Usagi!

287
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,676
Usagi!

288
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,511
- Keep moving.
- Yeah!

289
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,865
No blaze of glory for me...

290
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,421
Go.

291
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,554
Get outta here!

292
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,476
Aguni?

293
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,495
You're all right!

294
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,907
<i>Difficulty, Jack of Spades.</i>

295
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,368
I gotta hand it
to these face card games.

296
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,245
They're not messing around.

297
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,124
Ow, that's not good.

298
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,738
They won't beat me.

299
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,802
This isn't the world I know.

300
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,128
I'm not going.

301
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,633
Do you want to die?

302
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,638
No?

303
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,057
Then let's win it together.

304
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,728
But what's going to happen to us?

305
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,401
If we win...

306
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,905
we get to go back home.

307
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,202
They're not there anymore.

308
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,955
Mom and Dad are both gone.

309
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,045
I get it.

310
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,925
What is it that you think your parents
would want you to do, Kota?

311
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,597
They'd want me to come home.

312
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,059
Then let's go.

313
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,944
And how old are you, kid?

314
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,903
I'm ten.

315
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,199
You're a good kid.

316
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,082
This is a Spade game,
and you can't have a kid here.

317
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,460
If he weighs us down,
I'll do what I have to.

318
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,213
So don't blame me.

319
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,804
Usagi has what it takes to win.

320
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,187
Arisu.

321
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,981
Usagi.

322
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,282
I knew you'd still be alive.

323
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,868
Me too.

324
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,371
But how did you know I'd be here?

325
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,583
I knew you'd try a physical game.

326
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,837
All that's left is the Queen of Spades
and the King.

327
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:17,913
And this is Kota.

328
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,332
His visa runs out today.

329
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,542
So you brought him here?

330
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:27,089
I figured that
I could help him in a Spade game.

331
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,886
What's going on?

332
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,349
<i>Game, Checkmate.</i>

333
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,267
Checkmate?

334
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:45,899
<i>Today, the Queen Team will face off
against you, the Challenger Team.</i>

335
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,778
<i>Welcome, Challenger Team.</i>

336
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,031
<i>Welcome to the arena
of beautiful bodies in motion.</i>

337
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,493
<i>I am the Queen of Spades.</i>

338
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:01,248
<i>The Queen Team is made up of four members,
including myself.</i>

339
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,251
<i>Your Challenger Team has 16 members.</i>

340
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,378
Do you think they're citizens as well?

341
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,006
<i>Each team will have a King.</i>

342
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,716
<i>Don't worry, I'll choose.</i>

343
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,218
<i>The Queen Team's King</i>

344
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,387
<i>is me.</i>

345
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,808
<i>Now, I'm looking
for a good Challenger King.</i>

346
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,352
<i>Who's it gonna be?</i>

347
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,398
<i>Oh.</i>

348
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,526
<i>I choose him.</i>

349
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,505
<i>Game rules.</i>

350
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:56,928
<i>The teams will alternate taking turns
for a total of 16 rounds.</i>

351
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,930
<i>During the Queen Team's turn,</i>

352
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:03,852
<i>the Queen Team's players
will chase the Challenger Team's players.</i>

353
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,147
<i>If the button on a player's back
is pressed,</i>

354
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,025
<i>the button's light
will turn from blue to red,</i>

355
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,693
<i>the Queen Team's color.</i>

356
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:17,282
<i>That player may not move
for the remainder of that round.</i>

357
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,992
<i>Starting on the following round,</i>

358
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:23,080
<i>that player will now be considered
a member of the Queen Team.</i>

359
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,959
<i>The King, however,
is not allowed to change teams.</i>

360
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,924
<i>The opposite will occur
during the Challenger Team's turns.</i>

361
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:37,427
<i>Each turn will last no more
than five minutes.</i>

362
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:41,515
<i>After the end of 16 rounds
of alternating turns,</i>

363
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,518
<i>the team with the most members wins.</i>

364
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,146
<i>The members of the losing team,
including the King,</i>

365
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,981
<i>will all die.</i>

366
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,275
What the hell is this?

367
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,694
It seems like

368
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,364
chess, or shogi, more like.

369
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,701
If you get tagged when they push your
button, you're captured by the enemy team.

370
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,789
You switch sides, you fight for them now.

371
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,541
That's how it works.

372
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,130
<i>Please equip your vests,
with the buttons facing the back.</i>

373
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,768
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- How do you do this?

374
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,980
Can I see yours?

375
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,113
<i>Round one.
Queen Team's turn begins.</i>

376
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,991
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

377
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,368
<i>Game start.</i>

378
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,872
Huh?

379
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,920
They're coming.
They're coming. They're coming!

380
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,840
They're coming for us!

381
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,944
They'll get us all if we stay together!
Let's split up!

382
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,011
- Yeah!
- Okay? Let's go!

383
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,137
- Come on!
- Move!

384
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,889
- We can't stay together!
- Hurry!

385
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:04,806
- Hide!
- This way!

386
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,890
- Go!
- Go, go!

387
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,606
We'll keep you safe.

388
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,816
Just stay right here, okay?

389
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,195
- Okay.
- Usagi, come on.

390
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,751
Go, go! Hurry! Go, go!

391
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,961
Go!

392
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,255
- No, they're here!
- Go back, go back! Run!

393
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,216
Left! This way!

394
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,678
- Keep running! They're here!
- Run, run, run!

395
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,513
No, out of the way! Out of the way!

396
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,110
Oh no!

397
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:16,044
Pushing the button gives you
a little shock. I should have said.

398
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:19,297
But don't worry,
you're gonna be my pawn next turn.

399
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,020
- Where?
- They went that way.

400
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,016
Up! There's one up!

401
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,143
Run!

402
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,722
<i>The first turn
is ending in ten seconds.</i>

403
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,850
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

404
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,102
<i>- seven, six...</i>
- This is bad.

405
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,705
<i>- ...five...</i>
- Look at all the red.

406
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,689
<i>- ...four, three...
- </i>But at least her turn is up.

407
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,024
<i>...two, one.</i>

408
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,444
<i>Starting the Challengers' turn.</i>

409
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,240
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

410
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,742
<i>Turn start.</i>

411
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,244
Let's get back the ones we lost.

412
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,581
Besides, it's not like the new pawns
are gonna wanna work for her.

413
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,082
They'll wanna rejoin us, right?

414
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,543
- Right.
- Yeah. Okay. Let's go!

415
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,758
Hey! Hey! Over here!

416
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,925
Up here! Up here!

417
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,887
Hey! Come on! Get up here. Help! Help!

418
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,096
You gotta tag me back!

419
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,973
- Okay, hang on!
- Hurry!

420
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,684
- Don't move!
- Hurry up! Hurry!

421
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:02,816
Up here!

422
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,362
Huh? Whoa!

423
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,030
Here, thanks!

424
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,878
What's she doing to him?

425
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,838
She's stopping him from tagging.

426
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:27,217
Of course. The rules
didn't mention anything about that.

427
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,428
<i>Round three.</i>

428
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,056
<i>Queen Team's turn begins.</i>

429
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,226
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

430
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,103
<i>Turn start.</i>

431
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,854
We're gonna have to split up.

432
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,898
Get each player back one by one.

433
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,609
If we split up,
maybe we won't find each other again.

434
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,985
I'm not losing you.

435
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,369
After each turn,
there's a siren that goes off.

436
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,453
Yeah...

437
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:02,502
When it does, come to this side.
We'll be able to check on each other.

438
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,379
Right. Got it.

439
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,905
No! Please!

440
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,241
Stay back! Stop!

441
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,210
You wanna live or not?

442
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,920
I wanna live.

443
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,966
Then you're gonna have to play on my team.

444
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,012
<i>Turn five.
One minute remaining.</i>

445
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,856
No, stop!

446
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,320
You... you get back here! Stop running!

447
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,488
Damn it!

448
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:15,532
That's it...

449
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,279
Ah! Got you! Yes!

450
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:02,914
<i>Round ten.
Challenger Team's turn begins.</i>

451
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,333
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

452
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,210
<i>Turn start.</i>

453
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:08,962
Let me help you!

454
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,677
Wait! Wait. Hang on!

455
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,652
<i>Round 11.</i>

456
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,196
<i>Queen Team's turn begins.</i>

457
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,865
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

458
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,867
<i>Turn start.</i>

459
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,619
- You okay?
<i>- </i>Okay!

460
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,917
- Go, run!
<i>- </i>Hurry up! It'll be the next turn soon!

461
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,420
- Got you! Hah! Loser!
- Oh, no!

462
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,236
Join us on the Queen's Team.

463
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,031
What? What do you mean?

464
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:23,286
If you stay in this arena,
you don't have to play the other games.

465
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:26,706
King of Spades can't kill you either,
if you're in here.

466
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,583
That's not bad, huh?

467
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,711
Wait, you're players too?

468
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,172
- Just players like us?
- Sure we are.

469
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,634
We played this game last time
and won by sticking with the Queen.

470
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,429
She's strong, man. She never loses.

471
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,848
Plus if we win, we get to stay right here.

472
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:48,561
So if the Queen never loses,
then her team gets to keep playing.

473
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,645
You get it?

474
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,233
The Queen's team gets to survive
in this place as long as they want.

475
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,196
Pretty cool, wouldn't you say, man?

476
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,759
- Found anyone else?
- No, not yet.

477
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,344
Let's look upstairs.

478
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,388
Oh, shit.

479
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,771
It's not so bad, right?

480
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,899
At least we don't have to die
in some other game.

481
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,110
Yeah.

482
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,364
Yeah, boys!
It's easy if we all work together now!

483
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,950
Protect the Queen
and protect your own lives, all right?

484
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,035
Yeah.

485
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,459
I feel bad for the kid.

486
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,378
But it's him or us, right?

487
01:01:56,587 --> 01:02:00,007
Exactly. There's nothing
we can do about it now.

488
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,011
There's only three of them left.

489
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,890
Victory is in sight.

490
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:11,102
And best of all, none of you have to die.

491
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,356
- Oh!
- But listen.

492
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:18,818
I wanna get one more of them.

493
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,194
One more? Which one?

494
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,072
The guy who knew the girl and the kid.

495
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,743
Oh yeah. Arisu or something.

496
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,787
Yeah, exactly.

497
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,461
I want him.

498
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:44,177
<i>Two more people
until checkmate. Turn 13.</i>

499
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,512
<i>Starting Queen's turn.</i>

500
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,973
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

501
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,892
<i>Turn, start.</i>

502
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,813
There he is!

503
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,710
Go, run!

504
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,003
She's after you.

505
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:20,921
What?
