1
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,478
<i>Drop that!</i>

2
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,397
<i>- Go, go, go.</i>
- Go, go, go!

3
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,485
<i>Code five!</i>

4
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,865
Son, you'll be late for the interview.

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,246
Is killing people in a game
really fun for you?

6
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,417
Shit!

7
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,587
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

8
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,023
Come on! Up the stairs! We can make it!

9
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,567
Come on, run!

10
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,492
Come on! Over...

11
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,043
13 MINUTES AGO

12
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,101
None of the games have started yet.

13
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,479
Maybe we still have time.

14
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,024
Or they forgot
to push the big red start button.

15
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,277
They didn't even tell us
about the rules for this one.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,127
What is it?

17
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,965
I hear something.

18
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,160
They're alive. Beach people.

19
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,732
What is this?

20
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,151
What are you doing here?

21
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,611
We saw the blimps show up.

22
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,614
There are rumors
that the next stage is starting.

23
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,365
Right...

24
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,326
Here's the thing...

25
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,454
Huh?

26
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,625
Oh God!

27
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,768
A rifle.

28
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,312
- What's happening?
- Get moving.

29
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,712
Run to the car!

30
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,797
That thing's an anti-tank rifle.

31
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,012
- So I'd forget about hiding behind a car.
- What the hell?

32
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,597
Where's it coming from?

33
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,016
Run! Run!

34
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,540
- Does this mean the game's started?
- I don't know.

35
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,982
Did they give us any rules?

36
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,568
Without rules,
this is just a massacre!

37
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,657
That rifle can kill from a kilometer away.

38
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,328
Damn it, I recognize that sound.

39
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,205
Now we've got an assault rifle.

40
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,165
We have no idea how many there are.

41
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,334
Other players are starting
to group together.

42
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,646
- Could be more than one shooter.
- Getting closer!

43
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,297
I had no idea
so many players were still alive.

44
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,548
Run!

45
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,467
They're almost here.

46
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,844
We have to go!

47
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,471
- Come on!
- Help me!

48
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,851
Let's go!

49
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,647
Arisu!

50
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,899
This is bad!

51
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,318
We need to split up!

52
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,755
<i>Kill, kill, kill, kill!
Go, go, go!</i>

53
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,633
Go! Come on!

54
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,453
Arisu! Over here!

55
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,775
Aah!

56
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,946
Hey.
You skip your interview again?

57
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,116
If only reality could be reset.

58
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,416
Arisu!

59
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,193
Are you trying to get killed out there?

60
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,613
Where are they shooting from, anyway?

61
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,872
Huh. He must be the King of Spades.

62
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,942
Take this. A good luck charm.

63
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,820
An explosive? You made this?

64
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,489
Just use it if you have to.

65
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,493
Arisu! Now's our chance!

66
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,163
Let's go!

67
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,710
- Arisu?
- He's still alive!

68
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,047
Hey! You okay?

69
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,810
The King of Spades is here.

70
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,940
Come on!

71
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,609
Hang in there! Get up!

72
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,207
You all right, huh?

73
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,507
Hey! You two okay? You hurt?

74
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,220
Go! Go! Run!

75
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,225
The King of Spades is

76
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,061
just one guy.

77
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,232
We're pinned down here!

78
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,109
If we step out, he'll get us!

79
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,862
Huh?

80
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,370
Get in!

81
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,371
Tatta!

82
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,081
- Don't just stand there!
- Ann!

83
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,921
Run, Chishiya!

84
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,468
That's bad. Get going!

85
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,594
- Drive!
- Okay!

86
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,138
Chishiya!

87
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,239
Okay! We're safe for now.

88
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,116
You think Chishiya's okay?

89
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,660
He can take care of himself.

90
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,997
What kind of game is this, guys?
No rules. I mean, we didn't even register.

91
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,958
- We just take the bad guys down, right?
- And how many are there?

92
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,377
There's just the one.

93
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,421
There's only one King of Spades.

94
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,257
He's like the boss
of the physical challenges.

95
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,928
During the attack,
the blimp was flying around.

96
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,181
Maybe the battlefield
spans the whole city this time.

97
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,558
How are we supposed to fight them
without a weapon?

98
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,436
This next stage,
they really leveled up, huh?

99
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,272
The next stage.

100
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,444
<i>Let's have some fun! All of us together!</i>

101
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,863
I mean, who is Mira? Is she human?

102
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,615
I don't know.

103
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,077
All I can say
is she might be one of the game masters.

104
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,496
Mira? Game master?

105
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,998
If we're right about the King of Spades,

106
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,460
it's possible each suit has its own
game master at the top.

107
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,506
We defeat all four,
we complete the next stage.

108
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,507
We beat the bosses.

109
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,718
Then what?

110
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,010
We get to go home?

111
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,931
I'm not sure yet.

112
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,684
But that's our best chance to survive.

113
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,026
Where are you even taking us, man?

114
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,904
What? I'm following that car in front.

115
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,366
- What? Is that a good idea? Who are they?
- Where should we go, then?

116
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,703
Let's just be cool.
We escaped from the game and we're fine.

117
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,747
That was not a game, Yui!

118
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,250
What? We need a plan so we can win.

119
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,418
We can't run away.

120
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,463
That's not a bad idea. We've still got
plenty of days on our visas.

121
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,547
That's true.

122
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,633
- We hide until one of the others wins.
- Ooh! Yeah.

123
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,194
Just because
we get through all the face cards safely,

124
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,362
that doesn't mean we get to go back home.

125
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,866
You don't believe
Hatter's bullshit now, do you?

126
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,953
Yeah, but the next stage did start after
we got 40 different cards, like he said.

127
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,124
<i>None of us knew
what was going on when we got here.</i>

128
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,545
<i>We figured out that winning games extended
our visas by the number of days on a card.</i>

129
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,215
<i>If our visas run out,
we're killed by a laser.</i>

130
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,050
<i>According to Hatter,</i>

131
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,930
<i>collecting a whole deck of cards
would allow us to return home.</i>

132
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,058
The rules at least make sense.

133
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,852
You just want it to be true.

134
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,563
No, it's more than that.
There's a pattern.

135
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,651
It seemed crazy,
but there were always rules.

136
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,830
Hey, there's some Beach guys there.

137
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,584
Tatta! Go!

138
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,919
Aah! Hold on!

139
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,379
Tatta!

140
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,108
Hey! Tatta! Drive better!

141
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,734
I can't!

142
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,323
Let me drive now.

143
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,033
- Eh?
- Now! Move!

144
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,785
- Hey, careful. Shit!
- Move!

145
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,456
Hang on.

146
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,007
He's not there!

147
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,134
Hey. Nice one!

148
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,056
He's still there!

149
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,833
Hey, Ann! Where are you taking us?

150
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,516
Oh, shit!

151
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,470
Hey, you guys okay?

152
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,681
Holy shit! Did you see that?

153
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,060
Anyone get hurt?

154
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,811
Yeah, I twisted my neck.

155
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,772
I broke a nail.

156
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,190
Oh shit...

157
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,248
Run!

158
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,755
They're...

159
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,803
I can't do this!

160
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,764
- I can't!
- If you stay here, you'll die. Come on.

161
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,850
Even if I keep running,
there's always gonna be more!

162
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,310
I can't do it!

163
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,521
I don't hear any more gunfire.
We should be safe for a while.

164
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,525
- We can hide here.
- Good.

165
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,235
I hope Chishiya's okay.

166
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,653
And Ann, too.

167
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:18,574
Oh, I'm sure they're fine.
I mean, they're, like, super smart.

168
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,657
You're right.

169
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,326
If we're staying here,

170
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,246
we'll have to go out
and scavenge some supplies.

171
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,330
Water, food.

172
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,914
Mm-hmm.

173
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,460
Oh man, this sucks. Do we have to, though?

174
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,339
The longer we wait,
the more likely it is that he'll show up.

175
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,884
Let's go find some food.

176
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,429
And I'll... I'll go find us a ride.

177
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,556
Coming with me?

178
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,682
What?

179
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,893
Well, there's a place near here.

180
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,769
Okay, fine.

181
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,526
We won't be long.
You'd better bring back something good.

182
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,028
- We will.
- Here.

183
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,237
Oh, cool.

184
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,740
- Okay, let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

185
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,326
Let me guess. You've never had
a hot girl on your arm before?

186
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,703
- Come on.
- Sure I have. Shut up!

187
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,130
Okay, this is the spot.
Nice, right?

188
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,175
Yeah, nice.
Lots of old cars. Cool.

189
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,552
Hey!
They're not old, they're classic.

190
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,887
Who cares?

191
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,853
Wait. Are you kidding me?

192
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,898
Holy shit!

193
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,108
Just look at her curves! Oh!

194
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,778
Dude, don't be weird. It's just a car.

195
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,364
Whoa! Have you ever seen
something this hot?

196
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,324
That's so gross.

197
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,789
You know, I realized the other day,

198
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,875
rich people are probably the ones
who are suffering the most now.

199
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,129
Everything they built, that mattered
to them, it's all worthless now.

200
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,423
You're right.

201
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,550
I guess I'm lucky, then.

202
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,220
Don't have to worry about rent anymore.

203
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,224
Yeah, me too. No more credit card
interest payments either.

204
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,021
You know what?

205
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,862
Even with all the bills and payments,
I still want to go home.

206
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,159
Yeah, me too.

207
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,190
YAKISOBA KORE! BAN
SHORTCAKE FLAVOR

208
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,404
Cake-flavored <i>yakisoba?</i>

209
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,574
Oh, it's just like the one
in the commercial!

210
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,909
Oh, yeah!

211
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,121
What are you doing there?
You know how gross those flavors turn out?

212
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,416
Oh, I beg to differ!

213
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,876
Mm.

214
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,127
You're such a virgin.

215
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,254
Yo, that is so uncalled-for.

216
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,215
- Hey, you better eat it all.
- Oh, for sure.

217
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,859
- All of it.
- I won't have any problem.

218
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,325
- You sure?
- None. Arisu will help.

219
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,261
Come on, seriously?

220
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,232
Come on, seriously?

221
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,463
Cash or credit?

222
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,387
That's good.
I haven't heard that in a long time.

223
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,472
Here.

224
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,770
Is this stuff good?

225
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,106
Mm-hmm. I think so.

226
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,149
Hmm.

227
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,320
How many chopsticks would you like?

228
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,240
I'll take four sets, please.

229
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,491
Of course, sir.

230
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,080
Thank you very much,
and I hope you have a wonderful day.

231
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,708
What was... Your voice went up,
like, a whole octave there.

232
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,087
But it makes you wanna buy more, right?

233
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,799
Yeah, I bet a ton of guys
would have come in for you.

234
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,967
With that smile.

235
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,302
- Huh?
- Huh?

236
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,974
Hey, are you blushing?

237
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,852
No. I'm used to it.

238
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,602
Really?

239
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,406
I always wanted to work
at a convenience store.

240
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,032
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,952
The barcodes. I like scanning.

242
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,372
You know the ones
who could scan real well?

243
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,207
- I really admired them.
- Ah, yeah.

244
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,459
And here you are, sir.

245
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,589
I can't wait
to get back to our world.

246
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,385
Eating <i>yakisoba, </i>AC on full blast,

247
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,471
sitting with your best friends,

248
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,599
reading all the new manga
when they come out.

249
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,613
Stop doin' that, man.

250
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,740
- Creepy smiling makes me wanna hurl.
- Mmm, mmm.

251
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,575
Yeah, stop.

252
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,912
- Look at this right here. See?
- Huh? Hm.

253
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,165
The look on her face.
Her breasts, are you seeing them?

254
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,458
She's a total ten, bro!

255
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:05,378
<i>Manga </i>magazines should be
about the <i>manga, </i>not the models.

256
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,223
- That's not true.
- What are you talking about? Let me check.

257
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,195
- You see? She's hot.
- You hearing this?

258
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,428
- Karube.
- What was that?

259
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,572
- Check it out.
- Good stuff.

260
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,764
- What?
- Look, here.

261
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,847
- You see?
- Arisu.

262
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,393
You keep saying stupid shit like this,
you'll catch the virgin.

263
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,020
- Wait, what?
- Oh, no, not the virgin!

264
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,980
- Virgin isn't a disease!
- Oh, no!

265
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,666
- Damn, you've got it now!
- I guess I did.

266
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,210
- Wait! I'm already a virgin!
- Oh shit!

267
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,194
- Oh, now we're teaming up!
- I'm gonna get you...

268
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,785
Man, those were some good times.

269
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,459
Usagi...

270
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,048
We're gonna make it back to our world.

271
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,141
What's wrong?

272
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:16,533
KENICHIRO SHIBASAKI ATTEMPTS SUICIDE

00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,522

Uh, what is it?

290
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,545
Arisu...

291
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,884
Did you really love your life so much?

292
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,093
Huh?

293
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,643
I lost my dad...

294
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,565
right before all this.

295
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,489
They called him a liar.

296
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,787
They harassed him too,
never left him alone.

297
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,915
He went for a climb.

298
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,380
And he never came back.

299
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,508
That was the last I heard.

300
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,684
But he'd been out so many times.

301
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,524
And it wasn't a tough mountain at all.

302
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,153
It's impossible,
that's what I told myself.

303
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,406
But now...

304
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,202
After living here, I understand.

305
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,708
He hated this world.

306
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,671
And he wanted...

307
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,468
He hoped he could find a different one.

308
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,516
I never thought about that before.

309
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,231
And that's...

310
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,818
That's how I feel, too.

311
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,865
I didn't realize
how much I hated our world.

312
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,537
If we went back, I'd still hate it there.

313
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,505
I'm sorry. I<i>...</i>

314
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,968
Getting back is something
everyone else wants.

315
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,936
Usagi.

316
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,691
I know how you feel.

317
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,485
I do.

318
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,033
I hated so much of my life.

319
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,160
The world was shit.

320
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,121
But now, I don't know.

321
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,582
Since coming here,

322
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,710
I wanna try again.

323
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,589
I wanna be a better person.

324
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,722
I'll protect you.

325
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,808
I'll do whatever it takes.

326
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,394
Let's go back together.

327
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,076
I'm sorry.

328
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,040
Everyone says it, Arisu.

329
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,293
That they know how I feel.

330
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,130
That I should just forget the past
and be happy.

331
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,348
But it's not so easy
to forget.

332
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,018
Even you...

333
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,982
I don't know
what you've been through either.

334
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,865
If someone understands me or not,
it doesn't make a difference.

335
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,535
It's just...

336
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,417
if somebody gave me the chance
to go back there...

337
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,212
to that world...

338
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,512
I really don't think that I would.

339
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,016
Staying here won't change that.

340
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,434
Usagi...

341
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,865
We should go.

342
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,035
Everyone's waiting.

343
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,909
Hey, hey! Arisu! Usagi! Get in!

344
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,972
- We're exposed in this thing.
- It's the only one I could start.

345
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,666
You are such a liar.
I watched you fall in love with it.

346
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,417
It was so gross the way you felt it up.

347
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,782
- Said it was sexy...
- I said I liked its curves.

348
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,522
Dude, that's so gross.

349
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,049
What do you mean, gross?
I like the car.

350
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,136
Get in.

351
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,894
Arisu?

352
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,854
Uh, yeah.

353
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,088
<i>The King of Spades
is getting closer.</i>

354
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,593
It's just like you said.
His arena is the whole city.

355
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,932
That's not good.
We gotta stay ahead of him, keep running.

356
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,271
There's another way
we can stay off his radar.

357
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,022
What's that?

358
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,443
There's other games we can join, right?

359
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:31,943
Huh?

360
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,032
Put yourself in their shoes for a sec.

361
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,160
I wouldn't want my game interfered with.

362
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,622
So they have some kind of agreement,
is that it?

363
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,125
Don't interfere with each other,
be polite.

364
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:51,380
Each game so far has had rules.
Very strict rules.

365
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,217
If another game got mixed in,

366
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,803
it would completely ruin it.

367
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,930
But, like...

368
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,016
What if I don't wanna play anymore?

369
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,104
We were forced into
the King of Spades' game, like it or not.

370
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,731
We can keep hiding, sure.

371
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,150
But eventually, he'll find us and kill us,

372
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,986
or our visas will run out,
and then, pyeow!

373
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,405
If we keep playing, though,

374
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,242
we'll be able to get more information.

375
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,078
Find out from the game masters
what this place is.

376
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,455
Or why we're here.

377
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,625
We need more answers.

378
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,587
Or everyone else died for nothing.

379
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,767
Why don't we vote on it?

380
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,980
I'm with Arisu on this.

381
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,692
Oh shit.

382
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,529
All right. Count me in.

383
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,197
Usagi?

384
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,620
It's majority rules.

385
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,581
You have your answer.

386
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,044
So, which game first? What do you think?

387
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,386
The furthest one we can see
is here, along the harbor.

388
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,680
The King of Clubs.

389
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,184
You're picking a King? You're joking?

390
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,353
A King would probably
have more key information.

391
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,856
You've got guts, Arisu.

392
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:35,610
And besides,
Club games are about teamwork.

393
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,446
So we'll have a chance to win.

394
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,491
- With this group, for sure!
- Ah! Yeah!

395
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,076
I'm not counting you in that.

396
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,120
- Hey!
- Kidding!

397
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,405
What's that?

398
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,004
NO WEAPONS ALLOWED

399
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,048
PARTICIPANTS: FIVE PLAYERS
PLEASE PUT ON BRACELETS AND WAIT

400
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,174
Bracelets?

401
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,803
It says we need five players.

402
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,805
But there's only four.

403
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,809
Five, actually.

404
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,232
Niragi?

405
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,109
It's been a while.

406
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,655
What?

407
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,365
You're still alive?

408
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,495
Team up with him? I don't think so.

409
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,081
He'll sabotage us, for sure.

410
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,918
I bet he's already got
a plan to screw us over.

411
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,254
The bracelet's not comin' off now.

412
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,925
All I wanna do is enjoy the game.

413
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,763
If you're not interested in playin',

414
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,599
you'd better get outta here, huh?

415
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,688
Usagi?

416
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,566
I don't care what he wants.

417
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,825
If we don't join the game,

418
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,786
we'll be gunned down.

419
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,914
And that's it.

420
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,418
I'd rather fight here
than die like an animal.

421
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,924
Me too.

422
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,430
I wanna know why.

423
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,574
You two are idiots.

424
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,452
Don't say I didn't warn you.

425
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,251
Hey, don't slow us down.

426
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,754
This game is about working together.

427
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,509
And I'm pretty sure you're the slow one.

428
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,145
<i>Registration is now closed.</i>

429
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,397
<i>The game will now commence.</i>

430
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,589
What is this place?

431
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,389
<i>The King of Club's team
is now entering the field.</i>

432
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,496
Welcome...

433
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,375
to our game field.

434
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,128
I am the King of Clubs,

435
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,464
Kyuma.

436
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,309
- Uh...
- Uh...

437
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:48,107
Okay, let me introduce everyone.

438
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,109
First we have Shitara.

439
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,281
Uta.

440
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,740
Maki.

441
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,160
Goken.

442
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,581
Pleasure.

443
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,087
That's all the reaction I get?

444
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,423
I think you're weirding them out.

445
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,924
Put some damn pants on.

446
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,260
What? Not a chance!

447
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,929
Nudism is an upstanding practice.

448
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,682
A social movement
with hundreds of years of history!

449
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,436
Clothing is a social construct.

450
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,688
No biological necessity.

451
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,066
Humans should be bare and raw.

452
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,152
After all, it's only natural.

453
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,363
What's the deal with this guy?

454
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,950
So this is the King of Clubs?

455
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,869
Out of his damn mind.

456
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:47,333
Listen, we don't care about that.
Just tell us who you are.

457
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,629
Who are we?

458
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,548
We are the citizens of this country.

459
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,677
Citizens?

460
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,263
Sure. Citizens.
