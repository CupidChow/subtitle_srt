1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>Round 13.
Three minutes remaining.</i>

2
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,567
I don't want you.

3
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,390
Damn it!

4
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,149
<i>There are two players
remaining until checkmate.</i>

5
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,946
Miss?

6
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,082
Nobody cared
about saving that kid.

7
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,877
When given the option,
they sided with the Queen.

8
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,676
They'll do whatever it takes not to die.
It's a fact.

9
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,180
Nobody wants to see a child be killed.

10
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,642
But in the end,
everyone wants to save their own skin.

11
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,103
Each and every human being is that way.

12
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,898
Then I guess...

13
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,236
you've never met somebody

14
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,573
that you really cared about.

15
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,375
Fucking hypocrites like you
make me wanna throw up.

16
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,008
If you really cared
about this kid so much,

17
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,635
you'd die with him.

18
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,348
But something tells me
you'll change your mind soon.

19
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,601
You will.

20
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,406
Are you okay?

21
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,118
I promise

22
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,040
I won't stop protecting you.

23
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,671
<i>Round 14.
Challenger Team's turn beginning.</i>

24
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,008
<i>This turn will last five minutes.</i>

25
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,470
<i>Turn, start.</i>

26
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,586
Usagi!

27
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,046
Stay where you are!

28
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,931
- You okay?
- I have an idea.

29
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,099
Follow me.

30
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,815
Ow!

31
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,874
You all right?

32
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,292
Did you see them?

33
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,170
Okay, there isn't much time
left on the clock, so we have to...

34
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,379
Run!

35
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,224
Usagi. We need to capture five more.

36
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,143
I saw people upstairs. Let's go!

37
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,226
Wait!

38
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,438
Let's go! Come on, Usagi.

39
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,521
Wait.

40
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,948
You guys...

41
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,702
Do you really wanna
keep working for the Queen?

42
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,747
Yeah, of course we do.

43
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,874
We don't wanna die.

44
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,086
If we keep playing for the Queen's side
and we win,

45
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,712
then we can stay right here.

46
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,216
If we're in this arena,
we don't need to play anything else.

47
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,760
No getting hunted down or shot.

48
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,722
You've gotta be kidding me.
Winning isn't the most important thing!

49
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,808
Right now? Yeah. Yeah, it is.

50
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,895
No. You're wrong about that.

51
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,607
Listen.

52
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,904
The most important thing
isn't just winning the game!

53
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,826
It's getting back to our world.

54
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,416
If all you really care about is winning,

55
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,377
then sure, you're doing everything right.

56
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,631
You're protected by the Queen,
and you can live in this world forever.

57
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,802
But is that what you want?

58
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,098
If our side wins, we can beat the Queen.

59
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,725
If we beat every single face card game,

60
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,270
then there's a chance...

61
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,480
a chance we can get back home again.

62
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,237
There's no going back there.
Ever.

63
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,073
That world's all over.

64
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,993
It's just over.

65
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,621
These games have rules,
just like the rest.

66
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,834
The face card guys,
if they lose, they get killed.

67
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,003
Just like us.

68
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,629
Which means if we beat them,

69
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,007
then there won't be anyone else.

70
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,427
This will all end
if we win every face card game.

71
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,722
That's just a guess, man,
and nothing more.

72
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,891
Yeah, a guess.

73
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,850
And hope.

74
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,563
Maybe hope is what we need to survive.

75
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,398
I won't give up.

76
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,777
Sure, you can extend
your lives here with the Queen.

77
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,863
But what does that mean?

78
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,826
Y... you're spending the rest of your lives
killing each other.

79
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,706
That's not a life.

80
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,794
Why don't you take a chance with us?

81
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,512
This place
isn't that different from our world.

82
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,850
You guys want to go back
to our world so badly?

83
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,062
That place sucked.

84
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,148
Maybe...

85
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,152
Maybe this one'll be better.

86
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,540
Yeah.

87
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,126
I thought the same until recently.

88
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,506
Going back might not be all that great.

89
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:13,970
But you know...

90
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,558
I want to go back, I really do.

91
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,606
I wanna make it back to our world.

92
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,988
For all the pain and heartache
I lived with,

93
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,117
I was born and raised there.

94
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,371
And it made me who I am today.

95
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,499
I miss that world.

96
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,590
At times, it was unbearably lonely.

97
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,221
But I believe it taught me kindness.

98
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,974
That life that I had...

99
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,978
I'm kind here because it made me that way.

100
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,985
This world makes kindness easy to forget.

101
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,536
I want to return.

102
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,291
I want to give that life another shot.

103
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,474
I...

104
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,311
I wanna go back.

105
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,398
I do.

106
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,862
I want to return and see

107
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,323
my family.

108
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,717
Do you think...

109
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,388
Could I start over?

110
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,603
<i>Two turns remaining.</i>

111
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,440
<i>Round 15 is the final one
for the Queen Team.</i>

112
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,193
<i>This turn will last five minutes.</i>

113
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,487
<i>Turn, start.</i>

114
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,807
They have 14 on their side?

115
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,435
We need to get back five people
for a majority.

116
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,270
How do we do that in just one turn?

117
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,564
The other side can win just by running.

118
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,734
Okay, then.
We chase and catch them one by one.

119
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,651
Wait.

120
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,951
There's one more option.

121
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,043
I want that guy on our side
before the game's over.

122
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,546
And the woman?

123
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,800
I don't want her.

124
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,597
Let's teach her that fake virtues
have no place in this world.

125
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,017
- Aah!
- Let's go!

126
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,815
Come here!

127
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,403
Stop running!

128
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,866
Okay. Run!

129
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,336
Down there!

130
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,547
Stop running!

131
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,850
We don't need you. Move!

132
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,231
After her!

133
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,321
- This way!
- All right!

134
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,208
You, upstairs!

135
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,708
Run.

136
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,298
Over there!

137
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,386
Found him!

138
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,471
Woo-hoo!

139
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,556
Faster!

140
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,405
<i>Round 15 is ending shortly.</i>

141

<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

142
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,344
Grab him!

143
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,770
<i>Final turn, start.</i>

144
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,688
Go!

145
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,406
Arisu!

146
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,536
They went that way!

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,960
Get him!

148
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,378
- Oh! Oh!
- We did it! Yeah!

149
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,505
- I can't believe it!
- Fuck, yeah!

150
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,029
- Yeah!
- Yes!

151
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,280
We won!

152
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,741
- This is incredible!
- We won!

153
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,120
Yeah, we did so great!

154
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,414
We pulled through!

155
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,582
- Yes!
- We showed them!

156
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,334
- We did it. We won.
- Yes!

157
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,087
- Oh yes!
- That was so bad!

158
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,256
- We pulled through. You pulled through!
- No, you were great!

159
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,593
- Great! Well done! Well done!
- Yes!

160
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,106
I don't know
how you convinced everyone.

161
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,900
But congratulations,

162
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,860
Miss Goody Two-Shoes.

163
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,155
When I go back,

164
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,367
I'm not going to be alone.

165
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,661
I'm leaving with my friends.

166
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,122
They matter.

167
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,625
That's what you think?

168
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,255
You have way more freedom here, you know.

169
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:51,385
This place is much more my scene
than that rigid world.

170
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,096
You were players, weren't you?

171
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,808
You were brought here to play,
just like us.

172
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,560
You had to play the games.

173
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,812
Well, am I wrong?

174
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,818
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

175
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,487
- Once the games are done.
- Not before then?

176
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,033
What'll we learn when they're all over?

177
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,495
First you clear all the face cards.

178
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,123
Then you'll know everything.

179
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,792
Will we learn where we are?

180
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,961
Can we go back to our world?

181
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,508
You'll have to wait and find out, baby.

182
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,928
<i>- Time is up.</i>
- Hey!

183
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,224
<i>It is game over for everyone
on the Queen's Team.</i>

184
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,562
I wanna live free until my last breath.

185
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,441
See you later.

186
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,243
I want to finish these games.

187
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,829
I want the answer.

188
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,166
But more than that...

189
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,129
I wanna go back to our world.

190
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,341
Both of us together.

191
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,682
So do I.

192
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,362
Hey, look.

193
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,790
That smell...

194
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,084
Did you fart?

195
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,920
Of course not!

196
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,174
Hot!

197
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,929
Wow!

198
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,139
It's a hot spring!

199
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,641
There's a hot spring!

200
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,685
Usagi! Look!

201
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,979
- It's really a hot spring!
- Oh...

202
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,774
The water's perfect over here!

203
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,068
Really? Then let's get in!

204
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,905
When's the last time we took a bath?
We can't pass this up!

205
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,324
- Huh? Together?
- Huh...

206
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,285
Huh? Oh...

207
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,975
I could die right now and I'd be happy.

208
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,689
I just wish that...

209
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,693
the painful memories washed away
as easily as dirt.

210
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,863
Yeah, I know.

211
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,537
What's wrong?

212
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,247
Usagi?

213
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,583
Usagi?

214
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,752
Hey!

215
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,880
Usagi?

216
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,344
That's not possible.

217
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,140
They can't be real, can they?

218
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,244
They're taking a bath too.

219
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,041
Maybe they escaped from a zoo
or something.

220
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,004
If we hadn't been brought here,

221
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,840
we'd have never seen this.

222
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,717
Yeah.

223
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,681
You know what's kind of crazy?

224
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,642
I'm feeling emotional.

225
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,771
And I'm not entirely sure why.

226
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,902
Right there with you.

227
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,630
I'm sorry. I didn't see anything!

228
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,092
Just elephants! I'm only looking at them.

229
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,260
I love elephants.

230
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,553
It's okay.

231
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,099
You can stay.

232
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,687
Found it.

233
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,751
KIMIKO KUINA
ADMITTED: JUNE 2, 2021

234
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,985
Mom, I wanna see you again.

235
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,934
This makes me sick.

236
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,105
All the work of some twisted fuck.

237
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,985
Stuff like this
makes me lose hope for humanity.

238
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,280
This person knew
they were gonna die.

239
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,409
But they fought until the very end.

240
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,122
They didn't give up hope.

241
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,105
There's still hope here.

242
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:28,016
SUPREME COURT

243
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,158
Fascinating.

244
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,078
So you were the King of Diamonds
all along.

245
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,664
The Beach executive.

246
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,833
Former Number Two.

247
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,293
Kuzuryu.

248
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,882
Why was the King of Diamonds at the Beach?

249
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,844
I was curious.

250
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,096
Undercover, then.

251
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,101
<i>Difficulty, King of Diamonds.</i>

252
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,188
<i>Game, Beauty Contest.</i>

253
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,025
Let us begin.

254
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,961
<i>Rules.
Contestants have three minutes</i>

255
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,422
<i>to choose a number between zero and 100.</i>

256
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:47,470
<i>The average of the numbers
everyone selected is multiplied by 0.8.</i>

257
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:52,183
<i>The person who chose the number
closest to that result is the winner.</i>

258
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:58,648
Multiply the average value
of what we all chose by 0.8.

259
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,778
Whoever's number
is closest to that result wins.

260
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,280
Hmm?

261
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,033
Multiply the average value by 0.8?

262
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,246
Why 0.8? What's 0.8 mean?

263
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,498
I get it.

264
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,252
Multiplying the average
by the fixed value of 0.8

265
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,004
disrupts the scale's balance.

266
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,631
That's why it's a game.

267
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,217
0.8 is a drop.

268
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,220
A single drop straight from heaven.

269
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:34,100
<i>One point will be deducted
from the four losers,</i>

270
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,603
<i>and the round is concluded.</i>

271
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:42,275
<i>When a player reaches negative ten points,
they will receive a game over.</i>

272
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,904
<i>The last player standing
will clear the game.</i>

273
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:51,326
<i>However, every time a player
is eliminated, a new rule is added.</i>

274
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,287
A new rule? What's with that?

275
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,792
And nobody's explaining these scales.

276
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,880
<i>Round one, start.</i>

277
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,270
Hmm...

278
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,880
<i>Time limit reached.</i>

279
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:51,219
<i>The average of the numbers
chosen in the first round</i>

280
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,138
<i>is 32.8.</i>

281
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,393
<i>After multiplying this value by 0.8,</i>

282
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,438
<i>the player closest to this number</i>

283
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,315
<i>is Master Kuzuryu,</i>

284
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,025
<i>the winner.</i>

285
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,742
If everyone picked 40<i>,</i>

286
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,954
then the average value

287
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,998
would be 40, of course.

288
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,750
Multiplying that by 0.8 is 32.

289
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,545
Even if everyone anticipated that
and chose 32,

290
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:29,132
multiplying the average value by 0.8
will yield a lower number.

291
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,967
So that won't work.

292
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,636
If everyone picks the same, that means

293
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,306
getting stuck in a cycle and no one wins.

294
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,393
So we can't do that. Nah.

295
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,437
Ah, I understand.

296
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,691
You just need to predict your opponents'
moves and be a few steps ahead.

297
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,111
Mmm... This feels like a heart
more than a diamond.

298
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,697
Hmm! We're reading each other.

299
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,199
Whether you play poker or chess,

300
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,619
in an intellectual game,
you have to read your opponent.

301
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,414
Not reading their minds,

302
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,916
but predicting their reasoning.

303
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,044
Wouldn't you say?

304
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,756
Huh, King?

305
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,550
Their reasoning?

306
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,892
You ignoring me?

307
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,562
What's that?

308
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,355
Water?

309
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,319
That is sulfuric acid.

310
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,530
- What?
- Oh, so you'll answer him...

311
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,868
If someone reaches
negative ten points, the scales will tip.

312
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,038
It'll melt our bodies.

313
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,833
Best case, we end up horribly disfigured.

314
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,382
Scales, well...

315
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,427
Let me guess.

316
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,471
The King of Diamonds is a lawyer.

317
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,348
At least, he used to be.

318
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,018
Yes, but that's in the past.

319
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,812
That bad, was it?

320
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,941
But even so, you selected this venue.

321
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,779
Interesting game arena, the Supreme Court.

322
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,241
This giant installation.

323
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,744
The badge a lawyer wears
represents equality and fairness.

324
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,581
All life, including yours,
is equally valuable.

325
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,459
Is that what you wanna say?

326
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,336
What you want us to understand?

327
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:36,843
The scale will always tip
to whatever side has more gold.

328
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,346
Not all life has the same value, you know.

329
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,395
<i>Round two, start.</i>

330
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,565
<i>Since 26 was the answer before,</i>

331
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,359
<i>maybe I'll multiply that by 0.8 this time?</i>

332
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,904
<i>No, everyone might be
thinking the same thing.</i>

333
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,657
<i>Ah, maybe I'll multiply it by another 0.8?</i>

334
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,785
<i>Suppose everyone chooses 100.</i>

335
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,788
<i>The product after multiplying it by 0.8
would be 80.</i>

336
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,375
<i>In order to win, picking a number
higher than 80 is pointless.</i>

337
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:13,880
<i>If 80 is the highest average we can have,
multiplying it by 0.8 is 64.</i>

338
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,968
<i>If the highest average is 64,
then multiplying that by 0.8 is 51.2.</i>

339
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,178
<i>So 51.</i>

340
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,848
<i>And we can go on and on,
getting closer and closer to zero.</i>

341
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,350
<i>The law of the stock market is to invest</i>

342
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,644
<i>in stocks that
everyone wants to invest in.</i>

343
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,981
<i>You have to predict everyone's desires.</i>

344
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,692
<i>The crux of this game
is to read a few steps ahead</i>

345
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,652
<i>of everyone else's deductions.</i>

346
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:41,824
<i>There are already equations that exist
to help read an opponent's rationality.</i>

347
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,327
<i>Time limit reached.</i>

348
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,623
<i>The average of the numbers
chosen in the second round</i>

349
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,167
<i>is 16.6.</i>

350
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,879
<i>After multiplying this value by 0.8,</i>

351
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,424
<i>the player closest to this number</i>

352
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,470
<i>is Master Kuzuryu, the winner.</i>

353
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,611
You were even closer this time.

354
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,448
<i>The number is getting smaller.</i>

355
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,617
<i>So, what, we're supposed to pick zero?</i>

356
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,205
<i>The rational conclusion
would be zero.</i>

357
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,375
<i>In other words,
everyone will pick zero in the end.</i>

358
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,546
<i>Picking zero
is the most rational choice.</i>

359
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,509
<i>But the rational limit
is different for everyone.</i>

360
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,097
Kuzuryu.

361
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,765
What?

362
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,352
I think I understand now.

363
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,480
The thing that you're trying to measure...

364
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,442
it's the value of life, isn't it?

365
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,239
No, it's not.

366
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,533
Then what are you doing?

367
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,868
You can tell me.

368
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,217
Perhaps we could propose
a new settlement figure?

369
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,930
The contaminants that the factory dumped
actually did cause environmental issues.

370
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,142
Twenty people in the surrounding community
died as a result.

371
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,477
Diseases can be caused
by many factors.

372
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,897
What proof is there
that our company is responsible?

373
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,320
I heard that you were
an extremely talented lawyer,

374
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,947
but it seems
you do not understand the law.

375
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,160
Laws don't exist
to protect the weak from the powerful.

376
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,996
Everyone is equal
in the eyes of the law, sir.

377
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,247
That is naive.

378
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,836
In order to save starving people,

379
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,381
you first need the power
to influence the world's economy.

380
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,011
Your principles are not enough to change
a world so full of contradictions.

381
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,763
Let me ask you.

382
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,936
What do you think we should do
to maintain a respectable, modern society?

383
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,608
We need a justice system.

384
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,652
A fair justice system
must exist at all levels.

385
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,863
You mentioned...

386
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,867
You mentioned the importance
of respecting the world's economy.

387
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,412
But prioritizing economic growth
will create more inequality.

388
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,705
- A wealth gap...
- No!

389
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,335
Your duty as a lawyer
isn't to make sound arguments.

390
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,712
Any fool is able to preach equality.

391
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,884
Fairness and justice have no place
in a world more full of monsters than men.

392
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,389
However, thanks to the power
of human imagination,

393
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,266
we can make an unfair argument
sound fair and just.

394
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,936
And you will do just that.

395
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,772
It is your solemn duty
that is given to you by God.

396
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,784
<i>Time limit reached.</i>

397
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,370
<i>The results of the third round.</i>

398
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,707
100?

399
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,794
<i>The average of the numbers is 20.2.</i>

400
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,839
<i>After multiplying this value by 0.8,</i>

401
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,592
<i>the player closest to this number
is Master Daimon, the winner.</i>

402
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,344
Huh? I won?

403
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,428
I won?

404
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,887
Ah! Yes!

405
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,432
What's up, man?

406
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,809
Why'd you do that?

407
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,104
You picked 100.
That means you'll always lose.

408
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,107
There's a zero percent chance of winning,
don't you know?

409
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,902
I think all of you are overthinking this.

410
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,781
That kind of stuff
just gives me a headache.

411
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,367
So I blew it up.

412
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,753
Wow, you're insane.

413
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,512
<i>The winner of round six
is Master Chishiya.</i>

414
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,855
<i>The winner of round seven is...</i>

415
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,483
<i>...Master Daimon.</i>

416
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,779
Oh yeah!

417
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,707
I definitely don't wanna die like that.

418
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,671
<i>I'm at minus nine points.</i>

419
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,882
<i>If I miss any more, I die.</i>

420
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,510
<i>My formula must be foolproof.</i>

421
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:01,310
<i>What do I do? I'm so lost here.
I can't use the same strategy.</i>

422
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,396
<i>I can't make a single mistake.</i>

423
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,815
<i>The next time I lose, it's game over.</i>

424
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,110
<i>Rationally speaking,</i>

425
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,697
<i>the average
should be getting closer to zero.</i>

426
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,078
<i>I bet he predicted this outcome.</i>

427
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,967
<i>The winner of round ten is...</i>

428
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,178
<i>...Master Kuzuryu.</i>

429
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,893
<i>Two players
now have negative ten points.</i>

430
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,777
<i>It is game over
for these participants.</i>

431
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,122
- Take this off! Someone!
- I'll do anything!

432
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:08,502
Don't! Ah! Take this off!
Hey! Take this off!

433
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,628
What do you want, huh?

434
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,047
You want money? Please!

435
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,300
What can I do?

436
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,178
Please, stop this! Just stop!

437
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,442
Now, this is more like a face card game.

438
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,321
Is this the equality you're after?

439
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,034
<i>As two players were eliminated,</i>

440
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,745
<i>two new rules will be added.</i>

441
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,246
<i>Rule number one.</i>

442
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,249
<i>If two or more players choose
the same number,</i>

443
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:33,295
<i>they will be disqualified from the round
and will each lose one point.</i>

444
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,963
<i>Rule number two.</i>

445
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,924
<i>Choosing the exact correct number</i>

446
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:41,261
<i>will cause the other players
to lose two points instead of one.</i>

447
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,666
<i>Results for round 11.</i>

448
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,090
All of us picked zero?

449
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:23,303
<i>All three players picked the same number
and are disqualified from the round.</i>

450
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,764
<i>All three players lose one point.</i>

451
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,057
Huh?

452
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,518
Everyone ended up
choosing the same number.

453
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:35,023
<i>If that happens one more time,
it's game over for me.</i>

454
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,528
<i>Round 12, start.</i>

455
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,583
<i>Results for round 12.</i>

456
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,637
<i>As the winner chose
the exact correct number,</i>

457
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,475
<i>the other two players
will lose two points.</i>

458
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,103
No way.

459
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,939
No way! This can't be happening!
How did you...

460
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,401
You saw my answer, didn't you?

461
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,236
He cheated! He did!

462
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,656
You did! How else would you be able
to know which number I chose?

463
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,950
I knew it because I've been watching.

464
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,413
At the start of the last round,
you had negative eight points,

465
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,707
and I had negative nine.

466
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,795
Even if you lost,
you'd still get another chance.

467
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,672
So you took a risk,
thinking we'd eliminate each other.

468
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,468
I thought about that,
and I figured you'd pick a random number.

469
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,429
You want us to believe
you just guessed?

470
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,430
Impossible!

471
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,265
I knew what you thought we'd pick.

472
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,893
Odds are we'd choose numbers under 50.

473
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,814
<i>It's like he read my mind.</i>

474
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,235
<i>The King was up by three points before.</i>

475
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,412
<i>I couldn't catch up
if we chose the same number.</i>

476
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:22,089
<i>But I still had a chance if I could
get them to pick the same number.</i>

477
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,013
So you'd have to avoid
numbers under 50.

478
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,724
And if you were going to do that,

479
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,519
you'd have to avoid them
by a large margin.

480
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:40,941
Even so, you wouldn't pick too high.
Ninety and up is too much.

481
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,651
So over 50, under 90.

482
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:46,113
When you ask people to guess a number,
a few things come to mind.

483
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,073
Double digits, so they're out.

484
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:52,452
Same thing with nice, round numbers
divisible by ten.

485
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,039
When you put someone on the spot
and ask them to choose a number,

486
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,417
they'll usually go for eights,
threes and fives,

487
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,544
and some of those are prime.

488
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,170
You'd try not to pick them.

489
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,214
Not too many options left now.

490
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,884
How do we narrow the list further?

491
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,386
Some of these numbers we see every day.

492
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,221
Game systems,

493
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,432
movie titles,

494
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,850
brand logos.

495
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,977
Easy associations.

496
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,814
By my count, that just leaves 62 and 74.

497
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,649
No way to narrow it down.

498
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,527
So I... Well,

499
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,946
I got lucky.

500
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,784
I knew
I shouldn't have picked 74.

501
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:38,290
<i>A player now has negative ten points.</i>

502
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,962
No, no. No. No, no!

503
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,631
No! No, no!

504
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:46,798
Don't!

505
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,050
Please! Just let me go.

506
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,218
I'll do anything! Let me go! Let me go!

507
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,803
No!

508
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,611
Well...

509
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,158
She said that not all lives

510
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,369
have the same value.

511
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,122
Think she still believed it?

512
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,750
Up until the bitter end?

513
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,089
Tell me...

514
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,344
Have you ever peered behind the curtain,
seen how the world really works?

515
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:39,434
Watched children die because their parents
couldn't afford a few yen for medicine?

516
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,481
Seen girls sold off
to pay for their parents' debts?

517
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:50,404
Been powerless
to break the cycle of poverty?

518
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,244
<i>A new rule is being added.</i>

519
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:02,040
<i>If a player chooses zero as their number,</i>

520
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,003
<i>the other player will win
if they choose 100.</i>

521
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,006
A-ha.

522
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,801
Since there's only two players
left in the game at this point,

523
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,721
the one who picks closer to zero

524
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,140
is inevitably going to be the winner.

525
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,225
Just math.

526
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:25,522
So if you pick zero each time, you'll win.
You're further from negative ten.

527
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,899
But this new rule changes everything.

528
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,901
I still have a chance.

529
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,946
If you choose zero,

530
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,198
I can win by choosing 100.

531
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,828
But then if you think I'll choose 100,

532
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,041
you can choose one, and you'll win.

533
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,419
Three choices.

534
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:50,255
It all comes down to three choices.

535
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,091
Zero, one, and 100.

536
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,969
Rock, paper, scissors.

537
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,976
But I've only got one point left.

538
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,104
If we tie,
that's game over for me, isn't it?

539
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,901
The stakes couldn't be higher
if you tried.

540
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,113
I get it.

541
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,618
You're desperately trying
to make this fair.

542
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,329
But why? Why bother?

543
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,000
Hypothetically,

544
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:31,004
if there were a million doses
of a vaccine for a disease,

545
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,841
which million people would you save?

546
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,762
Ahhh.

547
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,806
I see it now.

548
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,812
You don't wanna have to choose
who gets to live and who has to die.

549
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,982
You don't want to determine
the value of a life.

550
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,943
Exactly.

551
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,029
How could I weigh all the variables?

552
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,699
What makes one life worth saving

553
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,243
and one worthless?

554
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,037
How can I know?

555
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,915
So,

556
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,335
tell me what you think.

557
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,048
If you had to answer
the question put before you...

558
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:17,926
What I'd do?

559
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,178
Give 'em to kids with no parents or money.

560
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:23,932
You would?

561
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,517
I would try to do that.

562
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,645
But I wouldn't be the one to choose.

563
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:29,896
It's about money.

564
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,692
Because anyone with enough money
can choose a life's value.

565
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,445
I bet you've seen it. Am I right?

566
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,823
You've peered behind the curtain.

567
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,949
I have.

568
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,536
After an accident,
there was no settlement paid out.

569
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,373
People died when they couldn't afford
the proper treatment.

570
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,292
So you understand.

571
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,837
Why do you bother
striving for justice at all?

572
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,046
Because I must.

573
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,301
Equality is something we fight for.

574
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,995
Very good. You were great.

575
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,623
Next week is the big day.

576
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,541
You keep it up, okay?

577
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,544
Yeah.

578
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,049
Thank you.

579
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,053
Doctor, thank you so much.

580
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,846
Of course.

581
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,016
- Excuse me.
- Yes, yes.

582
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,905
Hayato's condition
is finally stable.

583
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:05,158
And that means this next surgery
should save his life.

584
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,077
Yes. About the surgery...

585
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,870
Listen.

586
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,623
There's been a change
to the transplant priority list.

587
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,917
- You've made a change?
- Yes.

588
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,840
This patient was just moved up the list.

589
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,390
The grandchild
of a good friend of the director's.

590
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,892
- And what about Hayato?
- Postponed.

591
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,311
They're important.

592
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,940
Their support keeps the hospital running.

593
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,486
We don't have a choice.

594
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,406
Medicine is all about this sort of thing.

595
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,201
Now, go inform the patient's parents.

596
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,121
But what do I say?

597
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,752
You'll think of something.
He's your patient.

598
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,389
Hayato...

599
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,319
Well...

600
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,779
Even if he got the transplant last week,

601
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,115
there was a chance
he wasn't going to make it.

602
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,370
This isn't my fault.

603
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,208
You should know by now
your ideals aren't enough to save a life.

604
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,382
That's clear.

605
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,845
I'm not gonna carry it with me, sir.

606
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,807
This is our job.

607
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,826
SAKURAZAKA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

608
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,002
PHYSICIAN
PEDIATRIC CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY

609
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,344
So, take care of it.

610
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,427
Sir.

611
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,568
How fascinating.

612
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,657
Perhaps I was brought to this place

613
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,701
so I could play this game with you.

614
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,376
I'm going to choose 100.

615
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,425
Why would you say that?

616
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,136
Just giving you some help.

617
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,805
Are you mad?

618
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,808
You can't just tell me what you'll choose.

619
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:20,103
Unless I select zero this round,
you've guaranteed your death.

620
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,692
Sitting across from you

621
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,237
is a man who is charging towards death.

622
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,115
You have to decide.

623
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,868
What value does this life hold?

624
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,745
What value does my life hold?

625
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,126
It's huge. Why bother?

626
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,465
We lost everything
when we came here.

627
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,680
To abandon our ideals would be mad.

628
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,690
Ideals?

629
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,877
Hey. Come on.

630
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,714
What are you doing? Just go.

631
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:12,924
I can't do that.

632
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,095
In the last game I played,
a young man saved my life.

633
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,848
Now it's my turn to save someone.
I have to pay it forward.

634
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,852
You're not getting left behind.

635
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,146
I'm choosing to fight for this.

636
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,110
You're choosing?

637
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,530
Now let's go.

638
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,515
<i>Time limit reached.</i>

639
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,101
<i>The winner of round 13 is...</i>

640
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,730
<i>...Master Chishiya.</i>

641
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,321
You actually selected zero?

642
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,041
<i>Round 14, start.</i>

643
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,771
<i>The winner of round 14 is Master Chishiya.</i>

644
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:04,160
That's it then, isn't it?
Only one point left each.

645
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,745
This is the last round.

646
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,170
<i>Round 15, start.</i>

647
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:20,760
So, then,

648
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:22,929
can you do it?

649
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,686
If you're finding it hard
to make your choice,

650
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,729
you can just kill me.

651
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,440
That's fair, don't you think?

652
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,403
I cannot make that decision.

653
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:42,907
Was that your aim the whole time,
Master Chishiya?

654
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,410
To make sure
that our scores ended up tied?

655
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,496
In a way.

656
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,999
I wanted to witness this.

657
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,962
I wanted to be around
for your final choice.

658
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,981
If you pick one, you win.

659
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,829
Ms. Momoka.

660
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,333
Would you answer a question for me?

661
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,087
You volunteered.

662
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,839
Someone had to be the witch.

663
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,549
But that means killing yourself.

664
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,182
Why would you do that?

665
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,769
I did it for my ideals.

666
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,026
The human heart is
a beautiful thing.

667
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,030
Human life is precious.

668
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,449
I believe that, truly.

669
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:11,204
And when I look at my life,

670
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,625
I know I've been able to survive
because of those ideals.

671
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,050
Your games and rules don't get to kill me.

672
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,013
I'm not going to die because I lost.

673
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,602
I'm doing this
to show you all that you're wrong.

674
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:39,232
They're not going to kill each other
because they're not all bad.

675
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,367
If I'm destined to die here someday...

676
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,121
then I get to choose how I walk that path.

677
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,630
<i>I'm just one man.</i>

678
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,342
<i>I don't know the value of a life.</i>

679
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,386
<i>Or the meaning of one.</i>

680
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,433
And I don't think I ever will.

681
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,603
I'll never be the one to decide that.

682
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,151
But there's one thing
I'm able to decide now.

683
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,138
<i>The final round is over.</i>

684
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,896
So you made your choice.

685
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,399
The value of a life can't be decided.

686
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,860
Tell me why you did it.

687
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,367
I did it for my ideals.

688
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,330
<i>The winner is</i>

689
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,998
<i>Master Chishiya.</i>

690
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,630
<i>A player has reached negative ten points.</i>

691
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,175
<i>It is game over for that player.</i>

692
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,557
It's nice to see
that you can actually smile.

693
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,352
I'm finally free.

694
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,025
I made my own choice.

695
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,737
And based on my own ideals.

696
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,545
It's all because of you.

697
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:22,645
At last. It's our turn.

698
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:29,567
What?

699
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,571
That doesn't excite you?

700
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:38,285
If I'm going to have a game to myself...

701
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,998
I want it to be fair.

702
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,535
You quit while you were ahead.

703
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,663
I gave you the chance to make that choice.

704
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,500
I'm so jealous of you.

705
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:08,918
GAME CLEAR
CONGRATULATIONS

706
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,812
We've almost died
a thousand times.

707
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,648
We could still die, any second.

708
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,236
I don't believe it.

709
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,823
It's a miracle we made it
as far as we have.

710
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:27,288
If it was a miracle that got us here,

711
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,083
let's take the opportunity and fight.

712
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:34,795
Me and you.

713
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,464
Yeah.

714
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,000
I'm going to make it home.

715
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,845
For the future. For the me of tomorrow.
