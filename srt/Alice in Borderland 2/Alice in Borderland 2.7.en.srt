1
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,802
Please... help. I...

2
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,566
You fucked up... your own suicide?

3
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,236
Just kill me.

4
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,780
Please.

5
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,611
Oh, did you think I was gonna
put you out of your misery?

6
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,785
Are you fuckin' stupid?

7
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,998
I'm gonna make you fucking suffer.

8
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,500
Little bitch.

9
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,602
I'm gonna make everyone wish
they'd never met me.

10
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,400
Then I'm gonna die
and go straight to hell.

11
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,817
<i>Difficulty, Queen of Clubs.</i>

12
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,862
<i>Game, Target.</i>

13
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,574
<i>Please wait until the game commences.</i>

14
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,891
Did you think I was dead?

15
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,184
No.

16
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,271
I knew that I would see you again.

17
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,605
You're too strong to die.

18
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,858
Strong, huh?

19
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,611
You know, Kuina,

20
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,948
I started wondering
if waiting for death might be easier.

21
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,784
Yeah, I had similar thoughts.

22
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,080
But at least we're both here now.

23
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,876
Clubs are team games.

24
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,920
It should be much easier
with two of us playing.

25
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,090
Just a few more games.
We'll make it to the end.

26
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,926
Huh. Mmm. I'm sure we will.

27
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,393
<i>Registration has closed.</i>

28
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,604
<i>The game will now commence.</i>

29
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,431
Don't go in!

30
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,349
Hey!

31
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,604
Fancy meeting you here.

32
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,025
- Chishiya.
- There are only two games left.

33
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,986
Players are starting to gather in Shibuya.

34
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:59,200
I had a pretty good hunch
that you were probably still alive.

35
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,709
What?

36
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,962
Is that the only thing you've gotta say?

37
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,006
So?

38
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,591
Nothing. It's just...

39
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,135
You're a lot less grumpy now.

40
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,640
Oh, less grumpy, huh?

41
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,352
Well, I've been through a hell of a lot.

42
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,941
Hey, Arisu...

43
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,903
can I share something with you

44
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,531
that I've never told anyone before?

45
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,495
Yeah.

46
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,417
Well, I...

47
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,293
Yo!

48
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,384
I thought I'd never see you again!

49
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,344
I am so fuckin' happy!

50
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,096
Niragi!

51
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,266
Did you mean to miss a vital organ?

52
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,310
I didn't want to end things
with a surprise attack.

53
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,021
So let's begin.

54
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,274
It's a new murder game.

55
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,112
Not like there's anything else
for the three of us to do here.

56
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,449
You want to start a game
between players?

57
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,368
The three of us are the same.

58
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,080
Social outcasts. Losers.

59
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,084
Yet we still want to know how it feels
to be alive, more than anyone.

60
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,220
I don't have very much time left.

61
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,182
Do me one last favor.

62
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,893
One more game, come on!

63
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,645
I thought you guys were my bros!

64
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,871
Sounds like fun.

65
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,166
Arisu, what do you think?

66
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,751
What do you mean?

67
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,421
Come on, don't play dumb.
I know you've got a bone to pick with me.

68
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,507
We might as well deal with it right now.

69
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,426
We can settle things once and for all.

70
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,179
What the hell
are you talking about?

71
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,015
Come on, where's your gun?
I know you got one!

72
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,102
There's gotta be
another way to do this.

73
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,866
Niragi! Stop this!

74
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,785
I'm just acting like you guys.

75
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,620
Doing whatever I feel like.

76
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,832
Every time you open your mouths,
it's just to talk about yourselves.

77
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,000
I've had to listen to your bullshit
the whole time.

78
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,713
Stop acting like you're better than
everyone because you've seen people die.

79
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,758
And don't say you're trying to survive
for someone else,

80
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,594
because I know that deep down,
you're just as selfish!

81
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,389
The only thing that matters
is that we come out on top!

82
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,519
You said it'd all work out
if we worked together!

83
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,605
From the very start,
you just wanted to be the only survivor!

84
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,358
I don't want it to end this way!

85
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,402
Please, or you'll kill everyone.

86
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,653
Do it for them!

87
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,908
Yeah.

88
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,871
You might have a good point.

89
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,043
Maybe we're all just supposed
to kill each other in this place.

90
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,170
Now you're starting to make sense.

91
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,342
Niragi...

92
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,306
I know what you're trying to do,
but it won't work!

93
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,893
You're trying to wear me down!

94
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,901
Except...

95
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,154
now it won't work.

96
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,867
I'm not gonna act weak and selfish
ever again.

97
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,171
I'm out.

98
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,143
I'm not gonna pull this trigger
just so that I can survive.

99
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,122
<i>I'm finally free.</i>

100
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,084
I made my own choice.

101
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,004
And based on my own ideals.

102
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,383
It's all because of you.

103
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,476
You ruined it.

104
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,270
Thanks a lot, asshole.

105
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,693
Arisu?

106
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,828
What's going on here?

107
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,795
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about you.

108
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,424
Usagi!

109
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,176
Stop shooting!
She's got nothing to do with this!

110
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,805
Games need a heroine to rescue.
But this one should die.

111
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,849
What are you saying?

112
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,935
If I kill you now,

113
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,564
everything can go back to the way it was.

114
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,194
You... just get in the way.

115
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,845
Chishiya!

116
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,264
Chishiya!

117
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,350
Chishiya! You saved me!

118
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,436
Why did you do it?

119
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,440
I wanted to do something
that was a bit out of character.

120
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,153
I know it's thanks
to the people I met here.

121
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,864
Like Kuzuryu.

122
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,617
Arisu, too.

123
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,746
Hey.

124
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,707
Before, what were you gonna say?

125
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,753
Oh, yeah.

126
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,886
Honest people...

127
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,266
always seemed pretty stupid to me.

128
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,688
I've always loved messing with people

129
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,399
who try too hard at life.

130
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,862
I hated selflessness.

131
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,827
It's probably because I was jealous.

132
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,664
They all had something I was missing.

133
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,459
It was like

134
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,670
they could always see

135
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,632
what a pathetic and small-minded person
I really was.

136
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,554
I was always afraid.

137
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,476
I get you.

138
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,649
Yeah, I thought
you'd be the one to understand.

139
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,409
I guess hunting rifles

140
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,661
aren't as deadly as you thought.

141
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,254
Whatever you do,

142
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,466
just don't make me out to be the villain.

143
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,556
If there were seven billion of me,

144
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,268
you guys

145
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,478
would all be villains too.

146
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,819
You're pretty lucky, you know.

147
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,115
You guys are the majority.

148
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,495
Run.

149
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,383
- Hide them under the cars.
- Okay.

150
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,281
The only blimps left are the King
of Spades and the Queen of Hearts.

151
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,534
Anybody who's left is gathering in Shibuya
now that they've seen the blimps.

152
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,495
We can't go further until we take down
the King of Spades.

153
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,040
Huh? Look!

154
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,381
Kuina! Ann!

155
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,092
Arisu!

156
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,891
It's been a while.

157
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,685
You're both okay. I'm so glad.

158
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,353
It's good to see you again.

159
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,022
Did Chishiya make it?

160
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,732
Yeah.

161
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,945
I saw him. He's good.

162
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,780
Great.

163
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,199
Looks like the King of Spades
wants to settle things here.

164
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,160
We'll take the King down together.

165
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,108
Ann!

166
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,696
No! No!

167
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,744
Yeah! We did it!

168
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,162
- We got him!
- Finally!

169
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,206
- We're finally free!
- Finally! Yeah!

170
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,501
- We did it!
- Yeah!

171
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,665
Arisu!

172
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,687
Shit!

173
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,836
- I keep missing. Fuck.
- Let's go!

174
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,599
Arisu!

175
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,565
Come on! They're in here!

176
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,865
Arisu!

177
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,162
Heya.

178
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,581
Are you Usagi?

179
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,333
Yeah.

180
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,294
Good to meet you.

181
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,176
He'll run out of ammo soon.

182
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,178
Stay in here where there's cover.

183
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,680
Aguni?

184
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,849
Aguni. What are you doing here?

185
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,728
I followed you here.

186
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,648
So you do love me.

187
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,863
He's just human.
He's not invincible.

188
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,324
And as for his guns,

189
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,118
he won't be able to shoot forever.

190
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,955
Once he runs out of ammo,
he'll need to restock.

191
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,165
I think they drop supplies
from the blimps.

192
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,253
We've all got weapons.

193
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,098
But this is all the ammo I've got left.

194
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,490
I almost forgot.

195
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,452
My good luck charm.

196
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,329
This is the bomb Chishiya made.

197
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,414
Chishiya?

198
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,666
A lot of good that toy will do us.

199
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,003
We can lure him in
and use it at close range.

200
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,966
From the way it smells,
I'm guessing the bomb contains kerosene.

201
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,551
An ANFO bomb.

202
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,928
Then the explosion it makes
won't be that big.

203
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,390
I can see a drugstore over there.

204
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,517
If we can fill it up with gas,

205
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,811
then the explosion will be bigger.

206
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,479
Are you sure?

207
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,148
Probably.

208
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,778
So you're saying, someone needs
to lure the King of Spades in there?

209
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,362
Yeah.

210
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,075
I'll wait for him inside the store,
and then trigger it.

211
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,243
You're going to die if you do that.

212
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,579
No. I'll make it out.

213
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,705
How?

214
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,500
When the bomb detonates,

215
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,543
if I'm on the second floor,

216
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,545
I'll be able to survive the fall.

217
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,006
Probably.

218
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,552
You know, you say "probably" a lot.

219
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,639
His "probably" is worth betting on.

220
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,224
It's worth its weight in gold.

221
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,518
I'll be the bait.

222
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,645
I'll lure him in.

223
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,023
It's reckless to try to do it alone.

224
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,651
I've handled a lot worse.

225
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,905
We'll... we'll do it together.

226
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,117
Yes, together. Just leave it to us.

227
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,380
All right, then. Let's do it.

228
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,867
<i>We'll lure him to an alley
so he can't get more ammo from the blimp.</i>

229
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,828
Then we'll lure him
to the drugstore from there.

230
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,330
I'm gonna go first.

231
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,125
While I'm doing that,
you'll go to the alley and draw him in.

232
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,252
- Okay.
- Arisu.

233
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,213
Make sure that store is filled with gas.

234
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,006
Yeah.

235
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,076
This thing's a piece of shit!

236
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,202
Oh!

237
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,554
Ann, you almost hit me!

238
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,890
I'm making sure I don't hit you!

239
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,734
Ann!

240
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,373
Come out.

241
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,169
Come here.

242
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,686
Come on.

243
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,855
Come on.

244
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,610
Arisu! Do it!

245
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,280
Aguni!

246
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,144
Are you crazy?

247
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,787
Throw it!

248
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,607
Aguni!

249
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,610
Go.

250
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,992
- Where are they?
- They're all okay.

251
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,288
You've gotta go on to the last game.

252
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,145
Usagi!

253
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,317
Usagi!

254
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,361
Usagi!

255
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,114
Usagi!

256
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,499
I'm... I'm sorry.

257
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,179
That was the only way...

258
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:33,522
that I knew how to save you.

259
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,500
Sorry.

260
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,475
I want you to know...

261
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,021
I never held it against you.

262
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,888
What am I supposed to do now?

263
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,710
Mori.

264
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,392
What are you doing here?

265
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,562
Should I beg your forgiveness?

266
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,231
Nah.

267
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,610
I'm the one who should

268
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,655
beg you to forgive me.

269
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,453
I forced my best friend

270
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,832
into a role he didn't want to play.

271
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,557
Take care, my friend.

272
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,031
Aguni.

273
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,086
Shit.

274
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,048
I can't get up.

275
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,803
There's...

276
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,392
...only one left.

277
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,227
Huh...

278
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,563
Huh?

279
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,650
Ann, you're

280
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:30,986
still alive.

281
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,409
Promise...

282
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,247
...if we meet again...

283
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,671
...we'll be friends.

284
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,733
Ann.

285
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,195
Ann?

286
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,376
Usagi!

287
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,382
Usagi?

288
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,566
<i>This is the final game.</i>

289
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,695
<i>Participating players
should register immediately.</i>

290
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,900
If the rules

291
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,528
force the players
to start killing each other...

292
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,656
I promise that

293
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,909
I'm going to protect you.

294
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,745
That

295
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,914
makes you sound...

296
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,252
...ridiculous right now.

297
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,971
Welcome

298
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,890
to your final game venue!
