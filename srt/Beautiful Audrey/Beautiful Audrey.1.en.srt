1
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:20,437
(Beautiful Audrey)

2
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:32,949
(Kim Jung-nan)

3
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:39,222
(Park Ji-hoon)

4
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:45,228
(Kim Bo-young)

5
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:51,801
(Kim Ki-doo, Kim Yi-kyeong,
Ha Si-eun, Jeon Young-mi)

6
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:55,839
(Eun's Noodles)

7
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,156
Mom! Be careful. It's hot!

8
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:47,441
Is this my first or second day?

9
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:48,442
What's with the fuss?

10
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:50,477
It's precisely because it's
not your first or second day.

11
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,678
You shouldn't be overconfident

12
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:53,029
and need to be careful.

13
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:55,215
Are you going to keep nagging?

14
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:56,783
I'm already overwhelmed, you know?

15
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,719
I got it. My lips are sealed!

16
00:02:58,802 --> 00:02:59,703
Sealed!

17
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:10,980
Mhm... Mhm...

18
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:14,935
You couldn't keep quiet
for even 10 seconds.

19
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:17,187
What? Huh?
What do you want to say?

20
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:20,774
Release! Release!

21
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:22,142
Released.

22
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:24,678
Mom, are you going
out again today?

23
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,329
Ah, right. It's today, isn't it?

24
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,149
Yes, I have to go...
I have to go...

25
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,700
I have to see Ji-eun.

26
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:33,086
Yes, I have to go...
I have to go...

27
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,071
I have to see Ji-eun.

28
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:11,241
Ji-eun! You keep
coming in half a beat late!

29
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,995
You used to be so good,
get it together!

30
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,279
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:30,744
It seems like there are
more people than last time.

32
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:35,882
Yeah. What do they call
chasing after something like this?

33
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,384
Fandom. Fandom.

34
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,586
Are you too young
to not know that?

35
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,154
Right. Fandom.

36
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,556
There's nothing
my mom doesn't know.

37
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,091
Anyone would think
you're a teenager.

38
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:45,575
Well, that's basic.

39
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,413
Mom! They're coming!

40
00:04:58,655 --> 00:04:59,889
Mom! Let's go over there.

41
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:02,509
No. Let's just watch from here.

42
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,294
Why? Let's close to see her.

43
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:06,629
Come here, mom.

44
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,502
Please step back a bit.

45
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:15,305
Watch your head.
Watch your head.

46
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:19,008
Here they come. Here they come.

47
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:24,347
Ji-eun!

48
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,521
Ji... Ji...

49
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:37,794
Ji-eun.

50
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:47,804
Guess she didn't see.

51
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,008
(God Ji-eun)

52
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:08,391
Who's that?

53
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,777
What's what?

54
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,796
Just now. The man
that came with the lady.

55
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,499
Seemed like he was
calling your name.

56
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,701
Must be a fan.

57
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:21,537
I've seen that lady before.

58
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:24,941
If I remember correctly,
she seems to come once a month.

59
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,330
I wonder if it's
a mom following her son

60
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:32,181
or a son following his mom.

61
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:34,817
It seems like the son
is following his mom...

62
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:41,691
Isn't having
a diverse fan base good?

63
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,816
Exactly.

64
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,051
The YouTube response is excellent

65
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,587
and there are so many English
comments I can hardly read them.

66
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,572
President, at this rate,
aren't we heading to America?

67
00:06:57,573 --> 00:07:01,828
We should. To America,
Japan, France, and beyond...

68
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:03,230
- France?
- Wow!

69
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:04,497
Have you guys ever been to France?

70
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,448
No.

71
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:16,092
(God Ji-eun)

72
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,336
But Ji-eun really sings well.
Right, Mom?

73
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,140
Indeed. How can
someone sing so well?

74
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:49,042
Because she takes after you, Mom.

75
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,493
You were quite
the singer yourself once.

76
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:52,528
What singing...

77
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:57,851
Ms. Oh Mi-yeon,

78
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:02,088
how about singing a song
for your son who's driving?

79
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:04,224
Ah, no way.

80
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,558
Ah. Why?

81
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:07,227
Mom, you sing that song well.

82
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,811
Ah... what was it?

83
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:11,914
My name

84
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:18,721
even if a flower withers,
my name, suddenly...

85
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:00,040
Thought you were asleep.

86
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:01,574
What are you doing out again?

87
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:03,176
Get in.

88
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:05,311
I could have just taken the bus.

89
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:06,562
You couldn't even sleep...

90
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:08,581
I need to go out
to buy vegetables.

91
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:11,151
It's better that
I go out with you.

92
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,253
I can order the vegetables.

93
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:15,755
Mom! Do I have ordinary eyes? Huh?

94
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,390
I need to see
the vegetables myself

95
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:19,059
to know whether they're good.

96
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:21,811
Alright, alright. Enough
talking, let's get going.

97
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,372
Right.

98
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:35,158
But why do you always
sleep with the light on?

99
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:36,759
Oh?

100
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,363
Ah... I can't sleep
well with the light off.

101
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:43,716
Come on, Ms. Oh Mi-yeon
isn't a kid anymore.

102
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,785
How can you be so afraid?

103
00:10:45,868 --> 00:10:49,172
Always thinking of
teasing your mom.

104
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:52,058
- No, I'll go by myself.
- Alright, alright.

105
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,094
Just kidding. Just a joke.

106
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:55,595
Hurry up. We're late.

107
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:56,812
Off we go!

108
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,528
What about Ji-eun? I haven't
heard if she's coming.

109
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:16,165
Why are you curious?

110
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:19,535
No.. I just haven't heard
her say she's arrived home.

111
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:23,539
She hasn't come home, right?

112
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:28,895
Whether Ji-eun comes home or not

113
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:30,797
what does it have to do with you?

114
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,299
No, but I mean...

115
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:36,469
Ji-eun and I promised to marry
each other when we were kids...

116
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:37,687
You know that...

117
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:43,693
How long will you milk something
you said when you were five?

118
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,394
Uh... want to settle this?

119
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:49,716
What about... going to the
police station with me, huh?

120
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,317
Why are you, of all people

121
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,370
thinking of violence? Weird.

122
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:58,207
Exactly, why are you eyeing
someone else's precious sister?

123
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:00,743
We should consider
what Ji-eun thinks too.

124
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:04,046
Snap out of it.

125
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:08,951
You're talking nonsense.
So early in the morning... sheesh.

126
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,772
I mean, I'd have
a competitive edge, right?

127
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,257
- No chance.
- There's a chance.

128
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:16,826
There's a chance.

129
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:19,528
Just take a good look.

130
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:34,661
Hey! I'm going to eat you alive!

131
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:37,330
Do you have any idea
how I've raised Ji-eun?

132
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:38,447
Dream on.

133
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:41,150
You're talking nonsense.

134
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:44,737
I also carried Ji-eun on my back

135
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,372
and played with her.

136
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:47,556
I've done that too!

137
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,351
You should start by
building up your strength.

138
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:23,859
If you're struggling this much,
what will you do?

139
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:32,501
But it's okay. You're
practicing on your own.

140
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:39,675
This time, let me be the center.

141
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:41,610
A person who wants
to be the center

142
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:44,580
still can't sort out their home
life and gets dragged around?

143
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:47,950
The occasional visitors are
your mother and brother, right?

144
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:53,289
Have you already forgotten

145
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:55,491
how you got here?

146
00:13:58,627 --> 00:13:59,662
Ji-eun!

147
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,367
This is my chance.
Please, Mom, let me go!

148
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,820
No... We don't even know
what kind of company that is.

149
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:10,172
Who the president is...

150
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:13,726
How can you believe they'll
make you a star just like that?

151
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:17,046
Ah... what do you know, Mom?

152
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:19,215
How do you know anything
and keep saying it's strange?

153
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:23,569
So, look into it a bit more.

154
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:26,522
It won't be too late then.

155
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,243
Since when did you
care about what I want!

156
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:31,811
Ji-eun...

157
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:33,646
Please, listen to Mom this time...

158
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:34,797
Ah, damn it! Enough!

159
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,417
Didn't you say I could do
what I want when I grow up!

160
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,301
Do you hate it that
much to see me succeed?

161
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,888
You can't stand to see me do
better than your son, is that it?

162
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:43,305
Is that why?

163
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,275
How can you talk to
your mom like that?

164
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:48,744
When did you get here?

165
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:51,597
Apologize to your mom right now!

166
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,832
Damn it! What did I do wrong?

167
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:53,916
This brat, really!

168
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,436
Why hit her?

169
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,938
Talk it out, don't hit the child.

170
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:00,856
It's your mom's birthday today!

171
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:03,959
You...

172
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:06,145
what's so important
about being an idol

173
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:07,647
that you're acting
like this... like this...

174
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,099
Mom's birthday, so what!

175
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,685
What does that have
to do with my life!

176
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:15,337
And since when did Mom
and Dad care about me?

177
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:19,175
What do I want from you?
Money? No!

178
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:22,628
I want to do what I want!
Leave me alone!

179
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:24,113
Don't interfere!

180
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:27,583
- Dammit!
- Hey! Stop!

181
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:31,253
Hey, Kang Ji-eun! Kang Ji-eun!

182
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,768
You know how much I've invested

183
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,285
to craft
your refined image, right?

184
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,205
Make sure to sort
things out properly

185
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,590
to avoid damaging
the group's image

186
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:10,159
with unnecessary rumors.

187
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:20,520
Be careful. Take it slow. Slowly.

188
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:21,737
Yes, I'll be careful.

189
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:24,724
I'm here.

190
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:26,426
- You're here?
- Yes.

191
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:29,061
Goodness... you're
really something.

192
00:16:29,144 --> 00:16:31,431
What are you filming around
here day and night for?

193
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:33,449
You're here.

194
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:40,122
It's because you show
the real aspects of life.

195
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:45,361
You must have taken hundreds
of photos last time alone.

196
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:47,713
The past is already gone.

197
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:49,749
Today is different now.

198
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:51,934
Goodness... listen to you.

199
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:53,836
Just do what you need to do.

200
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,706
Just take your pictures
and go. I'm swamped. Busy.

201
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,485
Eat slowly.

202
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,187
Yes.

203
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:15,558
But where did Ki-hoon go?

204
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,927
He went to buy ingredients.

205
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:22,448
I thought he was just
a bookworm good at studying,

206
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:23,899
but he seems to
have found his calling.

207
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,868
He's good at it, right?

208
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:29,905
A student should have
continued studying.

209
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,474
Such a bright kid did
not even go to college.

210
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:36,412
Ah... I didn't mean it that way.

211
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:40,349
Well... it's not like you
said anything wrong.

212
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:43,686
Don't feel awkward, just eat.

213
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,020
Yes.

214
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:49,642
Hello. You are having a meal?

215
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,143
Hello, Lady Kim.

216
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:53,028
- Do you want some noodles?
- I've already eaten.

217
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:55,982
It's not about that.

218
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:57,149
We decided to collect
ten thousand won

219
00:17:57,232 --> 00:17:58,351
more for this year's
Sports Day prize.

220
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,069
We wanted to do it right.

221
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:01,787
What sports day?

222
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,373
Sports day as in sports day.

223
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:07,860
The merchant association
replaced the annual trip

224
00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:11,097
with this year's sports day.

225
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,900
When did anyone say
we're having a sports day?

226
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:15,167
I haven't heard anything.

227
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,118
Eh?

228
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:20,740
Oh, my! What's wrong? Ah...

229
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:22,691
We talked about it last time.

230
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:24,977
Really, no one told me anything.

231
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,562
What's going on?

232
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:28,931
I'm sure...

233
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:31,484
I talked about it.

234
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,937
You were told.
Don't turn this on me...

235
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:49,602
Ki-hoon, you're here?

236
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:51,954
Why should a busy
person come to you?

237
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:55,257
I called you because
I have something to show you.

238
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:58,110
It's almost mealtime, and
the shop is going to be busy.

239
00:18:58,193 --> 00:18:59,128
I have to go back soon.

240
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:00,829
Acting all high and mighty.

241
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:02,865
Look.

242
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:09,021
Hm... Mom's...

243
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,005
Yes.

244
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:12,525
My mom looks the prettiest.

245
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:15,144
Right? And I took
the photos well, too.

246
00:19:15,644 --> 00:19:17,112
You did take them well.

247
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:29,208
But why are you
diligently preparing

248
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,660
for an exhibition next year?

249
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:34,580
This thing is called artwork,

250
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:37,399
it doesn't just
pop out all at once.

251
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,652
It requires time and effort,

252
00:19:39,735 --> 00:19:42,538
layer upon layer,
stitch by stitch.

253
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:48,928
This exhibition will be the
grand one to introduce my name,

254
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:51,413
Baek Jang-mi, to the world.

255
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,153
Oh, right?

256
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,340
Did you know that the
merchant association's annual trip

257
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:02,991
has been changed to
a sports day this year?

258
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,393
Yeah.

259
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:08,130
Then.. mom should
know about it too, right?

260
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:10,466
I heard about it from mom.

261
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,036
I even bought clothes.

262
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:18,540
Ta-da.

263
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:21,110
How is it? Pretty color, right?

264
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:25,097
Oh. It's pretty. Mom will like it.

265
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,116
Right? She'll like it.

266
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,931
Mom!

267
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:44,984
Oh. You're back?

268
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:45,968
Yes.

269
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:51,057
You should use the air fryer.

270
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,658
Did you lock
the shop door properly?

271
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:54,326
Yes... I cleaned up well,

272
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:57,045
emptied the trash, and
locked the door properly.

273
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:01,784
Why bother standing
and grilling like this?

274
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,236
Gosh... What's
so hard about this?

275
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,587
The taste is different.

276
00:21:06,922 --> 00:21:09,758
Though, the taste is best
when it's grilled over charcoal.

277
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:11,827
But it's hard on you.

278
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:13,913
Even if it's hard,

279
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,498
feeding my child delicious
food makes me happier.

280
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:28,777
When Ji-eun was young, she
really loved grilled mackerel...

281
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:31,613
She liked it. Our Ji-eun did...

282
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:35,717
Mackerel!

283
00:21:38,754 --> 00:21:41,574
Shh! Wait for your brother,
and we'll eat together!

284
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:43,042
How can you eat first?

285
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,610
Don't be rude!

286
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:46,461
Sit. Sit.

287
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,610
Do you not like mackerel?

288
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:03,946
Uh. Not really.

289
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:08,567
She probably
dislikes eating with us.

290
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,885
Center syndrome.

291
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:12,154
What?

292
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:16,625
Just talking to myself.
Did you hear?

293
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:20,062
Why start something?

294
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,465
Who's starting anything?

295
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:24,867
Center syndrome?

296
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:28,988
With the company and
the president always favoring you,

297
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,873
how insignificant must we seem?

298
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,343
If you want to be the center,
you get to be the center.

299
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:37,112
Want to be the vocal?
You get that, too.

300
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,814
It must be so nice...

301
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:42,918
Then outdance me.

302
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,687
Or outsing me.

303
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:47,556
What did you say?

304
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:52,094
If you're not skilled
enough, practice. Practice!

305
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,563
Instead of just
trying to look pretty.

306
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:01,587
The mackerel's good, isn't it?

307
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,856
Where are you going? Ji-eun.

308
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:05,707
Ji-eun? Ji-eun!

309
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,527
Oh my! Look at me!

310
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:37,439
Mom! What's wrong?

311
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,991
Mom!

312
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:39,975
Sigh....

313
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:42,778
Uh... uh... Mom,
I'll do it. Let me do it!

314
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:43,979
Are you hurt, Mom?

315
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,214
Yeah....

316
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:50,903
Sigh. Why am I like this?

317
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:53,439
I'm not even thinking about
making dinner at this hour.

318
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:54,856
Are you hungry?

319
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:00,429
Mom.

320
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:03,165
We have already eaten dinner.

321
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:04,733
Huh?

322
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:08,470
We had dinner... grilled mackerel.

323
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:10,939
We ate?

324
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:25,337
(Hansaem Family Medicine)

325
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,391
So, you've finally made up
your mind? Haha...

326
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:32,044
No need for permission.

327
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:34,997
I wholeheartedly welcome it.

328
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:36,749
What? What...?

329
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:39,935
You came to get my blessing
to date Jang-mi, didn't you?

330
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:43,222
Ah, Dr. Baek! No, that's not it.

331
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:45,157
I'm not in that kind
of relationship with her.

332
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,193
Why would I date her?

333
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:52,631
Hey, even though I'm her father,

334
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:56,284
isn't it too much to
dismiss it so flatly?

335
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:58,220
Jeez... Then why did
you come so early?

336
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:00,155
Are you sick?

337
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:02,724
Well...

338
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:08,647
lately, I think
I've been a bit forgetful.

339
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,332
Forgetful of what?

340
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:18,624
Uh... like, I eat, but then it
feels like I haven't... just...

341
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:20,342
If you're hungry, eat again.

342
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:24,246
It's not that I'm hungry...

343
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:28,683
Gosh, such a young guy
is worrying.

344
00:25:29,184 --> 00:25:31,637
But look at you? all limbs intact,

345
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,772
and teasing Jang-mi
means your head's fine?

346
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:35,757
No problem at all!

347
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:38,060
No headaches, right?

348
00:25:40,362 --> 00:25:41,680
Yes.

349
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:43,282
Then, you're good.

350
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:44,533
Go on, get going.

351
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,134
Go.

352
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:48,654
Two bowls of noodles
for table three.

353
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:49,671
Okay.

354
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,410
Mom. Ah.

355
00:26:33,315 --> 00:26:34,249
Mom,

356
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,318
are you...

357
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:42,424
not having any
headaches or anything?

358
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:45,994
No. Why?

359
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:48,463
Yeah... Yeah...

360
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:51,433
No, I'm just asking.

361
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,335
Gosh, you're such a naive one.

362
00:26:57,472 --> 00:26:58,406
Ah, right.

363
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:08,250
What is it?

364
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:10,886
Huh? Oh.

365
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,754
I just wanted to
show you something.

366
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,697
What's this?

367
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,884
Well... since it's
sports day tomorrow,

368
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:27,502
I bought something
for you to wear.

369
00:27:28,837 --> 00:27:30,705
Oh my... is that tomorrow?

370
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,058
My goodness!

371
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,093
I've been so busy with the shop

372
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:35,310
that I lost track
of time... really.

373
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:47,122
As if I'm a kid going on a picnic.

374
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:50,192
Why spend money on this?

375
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,727
But Mom...

376
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:54,930
it's pretty?

377
00:27:55,897 --> 00:27:57,499
- Pretty?
- Yeah.

378
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,284
You look like you're
in your twenties.

379
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,036
Hey, teasing me again!

380
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:31,850
Ah... ah...

381
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:32,885
(The 6th Flower Road
Merchant Association Sports Day)

382
00:28:32,968 --> 00:28:35,821
Respected families of the
Flower Road Shopping District.

383
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:39,091
Running businesses during the
pandemic has been challenging,

384
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:44,530
and you've all worked
hard to keep going.

385
00:28:44,613 --> 00:28:47,299
Last year, we couldn't
have our unity gathering,

386
00:28:47,382 --> 00:28:49,835
and though we're replacing
it with a sports day this year,

387
00:28:49,918 --> 00:28:56,675
I hope today you can all
release your stress and cheer up!

388
00:28:56,758 --> 00:28:59,511
So then let's start
the Flower Road

389
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:02,381
Merchant Association Sports Day.

390
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:04,099
Begin!

391
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:10,772
The mugunghwa flower has bloomed.

392
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:14,376
The pork shop, out!
Eliminated!

393
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:18,146
So let's go again. Now.

394
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:23,918
The mugunghwa flower has bloomed.

395
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:27,973
The sundae soup shop, out.

396
00:29:28,056 --> 00:29:29,141
Head to the tunnel!

397
00:29:29,224 --> 00:29:31,293
Let's go again.

398
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:13,428
You're here...

399
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:14,662
Mi-yeon...

400
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:18,633
That's where you were!

401
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:21,669
What are you doing here? Huh?

402
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:25,039
- Oh!
- What's wrong?

403
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:26,725
Why? What happened inside?

404
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:29,828
Why, why, why like this?
Why? Why are you like this?

405
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,346
Hey... Hey!

406
00:32:22,831 --> 00:32:24,599
What is that they can't
talk with me about?

407
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:28,636
It's nothing, right?

408
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,607
Yeah.

409
00:32:33,775 --> 00:32:35,927
Mom. I need to use
the bathroom urgently.

410
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,046
Ah... go quickly then.

411
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:41,115
Got it. Just stay here
for a bit. I'll be right back.

412
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:46,204
It won't be easy to accept

413
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:47,956
but it is Alzheimer's.

414
00:33:03,104 --> 00:33:06,407
This is my mom's picture, right?

415
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:09,277
Her memory will
progressively deteriorate.

416
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,099
Her language
abilities will decline,

417
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:15,717
and her judgment will diminish.

418
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:47,515
All right, okay.

419
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:49,484
Okay.

420
00:33:50,018 --> 00:33:51,286
Good.

421
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,054
All right.

422
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:55,623
Okay.

423
00:33:58,726 --> 00:34:00,495
Ah! Perfect!

424
00:34:01,563 --> 00:34:02,997
Yes! Next!

425
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:05,250
- Thank you.
- Yes.

426
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,968
Getting ready for the next one.

427
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:12,557
Said this is from your home.

428
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,942
How did they get
your number?

429
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:15,743
He said it was urgent.

430
00:34:23,851 --> 00:34:24,719
Hello?

431
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:29,557
What are you doing?

432
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,993
How did you get my number?

433
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:35,029
Well...

434
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:41,202
your company president told me.

435
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:43,655
Are you crazy?

436
00:34:43,738 --> 00:34:45,607
Are you trying to ruin my life?

437
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:48,409
Why are you making
things so complicated?

438
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:50,945
Ji-eun.

439
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:53,281
What!

440
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,551
Mom's...

441
00:35:00,622 --> 00:35:01,823
Mom's... not well.

442
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:04,225
Go to the hospital.

443
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:07,795
We did.

444
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,465
And what do you
want me to do about it?

445
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,302
We did all sorts of tests...

446
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:21,309
It's Alzheimer's.

447
00:35:46,267 --> 00:35:48,587
(After 1 year)

448
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,571
(On break)

449
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:05,070
(Make sure to check
the light and heat before leaving)

450
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:08,206
(The rag is on the floor)

451
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:10,809
(To drink tea
1. Boil water...)

452
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:13,227
(Bathroom
Be careful when wet)

453
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:35,283
(My sis)

454
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:13,087
Guest, please eat, too.

455
00:37:17,391 --> 00:37:18,259
Yeah.

456
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:23,464
Eat slowly.

457
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:39,213
But...

458
00:37:40,648 --> 00:37:42,416
who will you be in our house?

459
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:47,555
Who else but your handsome son.

460
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,761
Handsome, that's correct.

461
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:04,605
At least you recognize that much?

462
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,032
How's she?

463
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:33,835
She's fine.

464
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:38,172
Her blood sugar levels and
blood pressure are normal.

465
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:42,143
Mom, you're healthy.

466
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:47,281
How's her daily life been lately?

467
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:49,450
Still sleeping next to the fridge?

468
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:50,785
- Yes.
- Yes.

469
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:56,490
She says the sound of the
fridge sounds like Dad snoring.

470
00:38:58,292 --> 00:38:59,627
That can happen.

471
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:02,463
Make sure you respond well
even if she asks the same thing.

472
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:04,632
Yes,

473
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,452
but she keeps leaving
without saying anything.

474
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:08,669
It's driving me crazy.

475
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:11,890
What can we do?

476
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:13,341
You have to pay more attention.

477
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:16,510
If she wants to go out, let her.

478
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,583
But sometimes
she calls out 'son'...

479
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,785
and remembers everything.

480
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:29,490
Then turns around and
immediately asks who I am...

481
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:32,960
The memories aren't all gone.

482
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:37,816
Some remain, some fade,

483
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:40,902
and some are stored differently...

484
00:39:42,403 --> 00:39:45,406
It's progressing fast
because she's young.

485
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:50,878
Ms. Mi-yeon.

486
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,548
Do you know where you are?

487
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,587
The hospital.

488
00:40:01,722 --> 00:40:03,124
Do you know who I am?

489
00:40:04,525 --> 00:40:07,545
Gosh. Ah... why
are you doing this?

490
00:40:07,628 --> 00:40:10,298
As if I wouldn't
recognize Mr. Baek.

491
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:16,470
And...

492
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:18,606
what is your name?

493
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:22,476
Audrey.

494
00:40:27,515 --> 00:40:31,085
Audrey.

495
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:37,591
My name is Audrey.

496
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:54,775
Mom.

497
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:57,011
Let's take your medicine.

498
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:05,319
Your name is Oh Mi-yeon.

499
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:10,024
When you were young,
you were Audrey Hepburn, right?

500
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:16,630
Dad's name is Kang Jin-soo.

501
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:24,005
Kang Jin-soo

502
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:27,341
is handsome.

503
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:31,679
Right. Dad is handsome.

504
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:35,449
Then...

505
00:41:36,283 --> 00:41:39,020
Shall we look at Dad's
photo after you take this?

506
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:26,434
Here.

507
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:29,070
Dad was twenty-seven.

508
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:31,572
Mom was twenty-two
when you got married.

509
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:34,442
You had a son, Kang Ki-hoon,

510
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:36,177
and a daughter, Kang Ji-eun.

511
00:42:37,178 --> 00:42:38,463
I'm Ki-hoon,

512
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:41,415
and the daughter, Kang Ji-eun,
is a very famous idol singer.

513
00:42:53,861 --> 00:42:55,596
Where's Kang Jin-soo?

514
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:02,770
Huh?

515
00:43:04,772 --> 00:43:05,639
Um...

516
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:12,480
He went somewhere far.

517
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:16,784
Where?

518
00:43:22,623 --> 00:43:23,557
Just... a far place.

519
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,847
Yay!

520
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:50,334
It's a mini album and then
a full album after a year.

521
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:51,352
Applause.

522
00:43:53,454 --> 00:43:54,539
You guys don't know?

523
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:56,774
The anticipation for
this album has skyrocketed.

524
00:43:56,857 --> 00:43:58,509
Ms. President, I don't
have time to take a break

525
00:43:58,592 --> 00:44:00,078
because of all the casting calls.

526
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:03,181
Yeah. We need to
top the charts this time.

527
00:44:03,264 --> 00:44:05,683
Post a lot of videos when
the overseas fans react.

528
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:07,585
And interact a lot
on social media.

529
00:44:07,668 --> 00:44:08,769
Yes!

530
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,572
Uh... bl... blood... nosebleed...

531
00:44:13,274 --> 00:44:14,975
use this to wipe.

532
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:21,815
Our Ji-eun has been practicing
too hard again, Ms. President.

533
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:25,036
It's good that Ji-eun
is working hard

534
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,521
but managing health
is also a skill, got it?

535
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:29,190
Yes..

536
00:44:32,726 --> 00:44:34,795
You guys also
care for your health.

537
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:36,197
Yes.

538
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,949
If one person gets sick,

539
00:44:38,032 --> 00:44:40,267
it immediately affects
the whole team, you know that?

540
00:44:40,868 --> 00:44:43,187
The moment you miss
activities, fans drop off.

541
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,338
And...

542
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:47,208
be careful even
with the small things.

543
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:51,145
Don't do or even create anything
that could cause problems!

544
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:53,681
If anyone becomes
a liability to our team

545
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,518
they're out.

546
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,861
Mom.

547
00:45:20,374 --> 00:45:22,743
Ah... My mom went out again.

548
00:45:36,624 --> 00:45:37,524
Mom.

549
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,261
Mom.

550
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,205
Gosh, where'd she go?

551
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:52,973
Mom.

552
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:58,212
- Looking for your mother?
- Ah... you scared me.

553
00:45:59,546 --> 00:46:02,233
It's me. I'll check
down the street.

554
00:46:02,316 --> 00:46:03,217
Thanks.

555
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:10,658
She wouldn't be here, I guess.

556
00:46:18,465 --> 00:46:19,733
Ki-hoon's dad...

557
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:23,470
Ki-hoon's dad.

558
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,975
Ji-eun...

559
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:29,910
Ji-eun...

560
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:32,946
There's our Ji-eun.

561
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,665
What are you doing here?

562
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:36,167
Let's go. Let's go home.

563
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,236
Mom will make you food.

564
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,504
Let's go quickly. Don't cry.

565
00:46:40,587 --> 00:46:42,039
Could you check me out, please?

566
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:43,090
Yes.

567
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:45,759
Mom's here. Let's go.

568
00:46:46,293 --> 00:46:48,028
You're traveling?

569
00:46:53,734 --> 00:46:56,437
Hee-jin! Hee-jin! Hee-jin!

570
00:46:58,272 --> 00:46:59,290
(Police)

571
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:01,342
This is kidnapping. Kidnapping!

572
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:04,111
Calm down...

573
00:47:04,678 --> 00:47:08,065
It seems she's not
in her right mind...

574
00:47:08,148 --> 00:47:09,917
Try to calm down, will you?

575
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:12,019
Mom!

576
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:13,987
Mom!

577
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:15,706
Mom!

578
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,475
You have to tell me
when you're going out!

579
00:47:17,558 --> 00:47:19,477
Why are you here?

580
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,895
Are you her guardian?

581
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:26,117
Yes.

582
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,067
This lady's son?

583
00:47:29,737 --> 00:47:32,990
Yes. I'm sorry.

584
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:35,626
My mother is a bit ill...

585
00:47:35,709 --> 00:47:36,627
I'm sorry.

586
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,096
She tried to kidnap
my child because she's sick?

587
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:40,047
Are you insane?

588
00:47:42,649 --> 00:47:44,335
Kidnap?

589
00:47:44,418 --> 00:47:46,570
No... my mother
would never do that.

590
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:48,973
There seems to be
some misunderstanding...

591
00:47:49,056 --> 00:47:50,107
Misunderstanding?

592
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,009
I saw her trying
to take my child...

593
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:53,344
Misunderstanding?

594
00:47:53,427 --> 00:47:57,148
Well, it really seems like
she's not entirely lucid.

595
00:47:57,231 --> 00:47:58,732
- Let's leave it at this.
- What!

596
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:02,770
Anyone and everyone
claims mental incapacity.

597
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:07,040
I want to press charges
of attempted kidnapping.

598
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:09,209
Let's follow the law.

599
00:48:10,344 --> 00:48:11,678
Hey...

600
00:48:18,185 --> 00:48:20,187
If you're going to lose it,
at least do it gracefully.

601
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:23,390
Damn it! Why is
she let loose? Jesus!

602
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,377
- What!? What did you just say?
- Ki-hoon...

603
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,511
no... no...

604
00:48:27,594 --> 00:48:29,113
What did you say to her!

605
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:30,815
Who are you calling crazy?

606
00:48:30,898 --> 00:48:32,316
Watch your words!

607
00:48:32,399 --> 00:48:35,286
What? You're at fault here
and raising your voice at us!

608
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:36,687
Do you even know my mom!

609
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,789
Do you know her? No, you don't!

610
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:40,591
What? This brat!

611
00:48:40,674 --> 00:48:41,909
Come here! You little!

612
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,179
Keep talking like that...

613
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:48,799
What, are you going to hit me?

614
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:51,051
Get out! Take her
and leave! Damn you!

615
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:56,323
Take it easy.

616
00:49:01,628 --> 00:49:03,831
At least it didn't
turn into a big issue.

617
00:49:04,998 --> 00:49:07,734
Mom almost became a kidnapper.

618
00:49:09,136 --> 00:49:12,473
It's a good thing the child's
mother eventually understood...

619
00:49:13,941 --> 00:49:15,075
Calling that child Ji-eun

620
00:49:15,943 --> 00:49:18,445
as if she were your sister Ji-eun.

621
00:49:22,783 --> 00:49:24,769
What now?

622
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:27,354
This could happen again.

623
00:49:28,755 --> 00:49:32,092
Shouldn't you tell Ji-eun
and figure something out?

624
00:49:37,464 --> 00:49:41,802
It won't happen again.

625
00:50:56,276 --> 00:50:57,328
Open the door.

626
00:50:57,411 --> 00:50:58,329
Open the door.

627
00:50:58,412 --> 00:51:01,298
Open the door!
Open the door! Open the door!

628
00:51:01,381 --> 00:51:03,567
You evil man!

629
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,851
Open it! I'm scared!

630
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:09,089
Open it!

631
00:51:11,558 --> 00:51:12,610
Open it!

632
00:51:12,693 --> 00:51:13,794
I'm sorry.

633
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:21,401
Mom, can you please
stay inside for a few days?

634
00:51:24,237 --> 00:51:28,241
Open the door! Ki-hoon!
I'm scared!

635
00:51:33,313 --> 00:51:34,414
Come on.

636
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,753
You wouldn't be in this situation
if you hadn't caused trouble.

637
00:51:48,328 --> 00:51:50,381
Open the door! Ki-hoon.

638
00:51:50,464 --> 00:51:52,265
Open the door!

639
00:52:01,908 --> 00:52:03,977
Mom. Please stop..

640
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,046
Seriously. You messed up again!

641
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:23,030
Why do you keep doing that?

642
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:26,099
Maybe you should take it
easy with the diet?

643
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,186
Do you have some grand plan

644
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:30,604
to faint on stage for attention?

645
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:55,729
Hello?

646
00:52:56,363 --> 00:52:59,032
Uh... Ji-eun! You're not busy?

647
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,951
Who is this?

648
00:53:01,034 --> 00:53:03,136
It's me. Deok-su.

649
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:06,357
Ah... ah. Why?

650
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,043
It's good to hear your
voice after so long.

651
00:53:10,544 --> 00:53:11,545
Are you doing okay?

652
00:53:12,312 --> 00:53:14,815
I see you on TV sometimes.

653
00:53:15,482 --> 00:53:16,934
Uh... I'm a bit busy.

654
00:53:17,017 --> 00:53:18,769
- I'm going to hang up.
- No!

655
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:20,387
It's not...

656
00:53:21,655 --> 00:53:23,223
It's about your mom...

657
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:26,293
I have something to tell you.

658
00:53:26,827 --> 00:53:29,262
The situation is... uh...

659
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:45,879
Ki-hoon! Not your noodles,
give me your mom's noodles!

660
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,765
You know!

661
00:53:47,848 --> 00:53:49,466
My mom is on vacation right now!

662
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:53,854
Why is this vacation so long! Tell
her to come back quickly! Really!

663
00:53:54,554 --> 00:53:58,058
My mom is on her day off.

664
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:04,297
Right, that's true.

665
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:07,601
It's her actual day off now.

666
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:12,038
I miss her.

667
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:14,141
Hey! Hey! Ki-hoon!

668
00:54:17,277 --> 00:54:18,178
What's up?

669
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:19,813
Ji-eun's here.

670
00:54:22,048 --> 00:54:23,200
Where?

671
00:54:23,283 --> 00:54:24,317
She went towards the house.

672
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:26,553
But she seemed furious...

673
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:42,769
Mom. Mom.

674
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:48,975
Mom. Mom, are you there?

675
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:51,611
Mom.

676
00:55:01,822 --> 00:55:02,756
Mom!

677
00:55:03,723 --> 00:55:04,691
Mom!

678
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:17,337
Come out.

679
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:23,743
Come out! Come out!

680
00:55:24,344 --> 00:55:26,613
Stop this and come out!

681
00:55:27,614 --> 00:55:29,449
Why are you doing this here!

682
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,585
Come out! Come out!

683
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,121
Come out!

684
00:55:36,857 --> 00:55:37,891
What are you doing?

685
00:55:38,892 --> 00:55:39,977
Mom, come out quickly.

686
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,027
Come with me.

687
00:55:41,561 --> 00:55:43,647
Hey! After over a year
of barely answering calls,

688
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,216
what are you doing now?
You scared mom!

689
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:48,786
Are you worried about that
when locking Mom in the room?

690
00:55:48,869 --> 00:55:50,070
Are you crazy? You!

691
00:55:52,172 --> 00:55:53,123
Where are you
planning to take her?

692
00:55:53,206 --> 00:55:54,525
Where are you going to take her?

693
00:55:54,608 --> 00:55:55,809
To a nursing home.

694
00:55:59,646 --> 00:56:00,647
Ji-eun...

695
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:02,482
A nursing home?

696
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:04,434
Staying locked up
here is much worse

697
00:56:04,517 --> 00:56:05,886
for Mom than a nursing home.

698
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:08,255
No.

699
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:12,626
But I don't want to send her
to a nursing home. I'm here.

700
00:56:13,426 --> 00:56:14,794
Stop pretending
to be the good one.

701
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,248
Stop acting like you're the
only one who cares for Mom.

702
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:20,166
Stop pretending
to be the good one.

703
00:56:20,734 --> 00:56:22,102
It makes me sick.

704
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,704
And what have you done?

705
00:56:25,405 --> 00:56:28,008
Your mom's been sick since when!

706
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:30,694
Have you adequately answered

707
00:56:30,777 --> 00:56:32,879
Ki-hoon's call even once
over the past year?

708
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,632
Abandoning your
family to live your life,

709
00:56:35,715 --> 00:56:38,852
and now you act so: righteous!

710
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:42,606
You're just causing a scene now

711
00:56:42,689 --> 00:56:44,224
because you think it might
tarnish: your idol's career.

712
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:47,928
Jang-mi, why are you
saying that to Ji-eun? Stop it.

713
00:56:48,428 --> 00:56:50,063
And why can't you say anything?

714
00:56:51,031 --> 00:56:52,516
Why are you always
the one feeling guilty?

715
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:54,618
What did you do wrong?

716
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:57,604
That's why I'm saying
stop! Just stop, all of you!

717
00:57:06,112 --> 00:57:07,080
Jang-mi, go.

718
00:57:09,816 --> 00:57:11,217
Just go.

719
00:57:35,075 --> 00:57:36,443
Ignore what Jang-mi said.

720
00:57:37,277 --> 00:57:38,812
No one thinks of you like that.

721
00:57:41,348 --> 00:57:42,282
And about...

722
00:57:45,919 --> 00:57:48,822
the nursing home...
I'm not ready yet, Ji-eun.

723
00:57:53,193 --> 00:57:54,527
As long as I'm here,

724
00:57:56,029 --> 00:57:57,464
I want to be with Mom

725
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,935
as much as I can...

726
00:58:03,536 --> 00:58:05,472
You could fool anyone into
thinking you're her real son.

727
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,974
I might even be fooled myself.

728
00:58:26,893 --> 00:58:28,228
Heart attack?

729
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:32,399
He was working
overtime alone...

730
00:58:35,301 --> 00:58:36,736
Ah, what do we do now?

731
00:58:37,837 --> 00:58:39,205
He doesn't have any family...

732
00:58:40,073 --> 00:58:41,708
His mom died giving birth to him.

733
00:58:44,344 --> 00:58:47,580
How is this young child supposed
to handle all this, dear?

734
00:58:59,893 --> 00:59:00,927
Ki-hoon.

735
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,275
Ki-hoon.

736
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:20,914
Would you like to live
with this uncle and auntie?

737
00:59:24,617 --> 00:59:29,089
Can Auntie be Ki-hoon's mom?

738
00:59:32,092 --> 00:59:33,293
Let me...

739
00:59:34,027 --> 00:59:35,462
be Ki-hoon's mom.

740
00:59:36,229 --> 00:59:37,097
Okay?

741
00:59:45,905 --> 00:59:48,208
It's all right.

742
00:59:51,077 --> 00:59:51,978
It's okay.

743
00:59:54,948 --> 00:59:56,416
Don't cry.

744
01:00:24,811 --> 01:00:25,745
Ji-eun!

745
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,515
Ji-eun!

746
01:00:36,422 --> 01:00:37,323
Um...

747
01:00:38,758 --> 01:00:41,494
I know you don't acknowledge it.

748
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:44,497
But...

749
01:00:48,535 --> 01:00:50,503
give me a little more time.

750
01:00:51,004 --> 01:00:51,938
One week.

751
01:00:52,672 --> 01:00:54,607
I'll come back to
take Mom in a week.

752
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,816
I want to go to the nursing home.

753
01:01:12,892 --> 01:01:13,826
I...

754
01:01:14,894 --> 01:01:16,729
I will stay at the nursing home.

755
01:01:18,331 --> 01:01:19,232
Mom...

756
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:24,304
Eat before you go. Ji-eun.

757
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:30,577
You haven't been here in a while.

758
01:01:31,211 --> 01:01:35,548
Have a meal and
spend the night with me.

759
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:03,827
What are you doing?

760
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:06,179
Don't just stand
there, open the fridge.

761
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,781
Uh?

762
01:02:09,515 --> 01:02:10,917
Oh.

763
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:46,152
Woah.

764
01:02:50,323 --> 01:02:52,425
Bon Appetit!

765
01:03:11,177 --> 01:03:12,779
Oh my? This is too delicious...

766
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:30,080
It seems you didn't have
the courage to ghost me

767
01:03:30,163 --> 01:03:31,698
seeing that you're
calling in less than a day.

768
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,200
I'm sorry...

769
01:03:36,002 --> 01:03:38,471
Did you cool off a bit?

770
01:03:40,173 --> 01:03:41,407
Yes.

771
01:03:42,608 --> 01:03:44,844
You skipped out on your
songwriting deadline, right?

772
01:03:45,812 --> 01:03:47,397
No matter how valuable
a product you are

773
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,399
I can't keep giving you
chances indefinitely.

774
01:03:49,482 --> 01:03:50,650
Do you understand what I'm saying?

775
01:03:52,385 --> 01:03:53,403
You were eager to
include your compositions

776
01:03:53,486 --> 01:03:56,055
in the next solo
album, weren't you?

777
01:03:56,889 --> 01:03:58,141
Then you need to
keep that promise.

778
01:03:58,224 --> 01:04:00,727
That's how I can
do business, right?

779
01:04:02,061 --> 01:04:04,731
I came here to write
songs in peace, actually.

780
01:04:08,234 --> 01:04:09,819
What?

781
01:04:09,902 --> 01:04:12,038
Were you playing artist?

782
01:04:12,972 --> 01:04:14,624
Ah, it would be best
if you had said so earlier.

783
01:04:14,707 --> 01:04:15,759
Mom!

784
01:04:15,842 --> 01:04:18,511
Ah... I don't want to
wash my face! I won't do it!

785
01:04:19,746 --> 01:04:22,548
Then how much more
time do you need?

786
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,652
One, two, hey!

787
01:04:28,388 --> 01:04:29,372
If you wash your face

788
01:04:29,455 --> 01:04:31,141
I'll buy you your
favorite ice cream!

789
01:04:31,224 --> 01:04:32,142
Really?

790
01:04:32,225 --> 01:04:33,159
Really!

791
01:04:33,493 --> 01:04:35,261
Ji-eun... Hello?

792
01:04:36,229 --> 01:04:38,415
Just today. Please
excuse me just for today.

793
01:04:38,498 --> 01:04:39,365
I'll definitely come tomorrow.

794
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:41,634
I won't do it.

795
01:04:42,101 --> 01:04:43,787
Hmm...

796
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:46,906
if you wash your face, I'll
buy you your favorite ice cream!

797
01:04:49,275 --> 01:04:50,176
Really?

798
01:04:50,576 --> 01:04:51,611
Hmm... Really!

799
01:04:54,881 --> 01:04:56,349
I want to eat it before dinner.

800
01:04:56,849 --> 01:04:58,668
Hm? Um...

801
01:04:58,751 --> 01:04:59,952
Ah... that's a bit...

802
01:05:02,188 --> 01:05:03,122
Then I won't do it either.

803
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:08,027
Alright! Then let's eat
ice cream before dinner today!

804
01:05:10,563 --> 01:05:11,564
Let's go!

805
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:14,400
Let's go! Let's go!

806
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:02,832
What?

807
01:06:02,915 --> 01:06:06,152
Dressed up so beautifully
to buy ice cream?

808
01:06:07,753 --> 01:06:08,621
Do I look pretty?

809
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:11,924
Yeah. Just like Audrey Hepburn.

810
01:06:15,862 --> 01:06:17,096
Because I'm Audrey.

811
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,834
Are you okay?

812
01:06:23,436 --> 01:06:25,037
They say you reopened the shop.

813
01:06:25,771 --> 01:06:26,772
Do what you need to do.

814
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:31,143
Sister, let's get some ice cream.

815
01:06:32,512 --> 01:06:34,063
Okay. Let's go.

816
01:06:34,146 --> 01:06:35,414
Okay.

817
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:43,856
Let's go.

818
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:06,112
Is it good?

819
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,631
Yes.

820
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:10,483
It's good. Want some?

821
01:07:21,093 --> 01:07:22,028
Mom.

822
01:07:28,668 --> 01:07:29,669
Mom...

823
01:07:31,604 --> 01:07:32,605
I'm Audrey.

824
01:07:34,907 --> 01:07:35,841
Audrey.

825
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:39,712
Did you know I missed Mom?

826
01:07:42,181 --> 01:07:43,282
Then see her.

827
01:07:46,686 --> 01:07:49,188
I'm actually struggling.

828
01:07:51,257 --> 01:07:53,025
It's what I wanted.

829
01:07:53,526 --> 01:07:55,027
It's what I dreamed of.

830
01:07:57,196 --> 01:07:58,464
But it's still hard
even though it's hard.

831
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:04,537
But it was my choice,

832
01:08:06,138 --> 01:08:07,740
so I can't say it's hard.

833
01:08:11,143 --> 01:08:13,079
After what happened to Dad,

834
01:08:14,113 --> 01:08:15,481
how could I give up...

835
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:18,551
I can't give up.

836
01:08:32,832 --> 01:08:34,834
Why couldn't you cherish
me like this when I was little?

837
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:38,738
Instead of worrying
about my brother,

838
01:08:39,138 --> 01:08:40,506
cherish me too!

839
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:47,997
Why do you have to be sick?

840
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,250
Don't be sick... Mom.
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

841
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,788
I want to do well,

842
01:08:58,758 --> 01:08:59,759
but it's not working.

843
01:09:04,196 --> 01:09:05,331
I wanted

844
01:09:06,332 --> 01:09:10,469
to be your beloved child too...

845
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:13,339
Always...

846
01:09:17,476 --> 01:09:18,711
You are kind.

847
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:26,385
You bought me ice cream.

848
01:09:27,219 --> 01:09:28,587
You're so kind.

849
01:09:29,355 --> 01:09:31,123
Very kind.

850
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:41,651
(I'm Sorry)

851
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:44,503
(How hard it must have been...)

852
01:11:04,817 --> 01:11:08,587
Folding it this way
makes it easier to use

853
01:11:09,955 --> 01:11:11,624
and looks pretty.

854
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:18,998
Let's go out together.

855
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:23,202
Is there anywhere
you'd like to go?

856
01:11:23,836 --> 01:11:25,054
What about to see Ki-hoon?

857
01:11:25,137 --> 01:11:27,339
Do you want to go
see him at the shop?

858
01:11:39,585 --> 01:11:40,619
Mother.

859
01:11:42,354 --> 01:11:44,690
Why suddenly ask to take photos?

860
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:46,592
It makes me uneasy.

861
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,913
I'm not preparing
for a memorial photo.

862
01:11:50,996 --> 01:11:52,464
I just want to take
a pretty picture.

863
01:11:53,465 --> 01:11:55,534
Don't even say such things.

864
01:11:56,802 --> 01:12:03,676
I tend to be a bit
inconsistent, right?

865
01:12:06,612 --> 01:12:07,746
Hey...

866
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:13,302
While I'm still lucid
and look my best

867
01:12:13,385 --> 01:12:15,287
I want to have some
lovely photos taken.

868
01:12:16,155 --> 01:12:17,056
Please take them.

869
01:12:24,396 --> 01:12:25,731
Then, I'll take them...

870
01:13:28,627 --> 01:13:29,728
This is so good.

871
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:31,363
Is it okay?

872
01:13:32,231 --> 01:13:33,198
Perfect.

873
01:13:33,766 --> 01:13:36,468
Let's release this
as your solo single.

874
01:13:47,313 --> 01:13:48,747
Ji-eun, what's wrong?

875
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:52,818
Ji-eun!

876
01:14:56,949 --> 01:14:57,983
Did you wake up?

877
01:15:00,986 --> 01:15:02,087
Need the bathroom?

878
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:11,196
Are you hungry?

879
01:15:17,336 --> 01:15:18,470
What time is it?

880
01:15:21,206 --> 01:15:23,642
It's only been
an hour since we ate...

881
01:15:24,176 --> 01:15:25,411
I can't give you more.

882
01:15:29,815 --> 01:15:30,816
Let's go for a walk.

883
01:15:36,221 --> 01:15:37,656
It's too late.

884
01:15:41,427 --> 01:15:42,428
Do you want to go out?

885
01:16:05,284 --> 01:16:06,185
Mom...

886
01:16:09,888 --> 01:16:11,790
Just bear being sleepy
a little longer.

887
01:16:13,092 --> 01:16:15,394
Let's take a walk around
the neighborhood just once.

888
01:16:24,269 --> 01:16:28,974
Wow... this place seems
to have changed a lot.

889
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:32,911
Like, there used to be a
big tree here... I think...

890
01:16:34,546 --> 01:16:36,999
But the air feels so fresh
when you haven't been out.

891
01:16:37,082 --> 01:16:38,134
It's really nice.

892
01:16:38,217 --> 01:16:39,151
Ki-hoon.

893
01:16:41,286 --> 01:16:42,154
Yeah.

894
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:50,596
Let's...

895
01:16:53,332 --> 01:16:54,900
close the shop.

896
01:16:58,103 --> 01:16:59,638
Suddenly, why?

897
01:17:02,007 --> 01:17:05,310
You should also live
doing what you want.

898
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,515
Let's stop now

899
01:17:12,251 --> 01:17:16,522
and look for a nursing home.

900
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:23,829
Mom, don't worry about me.

901
01:17:25,164 --> 01:17:26,465
It's what I want.

902
01:17:28,433 --> 01:17:29,501
My choice.

903
01:17:38,944 --> 01:17:43,949
You gave up going to
college thinking of me.

904
01:17:46,018 --> 01:17:47,119
I know...

905
01:17:52,224 --> 01:17:54,726
I made you give up.

906
01:17:57,663 --> 01:17:59,498
I should have sent you then.

907
01:18:03,802 --> 01:18:04,870
It's late...

908
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:13,912
but live your life doing
what you want now.

909
01:18:20,986 --> 01:18:22,988
Don't live looking back.

910
01:18:26,725 --> 01:18:28,594
Live looking forward.

911
01:18:31,363 --> 01:18:32,831
Don't blame yourself.

912
01:18:37,402 --> 01:18:38,403
Understand?

913
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:41,340
Okay?

914
01:18:47,913 --> 01:18:48,780
Mom...

915
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:55,787
Mom, when you said you'd
be my mom, I was happy.

916
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:59,258
I was happy.

917
01:19:02,527 --> 01:19:04,296
You told me
that was my room.

918
01:19:06,798 --> 01:19:09,268
The bed and the desk too.

919
01:19:12,271 --> 01:19:13,455
You prepared everything in advance

920
01:19:13,538 --> 01:19:14,706
and said you didn't
know my favorite color

921
01:19:15,474 --> 01:19:17,142
so you chose based on your taste.

922
01:19:19,845 --> 01:19:22,080
I still vividly remember
you saying that.

923
01:19:26,985 --> 01:19:27,886
So,

924
01:19:30,789 --> 01:19:32,124
I like it here.

925
01:19:34,092 --> 01:19:36,795
The home, the neighborhood,
the shop? I like it all.

926
01:19:38,897 --> 01:19:39,898
I haven't given up on anything.

927
01:19:41,633 --> 01:19:43,468
It's not that I'm here
because I have to be.

928
01:19:45,804 --> 01:19:47,639
I'm here because I want to be.

929
01:20:19,438 --> 01:20:20,187
Ji-eun.

930
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:21,206
Where's Ji-eun?

931
01:20:22,507 --> 01:20:24,209
She went to get tested...

932
01:20:25,977 --> 01:20:28,980
What? What's wrong with her?

933
01:20:30,449 --> 01:20:33,418
We did a blood test
first and are now waiting.

934
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,955
Are you Kang Ji-eun's guardian?

935
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,226
Yes. I'm Ji-eun's brother.

936
01:20:42,361 --> 01:20:43,612
Attending Doctor It's late today,

937
01:20:43,695 --> 01:20:45,497
so you'll need to go through
the admission process.

938
01:20:46,064 --> 01:20:48,117
First, and
the detailed examination

939
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,468
will be conducted
tomorrow morning.

940
01:20:50,335 --> 01:20:53,205
Why? Is my sister very sick?

941
01:20:57,843 --> 01:21:01,546
We suspect
it's myelogenous leukemia

942
01:21:02,013 --> 01:21:05,317
but we'll know for sure
after tomorrow's test.

943
01:21:37,616 --> 01:21:39,335
How about starting

944
01:21:39,418 --> 01:21:41,170
with medication
and injection treatments

945
01:21:41,253 --> 01:21:42,538
while preparing for

946
01:21:42,621 --> 01:21:44,055
a hematopoietic
stem cell transplant?

947
01:21:44,523 --> 01:21:49,528
Yes, I'll proceed with
the transplant right away.

948
01:21:51,763 --> 01:21:55,033
Being siblings,
you're likely the best match...

949
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,453
but it might be good to check

950
01:21:57,536 --> 01:21:59,704
if other family members
are also a match.

951
01:22:02,107 --> 01:22:05,327
Uh... if it's not
a family member...

952
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:06,411
is it difficult?

953
01:22:07,879 --> 01:22:09,247
I thought you were her brother.

954
01:22:11,383 --> 01:22:12,984
Well, yes...

955
01:22:28,099 --> 01:22:30,786
Hey! That's not right! Wrong!

956
01:22:30,869 --> 01:22:32,821
What's wrong!

957
01:22:32,904 --> 01:22:35,307
You caught it like
this after it fell.

958
01:22:36,808 --> 01:22:37,943
No!

959
01:22:39,611 --> 01:22:40,829
Wow.

960
01:22:40,912 --> 01:22:42,931
I let you win three more times.

961
01:22:43,014 --> 01:22:44,199
It's not fair
anymore. It's my turn.

962
01:22:44,282 --> 01:22:45,951
It's mine.

963
01:22:48,286 --> 01:22:50,121
Really, that's not fair.

964
01:22:50,689 --> 01:22:51,623
(Ki-hoon)

965
01:22:53,358 --> 01:22:55,844
Okay, okay. This is the last time.

966
01:22:55,927 --> 01:22:57,162
I can't let it slide anymore.

967
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:06,671
Uh.

968
01:23:07,672 --> 01:23:09,608
How's Ji-eun doing?

969
01:23:11,977 --> 01:23:12,844
Uh...

970
01:23:13,645 --> 01:23:15,547
Acute myeloid leukemia...

971
01:23:16,848 --> 01:23:18,550
They said a transplant
has a high cure rate...

972
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:23,655
but I can't be the donor.

973
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:28,460
Because the genetic
types have to match...

974
01:23:32,464 --> 01:23:34,566
Your mom... would be difficult?

975
01:23:36,635 --> 01:23:39,204
Mom can't even remember
her name. How could she?

976
01:23:39,671 --> 01:23:42,841
It's too risky.

977
01:23:44,242 --> 01:23:45,210
Right...

978
01:23:46,678 --> 01:23:48,547
You need her consent
for the paperwork...

979
01:23:50,015 --> 01:23:51,816
This is insane.

980
01:23:53,818 --> 01:23:56,087
How are you holding up?
Are you okay?

981
01:23:57,355 --> 01:23:59,090
What about Ji-eun?
Did you admit her?

982
01:24:00,825 --> 01:24:03,862
Yeah. They said to start
with the injection treatments...

983
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:08,934
Jang-mi. I'm really sorry but...

984
01:24:10,268 --> 01:24:13,338
could you stay a bit
longer with our mom?

985
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:15,774
Of course.

986
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:19,995
She's eating well, staying well

987
01:24:20,078 --> 01:24:21,646
so don't worry too much.

988
01:24:22,247 --> 01:24:24,482
Thanks. Call me
if anything happens.

989
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,118
Yeah, I got it.

990
01:24:32,691 --> 01:24:33,592
Why's Ji-eun at the hospital?

991
01:24:35,293 --> 01:24:36,695
She's sick, in the hospital...

992
01:24:38,964 --> 01:24:39,864
Hey.

993
01:24:40,532 --> 01:24:41,399
Lead the way.

994
01:24:42,367 --> 01:24:43,852
That... I can't do that.

995
01:24:43,935 --> 01:24:44,853
Why not.

996
01:24:44,936 --> 01:24:46,571
Ki-hoon would be mad at me!

997
01:24:47,472 --> 01:24:48,991
Just tell me where
the hospital is.

998
01:24:49,074 --> 01:24:50,158
I can't.

999
01:24:50,241 --> 01:24:53,562
Don't worry too much
since Ki-hoon is with her.

1000
01:24:53,645 --> 01:24:54,980
You're really not
going to tell me?

1001
01:24:57,148 --> 01:24:58,634
I'm hungry...

1002
01:24:58,717 --> 01:25:01,303
Aren't you hungry? Let's go eat.

1003
01:25:01,386 --> 01:25:04,373
Hey. How sick is she?

1004
01:25:04,456 --> 01:25:06,241
They said it's not too serious.

1005
01:25:06,324 --> 01:25:08,493
Ah, I'm so hungry. Let's go eat.

1006
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:26,511
What are you doing?

1007
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:32,651
You're awake?

1008
01:25:36,287 --> 01:25:40,325
You being here as my guardian...

1009
01:25:41,326 --> 01:25:43,128
really doesn't feel great...

1010
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:52,303
The way my sister's talking,
must be all better.

1011
01:25:55,373 --> 01:25:56,374
Are you in pain anywhere?

1012
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:00,178
Where's Mom?

1013
01:26:04,616 --> 01:26:05,483
At home.

1014
01:26:07,485 --> 01:26:08,887
She's with Jang-mi.

1015
01:26:11,623 --> 01:26:12,557
You know what?

1016
01:26:16,661 --> 01:26:21,032
I only recently found out

1017
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:25,036
why Mom always
slept with the lights on.

1018
01:26:26,204 --> 01:26:27,138
Why?

1019
01:26:29,874 --> 01:26:31,843
I thought it was
because she was afraid...

1020
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,433
She wanted you to come home

1021
01:26:38,516 --> 01:26:40,518
to a bright and welcoming house...

1022
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:43,855
not dark and gloomy...

1023
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:47,425
for you to come home to light...

1024
01:26:49,994 --> 01:26:51,663
You should go now... leave.

1025
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,601
No.

1026
01:27:07,879 --> 01:27:08,780
I'm sorry...

1027
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:15,186
I'm sorry for making
you share the love

1028
01:27:16,588 --> 01:27:18,389
that should have been yours
alone from our parents...

1029
01:27:21,693 --> 01:27:22,627
I'm sorry for the times
I wasn't enough...

1030
01:27:24,129 --> 01:27:26,297
for the hardship
and hurt I caused.

1031
01:27:37,308 --> 01:27:38,743
It's time to eat.

1032
01:27:42,714 --> 01:27:44,415
Where did you go?

1033
01:27:47,652 --> 01:27:48,520
You know what?

1034
01:27:50,822 --> 01:27:51,689
Ms. Oh!

1035
01:27:57,662 --> 01:27:58,563
Ms. Oh!

1036
01:27:59,731 --> 01:28:00,598
Ms. Oh!

1037
01:28:01,432 --> 01:28:04,102
Ah... really, where
did she go this time?

1038
01:28:04,969 --> 01:28:06,922
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1039
01:28:07,005 --> 01:28:08,306
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1040
01:28:08,973 --> 01:28:10,141
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1041
01:28:17,348 --> 01:28:18,583
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1042
01:28:19,517 --> 01:28:21,419
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1043
01:28:22,487 --> 01:28:23,755
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1044
01:28:24,589 --> 01:28:25,824
My daughter is Kang Ji-eun.

1045
01:28:26,357 --> 01:28:29,194
Born June 24, 1999.

1046
01:28:33,298 --> 01:28:34,165
Yeah.

1047
01:28:34,599 --> 01:28:36,618
She's not here.

1048
01:28:36,701 --> 01:28:38,770
It doesn't seem like
she walked this way.

1049
01:28:40,505 --> 01:28:41,890
Did she go to Ji-eun's hospital?

1050
01:28:41,973 --> 01:28:43,525
How could she just
go to the hospital

1051
01:28:43,608 --> 01:28:45,627
without knowing which one it is?

1052
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:47,679
Ah... right..

1053
01:28:48,646 --> 01:28:49,948
Did she head to the main road?

1054
01:28:52,717 --> 01:28:53,818
I'll go check.

1055
01:28:59,557 --> 01:29:01,326
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1056
01:29:02,493 --> 01:29:04,479
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1057
01:29:04,562 --> 01:29:05,830
My daughter is Kang Ji-eun.

1058
01:29:06,397 --> 01:29:09,234
Born June 24, 1999.

1059
01:29:11,469 --> 01:29:12,403
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1060
01:29:13,671 --> 01:29:16,507
Kang Ji-eun. Born June 24, 1999.

1061
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:20,395
Type A, Aspirin intolerance.

1062
01:29:20,478 --> 01:29:22,413
I can't take aspirin
because of an intolerance.

1063
01:29:24,015 --> 01:29:25,049
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1064
01:29:25,984 --> 01:29:26,985
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1065
01:30:18,903 --> 01:30:19,804
Isn't that Ms. Oh over there?

1066
01:30:21,105 --> 01:30:21,973
Pull over.

1067
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,859
Grab the umbrella.

1068
01:30:23,942 --> 01:30:24,809
Yeah.

1069
01:30:30,415 --> 01:30:32,467
Ms. Oh!

1070
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:35,804
How can you just leave
without saying anything!

1071
01:30:35,887 --> 01:30:37,322
Oh... you're all wet.

1072
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,975
Are you bleeding?

1073
01:30:40,058 --> 01:30:41,042
Get in the car, okay?

1074
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:42,077
Get in. Hurry.

1075
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:45,163
Ji-eun. I need to
get to Ji-eun. Quickly.

1076
01:30:47,165 --> 01:30:49,818
Alright, alright. Let's go. Go!

1077
01:30:49,901 --> 01:30:51,602
To the hospital! I'll take you.

1078
01:31:10,621 --> 01:31:11,489
Safety belt.

1079
01:31:32,176 --> 01:31:35,297
My name is Oh Mi-yeon.

1080
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,866
1999... 1999... 99...

1081
01:31:37,949 --> 01:31:38,883
99...

1082
01:31:40,518 --> 01:31:42,704
99... born June 24th.

1083
01:31:42,787 --> 01:31:44,105
- Type A. Type A.
- Ms. Oh...

1084
01:31:44,188 --> 01:31:48,143
Born weighing 2.8 kg.
Our... there... doctor...

1085
01:31:48,226 --> 01:31:49,144
Mom...

1086
01:31:49,227 --> 01:31:52,063
Ki-hoon... Where's Ji-eun?
Where's Ji-eun?

1087
01:32:01,873 --> 01:32:02,840
Mom...

1088
01:32:04,776 --> 01:32:05,894
Ji-eun...

1089
01:32:05,977 --> 01:32:06,978
Mom...

1090
01:32:08,579 --> 01:32:09,514
Ji-eun...

1091
01:32:16,254 --> 01:32:17,488
Ji-eun...

1092
01:32:17,989 --> 01:32:18,956
My baby.

1093
01:32:25,496 --> 01:32:27,248
It's going to be okay... My baby.

1094
01:32:27,331 --> 01:32:28,699
It's okay. Don't cry.

1095
01:32:30,535 --> 01:32:31,653
It's okay.

1096
01:32:31,736 --> 01:32:33,404
Mom...

1097
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:37,208
(Transplant
Consulting Center)

1098
01:32:39,377 --> 01:32:41,546
We just need your
signature on the last part.

1099
01:33:05,336 --> 01:33:08,606
(Oh Mi...)

1100
01:33:10,575 --> 01:33:16,013
(Oh Mi-yeon)

1101
01:34:17,942 --> 01:34:20,311
I feel suffocated.

1102
01:34:21,812 --> 01:34:23,147
You'll catch a cold!

1103
01:34:31,355 --> 01:34:32,523
If you listen to me,
I'll give it to you.

1104
01:34:33,891 --> 01:34:34,792
Pff.

1105
01:35:01,352 --> 01:35:03,638
The mom who once talked
to me about facing forward,

1106
01:35:03,721 --> 01:35:05,823
dreaming and the future,

1107
01:35:06,424 --> 01:35:08,392
is now turning towards the past.

1108
01:35:10,027 --> 01:35:13,348
Even the jumbled memories

1109
01:35:13,431 --> 01:35:16,117
she had are fading away.

1110
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,068
Mom.

1111
01:35:18,069 --> 01:35:20,571
Mister. No jellies.

1112
01:35:22,039 --> 01:35:22,907
Audrey.

1113
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:24,909
Huh?

1114
01:35:26,377 --> 01:35:29,213
Can I be your son?

1115
01:35:30,648 --> 01:35:34,518
Can I be Ki-hoon's mom?

1116
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:41,125
Let me be Ki-hoon's mom.

1117
01:35:43,961 --> 01:35:46,464
Let me be your son. Okay?

1118
01:35:52,803 --> 01:35:53,771
Okay!

1119
01:35:55,072 --> 01:35:57,875
Let's do that. I understand.

1120
01:36:11,989 --> 01:36:13,391
What are you two doing?

1121
01:36:18,763 --> 01:36:20,215
Leaving me to run errands

1122
01:36:20,298 --> 01:36:21,666
and you two cooing
over each other.

1123
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:24,068
That's too much.

1124
01:36:25,603 --> 01:36:29,106
Brother, I'm Mom's
guardian now. You know that?

1125
01:36:29,774 --> 01:36:30,641
I'm not sure...

1126
01:36:31,509 --> 01:36:32,427
She's mine...

1127
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:33,428
Ah!

1128
01:36:33,511 --> 01:36:34,429
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

1129
01:36:34,512 --> 01:36:35,530
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

1130
01:36:35,613 --> 01:36:36,931
- I said she's mine.
- I'm telling you, she's mine.

1131
01:36:37,014 --> 01:36:38,666
The chair's going to
flip. She's mine.

1132
01:36:38,749 --> 01:36:42,286
Stop it! I can't breathe..

1133
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:44,038
- Mom!
- She's our mom. She's mine.

1134
01:36:44,121 --> 01:36:45,707
- She's our mom!
- I was the first to be with her!

1135
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:46,708
What's with this kid?

1136
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:47,709
- If you came late...
- She's our mom.

1137
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:50,845
- If you came late...
- Coming late or not...

1138
01:36:50,928 --> 01:36:52,113
- Mom! Mom!
- Save me! Save me!

1139
01:36:52,196 --> 01:36:54,048
Mom, you're mine! Right?

1140
01:36:54,131 --> 01:36:55,450
- You're mine.
- Hey! Kang Ji-eun.

1141
01:36:55,533 --> 01:36:56,701
Hey! This. The cup....

1142
01:37:03,007 --> 01:37:04,975
Thank you for coming, Ms Oh.

1143
01:37:08,512 --> 01:37:09,480
It came out well...

1144
01:37:10,147 --> 01:37:11,699
Where's Mom's photo?

1145
01:37:11,782 --> 01:37:12,800
Mom's photo?

1146
01:37:12,883 --> 01:37:14,235
Yeah, where could Mom be?

1147
01:37:14,318 --> 01:37:15,453
Mom... where are you?

1148
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,355
Here it is.

1149
01:37:19,724 --> 01:37:21,309
She's really pretty. Our mom.

1150
01:37:21,392 --> 01:37:24,479
Really pretty. Mom. Wow!

1151
01:37:24,562 --> 01:37:25,813
Our mom is the prettiest.

1152
01:37:25,896 --> 01:37:27,215
Ah.. right. The prettiest.

1153
01:37:27,298 --> 01:37:29,133
Told you my photography skills
would make it look like this.

1154
01:37:47,685 --> 01:37:51,655
My name is Audrey.

1155
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:56,394
Au... Drey!
