1
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,520
I'm sorry for making you feel scared.

2
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,190
But to be honest,

3
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,260
I'm scared, too.

4
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,760
Mom, I'm so scared.

5
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,710
- Mom, I'm scared.
- It's okay.

6
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,510
I wanted to tell you that.

7
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,170
Mom...

8
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry, Mom.

9
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,220
After clumsily embracing the feelings

10
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,030
that we had given up on expressing,

11
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,660
just like magic,

12
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,240
the times that were hidden between us

13
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,520
started revealing themselves.

14
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,480
Payment received.

15
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,290
Here's the receipt.

16
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,010
Submit the prescription in the corner of that hallway

17
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,830
and pick up the medicine.

18
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,660
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.

19
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,450
- I'll pick up the medicine.
- Okay.

20
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,100
I think she will take awhile. Should we wait in the car?

21
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,600
- Aren't you tired?
- No.

22
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,000
- Auntie.
- Yes.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,990
Mom will live with me here for a while.

24
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,990
Really?

25
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,480
- Did you two talk yesterday?
- Yes.

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,140
Gosh. Good job. Good job.

27
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,280
You could've honestly talked about

28
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,500
how you felt from the beginning.

29
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,290
You heard about building a house, right?

30
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,240
I feel relieved after telling you.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,990
Being honest is always the best.

32
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,700
"House"? What house?

33
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,700
Are we building a house?

34
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,740
- Huh?
- Huh?

35
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,610
Build what?

36
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,690
I'll cook instead.

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,600
Because I'm a cook.

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,590
Geez. Oh, no...

39
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,340
Well,

40
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,890
the thing is, Hyo Ri...

41
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,420
Don't get angry and listen.

42
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,650
All done. Let's go.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why is she in a bad mood? Why are you giving me a stink eye?

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,470
I heard someone is planning to fix up an abandoned house.

45
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,170
I told everything.

46
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,280
I heard there isn't a single house nearby.

47
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,150
Without even a door, it's assumed it was vacant for decades.

48
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,370
I asked her what's good about it, and after much thought, she came up with

49
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,820
how it's like renting the entire mountain.

50
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,710
What a ridiculous answer.

51
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,210
Geez.

52
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,500
What are you talking about?

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,440
It's... It's a very beautiful traditional house.

54
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,970
People in the village call it a mansion.

55
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,520
- Yes, yes.
- Ask the corner store lady.

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,990
Let's go there, then.

57
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,100
Go where?

58
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,270
Let's go to the traditional house called a mansion.

59
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,710
Let's go.

60
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,850
You can go later. Later...

61
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,800
Hyo Ri, let's go later!

62
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:16,000
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
✨ The Marvellous ✨ Team @ Viki.com

63
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,970
Why are you stopping?

64
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,240
We're in the neighborhood,

65
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,200
- but let's rest today since you're tired.
- No.

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,590
Let's go right now.

67
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,600
Yes. It's better to get it over with.

68
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,250
I'm not the only one who's tired of him, right?

69
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,820
No, definitely not.

70
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

71
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,260
Are you going home? Give us a ride, too.

72
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,550
No, we aren't going home. We need to stop by somewhere.

73
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,280
Where?

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,540
It looks like you're going somewhere really nice.

75
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,780
- Let's follow them.
- No, why...

76
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,700
Get in. Let's go. Just get in.

77
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,910
Should we scooch a bit?

78
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,240
Yes, yes.

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,260
A little more. A little more. Right.

80
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,430
- Keep going. Nice.
- My goodness. What in the world.

81
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,020
Oh, yeah. Go, go, go.

82
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,100
This isn't reality.

83
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Hey, give her time. This house takes

84
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,060
some time to get used to it.

85
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,700
It... It feels so exotic!

86
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,620
"Exotic"? Do you mean, the scenery is exotic or something?

87
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,910
Right here. This part.

89
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,900
Over here.

90
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,780
It's Serengeti!

91
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,830
If you put a few lions here like in a jungle,

92
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,760
- it'd be exactly like Serengeti.
- There are no lions.

93
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,500
There are many boars in the mountains.

94
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,700
There are wild dogs too. That's why it's Serengeti.

95
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,890
Right.

96
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,140
- Good.
- Bo Hyeon,

97
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,890
if boars and wild dogs fought, who'd win?

98
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,050
- That's not important right now.
- No. What's important now?

99
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,750
Checking this place out is. Come here.

100
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,530
Wow, daebak. Look here.

101
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,140
Come over here.

102
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,390
Why is he here?

103
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,700
I came since the borough office is doing due diligence for repurposing.

104
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Did you bring Hyo Ri to show her the house?

105
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,600
Thanks to someone, I'm having an open house for the whole neighborhood.

106
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,800
Hey, keep it short. Keep it short.

107
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,950
Wow, daebak.

108
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,600
- Why are they here?
- Hyung!

109
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,250
This is...

110
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,630
totally daebak. I mean...

111
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,630
the inside and outside are completely...

112
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,600
bizarre.

113
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,000
I think this is a very attractive house.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,090
Really, it's daebak.

115
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,500
He's the only one on my side, but I don't feel comforted at all.

116
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,000
I think I saw this house in a drama.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,870
A drama? What drama?

118
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,060
Kingdom.

119
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,850
I know that one.

120
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,240
Zombies walk on roofs and stuff.

121
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,810
Must be nice. You're so knowledgeable.

122
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,090
The borough office people are here.

123
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,400
- Hello.
- Hi.

124
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,110
That house is really no good.

125
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,160
No way.

126
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,340
You saw the borough office employees earlier, right?

127
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,210
We already got the paperwork done.

128
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,520
The house has been abandoned,

129
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,230
but it'd be nice if we fixed it up well.

130
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,480
It's so hard to find a house

131
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,930
with a view like that these days.

132
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,540
That house is what people call...

133
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,920
the mountain and water location.

134
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,700
Is there a river in front of the house?

135
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,300
- Mountain and water?
- Mountain after mountain, more like.

136
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,110
To fix the house,

137
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,400
it'd cost a lot of money. Do you have money?

138
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,100
I have to go to the hospital now. We'd have a lot of expenses.

139
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,380
And will you stop working now?

140
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,920
Whether you get back to work or get a new job, you have to return to Seoul.

141
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,130
Why would you build a house here?

142
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,070
I have severance pay and a security deposit.

143
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,620
And with that money, we'll upgrade the annex

144
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,590
with Auntie Seon Yeong and open a restaurant.

145
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,340
Restaurant?

146
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,250
Can you cook or have a good personality?

147
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,800
- Restaurant?
- You diss me to my face?

148
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,250
Just give up. We already got the paperwork done.

149
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,380
I'll call them and cancel it tomorrow.

150
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,300
- It's all over.
- I said you can't-

151
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,500
Huh? Bo Hyeon.

152
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,590
Don't worry. We're joking around.

153
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,110
You know, on National Geographic,

154
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,980
the mom and baby growl and play around.

155
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,330
That's what we're doing now, right?

156
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,080
No.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,900
Can I get your 'best help' tomorrow?

158
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,300
- Sure.
- Let's leave at seven, then.

159
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,170
Okay.

160
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,440
- See you.
- Okay.

161
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,120
Gosh.

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,520
What's the 'best help'?

163
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,960
Here comes the next box.

164
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,250
It has a red label on it.

165
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,500
Mixed colored roses. There's another box, right?

166
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,300
- Yes, another one.
- Okay.

167
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,800
Red roses are here...

168
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,740
You're a good worker.

169
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,040
I can tell she went to medical school.

170
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,170
She's good at everything.

171
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,800
Will these really become flowers?

172
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,390
This is called propagation.

173
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,400
If you cultivate a branch from the mother plant,

174
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,700
it becomes a seedling.

175
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,890
If you plant the seedling in a pot,

176
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,780
it grows flowers.

177
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,950
How fascinating.

178
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,900
Flowers and people need to grow up away from their mother.

179
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,200
If the mother coddles too much,

180
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,800
you can't develop on your own.

181
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,050
Look at me.

182
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,920
Because my mom raised me free-range,

183
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,900
I turned out so well.

184
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,050
You're right.

185
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,770
You were basically a calf.

186
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,500
She made you leave at sunrise

187
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,900
and not let you come home before sunset.

188
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,400
How could you call a person a calf?

189
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,210
- What?
- How about a bull?

190
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,110
Have a cow, man.

191
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,380
Bo Hyeon, bring more cases from the storage.

192
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,020
Okay.

193
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,900
I think she was raised like a plant in a greenhouse.

194
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,630
When a plant in a greenhouse becomes a human,

195
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,380
it becomes a bookworm.

196
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,230
A foxtail?

197
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,300
What?

198
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,100
I wasn't a plant in a greenhouse, but a foxtail.

199
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,050
You have to let wild plants grow naturally,

200
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,100
but my mom wanted to raise me well.

201
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
But she couldn't afford to put me in a greenhouse.

202
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,000
So, she kept watering the weed on the path.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Not knowing I drowned and ran out of oxygen.

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,600
I was like a sick foxtail that barely

205
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,180
managed to survive.

206
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,270
I was more like that than a plant in a greenhouse.

207
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,390
She's different because she went to medical school.

208
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,900
Look how eloquent she is.

209
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,300
I like Bo Hyeon.

210
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,950
How about you?

211
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,900
How about you, Ms. Foxtail?

212
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,100
I have high standards.

213
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
Hey. Bo Hyeon is a good guy, okay?

214
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,900
I know. So, I'm considering liking him.

215
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,200
Wow, Bo Hyeon. Lucky you.

216
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,500
Stop being silly and finish the rest.

217
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,690
I'll stop by the post office on the way home.

218
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,610
That's okay, right?

219
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,480
I think we can get up to four rooms.

220
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,700
I think the size would be awkward.

221
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,000
It won't be impossible to extend the rafters.

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,270
- Okay.
- Oh, really?

223
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,600
If this becomes spacious, it'd feel more open.

224
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,300
The beams are stronger than expected. I think it'd be okay.

225
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,700
Gosh, seriously.

226
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
You're so smart.

227
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,320
Pardon?

228
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,770
- Huh? Well, no.
- Stop.

229
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,630
You're so intelligent and...

230
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,230
How should I say? Attentive.

231
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,480
You're like that.

232
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,800
You said you know a demolition team, right?

233
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,300
Pardon?

234
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,500
I got a call.

235
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,210
Yes, sir.

236
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,930
He got a call.

237
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,060
Don't worry about the construction team.

238
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,900
I'll assist you closely by your side.

239
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,700
By my side? Assist? Why?

240
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,380
Oh, he doesn't know.

241
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,300
I'm pretty experienced in this field. Pretty experienced.

242
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,320
- Okay, stop.
- Yes, I'll help you.

243
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,270
I'll do my best. Don't worry.

244
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,140
I'll stay right by your side.

245
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,950
I should go to Seoul to check out materials.

246
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,900
Really? Let me come with you.

247
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,000
Check out the materials, meet the construction team

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,790
- and see our place, too.
- Okay, okay.

249
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,800
Should we go get makgeolli since we're in a good mood?

250
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,580
- What makgeolli?
- How does that sound?

251
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,070
Let's go. You and I.

252
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,300
- Where? Where? Just us two?
- Get makgeolli.

253
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,800
- They would feel left out, then.
- It's okay.

254
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,010
Don't feel left out. Come!

255
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,950
- I'm sorry.
- W-What's wrong with her?

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,200
Thank you.

257
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,480
Sorry. I was going to go soon.

258
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,000
There are so many hidden hot spots here, right?

259
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,700
You're right.

260
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,930
It's so pretty.

261
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,220
Follow me.

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,200
Sorry. What do I do?

263
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,900
- I'm sorry, too.
- No, I set my foot wrong.

265
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,150
I apologized in advance, okay?

266
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,800
Are you crazy?

267
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,400
No.

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,690
You're wet now.

269
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,300
You can cross daringly without being afraid now.

270
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,000
The worst that could happen is your feet getting a bit wetter.

271
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Don't be scared.

272
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,620
You're right.

273
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,590
I was scared for no reason.

274
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,740
It feels nice and cool.

275
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,700
Hey, you...

276
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,100
Stop!

277
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,620
Are you okay? Are you okay?

278
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,540
Am I okay?

279
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,070
Hold on. Hold on. Time out.

280
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,990
What are you thinking about?

281
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,920
What? I'm not thinking.

282
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,430
Let's leave at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

283
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,660
Okay.

284
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,800
Are you going somewhere?

285
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,800
I need to sort things out at home tomorrow

286
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,640
and your mom is meeting with the construction team.

287
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
Will you really build that house?

288
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,300
Yes, I'll take care of it.

289
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,700
Don't try to argue.

290
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,800
Are you dead?

291
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,030
Come quickly.

292
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,600
Auntie, I'll go to Seoul tomorrow, too.

293
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,900
Did something come up?

294
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,300
Are you in pain, by chance?

295
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,500
I'm not.

296
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm totally fine.

297
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,870
Hey, dry your hair first.

298
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,900
- We'll go.
- Okay, bye.

299
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
- Shall we?
- Yes.

300
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,800
We have a tight schedule today.

301
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Take a nap. I'll wake you up when we arrive.

302
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,200
How could I sleep now?

303
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,000
Let's discuss the plan on the way

304
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,900
and we should check our schedule again.

305
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,800
We're in an emergency based on the current schedule.

306
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,600
And I'm too sensitive to sleep when someone's driving.

307
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,530
Emergency, she said?

308
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,120
What? Sensitive, she said?

309
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,590
You should have some, too.

310
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,260
I'm so relieved that you guys made up.

311
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,970
Because you're just like me,

312
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,700
you don't hold grudges, right?

313
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,220
I went to medical school because I resemble you.

314
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,130
- I couldn't go near it if I took after Mom.
- That's right!

315
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,610
You're exactly like me.

316
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,200
Of course.

317
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,390
You're perceptive and smart like me.

318
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,880
- By the way...
- Yes?

319
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm not sure...

320
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,410
what I should tell Suk about my illness.

321
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,570
Why would you worry?

322
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,410
It's Suk.

323
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,710
She understands how you feel better than you.

324
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,590
You're right.

325
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,360
It's Suk.

326
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,310
Why did I worry?

327
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,510
Even if you don't explain everything,

328
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,660
she'll feel it in her heart.

329
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,050
We're like that, too.

330
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,750
I...

331
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,380
don't always have to explain.

332
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,950
Hey!

333
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,760
Let's go. Let's go.

334
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,830
Just take it.

335
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,390
Lee Hyo Ri!

336
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm here.

337
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,990
- Be quiet.
- What took you so long?

338
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,480
What?

339
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,560
Hyo Ri!

340
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,740
Are you sure you made an appointment? It's been an hour.

341
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,910
Fieldwork doesn't end on time.

342
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,850
Things always change.

343
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,900
You should know better.

344
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,050
Are you bored?

345
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,260
Should we play word chain? Loser gets flicked on the head.

346
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,610
I'm fine. I don't want to-

347
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,400
Woryoil*. Five...
(Means "Monday")

348
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,500
- I said I don't want to.
- Four. Three. Two...

349
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,650
- Yilgwangyok*. (Means "sunbathing")
- Yok?

350
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,740
Yokjeong*.
(Means "lust")

351
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,270
- Hey. Come on...
- Five. Four...

352
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,300
- Three.
- Jeong, jeong...

353
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,700
- Two.
- Jeongyok*. Jeongyok! (Also means "lust")

354
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,980
Hey, are you crazy?

355
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,670
Why did you hit me? I said the word.

356
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,000
You ran out of time.

357
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,200
The simpler the game, the more suspenseful it needs to be to be fun.

358
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,400
And your word choice is too explicit.

359
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,720
Hey. You started it...

360
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,150
Let's start over.

361
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,200
I'll start.

362
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,840
- Sangiseuk*. (Means "foothill")
- Manager Lee!

363
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,380
Chief. Let's go.

364
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,000
Go where? We need to play another round.

365
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,090
Oppa, we're turning 50 soon.

366
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,500
Geez. Hurry up and come.

367
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,990
Shit.

368
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I almost peed my pants when I saw your mom that day.

369
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,840
I was scared. How are you still fine?

370
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,360
Congratulations on coming back.

371
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,100
- Congrats.
- My friend.

372
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,400
- Cheers.
- Yes.

373
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,900
The sunset, the weather, and the beer.

374
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,050
I've been waiting for this day.

375
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,470
I'll finish the beer and talk.

376
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,360
The worksite isn't large,

377
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,160
but it won't be easy since it's an old building.

378
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,120
That doesn't matter.

379
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,870
It's Manager Lee's house.

380
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,530
I'll plaster the house even if it were on top of the mountain.

381
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,030
You're all talk.

382
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,680
Another bottle of soju, please.

383
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,720
- Okay.
- Mr. Jeong should be coming, too.

384
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,930
Mr. Jeong?

385
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,490
He must be busy with the retail complex in Songdo.

386
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,360
I bragged to him that I'm building your house.

387
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,310
And he got angry, saying, "Why didn't she tell me?"

388
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,400
It's because I know how busy he is.

389
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,620
You realize it when the titles come off.

390
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,500
How you've lived your life.

391
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,950
Manager Lee, you led a good life.

392
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,140
Many people are helping you.

393
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,360
You heard him, right?

394
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,000
Here.

395
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,900
Manager Lee, don't disappoint us like this.

396
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,320
Hey!

397
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,740
- Seriously.
- Hello.

398
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,740
You bastards. They came as soon as they heard.

399
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,550
This is what's wrong with you. You're too selfless.

400
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,350
That's why I came so quickly.

401
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,440
Sit down quickly, then. Sit.

402
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,180
Bring us more soju.

403
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,860
- Okay.
- Manager Lee!

404
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,290
Come in! Come in! Sit.

405
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,660
A box of soju, please.

406
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,450
Hey, hey.

407
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,910
Manager Lee,

408
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,500
we bet on something.

409
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,400
- You need to tell us the truth.
- Okay.

410
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
- We go further back, right?
- What do you mean?

411
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,860
- We've known each other for 14 years.
- 14 years...

412
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,500
Right. Mr. Han started in Euiwang in 2014.

413
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,950
Mr. Choi started in Gwangju. So, it was 2018.

414
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,220
- Yes!
- Okay!

415
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,720
Let's drink!

416
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,590
Let's drink! Let's drink!

417
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,900
Free drinks taste the best.

418
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,100
It's been too long.

419
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,500
I had no one to come with since you were gone. I'm so happy right now.

420
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,750
It's because you're too picky with people.

421
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,000
Who's she? Was it Min Jeong in your department?

422
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,650
- You said she's all right.
- Gosh.

423
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,420
I can't hang out with the MZ Generation.

424
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,500
Kids these days don't have respect for their elders.

425
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,600
You can't be that elder, who's only two years older, right?

426
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,300
Between her and I,

427
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,820
- there's a hurdle, which is her eyelashes.
- What?

428
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,780
She wears eyelashes that look like fingers.

429
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,760
Whenever she blinks when I'm talking to her,

430
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,600
I feel the wind on my face from her eyelashes.

431
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,150
- I can't hear anything she says.
- That makes no sense.

432
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,290
It's true.

433
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,250
What's this?

434
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,690
What is it?

435
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,440
What?

436
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,600
Lee Hyo Ri, what is it?

437
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,100
Sorry.

438
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,560
Fine. I'm not sorry.

439
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,600
I won't tell you to cheer up.

440
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,610
Let's have fun.

441
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,330
Quit your silly studies

442
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,350
and do whatever you want.

443
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,860
Fail, ruin things,

444
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,680
and live a messy and fun life.

445
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,130
Okay?

446
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,060
Let's really live however we want.

447
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,500
I swear I will.

448
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,430
Yes. That's it. Okay.

449
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,600
I'll go to Cheonghae when the semester ends.

450
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,000
Let's have tons of fun.

451
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,360
We sure will. You have to come, okay?

452
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,570
Okay, I'll come.

453
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,410
I'm off.

454
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,340
Cheers!

455
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,960
Someone's here.

456
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,260
- What?
- Hyo Ri.

457
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,860
- Lee Hyo Ri!
- Hyo Ri!

458
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,970
Manager Lee, she's so pretty.

459
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,230
Right? She's my daughter.

460
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,980
She's pretty because she's my daughter.

461
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,600
Daughter, where are you?

462
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,100
- Dad.
- You scared me.

463
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,680
Hey, why aren't you home yet?

464
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,340
Where are you?

465
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,650
Should I come arrest you?

466
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,280
Dad.

467
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,640
What?

468
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,990
I have no money.

469
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,010
Mom caught me giving you money and...

470
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,330
Hey, I'll die if I get caught again.

471
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,220
What?

472
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,200
What's wrong, Suk?

473
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,100
What's wrong?

474
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,050
Dad,

475
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,600
H-Hyo Ri...

476
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,730
She's sick.

477
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,280
But not knowing that,

478
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,880
I texted asking if she was dead...

479
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,820
What do I do, Dad?

480
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,710
What do I do, Dad?

481
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,990
Dad, what do I do?

482
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,280
Oh, no... Gosh.

483
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,990
Suk.

484
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,570
Drink, drink.

485
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,210
Have another glass. Have another glass.

486
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,780
- Have some.
- Okay.

487
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,230
Don't be like that.

488
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,570
Thank you.

489
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,050
That doesn't taste good.

490
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,970
I don't get it.

491
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,600
Just like Anchorwoman Baek Ji Yeon,

492
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,620
I'll become a carrier woman.

493
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,380
You want to become a carrier?

494
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,780
Career. Not carrier, you fool.

495
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,820
Don't be such a stickler.

496
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,720
You understand what I was saying.

497
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,410
Why would you be nitpicky?

498
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,770
If you're so smart,

499
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,200
why do you get chicken and kitchen mixed up?

500
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,410
That's not...

501
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,090
I'll be back.

502
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,680
- I'll pour you one.
- By the way...

503
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,760
Hyo Ri, you know...

504
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,970
Looking at her face,

505
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,930
I can tell she had an...

506
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,570
appendix surgery when she was in the 9th grade.

507
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,750
How did you know that?

508
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,100
To be honest,

509
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,230
that's why I became good friends with your mom.

510
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,900
The end has to be thicker.

511
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,630
Apply more on the side.

512
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,210
Why don't you do it yourself?

513
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,430
Why is she nitpicking?

514
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,990
I'm not nitpicking.

515
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,170
It's a necessary step. Fix it.

516
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,100
A female manager at a construction site?

517
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,740
Gosh, it's hard.

518
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,780
You can't do that unless you're really gutsy.

519
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,180
All the people in this field...

520
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,530
have quite a bit of temper.

521
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,890
Director, remove the pins

522
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,400
and polish the surface, too.

523
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,500
I was going to do all that, anyway.

524
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,800
I was going to check this first.

525
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,160
I already had a plan, okay?

526
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,350
Do I have to read your mind, too?

527
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,470
Work in the normal order.

528
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,480
Do you know how to finish walls?

529
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,940
I'm working hard. If you know nothing...

530
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,460
She was obviously right,

531
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,260
but she kept giving orders.

532
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,500
To be honest, I didn't like her at first, either.

533
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,730
A lot of you were...

534
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,100
determined to teach her a lesson, right?

535
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,600
Remember Mr. Park from Taean Supplies?

536
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,580
- Yes, yes.
- He even slapped her in the face.

537
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,760
Because the order got canceled.

538
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,940
But she didn't even bat an eye.

539
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,400
Gosh, she's tough. Yes.

540
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,030
I thought, "I shouldn't get involved with her," at first.

541
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,860
But...

542
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,580
Geez.

543
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,800
Yes, it's me. Did you have lunch?

544
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,290
Hey, you need to take care of yourself.

545
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:21,400
Tell the nurse you slept through the lunch hour and eat right now.

546
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,200
You need to care for yourself if I can't be there.

547
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,380
Tell them right now.

548
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,570
She was crying.

549
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,790
She said her daughter was hospitalized.

550
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,100
But we were having a work emergency, too.

551
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,620
Imagine how she must've felt.

552
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,730
I saw her forcing herself to eat

553
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,000
while crying silently.

554
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,830
Gosh, seeing that,

555
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,520
I finally thought,

556
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,620
"She's...

557
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,000
trying to survive, too."

558
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,000
That was...

559
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,110
the moment I fell for her.

560
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,380
That's right.

561
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,310
- I'm sure everyone here is the same.
- Of course.

562
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,300
Yes.

563
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,600
Manager Lee's frustrating yet simple spirit.

564
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,540
You're hopeless once you fall for that.

565
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,530
I'm hopeless. I'm hopeless. Help me.

566
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,730
I got everyone a hangover cure.

567
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,400
Manager Lee is the best!

568
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,800
I haven't drunk this much in a while.

569
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,500
I feel... I feel sick.

570
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,980
Hey, if you throw up in here,

571
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,000
forget the house. Our friendship is over.

572
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,700
Should you hang a bag on your ears?

573
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,700
Wait a minute.

574
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,620
Gosh. Gosh. What do I do?

575
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,200
Gosh, I don't know.

576
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
- I don't know, don't know, don't know.
- What's with her?

577
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,520
W-What's the problem?

578
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,800
Oppa,

579
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,300
it turns out you're the...

580
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,010
first man to visit our place.

581
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,860
Gosh! What do I do?

582
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,050
I don't know what to do! Gosh.

583
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,140
I feel so shy.

584
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,030
Hey.

585
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,860
I'm totally fine. What are you doing?

586
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,780
Let go.

587
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,850
- I'm okay.
- You bought everyone a hangover cure.

588
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,400
Why didn't you get one for yourself?

589
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,720
That's what I'm saying.

590
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,590
Ahjussi, I'll stop by the convenience store.

591
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,390
Okay, okay. See you.

592
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,590
Here, sit.

593
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,380
Geez.

594
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,860
Okay...

595
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,700
Where's the light switch?

596
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,080
Right there. Behind the door.

597
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,800
The light.

598
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,910
Here.

599
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,260
Drink water and sober up.

600
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,560
Come to your senses.

601
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,000
Stop smiling. I don't want to get attached.

602
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,160
No! No.

603
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,600
No, don't get attached to me. No, no.

604
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,550
That'd be hopeless.

605
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,740
Because I don't want people to see my true charm,

606
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,300
I've been hiding it so hard.

607
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,400
So, don't get attached.

608
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,200
Okay? I made it clear.

609
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,500
I can't be responsible, okay?

610
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,300
Oppa, you know what?

611
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,930
Your eyes...

612
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,340
haven't aged at all?

613
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,300
You're still handsome.

614
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,440
That makes me so happy.

615
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,000
Okay. Drink water and sober up first.

616
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,670
You don't know how it feels, do you?

617
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,710
How it feels...

618
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,000
when you're unsure if you're

619
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,220
facing the truth or avoiding it. That weird feeling.

620
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,180
You're not okay at all,

621
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,370
but you're also okay.

622
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,450
I know it too well.

623
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,800
Bo Hyeon,

624
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,200
Mom has to catch a flight now. Okay?

625
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,200
The feeling when you deceive yourself.

626
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,430
Because you have to hang in there,

627
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,950
you try to appear okay.

628
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,750
- Mom is sleeping.
- Sorry.

629
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,470
It's okay.

630
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,750
Mom.

631
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,470
Wake up, Ms. Lee.

632
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,000
- Get up. Sleep inside.
- Yes, yes.

633
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,600
Yes.

634
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,900
- Yes, that's a good girl.
- Your arm.

635
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,020
Go to bed.

636
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,200
Should I make you some tea?

637
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,850
Here you go.

638
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,590
Is Mom sleeping?

639
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,750
Yes.

640
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,890
Her only strength is falling asleep immediately.

641
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,500
I know.

642
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,200
She should be on a talent show.

643
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,290
Not bad, right?

644
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,110
It's nice.

645
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,530
By the way,

646
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,300
why are you against building the house?

647
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,820
My mom's life keeps changing because of me.

648
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,940
I find it burdensome.

649
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,310
My mom...

650
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,240
never got to live her life.

651
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,190
She always put me first.

652
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:21,100
But she's making a decision like this again.

653
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,700
It makes me angry, and it upsets me.

654
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,600
At first,

655
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,300
when she told me she'll build a house,

656
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,300
I asked her...

657
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,480
why she wants to.

658
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,700
She said she's trying to live.

659
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,820
To live a fun life with you.

660
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,170
Her reason for building a house must be

661
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,040
the same as why you first came to Cheonghae.

662
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,600
It's the desire to do what you want to do without further delay.

663
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,720
Go inside.

664
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,400
- Get some rest.
- Thank you.

665
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,800
You need to care for yourself if I can't be there.

666
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,040
Tell them right now.

667
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,400
Ex...

668
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,300
Excuse...

669
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,300
I took my time because I thought you were sleeping.

670
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,600
Your acting skills haven't improved.

671
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,330
Hey, by chance, last night...

672
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:48,070
Of course, you threw a drunken tantrum.

673
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:51,230
Mr. Ryu seemed very shocked.

674
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:56,130
I can't reveal my true self to him yet.

675
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,000
I couldn't control myself because I hadn't drunk in a while.

676
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,350
Is this my room?

677
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,960
Looks like yours, telling from its size.

678
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,530
Why are they so close? Put them further apart.

679
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,450
Why are you suddenly making a suggestion?

680
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,370
Let's build the house.

681
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:17,390
And do it right if you're going to.

682
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,500
Are you serious?

683
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,600
Are you on board?

684
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,200
Yes, I'm on board.

685
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,670
Do you need my thumbprint or something?

686
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,110
Eat quickly. Mr. Ryu will be here soon.

687
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,230
Wow, you're an amazing driver.

688
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:53,110
It feels like I'm riding a five-star hotel mattress.

689
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,320
What's the point? My customer is either asleep or drunk.

690
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,660
She's unable to notice my driving skills.

691
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,080
Ahjussi,

692
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,500
can we have a full-sized window in the living room?

693
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,940
- Full-sized window?
- Yes.

694
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,200
Full-sized window.

695
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,580
Yes, that'd look nice.

696
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,060
But that'd raise the heating cost, no ventilation,

697
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,850
and it provides no privacy.

698
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:25,900
Can we have a screening or listening room in the basement?

699
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,600
That sounds good.

700
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,800
But the basement gets no fresh air, and it gets moist.

701
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,450
We'd have to give up on a portion of the yard space

702
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,470
and it'd cost a lot. It'd be better to add a story.

703
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,130
If you'd do everything the way you like,

704
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,250
don't call it "Hyo Ri's house."

705
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,050
Call it "Ji An's house" instead.

706
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:47,780
No, call it "Tyrant Lee Ji An's However-I-want House."

707
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,300
"I'm-the-King. Suppress-your-opinion House."

708
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,730
How does that sound?

709
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,800
I'm being nice, yet you're talking back?

710
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,580
- Talking back? I'm kowtowing cautiously.
- Kow-

711
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,270
Do you know what "kowtow" means?

712
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:01,600
Do you know what "nice" means?

713
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,900
Gosh, she has to have the last word.

714
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,280
You know I do.

715
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,860
The bottom and the pillars weren't aligned.

716
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,050
We secured it with a belt.

717
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,350
Okay.

718
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,780
- Cheol Min.
- What?

719
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,430
- You're doing great.
- Really?

720
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,340
- Can I be a chief, too?
- The drain pipe will come out here.

721
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,780
You'll keep the circuit breaker where it is, right?

722
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,660
Yes. Focus on waterproofing the kitchen.

723
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,960
Okay. I'll have a look.

724
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,540
How big of a flat tie do you need?

725
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,640
We'll have the 350 ones.

726
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,380
Won't you measure with a ruler?

727
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,460
Follow the basic rules.

728
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,120
I know it's annoying, but measuring with a ruler

729
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,310
is important in this job.

730
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,510
How will you train your juniors later?

731
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:13,080
Okay.

732
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,070
- 400.
- So?

733
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:19,590
Since we're adding the wedge pins,

734
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,900
we'll get the 400 ones.

735
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,460
I said work is about the attitude, not experience.

736
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,690
If you're sloppy with the basics,

737
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:31,810
you end up looking sloppy without showing off your strength.

738
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,710
Take a 30-minute break.

739
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,400
- The sun is too strong.
- Okay.

740
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,100
Wow, I was a bit surprised just now.

741
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,050
You looked like a good senior just now.

742
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,830
Are you picking a fight on this hot day?

743
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,150
What are you talking about?

744
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,280
A compliment is supposed to make a whale dance.

745
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,550
Cool senior, Manager Lee, fighting.

746
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,500
Let's eat!

747
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,300
Welcome!

748
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,500
I'll eat first! Hello.

749
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,470
Hello.

750
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,890
Wow, I haven't tasted your cooking in a while.

751
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,280
This is what a proper spread looks like.

752
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,600
Yes. I put extra effort into it.

753
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,700
Please work extra hard after eating it.

754
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,830
- Thank you for the meal!
- Applause!

755
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:36,110
Applause. Applause.

756
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,080
Help yourselves.

757
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,810
Seventy.

758
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,420
Aren't you eating?

759
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,150
I'm not hungry right now.

760
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:56,600
Why is the plastering surface so rough?

761
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,480
Eat without me.

762
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,550
I'll eat when I'm hungry later.

763
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,300
We'll leave now.

764
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,300
You did so much. Thank you.

765
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,390
We managed to pull it off.

766
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:43,310
We'll come running anytime if you call us.

767
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,160
I know. Thank you so much.

768
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,700
- It's okay. That's enough.
- Treat us to a meal later.

769
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,470
- We'll hang out again.
- I'm going to Seoul next month.

770
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,490
Really? Really?

771
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:51,940
We'll be seeing you.

772
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,480
- We'll go.
- Bye. Thank you.

773
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,480
Live well.

774
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,640
- Thank you.
- Fighting.

775
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:17,050
Okay. Let's work. Let's work.

776
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,260
It's moving day.

777
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,670
Be careful.

778
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,340
Give it to me.

779
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,540
It's so heavy.

780
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,160
Let me help you.

781
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,600
No, I'm okay.

782
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,780
To Hyo Ri's room, right?

783
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,900
- Yes. Hyo Ri.
- This way.

784
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,200
- Do you need help?
- No. It's okay.

785
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,260
Don't go with him...

786
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,360
Hey...

787
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,910
Don't go with him, I said.

788
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,450
Gosh. Looks heavy. Be careful.

789
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:46,270
- Use your muscles.
- Be careful. Be careful.

790
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,880
Gosh, not this way. Go back.

791
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,540
That's the opposite. Not this way.

792
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,700
Go back. You're doing great.

793
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,090
Thank you. You're the best.

794
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:03,230
♫ Make you bear it on your own ♫

795
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:08,530
♫ 'Cause big girls don't cry ♫

796
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:14,100
♫ Well, my love comes to you ♫

797
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,130
Serengeti...

798
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,790
became a paradise.

799
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:24,420
♫ I never felt before ♫

800
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,140
The electrical layout...

801
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,150
looks good.

802
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,500
The paint finish...

803
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:39,800
♫ Falling in love ♫

804
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,090
Perfect.

805
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,200
Nice.

806
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,800
Done.

807
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,640
I connected the lights in the annex, too.

808
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,200
Should I connect them to the main house and turn them all on?

809
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,000
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

810
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,100
It's so nice. My gosh.

811
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,810
Wow.

812
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,050
My gosh.

813
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,110
Wow. My gosh.

814
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,470
My gosh.

815
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:41,810
It's so pretty.

816
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,730
Our house is nice.

817
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,600
Good work, Lee Ji An.

818
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,760
Thank you so much, Oppa.

819
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,940
Don't mention it.

820
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,690
You did so much.

821
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,250
Yes.

822
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:16,300
My daughter, don't ever get married

823
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,030
and live here and look after me.

824
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,930
Gosh, stop! Stop!

825
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:23,110
I don't want to.

826
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,030
Then, take care of me.

827
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,960
I don't want that, either.

828
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,650
Geez, it's happening again.

829
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,100
I should tell the electricity team to come back tomorrow.

830
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,560
I'll contact them.

831
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,000
What's the issue?

832
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,590
Why aren't you going to bed?

833
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,850
This kept bothering me.

834
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,700
- Have you been living like this?
- Huh?

835
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,660
You skipped meals.

836
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,240
You won't take breaks

837
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,370
and you can't even sleep well.

838
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:03,950
You don't even notice you're wearing yourself out.

839
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,680
Have you been living so doggedly like this?

840
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,580
No. I've always eaten on time

841
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,070
and rested well, too.

842
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:21,110
Mom,

843
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,460
it's nice that you work hard.

844
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,600
It's cool and...

845
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,700
admirable,

846
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,420
but...

847
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,780
let's cherish life, too.

848
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,090
If Grandma didn't teach you,

849
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,170
I will.

850
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:46,430
How precious you are.

851
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:50,610
You're so precious and shouldn't be overworked.

852
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,950
I'll teach you.

853
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,640
So, you teach me, too.

854
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,560
That I need to cherish myself more than anyone.

855
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,010
Please teach me that, too.

856
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,320
Okay. Let's.

857
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,990
Because we're so precious.

858
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,690
We should've built a house sooner.

859
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,320
- It's so nice, right?
- Yes

860
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,090
The ceilings are tall.

861
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,610
There are stairs.

862
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,140
There's a garden.

863
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,390
It's exactly as I dreamed.

864
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,200
I don't want to admit it, but it's the best thing you've done.

865
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,550
I knew you'd...

866
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,700
end up doing this.

867
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,370
- I said you can't build this house.
- Is this a hidden camera?

868
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:46,110
Why are you suddenly like this?

869
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,640
Hey.

870
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,580
Hey.

871
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:57,930
Don't panic.

872
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,500
L-Let's calm down.

873
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:04,330

Lee Ji An, are you trying to make me feel guilty?

886
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:37,790
You begged me to come once.

887
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,730
Why should I tolerate again?

888
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:42,400
You don't know how I endured all that time.

889
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,690
That's how tiring and hurtful it is.

890
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:46,960
It's because it's sweet.

891
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,980
I comforted myself watching the stars.

892
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,640
I think those two are each other's first love.
