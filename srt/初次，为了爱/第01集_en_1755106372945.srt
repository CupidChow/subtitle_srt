1
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:44,408
This brighter and lumpy part is the tumor.

2
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:49,008
The image suggests that the primary tumor originated in the brain.

3
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,948
For an accurate diagnosis,

4
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:54,128
the tumor must be surgically removed for a biopsy.

5
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:59,668
I suspect it's a glioma tumor, the most common primary brain tumor.

6
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:06,308
Haven't you seen me somewhere, by chance?

7
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:11,498
I was in the "Excellent Doctor" 2000th episode special

8
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:15,748
and Episodes 1052 and 1100 of "Mysteries of the Human Body."

9
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:17,348
I see.

10
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:19,368
Because of my media presence,

11
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:22,218
if I give treatment and diagnosis willy-nilly,

12
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:25,828
I'd be in huge trouble.

13
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:27,768
It's embarrassing to say this,

14
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:30,128
but it means I'm a trustworthy doctor.

15
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:31,548
Don't worry.

16
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:34,058
Let's work together and get you treated.

17
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:37,328
I'm asking you to brace yourself.

18
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:40,298
Let's check progress regularly

19
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:43,360
and schedule the surgery as soon as possible.

20

✨ The Marvellous ✨ Team @ Viki.com

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,758
You checked the location thoroughly, right?

22
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:10,828
Yes, I looked this morning.

23
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:13,318
Hey, Kim Cheol Min! Get with it!

24
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,318
Move the truck further in!

25
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:17,238
Where will the concrete truck go?

26
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,378
Okay, got it!

27
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:20,378
Where's the concrete truck?

28
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:23,318
Geez, you should call to confirm.

29
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,218
Mr. Kim.

30
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:31,238
What's the deal? My guys have been waiting since the crack of dawn.

31
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:36,658
- Get ready for the pour.
- Okay, okay.

32
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:37,808
Hey.

33
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:40,368
Hey, move!

34
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,558
Jong Su, tell them to be careful with the diverter.

35
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:14,468
Are you going to the team dinner tonight?

36
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:18,558
Geez. I'm at work. Isn't that enough?

37
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:20,948
Don't upset the owner for no reason.

38
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,858
Let's make him happy.

39
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,918
It'd be our loss if we get on his bad side.

40
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:27,768
Geez.

Come to the Young Sense Karaoke in front of City Hall now.

50
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:08,628
I said I won't go anymore.

51
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,058
Call a driver.

52
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:11,588
You little.

53
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:14,458
Calling a driver isn't free. Huh?

54
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,948
What?

55
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:17,558
Dang it.

56
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:38,458
The call is not going through. You'll be connected…

57
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:04,898
- Wow...
- Since you joined us, Sir,

58
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:08,158
a team dinner is so fun!

59
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:10,408
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

60
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:13,638
Is it because you studied in Hong Kong?

61
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:16,468
Your aura is... Whoa!

62
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:18,718
Your aura...

63
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,408
Sir, since you're here,

64
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,728
it feels like the middle of Shinjuku here.

65
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:25,358
Wow!

66
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,378
I studied in Hong Kong,

67
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:30,278
but it feels like Shinjuku?

68
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,378
What's your name?

69
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:35,598
Avoid talking to that man if you can.

70
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:38,688
You should talk as little as possible.

71
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,778
Right. He's

72
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:44,678
so obnoxious.

73
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,218
I'm ignorant.

74
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:50,128
Gosh, let's go!

75
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:52,728
Let's go!

76
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,248
Hyo Ri is here. Let's go.

77
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:56,388
Hyo Ri!

78
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:03,668
Did you drink a lot?

79
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:06,408
Hey, say hello to someone.

80
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,148
Wait...

81
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:10,808
Who's this?

82
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:12,218
She's my daughter.

83
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:15,578
- She insisted on picking me up.
- Oh?

84
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:18,308
Did you have a grown-up daughter like this?

85
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:22,208
I need to set time aside sometime

86
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,448
to investigate your past.

87
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:26,788
You're so naughty, Sir.

88
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:30,418
Gosh, let's see.

89
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:34,948
She's pretty. Very pretty.

90
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:37,778
- Very pretty.
- Yes, yes.

91
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:40,578
Sir, she's a medical student

92
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:42,158
at Hanguk University.

93
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:43,628
Wow!

94
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:46,318
Hey, show him your intelligent face,

95
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:48,498
the unapproachable face, your intelligent face.

96
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:50,978
Hanguk University Medical School?

97
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,908
Wow, you're so impressive!

98
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:56,188
You raised your daughter well.

99
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:59,718
- Hanguk University Medical School is—
- Sir.

100
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:02,198
Let's go for the third round!

101
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:05,038
- Let's go!
- Go.

102
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,058
Bye, Hyo Ri!

103
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:28,538
Goodness.

104
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:32,048
He may be an owner, but only through nepotism.

105
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,598
He always acts like he knows everything.

106
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:36,158
He's all over the worksite,

107
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:40,858
causing harm to the workers' safety and mental health.

108
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:48,028
Seon Yeong can't stop flirting with Chief An.

109
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:50,158
You can call it romantic,

110
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:54,218
but it turns out Chief An won't budge.

111
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:55,968
This is where it turns into horror.

112
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:58,308
Seon Yeong became obsessed,

113
00:07:58,308 --> 00:08:00,688
and she won't give up.

114
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,558
Wow, she's really...

115
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:06,548
You know,

116
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:11,558
the new lumber team leader asked me if I was in my 20s.

117
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:16,958
Gosh, he really has a keen eye, you know.

118
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:20,938
I'm sick of being told I look young.

119
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:36,158
Geez, you scared me, Girl.

120
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:40,578
Why do you live like this?

121
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:42,968
For what reason do you live like this?

122
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,608
What are you saying?

123
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,558
I'm so scared.

124
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:52,228
Of what? Why? Why are you scared?

125
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:54,798
Did someone say something to you?

126
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:57,268
- I'll just—
- I'm afraid I'll end up like you.

127
00:08:57,268 --> 00:09:00,058
I'm afraid I'll live like you.

128
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:05,938
Hey, you keep acting up because I'm nice.

129
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:08,228
I've been too mild, haven't I?

130
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:12,008
Should I turn up the spice level?

131
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:41,488
Chief Hwang.

132
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:43,168
Manager Lee.

133
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:45,878
How could you do this?

134
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,368
How could you do this to me?

135
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:51,078
Manager Lee, I'm sorry.

136
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:53,538
D-Don't be sorry.

137
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:55,178
Don't be sorry. Don't be.

138
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,728
You'll pay me back, right?

139
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,988
You'll pay me 30 million won (21,600 USD) back, right?

140
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:01,748
Don't be sorry. Why would you be sorry?

141
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:04,608
I'd pay you back if I could, but...

142
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:07,538
Pay me back if you want to.

143
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:11,638
Chief Hwang, I need to pay Hyo Ri's tuition.

144
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:14,748
You know my situation. Let's not do this, please?

145
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:19,300
I wish I could sell my organ, you know?

146
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,300
But my body is in poor shape right now.

147
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,028
Chief Hwang,

148
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:27,788
you know how I survived on the construction site. Right?

149
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:29,000
If you don't pay me back,

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,800
I'll go crazy and follow you around forever.

151
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,428
So, pay me back, no matter what!

152
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,100
Hey, I'm leaving.

153
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:06,668
Wow, watching you color your eyelids first thing in the morning

154
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:10,268
makes me wonder when you'll get me to live in the lap of luxury.

155
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:14,708
I won't be satisfied with a half-assed effort of being a filial daughter.

156
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,818
Geez, I got wasted last night

157
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:21,558
but woke up right on time for work.

158
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:24,288
This K-mother spirit—

159
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:28,948
I'm leaving this house. Don't look for me.

160
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:30,688
Sure, go ahead.

161
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,678
Bye, not "good" bye.

162
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,900
Manager Lee, you need to look at this.

163
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,368
What's up?

164
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,400
Why does the rebar count not match the plan?

165
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,768
We were surprised when we checked today, too.

166
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:55,688
Shit.

167
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:01,198
Yes, Sir. I just arrived.

168
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,238
- Manager Lee.
- Yes.

169
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,728
So?

170
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:15,298
Pardon?

171
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
And?

172
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:24,068
What do you mean by "and"?

173
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:26,428
What will you do?

174
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:28,588
There's a big gap in the supply count.

175
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:32,300
You should know how to catch the thief as the field manager.

176
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,200
Hold on.

177
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,648
Are you here to turn yourself in today?

178
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,200
When I took over the job,

179
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,228
it's customary for the Material Management Team to check the order and worksite,

180
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:48,800
and I was told everything was good.

181
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
I see.

182
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,568
Is that so, Manager Lee?

183
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:54,868
Yes.

184
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:56,438
I increased security on the worksite,

185
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:59,418
and we installed more security cameras inside and outside

186
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:01,600
to prevent further loss.

187
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
She came to this worksite only a month ago.

188
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,600
We need to talk to the former manager, Manager Jang...

189
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,398
so we can...

190
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:13,738
How interesting.

191
00:13:13,738 --> 00:13:15,638
Are you two dating?

192
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:19,200
Otherwise, why would you always defend her?

193
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,800
She didn't check the supply count when she took over the job.

194
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,188
That's negligence of duty.

195
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:25,800
Oh, right.

196
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Did you two plot and steal supplies together?

197
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,138
And you agreed to blame the former manager?

198
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:32,218
Did you?

199
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:37,148
Make a reasonable excuse so I can at least pretend to listen!

200
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:39,388
Seriously! I'm so pissed.

201
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:40,600
Move.

202
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,400
Move it!

203
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:45,588
So annoying!

204
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,300
Geez.

205
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:56,728
Sir, Manager Lee was sent to the worksite urgently, so...

206
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:59,188
So what?

207
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:02,738
What about it?

208
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:05,800
I'll make sure to fix the problem.

209
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,000
Geez, you're so pathetic.

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,618
Move! The door won't close!

211
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,898
Is it me?

212
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:16,688
What are you doing? Close the door!

213
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:19,168
The door is closing.

214
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:23,238
What a coldhearted bastard.

215
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,800
It's a harmful consequence of studying abroad too young.

216
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,200
Son of a bitch.

217
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,398
He's a psychopath pretending to be a sociopath.

218
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,300
That was good defense.

219
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,378
Manager Jang is missing, right?

220
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:36,508
What do we do?

221
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,200
I asked people to look for him.

222
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
The company would understand, right?

223
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:49,678
P-Professor, here's the chart.

224
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,100
Are you nagging me right now?

225
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,388
You bastard.

226
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,638
You can read it to me when we're at the ward.

227
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,408
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,200
- Making a round?
- Yes.

229
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,438
For Assemblyman Lee's sibling,

230
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:20,400
you collected the previous hospital's medical record. Right?

231
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,000
Pardon?

232
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,800
Well, I only collected ours.

233
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,900
You're slow, dumb, can't read the room, and have poor instincts.

234
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,800
Wow, our Myeong Su,

235
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,000
if you insist on your own way of doing things,

236
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,998
- you should've gone to a seminary.
- I'm sorry.

237
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:42,258
Why do you tire innocent people around you?

238
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:44,888
You and the other students...

239
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:46,408
Oh?

240
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:48,700
You are still here?

241
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,900
There are always a few each year,

242
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,738
the ones who faint in the OR.

243
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:56,158
Let's be honest.

244
00:15:56,158 --> 00:15:59,800
If you can't even handle that, you should quit being a doctor.

245
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,800
So, would you be able to even hold a scalpel?

246
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,200
Why does a girl look like this?

247
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,708
You lack skills, and you can't even put on makeup.

248
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,458
That's enough.

249
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:18,258
Next time, leave the OR later than the patient.

250
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,948
Promise.

251
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:22,100
Promise me.

252
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,400
Forget about finishing it off nicely.

253
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,300
Bravo.

254
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,000
At the team dinner, Professor Hwang from the anesthesiology

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,800
said you'd win the Nobel Prize if you were as good

256
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,818
a surgeon as you are at bullying the students.

257
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:46,268
No. He said, "Can he not focus on

258
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,068
surgery since he wastes energy

259
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,688
bullying students before the surgery."

260
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:54,300
And he burst out laughing so everyone in the restaurant could hear.

261
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,100
But I don't think so.

262
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,578
Professor Kim,

263
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:03,218
you're a true teacher who

264
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:04,958
uses unreasonable and inhumane authority,

265
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:09,718
to constantly cause students to ask themselves

266
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:14,558
"Why am I trying to become a doctor?"

267
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,958
Please continue to maintain this vibe and...

268
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,798
Fighting.

269
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,698
Let go.

270
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:30,838
Go.

271
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:33,097
Come up later.

272
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:35,158
I have to go up, too.

273
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,000
Where are you?

274
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,800
It cured well!

275
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,500
Yes, it cracked less. It turned out well.

276
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,498
Yes, spray more water on it.

277
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:25,078
Okay.

278
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:27,998
I don't have to worry about your worksite, Chief An.

279
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,848
Don't flatter me.

280
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:33,068
Oh, right. What happened to the missing supplies case?

281
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,608
I'm upset about it.

282
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:36,628
It was obviously that bastard Manager Jang!

283
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:39,288
Why would he disappear if he's innocent?

284
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:40,708
That's what I'm saying.

285
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,838
You can just tell by looking into his eyes.

286
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:44,218
That's what I'm saying.

287
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:46,900
I didn't like his eyes.

288
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,600
He acted like a boss when he came to eat, too.

289
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,428
The special meal is ready, right?

290
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:55,258
Everyone's tired after pouring concrete.

291
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:57,700
I talked to Deputy Kim from the HQ

292
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,200
and put abalone in the chicken soup.

293
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,538
I love it.

294
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:03,818
Do you love me that much?

295
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:05,900
- No, the chicken soup and abalone.
- Just confess it.

296
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,500
Don't be like this.

297
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,608
Yes, General Manager.

298
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:13,548
Audit Team?

299
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:16,158
But why me...

300
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:19,900
Okay. Got it. Call me.

301
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,600
What did he say?

302
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,788
The Audit Team is handling the case now.

303
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,300
I'll count on you and do this job, Chief An.

304
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,288
I'll go to the plan site. Talk to you later.

305
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:33,898
Okay, bye.

306
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:35,668
Hey!

307
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:38,488
Look how rude you are.

308
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,200
Don't act like you're my friend.

309
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:06,758
Yes, hello?

310
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:10,518
Hi, I'm a medical student, Lee Hyo Ri's mom.

311
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:12,298
I have a question.

312
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:15,828
When is the second-semester tuition due?

313
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:20,758
Pardon?

314
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:23,868
No, there must be a mistake.

315
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:27,828
Lee Hyo Ri, third year in medical school. Lee Hyo Ri.

316
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:33,318
That can't be.

317
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:36,138
Could you check one more time?

318
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:39,288
She submitted a dropout request? That can't be.

319
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:51,748
Answer it.

320
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,388
Hello?

321
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,978
You, Shit. You...

322
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:03,058
I just called your school.

323
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,868
- Where are you right now?
- I said I was leaving.

324
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:08,438
Hey! Your school said you...

325
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:11,448
submitted a dropout request. It's a system error, right?

326
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:12,738
I dropped out.

327
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,798
I told you from the beginning that med school's not for me.

328
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:16,728
I went all this time as you wished.

329
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:17,918
So, I want to stop now.

330
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:19,548
Hey, Lee Hyo Ri!

331
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:20,778
I ran away from home. Don't look for me.

332
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:22,198
I won't pick up, either. So, don't call me.

333
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,108
Hey, Lee Hyo—

334
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:28,358
This girl...

335
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:37,898
What's wrong with this?

336
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:47,828
Did you finally drop out?

337
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:49,498
Yes, aren't you proud of me?

338
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:52,878
I guess your mother had no clue.

339
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,968
Well, let's just leave it at that.

340
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:58,878
- You just said you ran away from home.
- Yes?

341
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:02,208
Did you mean you're on an outing? Or...

342
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,138
a runaway or something like that?

343
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:06,348
Yes, I'm a runaway.

344
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:09,658
So, I'm sort of an accomplice

345
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:12,788
- in your runaway plan?
- That's right.

346
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:17,818
Then, I'm one of your mom's targets now, right?

347
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:22,998
Geez, this is nuts!

348
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:24,198
It's your mom.

349
00:22:24,198 --> 00:22:26,898
Block her number for your mental health.

350
00:22:26,898 --> 00:22:29,014
You know how she nags nonstop.

351
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,008
Of course, I do.

352
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:32,658
She caught us when we went to karaoke in high school.

353
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:35,148
You threw up after hearing the same nagging for an hour.

354
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:36,798
Gosh.

355
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,938
Hey! Run away alone if you want to!

356
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:43,628
Why drag me into this?

357
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,258
I wondered why you suddenly wanted to go on a trip.

358
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:48,258
Suk, stop. Stop.

359
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:49,808
- Look to the side.
- No!

360
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:53,418
- Do I just do whatever you say?
- Just look!

361
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:56,818
Oh?

362
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,668
What's this?

363
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:06,908
It's the ocean, what else?

364
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:10,618
- It's the ocean!
- I was dying to see the ocean!

365
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:17,348
It's the ocean!

366
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:18,528
Isn't it so pretty?

367
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,358
Have we already reached the ocean? The ocean!

368
00:23:29,918 --> 00:23:32,628
Wow, it looks amazing.

369
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:35,388
Gosh.

370
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:37,528
This is crazy!

371
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:39,448
I'm sorry, god of the ocean!

372
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:42,688
The ocean has too much tasty stuff!

373
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,068
It's too tasty.

374
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,088
♫  Until the end of the blue ocean  ♫

375
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:53,738
♫  I'll ride a horse  ♫

376
00:23:53,738 --> 00:23:55,038
♫  Ride a horse  ♫

377
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,358
♫  There are stars in the sky  ♫

378
00:23:58,358 --> 00:24:03,158
♫  The desert only has a path for camels  ♫

379
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:10,148
♫  Endless love will become our path and open up to us  ♫

380
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,768
How could I not be pissed?

381
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:16,098
My car had to break down, too.

382
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:17,588
Is Hyo Ri really not home?

383
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:19,788
Geez.

384
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:22,028
She's not home.

385
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:25,548
Why would she suddenly act up?

386
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:29,958
She'll probably fight for a few days out of pride.

387
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,538
Hey, do you know what it means

388
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:36,028
for a woman in her 20s to raise a newborn alone?

389
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:39,048
It means I gave up on my life and went all in for her.

390
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:40,628
How could she do this to me?

391
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:44,368
That's what I'm saying. What a brat.

392
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:47,608
Can she undo dropping out of school?

393
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:50,168
I should beg them.

394
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:52,398
My stomach hurts because I'm stressed.

395
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:53,628
It hurts again?

396
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:57,298
Hey, you should get checked at a hospital right away.

397
00:24:57,298 --> 00:24:59,338
And call me when you go to school.

398
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:02,118
I know how to beg.

399
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:04,688
By the way, does Hyo Ri have money?

400
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:06,178
I don't know. Who cares?

401
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:08,678
Hey, I'm at my yoga class. Bye.

402
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:10,388
Okay.

403
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:18,248
Buddy.

404
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:20,208
Yes.

405
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,548
Have a tiring dream.

406
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:25,688
That way, you'll digest well

407
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:28,578
and we'll get to eat a lot of tasty stuff.

408
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,920
No, how about...

409
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,747
having sleep paralysis?

410
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:36,927
Be quiet. Go to sleep.

411
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,588
Suk.

412
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:59,148
I'll send you to purgatory.

413
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,428
Take this and leave.

414
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:17,958
What's going on?

415
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,048
I got an error message while using online banking.

416
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:25,838
Could you show me the error message?

417
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:28,638
Here.

418
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:37,118
This account was closed.

419
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:40,728
Pardon? It's my daughter's account.

420
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:43,288
It was closed yesterday.

421
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,618
It seems she withdrew all the funds and closed it.

422
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:49,748
Wow, Hyo Ri...

423
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:52,068
is so cutthroat.

424
00:27:52,068 --> 00:27:53,758
She closed her account,

425
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:57,468
acquired plenty of escape funds, and left home?

426
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,748
I won't forgive her. She'd better watch out.

427
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:03,538
I'll beat her up. I won't hold back.

428
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:06,658
Is she going through puberty? What's her deal?

429
00:28:06,658 --> 00:28:07,948
Wait till I catch her.

430
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:11,418
But hey, shouldn't you being going to the Seogyo neighborhood today?

431
00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:13,288
I was suspended since I'm being audited.

432
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:14,818
Really?

433
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,928
I'll just check out the worksite and leave.

434
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:20,778
It works out. I get to look into the dropout process at school.

435
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:26,608
Eat a lot. Eat a lot.

436
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:27,658
Do you pity me?

437
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:31,258
Finish your meal quietly and go to the worksite.

438
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:33,358
I heard you totaled your car.

439
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:36,448
I'll go to the school with you since I'm done.

440
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:44,608
Okay. It said 200 meters ahead after a left turn.

441
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:50,708
The map says it's here. But nothing's here.

442
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,688
You wanted to come here since we left.

443
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:55,458
Are you sure it's famous? Why is there nothing?

444
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:56,958
Wait a moment.

445
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:59,718
It should be around the corner.

446
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:03,448
How strange.

447
00:29:09,388 --> 00:29:11,128
Hey, it's there!

448
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:12,288
- There it is. There it is.
- Where?

449
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:14,618
- Where?
- Isn't that it?

450
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:34,678
Wow, this is crazy.

451
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:43,238
Hyo Ri!

452
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:44,968
Where are you going?

453
00:29:44,968 --> 00:29:47,018
Hey, hey, hey.

454
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:52,298
Hey, you can't just open doors like that. What are you doing?

455
00:29:53,648 --> 00:29:56,018
I wanted to check it out just once.

456
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:01,448
This is enough. You don't have to go inside.

457
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:06,348
Let's go.

458
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,108
What's the deal? Seriously.

459
00:30:12,108 --> 00:30:14,528
What? Why are we leaving already?

460
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:27,258
Hey, why did you want to come to Cheonghae?

461
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,678
You said you've never been here before.

462
00:30:29,678 --> 00:30:32,608
Do you believe in fate?

463
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:35,018
Totally. I have a pure soul.

464
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:38,598
I believe in fate and Tao. I've had two ancestral rites, too.

465
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:40,658
Me, too.

466
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:46,558
I felt like I could face my fate if I came to Cheonghae.

467
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:52,688
Hey, what's that?

468
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:55,208
What's this?

469
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,208
It's smoking!

470
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,758
- Get out!
- It's smoking!

471
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,528
Hurry!

472
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,008
Hey...

473
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:11,558
Hey, what's wrong?

474
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,558
We're screwed.

475
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:17,808
My phone. This won't do.

476
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:20,958
No! Haven't you seen movies?

477
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:24,218
It ignites and explodes after this. Do you want to die?

478
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,258
Then, what am I supposed to do?

479
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:29,188
No one's passing by, either.

480
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:32,128
- Let's call the insurance—
- No!

481
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:34,248
My dad lent it to me without telling my mom.

482
00:31:34,248 --> 00:31:37,038
I'm done if my mom finds out!

483
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:44,738
Suk, pain is temporary. Just take a beating from your mom.

484
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,338
- Call the insurance.
- I really can't.

485
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,228
How is pain temporary?

486
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:53,548
Hey, d-did you hear that voice, too?

487
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:56,338
A good beating lasts at least two weeks.

488
00:31:56,338 --> 00:32:00,388
I got beaten to a pulp after stealing my mother's wallet,

489
00:32:00,388 --> 00:32:02,618
and I couldn't use the toilet for two weeks.

490
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:04,658
- I heard something.
- Where's it coming from?

491
00:32:04,658 --> 00:32:09,928
My mother was very good at slapping.

492
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,788
A mountain god?

493
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:23,908
You scared me.

494
00:32:24,888 --> 00:32:26,928
There's an issue.

495
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,868
Do you know about cars?

496
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,608
The car stopped because of an issue.

497
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:36,228
Right.

498
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:39,068
Probably.

499
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,388
It's not a big deal. It can be fixed.

500
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:46,878
Don't worry, okay?

501
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,338
Does that mean it can be fixed quickly?

502
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:52,888
Not quickly.

503
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,378
Don't butt in. You know nothing.

504
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:57,858
You still can't drive a tractor alone.

505
00:32:57,858 --> 00:32:59,038
Come on.

506
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,628
I'm comforting the young ladies who are in shock.

507
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:05,278
Comforting, my foot.

508
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,198
Yes, yes. Where are you?

509
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:09,868
What?

510
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:12,678
This is no time to check out plants.

511
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:15,958
Our neighborhood is in crisis.

512
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,158
Father, too?

513
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:20,738
My goodness. Come back now.

514
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:25,098
This is the first time in 10 years that this has happened here.

515
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:26,838
It's very unusual.

516
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,978
Right now...

517
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:38,898
Don't be so shocked.

518
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:41,398
He'll come quickly this way.

519
00:33:44,378 --> 00:33:45,888
By the way,

520
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:48,358
have you eaten at all?

521
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,258
No.

522
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:54,938
Wow, thank you so much!

523
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:57,198
- There are potatoes, too!
- This is incredible.

524
00:33:57,198 --> 00:33:59,028
Hey, let's take a selfie.

525
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:00,938
Why don't you eat first?

526
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,098
This is important.

527
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:05,188
Wow, let's eat.

528
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:07,238
Thanks for the meal.

529
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:09,488
Enjoy.

530
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:17,458
Seriously.

531
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:21,748
Hanguk University Medical School is impossible to get into,

532
00:34:21,748 --> 00:34:24,028
but a piece of paper is enough to drop out.

533
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,378
Gosh, Ji An. Ji An! Calm down. Calm down.

534
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:30,348
We should stabilize your blood pressure first.

535
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:31,668
And we either bring her back

536
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:34,818
- or accept this. One or the other...
-  No, no...

537
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:36,778
Dropping out isn't allowed in my family.

538
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:39,898
I'll catch her and eat her alive.

539
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:42,598
You're eating Chief Hwang, Manager Jang, and Hyo Ri.

540
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:44,788
You'll have a feast. My gosh.

541
00:34:44,788 --> 00:34:46,978
- Hey.
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

542
00:34:46,978 --> 00:34:48,058
Okay, okay.

543
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:52,558
To find Hyo Ri, we need to think like her.

544
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:56,228
She probably turned her phone on

545
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,418
and then...

546
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,368
Like this.

547
00:35:02,218 --> 00:35:04,228
And then...

548
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:06,578
open Instagram...

549
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:10,448
I found her.

550
00:35:10,448 --> 00:35:11,788
- Hey, I found her.
- You did?

551
00:35:11,788 --> 00:35:13,918
You found her?

552
00:35:16,308 --> 00:35:18,398
Wow, look at this.

553
00:35:20,158 --> 00:35:22,448
- Let's go.
- Okay.

554
00:35:22,448 --> 00:35:24,678
- How long will it take?
- Two and a half hours.

555
00:35:24,678 --> 00:35:26,878
Okay. Lee Hyo Ri and Lee Suk.

556
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:30,418
Your heaven will last two and a half hours.

557
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:40,918
It's so delicious.

558
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:43,318
This is the best meal I've had in Cheonghae.

559
00:35:43,318 --> 00:35:46,778
Village Leader Go's home cooking is known to be

560
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,878
the best in the neighborhood.

561
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:50,638
Are you the village leader?

562
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:53,188
No, he's just a villager.

563
00:35:53,188 --> 00:35:55,408
I'm the village leader.

564
00:35:55,408 --> 00:35:58,618
I'm the first female leader in the neighborhood's history,

565
00:35:58,618 --> 00:36:01,048
and I was elected six times in a row.

566
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:04,198
I set a new record in the town of Doseon's history.

567
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:06,168
I did.

568
00:36:06,168 --> 00:36:08,898
She's good at her job, a good cook,

569
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:10,658
and good-looking!

570
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:15,698
Village Leader Go is basically a celebrity around here.

571
00:36:15,698 --> 00:36:18,358
"Celebrity"? Impressive.

572
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:20,658
Eat more. Eat more.

573
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:23,748
Gosh, you must be thirsty.

574
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,718
I should bring nurungji water (scorched rice water).

575
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:26,818
- Sounds good.
- Thank you.

576
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:28,238
Nurungji water.

577
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:31,058
I should do stuff like that.

578
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:34,428
By the way, are you in Cheonghae for a vacation?

579
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:37,578
I'm on vacation, and she ran away.

580
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:44,478
Okay. Here's nurungji water.

581
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:46,398
Wow, thank you.

582
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:48,868
- It's corn.
- That's for dessert.

583
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:51,868
What's he doing here this time?

584
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:55,368
I barely managed to improve the village's image.

585
00:36:55,368 --> 00:36:57,038
Do you think so?

586
00:36:57,038 --> 00:37:00,548
Seriously. You're so proud, aren't you?

587
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:02,958
Hello!

588
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,868
He's so obnoxious.

589
00:37:04,868 --> 00:37:07,098
So showy.

590
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:10,568
Gosh, my heart just dropped...

591
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:13,238
because of the two beauties.

592
00:37:15,168 --> 00:37:17,118
They came to check out our village.

593
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:20,338
Oh, I see. Nice to meet you.

594
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,088
- Hello.
- Hello.

595
00:37:24,798 --> 00:37:26,518
Bo Hyeon was looking for you.

596
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:28,268
- Is he back?
- Yes.

597
00:37:28,268 --> 00:37:30,378
Mr. Ryu, too?

598
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,668
Yes, they were together.

599
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:34,758
Gosh, I can't handle all that.

600
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:38,458
For some reason, I become weak in front of him.

601
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:43,318
Goodness. No one's above Mr. Ryu in this village.

602
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:45,818
Okay, okay. Hurry up and eat slowly,

603
00:37:45,818 --> 00:37:47,468
and we'll get moving.

604
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:50,038
- Okay.
- Eat more.

605
00:37:56,718 --> 00:38:00,928
He's the owner of the architecture firm over there.

606
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:02,778
He's so particular.

607
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:06,488
Try not to clash with him.

608
00:38:06,488 --> 00:38:08,788
You'll get too upset.

609
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:19,558
So, how does it look, Mr. Ryu?

610
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:26,808
Wow, a handsome middle-aged man.

611
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:28,858
Why did you call us?

612
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:33,228
They can't go anywhere because the car broke down.

613
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,538
Don't you think this is urgent?

614
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:37,968
Why is that urgent to us?

615
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:41,918
I suppose it might not be to you.

616
00:38:46,178 --> 00:38:48,148
Wow, a pretty young man.

617
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:49,848
Are you the vehicle owner?

618
00:38:49,848 --> 00:38:53,648
It looks like a short circuit. It happens with campers.

619
00:38:53,648 --> 00:38:55,598
It's not hard to fix,

620
00:38:55,598 --> 00:38:58,668
but we can't fix it now because we don't have the part.

621
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:01,238
You should call the insurance—

622
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,438
I can't do that.

623
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:05,718
Did you steal the car?

624
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,998
- No—
- You should turn yourself in, then.

625
00:39:07,998 --> 00:39:10,628
- Come on.
- They didn't steal it.

626
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:13,518
There's a bit of a family situation.

627
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:18,038
Okay! First of all,

628
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:19,948
we'll move it to Hyung's yard,

629
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:24,878
and Bo Hyeon will get the part and fix it.

630
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:28,538
I asked you not to call me Hyung, didn't I?

631
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:31,198
And my front yard isn't a public parking lot.

632
00:39:31,198 --> 00:39:35,528
I don't just let strangers in there.

633
00:39:36,198 --> 00:39:41,318
It's okay. We don't ask for help from strangers, either.

634
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:42,978
Where's a public parking lot?

635
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:45,148
Well, it's everywhere.

636
00:39:45,148 --> 00:39:49,198
All empty fields are basically public parking lots.

637
00:39:49,198 --> 00:39:52,618
But since we're in the countryside,

638
00:39:52,618 --> 00:39:56,318
the empty fields get filled with stray dogs at night.

639
00:39:56,318 --> 00:39:57,928
Not just stray dogs,

640
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:02,418
sometimes they get into fights with boars.

641
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:04,788
- Right.
- Lee Hyo Ri.

642
00:40:04,788 --> 00:40:06,438
Talk to him again.

643
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:09,978
Do you think we really don't know each other?

644
00:40:09,978 --> 00:40:12,168
Do we know each other, then?

645
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:17,268
Gosh, everyone in this country is connected if you trace family history—

646
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:20,718
I'm sorry, but I don't even know my in-laws.

647
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:26,158
Goodness, Mr. Ryu. Don't be so difficult.

648
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:32,268
Everyone in this village knows you're the kindest man around, Mr. Ryu.

649
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:35,128
You can't trick me by saying stuff like that.

650
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:37,488
Don't waste your energy. Call a tow truck and—

651
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:42,278
Wait, didn't you say you need help at your farm, Bo Hyeon?

652
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:44,848
- Pardon?
- Here.

653
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:48,048
I saw them eating earlier.

654
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:50,618
From the way they ate...

655
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,458
You know I'm good at face reading, right?

656
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:57,378
Wow, I could tell they're really strong.

657
00:40:57,378 --> 00:41:02,088
You've got the top-quality workers right here.

658
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:04,248
Well, I...

659
00:41:19,378 --> 00:41:21,128
Should I help you, too?

660
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:23,358
- Don't.
- Okay.

661
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:27,738
Okay.

662
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,958
Then, park in our front yard for now.

663
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,168
Today would be difficult,

664
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:34,318
but I'll get the part downtown and fix it tomorrow.

665
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:36,498
Hey, don't do it.

666
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:38,158
It's okay.

667
00:41:38,158 --> 00:41:41,968
Bo Hyeon is so generous.

668
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:45,230
He's making up for his father, too.

669
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,010
Thank you.

670
00:42:20,478 --> 00:42:22,368
Let's see...

671
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,528
Wow, this is it.

672
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:37,518
- This is it.
- Hello.

673
00:42:37,518 --> 00:42:42,208
Have you seen this student by chance?

674
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,858
Let me see.

675
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,848
Bo Hyeon!

676
00:42:48,848 --> 00:42:51,228
- Gosh.
- Hello.

677
00:42:52,098 --> 00:42:54,198
Your mothers wanted to see you—

678
00:42:54,198 --> 00:42:55,868
Hey!

679
00:42:56,568 --> 00:42:58,458
I forgot I had a plan.

680
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:02,058
Hey. Let's get them in a civilized manner.

681
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:07,158
- Pack your bags now.
- I'm not going.

682
00:43:07,158 --> 00:43:09,958
- I said I was leaving.
- Shut it!

683
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:13,828
- Suk, pack your bag.
- Okay.

684
00:43:15,558 --> 00:43:18,398
I'm angry, too. You can't do this.

685
00:43:18,398 --> 00:43:21,568
I'm a bit disappointed, too.

686
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:29,628
Suk, let me help you.

687
00:43:29,628 --> 00:43:32,558
Why did you drop out? It was so difficult to get in.

688
00:43:32,558 --> 00:43:35,228
- You've been too pampered.
- "Pampered"?

689
00:43:35,228 --> 00:43:36,648
I've been too pampered?

690
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,968
You know how I've lived to get into that school.

691
00:43:38,968 --> 00:43:41,328
I know. I know. So, why? Why drop out?

692
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:43,938
You worked so hard to get in. So, why?

693
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:46,318
Why ruin a life that was going well?

694
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:49,228
My life isn't yours just because you took me in and raised me.

695
00:43:49,228 --> 00:43:50,908
A life that was going well?

696
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:53,228
What kind of life is that, exactly?

697
00:43:53,228 --> 00:43:56,088
I told you from the beginning that med school's not for me.

698
00:43:56,088 --> 00:43:59,358
Do you know what I was doing there to survive?

699
00:44:00,668 --> 00:44:03,548
What's with you? Wh-What's wrong?

700
00:44:03,548 --> 00:44:06,058
They can't move because the camper broke down.

701
00:44:06,058 --> 00:44:09,558
Auntie Seon Yeong, go back with Suk.

702
00:44:09,558 --> 00:44:12,148
I need to tell Mom something.

703
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:16,508
I'm sorry, Suk. I'll call you later.

704
00:44:22,058 --> 00:44:24,858
Hey, I've never seen Hyo Ri like that.

705
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:28,578
- Comfort her and come back together.
- Okay.

706
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:31,138
- Let's go, Suk.
- Okay.

707
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:51,842
You said you had something to say. What are you doing?

708
00:44:51,842 --> 00:44:53,527
Make it quick so we leave before the sun sets.

709
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:55,657
What's this about?

710
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:04,068
I have a brain tumor.

711
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:07,218
What?

712
00:45:08,628 --> 00:45:10,878
I have a brain tumor.

713
00:45:12,198 --> 00:45:14,288
Geez, you brat. You little...

714
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:17,748
You can't say stuff like that. How could you say that?

715
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:35,348
Hey...

716
00:45:38,688 --> 00:45:40,358
Is it true?

717
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:41,948
Huh?

718
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,298
Is it true?

719
00:45:44,298 --> 00:45:46,308
When did you find out?

720
00:45:51,258 --> 00:45:53,058
Which hospital?

721
00:45:53,058 --> 00:45:54,528
Huh?

722
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:01,378
Let's go together, right now.

723
00:46:01,378 --> 00:46:04,528
Let's... Let's go now...

724
00:46:05,418 --> 00:46:07,548
There must be a bus.

725
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:17,268
It's okay. With medical breakthroughs these days, all that's...

726
00:46:17,268 --> 00:46:22,648
Let's see. Let's take a taxi to the bus terminal.

727
00:46:22,648 --> 00:46:24,648
Where are we, by the way?

728
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,288
Hold on.

729
00:46:57,018 --> 00:47:01,938
This brighter and lumpy part is the tumor.

730
00:47:01,938 --> 00:47:06,508
The image suggests that the primary tumor originated in the brain.

731
00:47:06,508 --> 00:47:08,458
For an accurate diagnosis,

732
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:14,088
the tumor must be surgically removed for a biopsy.

733
00:47:33,178 --> 00:47:35,378
Is that why you ran away?

734
00:47:36,428 --> 00:47:37,748
Hey,

735
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:40,518
you need to be alert and try your best to live.

736
00:47:40,518 --> 00:47:42,998
I've been living like that all along.

737
00:47:42,998 --> 00:47:46,508
I've been trying desperately and tenaciously all my life.

738
00:47:46,508 --> 00:47:48,928
But I don't want to.

739
00:47:48,928 --> 00:47:51,238
I don't want to live tenaciously anymore.

740
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:53,798
What difference does it make?

741
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:58,258
Will my illness go away? No.

742
00:47:59,258 --> 00:48:03,558
I'll just live a boring life and die.

743
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,718
Who says you can die?

744
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:12,258
Don't worry about anything. I'll try to...

745
00:48:12,258 --> 00:48:15,358
Why don't we go to different hospitals and—

746
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:17,668
I've already been to them.

747
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:24,098
Just leave me alone.

748
00:48:24,098 --> 00:48:27,518
Don't try to do anything.

749
00:48:27,518 --> 00:48:29,298
Just...

750
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,198
I need some time alone.

751
00:48:37,198 --> 00:48:39,268
I'll stay in Cheonghae for now

752
00:48:39,268 --> 00:48:42,808
and go back to Seoul once I get sorted out.

753
00:48:42,808 --> 00:48:46,358
- Why don't we—
- Please.

754
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:53,098
Mom, please.

755
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,528
I want to be alone.

756
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,000
I don't want to live tenaciously anymore.

757
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,048
What difference does it make?

758
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,818
I'll just live

759
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:56,428
a boring life and die.

760
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,900
Who says you can?

761
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,500
Hello?

762
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,900
Will you live your life like this?

763
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:03,458
Hello? Who's this?

764
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Yes, Ji An.

765
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,778
Hey, what time is it?

766
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:13,778
Are you crazy?

767
00:52:13,778 --> 00:52:17,500
Is there a time difference between Cheonghae and Seoul?

768
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,900
It's 3 a.m.!

769
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,568
I'm in Seoul, okay? I'm not in Cheonghae.

770
00:52:21,568 --> 00:52:24,200
- What will you do with yeolmu?
- What? Who?

771
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,400
Who's Yeolmu?

772
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,388
- Yeolmu kimchi.
- "Yeolmu kimchi"?

773
00:52:27,388 --> 00:52:29,399
Keep making it for me if you are going to.

774
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,234
You should've never given it to me if you were going to stop.

775
00:52:31,234 --> 00:52:34,564
Why do you tease me by being inconsistent?

776
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,200
Hey.

777
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,448
Hello? Are you sick?

778
00:52:42,448 --> 00:52:43,658
Are you crazy?

779
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:45,100
Hey,

780
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,800
what's the matter?

781
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,208
Are you ignoring me?

782
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,748
I'm not sick, you bitch!

783
00:52:54,188 --> 00:52:57,088
Hello? What?

784
00:52:57,088 --> 00:52:59,600
Is she crazy?

785
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,100
Why am I a bitch?

786
00:53:17,258 --> 00:53:19,488
Who's dying?

787
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,500
Who says?

788
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,700
Hey.

789
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,058
Hey. What's with you?

790
00:53:54,058 --> 00:53:56,000
What do you mean?

791
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,800
Hey, are you really sick or something?

792
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,000
Oh? Ji An.

793
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,800
It's not me.

794
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,758
Hyo Ri is sick.

795
00:54:05,758 --> 00:54:08,268
She's sick, but I didn't know.

796
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,400
Hey, what are you talking about?

797
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,300
Why is she sick? How?

798
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,600
She has a brain tumor.

799
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,500
"Brain"...

800
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:29,800
- "Brain tumor"?
- Yes.

801
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,100
But I didn't know.

802
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,518
She went to a hospital on her own.

803
00:54:39,228 --> 00:54:42,778
I took for granted that I'd die before her.

804
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:46,600
Why can't I take normal things for granted

805
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,900
like everyone else?

806
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,900
But she'll be okay once she gets treated.

807
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,900
What's going on?

808
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,600
Why Hyo Ri?

809
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,000
Why Hyo Ri?

810
00:55:41,488 --> 00:55:43,838
Why Hyo Ri?

811
00:55:56,368 --> 00:56:00,738
Why Hyo Ri? Why Hyo Ri?

812
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,900
Gosh, what will our Hyo Ri do?

813
00:56:39,088 --> 00:56:42,818
There comes a moment when it becomes scary to even cry.

814
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,500
Because if I get caught being scared,

815
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,768
what I fear might actually happen to me.

816
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,800
If I don't cry,

817
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,378
it might end up being a temporary worry

818
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:04,418
and pass as if it were nothing.

819
00:57:11,588 --> 00:57:14,618
As long as I don't get caught being scared.

820
00:57:14,618 --> 00:57:16,698
As long as I don't cry.

How much would the treatment cost?

828
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,900
Lee Ji An?

829
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,800
Why do you control everything, Mom?

830
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,000
Will you keep treating me like this?

831
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,128
You must get back the ₩30 million you lent.

832
00:59:34,128 --> 00:59:35,400
I won't just sit back today.

833
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,100
I'll flip everything upside down.

834
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,800
Do you know what saves a person?

835
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,600
I'm really sorry,

836
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,548
but do me a favor.
