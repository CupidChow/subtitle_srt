2
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,300
What scholarship percentage can you get this semester?

3
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,120
Just seeing her eat like that will give me indigestion.

4
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,670
Gosh, is she determined or foolish?

5
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,120
Doing as much as others

6
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,160
won't let me live like others.

7
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,690
I knew that early on, but...

8
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,440
Let's start the operation.

9
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,230
Scalpel.

10
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,500
- What's this?
- Why did she faint?

11
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,110
Are you okay?

12
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,400
Hyo Ri!

13
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,890
Ms. Lee Hyo Ri.

14
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,220
Are you here alone?

15
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,720
Yes.

16
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,370
The CT and MRI scans detected a brain tumor.

17
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,770
"Tumor"?

18
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,490
It's not metastatic. It appears localized.

19
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,800
We'll know the details after a biopsy.

20
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,800
So, you need surgery first.

21
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,930
But as much as I tried,

22
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,170
exactly as much,

23
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,640
I thought I'd get a chance, too.

24
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,360
It's Patient Kim Min Ji, 27 years old.

25
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,890
She was hospitalized due to sudden quadriplegia.

26
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,400
The test revealed a tumor in her brainstem.

27
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,600
Gosh! Hello, Doctor.

28
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,720
How are you feeling?

29
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,890
She doesn't eat because she's worried.

30
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,250
She's such a troublemaker, Doctor.

31
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,550
Mom.

32
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,220
Don't say stuff like that to the doctor.

33
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,380
While caring for her,

34
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,800
we're telling her to be strong.

35
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,500
I said she can count on you.

36
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,760
Yes.

37
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,120
Don't worry, and relax your mind, as your father said.

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,460
Eat the food your mother gives you

39
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,470
and care for yourself.

40
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,570
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

41
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,270
With this misfortune that's on another level,

42
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,780
I hopelessly...

43
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,560
became afraid.

44
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,690
I became sad.

45
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,040
I'm home!

46
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,160
Have you eaten?

47
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,150
How old are you?

48
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,480
You should feed yourself if I'm home late.

49
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,770
It'd be nice if you made some for me, too.

50
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,810
Let's see what we have.

51
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,100
There it is.

52
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,100
I...

53
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,420
- need to tell you—
- You know I live for you, right?

54
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,000
Become a great doctor soon,

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,500
so I can retire before 50 and enjoy life while shopping.

56
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,550
Hey!

57
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,290
You can't break the door like that.

58
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,140
Guilt mixed with sadness

59
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,100
became a childish tantrum,

60
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,800
anger, and tears.

61
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,510
And it hurt us more.

62
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,100
Ms. Lee Hyo Ri's guardian, please come in.

63
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,760
Okay.

64
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,870
Awake surgery is appropriate

65
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,240
when you cut out a tumor

66
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,050
that's melded into the brain.

67
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,700
Her tumor is small,

68
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,230
but it's located near a highly functional part of the brain.

69
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,420
So, through the awake surgery,

70
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,930
we'll safeguard important parts of the brain

71
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,720
and remove the tumor.

72
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,560
Yes. She'll receive all necessary treatments.

73
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,180
We trust you and will get all the treatments you mentioned.

74
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,700
Please schedule her surgery sooner.

75
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,890
Well,

76
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,300
I will schedule it as soon as possible,

77
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,270
and move it earlier if I can.

78
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,100
Thank you.

79
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,870
Doctor,

80
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,880
as for the treatment cost...

81
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,240
How much will it be?

82
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,280
Don't you want to visit Hyo Ri?

83
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,040
I'm going to HQ now.

84
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,010
You can't even work because of the audit. Why go?

85
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,090
You heard the doctor, right?

86
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,560
I must pay for her treatment. I can't get fired.

87
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,510
Will you beg the owner or something?

88
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,300
That piece of work?

89
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,100
No matter what it takes, I'll survive at work

90
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,510
and give her all the good treatments she can get.

91
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,590
I'll go now.

92
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,880
Hey, please call Hyo Ri. Okay?

93
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,630
Sir.

94
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,400
My sister-in-law is a nurse at Mungyeong Hospital.

95
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,620
- Should I ask her?
- Yes, if I need help later.

96
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,310
How are things with the Audit Team?

97
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,880
They seem to think it was Manager Jang based on the circumstances.

98
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,980
But the owner is so unpredictable.

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,200
- Let's try talking to him.
- Yes.

100
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,040
Here he comes.

101
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,210
I see you often lately, Manager Lee.

102
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you feeling anxious?

103
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,800
I get to see you often because of it. It's so nice.

104
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,570
Hey,

105
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,590
try harder when you lie.

106
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,810
You can't be successful because you can't do that.

107
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,840
Come on. Fill it up with Spam.

108
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,680
You can't even tell Spam and sausage apart.

109
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
Just give it to me. Give it to me.

110
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,340
Give it to me.

111
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,690
Sir, regarding Manager Lee's audit—

112
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,550
Yes, the audit.

113
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,300
I spoke with the Audit Team.

114
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,680
You must take some responsibility.

115
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,160
Pardon?

116
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,780
Sir, you're joking. Right?

117
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,240
It's your fault for not catching it.

118
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,870
Just accept it and be done with it.

119
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,650
You went through a lot. Go on and eat.

120
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,000
Sir, it's so unfair for her—

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,990
Why are you butting in again?

122
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,100
You don't know when to butt in or not, do you?

123
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,600
It's not that, Sir.

124
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,370
Based on her circumstances, if she can't work—

125
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,930
"Circumstances"? What circumstances?

126
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,400
Who in this country doesn't have circumstances?

127
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,300
Manager Lee is still young. She can quickly find another job.

128
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,730
Right.

129
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,800
You said your daughter goes to a top medical school.

130
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,300
You seem to have no luck with a husband.

131
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,310
Let your daughter pamper you and play rich.

132
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,900
Gosh, I'm jealous.

133
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,400
- Gosh, Sir.
- Did I just get fired?

134
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,500
- I'll give you severance pay—
- Whatever.

135
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,700
- Did you just fire me?
- What did you say?

136
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,280
How can you come into work at 11:00 a.m. every day? Do you know the work hours?

137
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,450
Even kindergarteners need to arrive by 9:00 a.m.

138
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,070
You show up late, and you bully the employees

139
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,420
who left home while it was still dark out.

140
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,200
You call whomever's below you "this bastard" and "that bastard."

141
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,410
You'll pay me severance pay?

142
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,930
Wake up.

143
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,400
That's my right, not your charity.

144
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,160
You...

145
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,440
You're crazy, right? Oh, right.

146
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,330
It's because you got fired, right?

147
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,500
Listen carefully. Okay?

148
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,600
Do you know why people tolerate your overbearing behavior?

149
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,000
It's to protect something.

150
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,760
It's because they have something to protect.

151
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,000
But I'll quit with no regrets.

152
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,600
I can't afford to waste my time on people like you anymore.

153
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,300
If the severance process doesn't go smoothly,

154
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,800
you'll see me in court with shackles.

155
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,500
Sit.

156
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Come here.

157
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,920
Hey!

158
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,770
I'll no longer tolerate it.

159
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,010
You know how difficult a life Hyo Ri had, right?

160
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,110
Why should she be sick?

161
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,200
This is too unfair.

162
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,700
Thinking about it now,

163
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,800
I worked desperately to protect her.

164
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,170
But I couldn't be...

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,400
by her side when she needed me.

166
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,060
So, I'll stop living like that.

167
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,470
I won't be a pushover.

168
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,860
I'll fight all the injustices

169
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,100
and protect Hyo Ri right by her side.

170
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,400
Good job, Lee Ji An.

171
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,200
You know I'm a blue collar diner conglomerat, right?

172
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,300
I have no parents, siblings, or a husband.

173
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,600
I saved up a lot since I had nothing to spend on.

174
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,500
If we combine our savings,

175
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,930
we can easily pay for Hyo Ri's treatment.

176
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,800
Don't worry. You did a good thing.

177
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,950
Did you think I'd be moved by this?

178
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,200
Whatever.

179
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,500
I couldn't call Hyo Ri.

180
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,440
I just couldn't for some reason.

181
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,890
Bring her back quickly because I miss her.

182
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,910
Okay. Hang up, Bitch.

183
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,180
Dad, hand me the wrench.

184
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,820
Okay.

185
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,700
- Here.
- Thank you.

186
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,660
You make me uncomfortable by being here.

187
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,550
Why don't you check out the neighborhood?

188
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,100
Okay.

189
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,300
Dad,

190
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,000
go downtown. I bought the wrong wire.

191
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,900
It's the wrong size.

192
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,220
Why tell me that so secretly?

193
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,200
Because I would've looked lame.

194
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Right. Men can't look lame.

195
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I'll go without anyone noticing.

196
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,100
What's the deal?

197
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,200
It only took 30 minutes to circle around.

198
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,880
It's so hot.

199
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,690
The empty fields get filled with stray dogs at night.

200
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,300
Sometimes, they get into fights with boars.

201
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,700
Boar. Boar.

202
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,640
Hey.

203
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,500
She looks very skillful.

204
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,240
These are basic skills you learn in school.

205
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,400
Are you okay?

206
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,000
Why am I here?

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,010
You overdressed to work in the field in this heat.

208
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,400
Of course, you have heat exhaustion.

209
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,610
To tan the right amount for my physique,

210
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,400
I can't expose my skin to the sun.

211
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,500
But I can't give up on our garlic, either.

212
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,500
So, I had no choice...

213
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,500
but to work overdressed like this.

214
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,200
Gosh, my image was ruined.

215
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,600
You have no image to protect around here.

216
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't try to save face and

217
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,300
try not to inconvenience others. Okay?

218
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,160
If it weren't for her,

219
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,150
you would've been eaten by stray dogs.

220
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you feel dizzy or nauseous?

221
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Drink water often, little by little,

222
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,090
and rest a while before moving.

223
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,100
Okay.

224
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,040
But you know...

225
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,300
are you a doctor or a nurse?

226
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,800
I was in medical school, but I quit.

227
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,100
I'm nothing anymore.

228
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,100
Go to the hospital if you feel sick after 30 minutes.

229
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,160
Okay.

230
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,640
Thank you.

231
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,870
Bye-bye.

232
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,990
Good work.

233
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,770
Is she pretty and smart, too?

234
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,440
Your eyesight is good at times like this.

235
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,850
It's no good.

236
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,700
Hello. How much are the apples?

237
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,680
They're 10,000 won for four.

238
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,100
- I see.
- Help yourself. They're tasty.

239
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,230
Hello, Sir.

240
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,050
I'm looking for electrical wiring.

241
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,550
Will the 5-meter one work?

242
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,520
Goodness...

243
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,070
Oh, it hurts!

244
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,100
Gosh, you're so out of touch.

245
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,010
Look. Anchorwoman Baek Ji Yeon was on the news with this hair.

246
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,290
Gosh, when? When?

247
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,150
Your faces are different.

248
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,830
You'll look pathetic if you try to copy her.

249
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,940
What are you saying?

250
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,060
Hey, look.

251
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,870
"As the recession continues,

252
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,500
the market prices have been going up."

253
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,270
Hey, that's your problem.

254
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,700
You don't understand the basics.

255
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,000
A newscaster needs a mic.

256
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,200
You must do it properly.

257
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,800
Fine. If I held this...

258
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,620
"As the recession continues..."

259
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,720
Are you okay?

260
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,500
He doesn't have an accent.

261
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,900
He said, "Are you okay?"

262
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,640
Go in there!

263
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,690
Jeong Seok!

264
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,290
Jeong Seok! Jeong Seok!

265
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,740
Hey!

266
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,220
I thought the transfer student was a bookworm.

267
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,860
When did you steal a girl's heart?

268
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,480
Wow!

269
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,380
Look.

270
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,810
- Hey, hold on—
- Hey!

271
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:42,430
Jeong Seok's girlfriend is here! Oh my gosh!

272
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,840
What's she doing there?

273
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,040
Geez, stop.

274
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,840
♫  The sky is open toward us  ♫

275
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,180
♫  And you're by my side  ♫

276
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,740
♫  You're standing smiling brightly  ♫

277
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,510
♫  Yes, you're the blue ocean  ♫

278
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,060
♫  You're the blue ocean  ♫

279
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,550
♫  I love you  ♫

280
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,580
♫  I love you  ♫

281
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,840
♫  I love you  ♫

282
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,360
♫  I love you  ♫

283
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,630
Ryu Jeong Seok?

284
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,600
Lee Ji An?

285
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,350
What a small world.

286
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,900
We ended up meeting again like this.

287
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,670
I know.

288
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,400
You haven't...

289
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,220
changed much, Ms. Lee.

290
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,100
"Ms. Lee"?

291
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,200
Talk to me casually, Oppa.

292
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,100
I don't talk casually to random people.

293
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,320
"Random people"?

294
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,260
Anyway, you became a lot more handsome.

295
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,060
Well, I aged a lot—

296
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,970
You used to wear huge glasses

297
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,100
and those drab clothes. What was that?

298
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,730
You wore only depressing colors.

299
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,630
Your nickname was Pity Party, you know.

300
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,010
I was going for minimalism.

301
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,220
- Minimal—
- But I still liked you.

302
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,370
My friends said I had poor taste, but I didn't care.

303
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,980
Hey, Lee Ji An!

304
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,060
You're talking casually!

305
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,930
It seems you can do it with any random person.

306
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm joking because I'm happy to see you.

307
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,880
It's so interesting that we met like this.

308
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
By the way, what brings you here?

309
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,880
Are you here to get someone, too?

310
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,770
- What?
- I'm here to get my daughter.

311
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,600
She's pretending to be on a trip, but she ran away.

312
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,300
Does your daughter drive a camper, by chance?

313
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,620
Did you become a psychic?

314
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,160
Let's go.

315
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,100
Isn't it heavy?

316
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,440
Wow, is this your house?

317
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,860
We must have a special connection.

318
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,440
Please don't read too much read into it.

319
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,690
Let's call it a coincidence, not fate.

320
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,690
Lee Hyo Ri!

321
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,790
Hey, Lee Hyo Ri!

322
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,640
Hyo Ri!

323
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,640
Lee Hyo Ri!

324
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,280
Hyo Ri.

325
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,810
Didn't you understand what I said?

326
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,170
I told you to leave me alone, even for just a moment.

327
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,390
I went to the hospital today.

328
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,140
I got a treatment plan. The treatment fee...

329
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,040
Anyway, let's go to Seoul. Let's properly—

330
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,430
Why do you get to decide everything? I asked you...

331
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,980
to wait just a few days.

332
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,580
I'm worried your condition will worsen—

333
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,580
I'm trying to live right now.

334
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,060
Do you know what the diagnosis means?

335
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,580
It means I need to change the way I live.

336
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,060
I don't know how much time I have.

337
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,120
So, what I should live for and how,

338
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,020
I need time to figure that out.

339
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,330
What about me?

340
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,970
Am I not...

341
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,130
one of your reasons to live?

342
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,360
I'm sorry,

343
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,750
but I have no energy to care for you now.

344
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,940
I'm overwhelmed just thinking of myself.

345
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,440
So, you care for yourself.

346
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,270
Why weren't you there...

347
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,640
when I needed you?

348
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,840
Why me?

349
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,950
Why me?

350
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,580
What did I do wrong?

351
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,230
Why just me?

352
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,870
What did I do wrong, exactly?

353
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,940
Hey!

354
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,410
Hey!

355
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,800
Hey!

356
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,440
Hey!

357
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,990
Hey!

358
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,870
It stopped raining.

359
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,380
Thank you so much.

360
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,860
I'll leave with my daughter tomorrow.

361
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,240
You know the rule of brattiness, right?

362
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,040
There are kids who behave until high school,

363
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,690
but then go through puberty late in their 20s.

364
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,200
I'm a known brat myself, too.

365
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,110
Menopause beats puberty.

366
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,820
Fighting.

367
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,420
What's wrong?

368
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,580
Don't fuss. I fell into the ocean.

369
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,370
What? H-How did that happen?

370
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,650
It's okay. I'll do it.

371
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,760
Why did you do that?

372
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,790
It was an accident, right? A mistake, right?

373
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,440
I was standing on the beach,

374
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,050
and the waves suddenly became intense.

375
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,280
Why would you go to the beach?

376
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,990
The waves were too strong,

377
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:17,150
and I had no energy to withstand them.

378
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,200
It's okay. Let's go to Seoul tomorrow.

379
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,300
The waves were much stronger than I was.

380
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,100
Of course, they were. The ocean is dangerous.

381
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,000
Should I no longer go to the beach because I might drown?

382
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,500
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

383
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,590
No.

384
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,580
I won't do that.

385
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
I'm not going to Seoul.

386
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,730
Not seeing the ocean, even though I want to,

387
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,430
because of the fear of drowning,

388
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,300
and waiting until things get safe,

389
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,000
I won't do that anymore.

390
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,700
Hey.

391
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,100
Come to our house.

392
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,000
She must be in shock.

393
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,330
Let's feed her a warm meal.

394
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,410
Okay!

395
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,880
I haven't eaten, either, Hyung.

396
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,920
Hyung, I was so shocked, too.

397
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,300
Earlier at the beach,

398
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,200
I was so shocked. My heart is still racing.

399
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,300
I need a warm meal, too, Hyung.

400
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,100
Hyung, we must have a telepathic connection.

401
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,200
- Come.
- Okay.

402
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,660
Hello.

403
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,500
Hyung, I'll move this and be right there!

404
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,740
Wait, Hyung!

405
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,460
Gosh, let me finish it.

406
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,360
You're so good at cooking meat.

407
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,160
Invite me sometimes, Hyung.

408
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,300
You have a healthy appetite.

409
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,100
I've been told that I was a good eater since I was a kid.

410
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,490
They must've meant it sarcastically.

411
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,010
Pardon?

412
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,560
Never mind.

413
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,870
Thank you for today. I heard you saved her.

414
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,710
Not at all.

415
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,150
By the way,

416
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:54,430
it's hard to run into a hometown friend like this.

417
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,040
It's meant to be. Right?

418
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,610
Hyung...

419
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,090
was really handsome back in school, right?

420
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,800
Your father...

421
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,080
well...

422
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,810
got very good grades.

423
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,400
He was a good student and...

424
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,700
h-he was a good student.

425
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,030
No.

426
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,840
Not that. Wasn't he totally

427
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,970
handsome and super popular?

428
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,600
Girls lined up in front of his school to see him, right?

429
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,200
Excuse me, I repeatedly said he was a good student.

430
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,900
Don't you think there is a reason

431
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,560
and you should stop?

432
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,610
I fed meat to these people, and hear this?

433
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,900
You got funnier, Ji An.

434
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,410
Yes. I got really funny.

435
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,800
You have a beautiful home.

436
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,600
I've always wanted to live in a house like this.

437
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
- "A house like this"?
- Yes.

438
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,990
A house with a picturesque view.

439
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,500
You see the seasons changing.

440
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,900
It has stairs, a high ceiling, and a garden, too.

441
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,600
It's like a house in dramas.

442
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,430
Hey, I said I'd build us a nice house.

443
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,800
When I was little,

444
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,600
I found it ironic that we didn't have a house

445
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,140
when you build houses.

446
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,280
But not anymore.

447
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,100
I just...

448
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,100
want you to not lend money to others, save modestly,

449
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,280
and get a small apartment soon.

450
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,190
Mom is a construction site manager.

451
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,100
A "site manager"?

452
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,500
I know a lot of good lots to build houses.

453
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,180
Discuss it with your husband and let me know if you really want to build.

454
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,450
I'll recommend a few lots I've been keeping secret.

455
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,400
I'm a single mom.

456
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,500
- If I tell you about raising Hyo Ri alone—
- Thank you for the meal.

457
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,800
I'm not feeling well. I should rest.

458
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,700
Let's go, Mom.

459
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,210
Why are you suddenly doing this?

460
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,630
Are you in pain, by chance?

461
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,740
- Is that something to brag about?
- What?

462
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,880
Are you proud that you're a single mom?

463
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,600
Should you get an award or something?

464
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,100
Hey, should I be ashamed then?

465
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,500
I chose to have you and raised you so well.

466
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,230
I should be proud. Is that a shame?

467
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,470
You can be proud since it was your decision.

468
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,600
What about me?

469
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,000
I was born as the daughter of a single mom. I didn't get to choose.

470
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
- Hey.
- Do you think you should be proud?

471
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Then, why not say you adopted me?

472
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Wouldn't that make you prouder?

473
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,440
Why bring this up now?

474
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,370
What does it have to do with anything?

475
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,630
When you have meals with people,

476
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,400
they always ask where your dad is and what he does.

477
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
I'd rather come right out and tell them—

478
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,990
That's why you blabbered to everyone throughout my school days

479
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,730
when we made introductions.

480
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,300
Did you find that embarrassing?

481
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,210
Why did you pretend you were okay when I told people?

482
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,600
You should've told me not to say anything.

483
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,400
I wasn't okay with it.

484
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,010
I had to pretend that I didn't care

485
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,940
to feel less embarrassed. So, I acted okay.

486
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,360
Because I didn't want other kids talking about us,

487
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,030
I studied desperately.

488
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,540
Because grades equal power,

489
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,750
I studied desperately so they couldn't say a word.

490
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,610
So, don't say that to people in front of me anymore.

491
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,220
If you really want to brag about it,

492
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,880
do it when I'm not around to people who have nothing to do with me.

493
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,280
Is that why you looked down on me,

494
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,250
dropped out without discussing it,

495
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,300
and refused to go to a hospital in Seoul?

496
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,720
- I'll manage myself.
- Manage what? You can't manage this alone.

497
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,550
Will you keep treating me like this?

498
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,490
Fine, I get it.

499
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,330
I-I made no accomplishments,

500
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,600
and I didn't do much for you.

501
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,800
Now, I know I blabber my mouth, not knowing when to shut it.

502
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Fine. We're going to Seoul tomorrow.

503
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,700
Let's stop.

504
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,300
Who's that?

505
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,820
Is she someone's sister?

506
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,630
Don't you know? She's Hyo Ri's mom.

507
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,710
Gosh, did she have her in high school?

508
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,810
She must've been a partyer.

509
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,400
I heard she divorced her husband.

510
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,600
If I stayed with my first love,

511
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,190
my son would've joined the military by now.

512
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,900
Not everyone can do that.

513
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,600
You have to have the knack for it.

514
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,500
She must've lived up to her pretty face.

515
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,900
Hey, if it's about looks,

516
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,300
she can't beat me.

517
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,700
You're so silly.

518
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,200
Seriously. You're pretty.

519
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,250
Hello.

520
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,800
I'm Hyo Ri's mom.

521
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,000
We kind of know.

522
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,500
What is it?

523
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,480
I know that you "kind of know."

524
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,040
I want to provide facts.

525
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,610
It's true that I was a partyer in high school.

526
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,180
But I had her after graduating.

527
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,400
I'm not a divorcee. I never married.

528
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,500
I'm a single mom.

529
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,960
And you...

530
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,890
are nowhere near my competition.

531
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Why is there nothing easy in this world?

532
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:12,320
I always attacked first because it was tough to hear murmurs.

533
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,420
But that wasn't the solution.

534
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,400
How could I have known that it made things harder for you, Girl?

535
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,950
Excuse me.

536
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,300
I think there was a deal between us.

537
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,700
Just like I'm trying my best to fix the camper,

538
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,600
I want you to do your best to work here, too.

539
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,860
I don't ever do anything half-assed.

540
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,490
Whenever I do something,

541
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,400
I always get the perfect score.

542
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,460
- "Perfect score"?
- Perfect score.

543
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,710
Okay, then.

544
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,000
I'll expect a thorough job.

545
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,730
Give me your hand.

546
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,770
Another fragrant day!

547
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,290
- Nice, nice, nice!
- Nice, nice, nice!

548
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,750
Nice, nice, nice. Okay?

549
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,630
One more time.

550
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,160
Another fragrant day! Nice, nice, nice!

551
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,800
- This is Korea.
- Go.

552
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,070
So, let me repeat myself.

553
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,000
Cut the stem at a 45-degree angle like this.

554
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,620
The cross-section needs to be large so it absorbs water and grows.

555
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,450
- Here?
- No, no. A little lower.

556
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,250
- "Lower"?
- Yeah.

557
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,230
At a 45-degree angle.

558
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,170
You're good.

559
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,940
45-degree angle...

560
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,750
That's right.

561
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,680
You did it right.

562
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,600
Are you tired?

563
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,410
No, not at all.

564
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:10,790
Really?

565
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,870
Yes, I'm fine.

566
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,430
You must've worked for a long time.

567
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,660
Has it been six years?

568
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,900
I started when I dropped out in 11th grade.

569
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,490
It's been about six years.

570
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,120
I see.

571
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,780
It was nice to see.

572
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,290
Huh?

573
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,610
You seemed happy.

574
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,920
You're right.

575
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,620
I really love this job.

576
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:53,500
By the way,

577
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,490
why do you act so rude?

578
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,390
Why are you rude to your mom?

579
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,620
I saw you arguing with your mom yesterday.

580
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,880
- You—
- That doesn't make you feel less victimized.

581
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,080
You don't love her less, either.

582
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,390
So, I am curious why you keep behaving rudely to her?

583
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,650
It's not something you should care about.

584
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,130
Don't overstep boundaries, please.

585
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,490
You're right.

586
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,100
I overstepped boundaries.

587
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,840
I'm sorry.

588
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,880
Hyo Ri.

589
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,040
Your mom must've left this yesterday.

590
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,630
It kept ringing.

591
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,950
- Thank you.
- Sure.

592
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,850
Don't look at me like that first thing in the morning.

593
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,560
Get ready to go to Seoul.

594
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,280
Hey, it's Chief Hwang's mother's 80th birthday today.

595
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,000
His family lives in Cheonghae.

596
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,800
Go and see him. You need your 30 million won back.

597
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,200
The address is...

598
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,390
Again? Did you lend money again?

599
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,910
Why...

600
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,580
Will you always be a pushover?

601
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,700
- It's not that. It's not that.
- It's not?

602
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,870
Chief Hwang's mother is sick.

603
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,880
I told you,

604
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,160
monetary exchange is for those who can afford it,

605
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,270
or for people who don't mind burning bridges.

606
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,260
I said you aren't qualified!

607
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,500
I'll get it back. He promised to pay it back.

608
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,470
Follow me.

609
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,270
Hey, where are we going? It hurts.

610
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,860
Auntie Seon Yeong sent you the address. You have to go there.

611
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,370
Will you lose 30 million won?

612
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,110
It's okay. I'll go. You stay.

613
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,160
You're not well.

614
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,960
Where is it?

615
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,980
You shouldn't have given a loan if you cared about me so much.

616
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,980
It's not far from here. Take a taxi.

617
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,500
Hey, Lee Hyo Ri, I said I'll take care of it.

618
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,180
And it's hard to get a taxi here.

619
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,800
- Hello.
- Hi.

620
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,980
What?

621
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,540
It takes about 30 minutes. Should I play music?

622
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,640
Okay. Play NEXT, please.

623
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,100
Let's drive quietly.

624
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,410
You're so inconsiderate.

625
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,100
He's suggested playing music because it's awkward.

626
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,800
- Right?
- Pardon?

627
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,700
- Well...
- He wants to drive quietly,

628
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,000
but after seeing your face, he wondered if he should play music,

629
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,760
to be considerate of his elder.

630
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,510
- Right?
- Huh?

631
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:53,750
- Yes.
- Hey, hey, did you say "elder" just now?

632
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,870
If I get dolled up, people still think I'm a college student.

633
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,620
I haven't heard such a silly joke in a long time.

634
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,920
Wow, seriously.

635
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,000
Bo Hyeon, when you first saw me,

636
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,920
glancing from afar, you thought I was in my 20s. Right?

637
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,690
Why do you keep pressuring him? Don't do that.

638
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,380
It'd be pressure if I were unreasonable.

639
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,080
I'm just doing a fact-check. That's not applying pressure.

640
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:31,870
I think this is it.

641
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,620
I won't let him get away with it. I'll flip everything upside down.

642
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,760
Do it right. Don't argue pointlessly.

643
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,800
Swear, scream, roll eyes, and fight.

644
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,870
- Otherwise, you can't get the money back.
- You just watch.

645
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,860
I worked at a construction site for years.

646
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,400
We'll take a taxi to go back. You can leave.

647
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,550
Thank you.

648
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,310
Mr. Hwang Yeong Ju!

649
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,370
Mr. Hwang Yeong Ju!

650
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,030
Don't say "Mister."

651
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,740
Gosh, got it. This girl...

652
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,930
Hwang Yeong Ju!

653
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,310
Chief Hwang!

654
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,690
Are you home alone?

655
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,850
No.

656
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,820
Where's dad? Where's he?

657
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,980
Dad is at Grandma's hospital.

658
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,550
It's a nursing hospital.

659
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,550
Who are you?

660
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,600
Huh? Gosh, thank you.

661
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,550
Thank you.

662
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,010
We don't know...

663
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,000
where Dad went.

664
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,780
Oh, I see.

665
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,370
Where's Mom?

666
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:20,220
Your siblings are so healthy.

667
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,390
- Don't say stuff like that.
- Ouch!

668
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,100
Gosh, are you okay?

669
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,870
Are you okay?

670
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,610
It hurts.

671
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,290
Sis, I'm hungry.

672
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,650
Okay.

673
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,510
I'll make you food and go to work.

674
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,240
Do you work?

675
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,320
I clean griddles at a barbecue restaurant.

676
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:51,840
There's nothing more fun than watching fights.

677
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,530
I'm not going anywhere.

678
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,930
They should start screaming soon.

679
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,360
Huh?

680
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,660
One, two, three.

681
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,170
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

682
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,880
Two, three.

683
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,610
There.

684
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,550
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

685
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,870
There.

686
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,140
Smile.

687
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,880
Smile.

688
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,410
Here.

689
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:51,040
- A heart.
- So pretty.

690
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,060
- Eat.
- Thank you.

691
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,460
Let me help you.

692
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,580
Put ketchup.

693
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,890
Enjoy.

694
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,540
Say "ah."

695
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:02,840
Enjoy.

696
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,620
Eat this.

697
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,390
Do you want to try this?

698
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:14,600
Gosh, you acted all tough and smart.

699
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,650
Since when did you care about humanity?

700
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,590
Geez.

701
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:21,740
Excuse me!

702
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,280
Huh?

703
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,250
Well...

704
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,500
It's Grandma's 80th birthday.

705
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,000
He's treating Grandma and her friends to a meal.

706
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,430
Wow, he's having a party instead of paying me?

707
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,720
Can you do it properly?

708
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,360
Stay here. I'll take care of it.

709
00:52:53,300 --> 00:53:07,360
♪  Deep within the waves of the Samakdo  ♪

710
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:14,170
♪  The young bride standing at the dock  ♪

711
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,010
Mom, happy 80th birthday!

712
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,870
Applause.

713
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,690
Be healthy!

714
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,320
Gosh, so frustrating.

715
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,840
Manager Lee!

716
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,720
Gosh, Mom.

717
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,120
You're 80 but still so pretty.

718
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,550
Mom, I will make a lot of money and

719
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,110
show you around Seoul.

720
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,900
You wanted to see the 63 Building.

721
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,350
It's not so hard to do, but I still haven't taken you there.

722
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:35,990
Mom, wait just a little. Okay?

723
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,600
Mom, eat well.

724
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,870
I'll visit you soon.

725
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,640
Manager Lee,

726
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,260
I'm a jerk, aren't I?

727
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:16,200
I know how hard you worked for that money.

728
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,300
But I...

729
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,580
I'm sorry.

730
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,160
When I lent you that money,

731
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,850
do you think I thought that

732
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:34,020
I might not get it back?

733
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,240
I didn't.

734
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,380
I still don't.

735
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,800
Chief...

736
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:48,660
you don't know how hard I worked for that money.

737
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:06,560
How dare you act like this?

738
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:12,210
Why do my wife and daughter always drag me down?

739
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,200
Why?

740
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,940
Honey, this is Cho Rong's funeral!

741
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,990
Come to your senses!

742
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:22,570
It's your fault!

743
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:29,180
What are you doing?

744
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:33,140
Who said you can demolish and redevelop?

745
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,620
I...

746
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,780
lived a lot more depressingly

747
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,420
and devastatingly than you think.

748
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,340
So, I know.

749
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,500
When a person is struggling too much,

750
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:50,660
you think, "I want to stop living."

751
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,620
You can barely breathe at some point.

752
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,880
But...

753
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,030
you know what makes you go on?

754
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,320
People.

755
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,500
Cho Rong.

756
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,900
My mom...

757
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,080
My mom left me.

758
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,390
What kind of mom abandons her daughter?

759
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,630
Don't cry.

760
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,520
You have me by your side.

761
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,510
Stop crying.

762
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,900
Ji An.

763
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:38,360
I learned that people let you breathe.

764
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:45,500
Your kids are sweet.

765
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,610
You're enduring your hardships well.

766
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,830
Gosh, my daughter called me a pushover.

767
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,320
I'm not a pushover.

768
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,590
I'm a romantic.

769
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,120
So, I believe in miracles.

770
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,390
A miracle isn't anything special.

771
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:11,140
People with no connections and nothing, like us,

772
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,130
let each other live briefly,

773
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:16,400
even though they call us pushovers.

774
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,720
That's a miracle.

775
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:24,290
I lent you a miracle worth 30 million won.

776
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,380
Make sure to return it.

777
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,760
You must recycle miracles.

778
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,000
Since I need it back, take your time...

779
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,400
surviving until the end, and give it back.

780
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,500
Manager Lee.

781
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,400
Manager Lee, you know...

782
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,730
Here.

783
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,700
What's this?

784
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:25,000
I got a text from Chef Kim from the diner.

785
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,300
I heard about your daughter.

786
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,300
Even if my life depended on it, I have no money.

787
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:39,400
This is a small house my mom owned.

788
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,280
Well, no. It's not much of a house.

789
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,800
It's just a shabby farmhouse at the foot of a mountain.

790
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,470
Selling it won't get you much.

791
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,980
But...

792
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,000
I just wanted to do this.

793
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:58,400
I'll go.

794
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,200
Hey,

795
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,900
young lady.

796
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,650
Well...

797
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
Your mom...

798
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,700
isn't a pushover.

799
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,800
She's a good person.

800
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,530
She saves lives.

801
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:27,450
It might take time,

802
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,700
but I'll make sure to survive and...

803
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:35,000
Miracle? I'll return it to you.

804
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,300
Okay.

805
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,950
Take care.

806
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,220
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

807
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,970
- Thank you for today.
- Sure.

808
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:31,100
Excuse me.

809
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,950
I'm over here.

810
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:42,710
I thought maybe you forgot to care for me.

811
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,700
By the way,

812
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,630
my life is...

813
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:54,520
so hopelessly dark.

814
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,900
Isn't that a foul?

815
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:28,570
I'm trying to live right now.

816
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:31,000
Do you know what the diagnosis means?

817
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,500
It means I need to change the way I live.

818
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,170
You have a beautiful home.

819
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,880
I've always wanted to live in a house like this.

820
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,650
"A house like this?"

821
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:43,860
Not seeing the ocean even though I want to,

822
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,470
because of the fear of drowning,

823
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,260
and waiting until things get safe,

824
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,900
I won't do that anymore.

825
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,700
Oppa,

826
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,910
I'm so sorry,

827
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:08,740
but do me a favor.

828
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,660
I can't see anything.

829
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,670
If we fall into a rice field,

830
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:22,700
no one will save us since we're in the countryside.

831
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,400
We'll freeze to death.

832
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,490
Who freezes to death in the summer?

833
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:29,400
I'm saying that's how dangerous it is.

834
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,390
You have poor comprehension skills.

835
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,530
Okay, go further. Go further.

836
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:38,250
Have you always been this supportive?

837
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,540
Huh? Over here.

838
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,700
There's something. Look, look.

839
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,200
It's here.

840
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,100
Stop, stop.

841
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,660
Wow, what's this?

842
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,240
Is it a haunted house?

843
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:06,090
It's not a haunted house.

844
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:08,010
It's Hyo Ri's house.

845
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,600
The ceilings are high,

846
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,350
it has stairs,

847
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:15,680
and it has a garden.

848
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,800
It's Hyo Ri's house.

You're making me want to right now.

870
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,970
Don't be surprised about how dogged I am.

871
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:11,730
I'll do something instead of crying.

872
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,390
The belly button is bigger than the belly.

873
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:16,290
- You'll build it, Oppa.
- I said I can't! I won't!

874
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:18,000
I looked for you desperately.

875
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,900
It's for my roots, not the wave.

876
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,910
Have I been approved?

877
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:25,950
Good boy.

878
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:28,910
Why are you trying to fix that house?
