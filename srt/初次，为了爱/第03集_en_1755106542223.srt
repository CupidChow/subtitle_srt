2
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,210
Ji An, you're here.

3
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,450
Stop talking like you're from Seoul.

4
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,510
I can't stand it. That won't make you an actor.

5
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,690
I sound so natural.

6
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,080
Why must you criticize?

7
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,930
Is today a special day?

8
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,120
No, not at all.

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,770
The mackerel at the fish shop looked good.

10
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,730
You like mackerel.

11
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,040
That's why I bought some.

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,510
Just be home more often.

13
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,440
I hear other moms yell at their kids to come

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,870
home early and not sleep outside.

15
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,250
Unlike other moms,

16
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,140
I'm pretty.

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,030
Do you know what they call this these days?

18
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,670
- "Princess Syndrome."
- Gosh.

19
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,930
Here.

20
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,380
Eat quickly, and we'll go for a walk.

21
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,030
Why bother walking by rice paddies?

22
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,210
Listen to you.

23
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,220
Why do you call them rice paddies?

24
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,000
It sounds nicer if you call it a walk.

25
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,720
Here you go.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,290
Eat a lot.

27
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,600
Your dad and I used to come here often.

28
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,510
We used to drink soju here

29
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,510
and talked about silly things.

30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,690
He wanted to have a farm,

31
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,200
but you said you didn't want one.

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,980
Farming or selling stuff isn't for me.

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,580
That's why you left our shop a mess like that.

34
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
So, since we're on the topic, Ji An...

35
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,590
I met a nice man.

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,100
But he wants us to run a business in Vietnam.

37
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,880
We have no hope living like this.

38
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,600
We must do something big to make money.

39
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,100
You could study in Seoul, too.

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,630
I'll settle down in Vietnam first

41
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,540
and then come get you.

42
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,420
You're a high school student. You can live alone.

43
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,390
Let's rent out the shop. That will get you living expenses.

44
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,210
I'll send you money every month, too.

45
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,800
Okay?

46
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,440
Ji An.

47
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,130
Okay.

48
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,800
Yes. Because you're smart and strong—

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,310
Shut up!

50
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,370
Don't say what you don't mean.

51
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,200
I don't need a mom.

52
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,850
Geez, that girl. Where did she get her temper from?

53
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,030
Lee Ji An!

54
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,100
- Aren't we going to Seoul?
- Gosh.

55
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,200
You scared me.

56
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,540
Why does she suddenly act like a girl?

57
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,940
Aren't you going to work?

58
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,010
I'm on vacation.

59
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,010
Tell them you take it back and go to Seoul.

60
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,110
Aren't you hungry?

61
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,690
I'm not hungry. I won't eat. I'll sleep.

62
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,450
Okay. I'll make omurice.

63
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,090
I said I won't eat!

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,550
Hello.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
Eggs...

66
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,450
How about carrots?

67
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,350
Peppers, onions,

68
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,970
and garlic.

69
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,300
How about a container?

70
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,600
I have a bad feeling.

71
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm getting a bad feeling.

72
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,020
Hello? H-Hyo Ri?

73
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,300
I should've called you.

74
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,150
I know.

75
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,610
You know Mom's here, right?

76
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,640
Come and get her.

77
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,980
It seems she took time off work.

78
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,920
It's not good to be away from work.

79
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,820
She didn't feel good leaving you alone—

80
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,830
You know.

81
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,360
We will only harm our relationship by being together.

82
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,740
I think we should stay apart

83
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,860
and take time to sort things out.

84
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,130
Auntie...

85
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,610
Yes. Well...

86
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,700
Okay. I'll be there.

87
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,330
I miss you a lot, too.

88
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,900
Okay.

89
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,390
Here. It's 16,000 won.

90
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,020
16,000 won?

91
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,400
Gosh, gosh.

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,500
Th-This carrot...

93
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,880
Is this 3,000 won?

94
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,150
I grew it organically myself.

95
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,660
That's why it's a bit expensive.

96
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,970
Organic is this big?

97
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,240
You're impressive.

98
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,060
I gave it a little bit of fertilizer.

99
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,840
Gosh. That's pesticide-free, not organic.

100
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,370
Organic products are grown naturally

101
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,890
without even fertilizer.

102
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,960
"I gave it fertilizer, but no pesticide. It's pesticide-free."

103
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,700
You should sell it like that.

104
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,420
If you get caught selling stuff like this in Seoul,

105
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,110
you'll see a policeman, Ma'am.

106
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,520
Listen to her.

107
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,980
You're so knowledgeable.

108
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,300
It's just common knowledge.

109
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,120
Have you lived in this village for a long time?

110
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,620
Well, a little,

111
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,060
for about 65 years.

112
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,110
Do you know Yijeong village?

113
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,200
Yijeong Village?

114
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,190
Oh, past that mountain?

115
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,650
Yes. You know.

116
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,420
There's a house there, you know.

117
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,380
Yes, a mansion.

118
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,700
- A mansion?
- A mansion at the foot of the mountain.

119
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,550
A mansion?

120
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,940
It's not a mansion.

121
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,430
Anyway, that house.

122
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,390
What about that house?

123
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,000
I wonder if it's a good place to live.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,070
When they built that house,

125
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,950
they hired a water flow expert, an astrologist,

126
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,520
a bazi expert, and a fortuneteller.

127
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,190
They built it with a great deal of fuss.

128
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,070
But no one ever used the house.

129
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,770
That's why it looks abandoned.

130
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,130
Oh, really?

131
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,240
It didn't look that way.

132
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,680
You know about organic produce,

133
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,370
but you know nothing about houses.

134
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,200
Why are you interested?

135
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,900
The house has an owner.

136
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,100
I'm telling you this just in case.

137
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,220
Our village doesn't just let in new people—

138
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,490
Okay. Take care.

139
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,970
H-Hold...

140
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,300
Organic. Organic.

141
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,610
Geez.

142
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,520
She's right.

143
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,800
Oppa, you haven't had breakfast. Right?

144
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,400
No.

145
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,900
- It's not much of a spread, but—
- It really isn't much.

146
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,670
You should've cooked for the two of you, so why make some for me, too?

147
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,300
It's no trouble at all.

148
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,800
Have breakfast with us for a while.

149
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,600
- Why?
- Why?

150
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,920
Don't feel burdened.

151
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,590
I just put another set of utensils on the table.

152
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,420
I don't feel burdened. I was saying no indirectly.

153
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,700
Is there some for me, too?

154
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,400
Bo Hyeon. There is. Join us.

155
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,800
I am starving.

156
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,400
Thank you.

157
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
- Let me get it for you.
- I'll do it.

158
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,000
- Help yourself.
- Okay.

159
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,360
By the way, looking at you side by side,

160
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,080
you look close like siblings.

161
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,060
- Be good friends.
- Okay.

162
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,280
Don't embarrass us over a meal.

163
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,370
Pretend you didn't hear that.

164
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,500
This is delicious.

165
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,000
Is it? Eat more.

166
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,100
- So, when will you go back to Seoul—
- Dad.

167
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,500
Will you be at your office today?

168
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,700
Yes. I will work at the office.

169
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,100
Really? What time do you leave for work?

170
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,600
I need to talk to you urgently.

171
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,050
Wow. An architecture studio sure is different.

172
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,680
Nice vibe, too.

173
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,510
Wow, so cool.

174
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,700
I'm starting to get a sense.

175
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,500
Huh? What do you mean?

176
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,850
The house we saw last night.

177
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,800
By chance, are you...

178
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,200
Let's do it, Oppa.

179
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,400
Let's fix it up together.

180
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,640
Hold on.

181
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,410
Gosh, gosh...

182
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,120
You're so mean. Seriously.

183
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,240
Can't you help me, considering our old friendship?

184
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,900
I won't do it!

185
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,400
Let's do it, Oppa. Please, let's.

186
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,670
I won't! Didn't you see it last night?

187
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,700
I can't do it. I can't do it, I said!

188
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,200
- I won't do it!
- I want to do it.

189
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,450
Hello.

190
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,400
Stop saying hello. Please.

191
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,960
Mr. Ryu. Mr. Ryu.

192
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,370
Ryu, Ryu, Ryu...

193
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,110
I know you're listening.

194
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,200
Don't be discouraged just because you failed to do it one night.

195
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,070
If you couldn't do it last night,

196
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,300
you can do it tonight.

197
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,500
- Don't you agree?
- You're right.

198
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,200
Well, that's just how it is.

199
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,740
It comes and goes.

200
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,800
It goes and comes. Back and forth.

201
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Gosh. You're at that age now.

202
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,480
That kind of stuff happens all the time.

203
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,730
Of course, I've never experienced that myself.

204
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,000
We can't wait to see you

205
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,400
trying your best, Mr. Ryu.

206
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,090
Fighting!

207
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,630
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

208
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,300
What are they saying?

209
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,200
Why are the villagers here always so random?

210
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,500
This is the country of manners.

211
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,600
You can't do that in the car!

212
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,340
Doing what you aren't supposed to do

213
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,430
always gets you going.

214
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,790
I knew this wouldn't work.

215
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,370
It's perfect.

216
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,020
You said you're a field manager.

217
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,890
Look at the material and environmental conditions.

218
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,960
The crossbeam and the rafters...

219
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,500
They're fine.

220
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,800
The walls are falling off, too.

221
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,240
There isn't much you can keep.

222
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,090
The belly button is bigger than the belly.

223
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,400
The rotten framing can be replaced.

224
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,240
The crumbling walls can be removed and replaced.

225
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,780
It'd be a lot easier that way.

226
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,870
There's nothing around. It's too secluded.

227
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,600
It's dangerous and lonely for you two to live in.

228
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,760
I've only lived in multi-unit buildings for the past 20 years.

229
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,610
I want to be away from neighbors now.

230
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,800
Cut her off.

231
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Oh, right.

232
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,370
We had a brief connection back in high school as a senior and junior.

233
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,950
But I went too far.

234
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,700
I support your decision, Ji An.

235
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,800
I hope you build the house you want.

236
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,360
You'll be building it.

237
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,400
Ryu Jeong Seok, get it together.

238
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,410
You're still just as mischievous.

239
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,600
I'll see you before you leave for Seoul.

240
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Oppa, you'll end up doing it.

241
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,800
Don't fight for no reason.

242
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,450
Hello?

243
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,270
Hey, Hyo Ri. I'm in front of the camper.

244
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,210
I'm coming out now.

245
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,700
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yeah.

246
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,700
Mr. Ryu.

247
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,700
Here's the document.

248
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,490
Geez.

249
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,100
This part is still weak.

250
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,900
- Yes.
- When is the presentation?

251
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
I bought us some time.

252
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,000
Since the county executive has suddenly changed,

253
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,900
they're reestablishing the internal reporting system.

254
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,800
But do you know why the county executive was changed?

255
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
He left his phone at a bar,

256
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,970
- but his phone—
- Spare me.

257
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,060
Spare? I'm sure they have spares.

258
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,160
I don't want to hear silly gossip.

259
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,180
Okay.

260
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,810
Here.

261
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,000
Suggest having a competition for the fun kids' library

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,700
ideas near the borough office.

263
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,100
Since we have time, we should get people's attention.

264
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,150
It'd be nice to get new ideas, too.

265
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,450
Okay. I'll contact them.

266
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,300
- Also...
- Yes?

267
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,570
You know, the abandoned house...

268
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,990
Abandoned house?

269
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,200
- Abandoned house...
- Abandoned house.

270
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,620
You're sick.

271
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,180
Try standing up.

272
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,680
Come on. Stand up.

273
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,500
Breathe out as much as you can.

274
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,200
- Come on and do it.
- No, no.

275
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,270
It's not that.

276
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,100
Gosh, whatever. Go back to work.

277
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,600
Okay.

278
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,820
Don't get sucked in.

279
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,500
Don't get sucked in.

280
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,630
Hello. Hello.

281
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,260
Hey, Bo Hyeon.

282
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,900
What brings you here, Son?

283
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, I wanted to talk to you.

284
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,990
What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.

285
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,790
Egg...

286
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,030
What? Did you come worried about me?

287
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,620
Yes.

288
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,100
I suppose. Yes.

289
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,200
She called you to pick me up, huh?

290
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,350
Geez. Seriously. That's not true.

291
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,160
You have no sense of imagination.

292
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,910
She called you first thing this morning to pick me up.

293
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,500
So, you came in a hurry. I can tell.

294
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,830
Hey. I swear that's not true.

295
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,300
It's not true.

296
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,500
It is.

297
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,750
What?

298
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,310
Crazy. You're so funny.

299
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,780
Gosh. I said it's not true!

300
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,450
Anyway, this is good. You're coming with me.

301
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,240
What? Where are we going? Where are we going?

302
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,700
Hey...

303
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,180
Did you lose your head from the shock?

304
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,930
You'll fix this house up?

305
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,800
It's still considered a mansion in this village, okay?

306
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,000
Wow, I hate it even more.

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,460
Look. We'll change the entire interior.

308
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,600
If we used the basic structure—

309
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,100
Yes, Ji An.

310
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,750
Right now, you're confused

311
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,610
and having a hard time. I know.

312
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,480
But still.

313
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,470
We need to be rational right now...

314
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,860
Hey!

315
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,800
Be careful! You're damaging our house!

316
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,330
Geez. You ruined our door.

317
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,600
Hey, you can't talk like that!

318
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,890
- Hey, Lee Ji An.
- Gosh, whatever.

319
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,400
Where are you going? Where are you going?

320
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,100
Lee Ji An. Lee Ji An! Come to your senses.

321
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,770
Should I remove all this and expand the garden?

322
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,600
Forget it! Why would you fix this house up?

323
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,800
Geez.

324
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,600
It'd be a waste just to use it as a garden.

325
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,300
Is that so? Should we utilize the space?

326
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,460
Wake up!

327
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,400
This would be an endless amount of work.

328
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,170
It's hopeless.

329
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,190
You could use it as a shop if you fixed it up.

330
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,690
We could open a café.

331
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,100
Hey. Who would come this far for coffee,

332
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,390
the village grandmas?

333
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,700
A restaurant would be better.

334
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,450
A restaurant. Yes, it's a restaurant.

335
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,920
Right? It's perfect.

336
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,870
If we start a business under your name...

337
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,580
You wanted to quit working at the diner, right?

338
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,380
Hey. How dare you try to trick me?

339
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
Do you think you can trick me like that?

340
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,430
Forget it, then.

341
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,530
I'll find a renter while we're fixing it.

342
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,020
I'll fix it the way they want. And I'll have a restaurant here.

343
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,540
Hey, when did I say I don't want to?

344
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,840
Are you in? Deal?

345
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,630
When did I say I'd do it?

346
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,660
Geez. Forget it. I'll put it on the market.

347
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,240
Done. You lost your chance.

348
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,010
- Deal, deal. I'm in.
- The ship has sailed.

349
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,500
- The ship has sailed.
- Hey, girl.

350
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,240
You're firm about stupid things.

351
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,100
Hey, I didn't even get to think for a minute. Come here.

352
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,410
That doesn't make you feel less victimized.

353
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,660
You don't love her less, either.

354
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,630
So, I am curious why you keep behaving rudely to her?

355
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,610
He acts high and mighty.

356
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,040
You can tell he's always like that.

357
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,810
He's a total jerk...

358
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,590
Jerk?

359
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,370
Who's a total jerk?

360
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,470
You... What are you doing here?

361
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,430
It's a street.

362
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,860
Right.

363
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,900
I was desperately looking for you.

364
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,600
I need your help right now.

365
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
Done.

366
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,310
Here.

367
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,890
Did I just get an approval?

368
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,930
I suppose.

369
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,140
You're better than Tae Oh.

370
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,860
I don't like who you're comparing me to,

371
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,600
but I appreciate the stamp. I'll return this.

372
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,080
Labor is sacred.

373
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,150
It must be respected.

374
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,260
And I give it to everyone who works here.

375
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,450
Don't overreact...

376
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,200
Okay.

377
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,560
- Got it.
- Okay.

378
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm good at making things pretty.

379
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,980
I know. You pick flowers nicely and wrap them nicely, too.

380
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,670
You look pretty when you work, and you have a pretty face, too.

381
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,530
Shit.

382
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,910
What's this?

383
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,080
The sky is pretty, too.

384
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,000
Everything is pretty.

385
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,240
- Bo Hyeon! Bo Hyeon! What are you up to?
- You came.

386
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,140
- Did you send flowers out?
- Yes.

387
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,410
- Hi.
- Hello.

388
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,070
- What? Are you going surfing again?
- You little...

389
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,980
God of the ocean gave us these waves,

390
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,120
but no one is riding them.

391
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,090
That's a sin. It'd make the god of the ocean sad.

392
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,250
Let's go, Brother.

393
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,550
Right.

394
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,720
Want to come, Pretty Sister?

395
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,740
Do you know what the diagnosis means?

396
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,000
It means I need to change the way I live.

397
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,660
She can't swim.

398
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,410
- Let's go.
- Hey.

399
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,900
I can learn.

400
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,940
What?

401
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,020
You'll teach me, right?

402
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,020
You little...

403
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,060
Don't you know the aloha spirit?

404
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,390
Trust and bond with others,

405
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,900
kindness and love,

406
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,770
that's the surfer spirit!

407
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,050
Let's go. I'll...

408
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,870
teach you the right way.

409
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,570
Go, go, go.

410
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,030
Let's get moving.

411
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,960
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

412
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,260
- Party time, Brother.
- Okay.

413
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,680
Go, go, go.

414
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,340
Let's go...

415
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,030
Hang tight.

416
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,770
We're visiting the god of the ocean.

417
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,710
Oppa!

418
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,050
Hey, So Yeon!

419
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,720
Bo Hyeon, I'm here!

420
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,600
I missed you a lot!

421
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,770
Who's she?

422
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,580
Let's talk when we get there.

423
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,400
Okay. See you.

424
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,230
Hello.

425
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,350
She's not here.

426
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,230
- She's not?
- I'm thirsty.

427
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,410
Let's wait.

428
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,300
The owner didn't look friendly enough to visit friends.

429
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,290
- She'll be back soon.
- What are you saying?

430
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,520
You don't have to know.

431
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,840
Isn't this place kind of nice?

432
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,120
It's so peaceful.

433
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,440
The fact that we find it nice means we're old.

434
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,220
Yes. Only you're old.

435
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,880
I'm just sensitive.

436
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,100
Geez. Keep trying.

437
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,620
The wrinkles on your face show time

438
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,000
and marked their territories.

439
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,720
- Seon Yeong.
- Yes?

440
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,050
I won't cry anymore.

441
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,000
Don't be shocked at how dogged I am.

442
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,570
I'll do something instead of crying.

443
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,660
Yes.

444
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,500
Don't waste your energy on crying.

445
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,640
I'll build a nice house and live happily with my Hyo Ri.

446
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,950
Wrong.

447
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,260
You'll live happily with Hyo Ri and Seon Yeong.

448
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,580
Should I ask Chief An if he knows an architect?

449
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,290
I already chose one.

450
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,860
Seeing how he built his house, he's the real deal.

451
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,910
You went to his house? When? Who's he?

452
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,590
Here he comes. He's our architect.

453
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,860
Oppa!

454
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,480
Are you already calling him Oppa?

455
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,040
He's Oppa until he signs the contract.

456
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,550
I think your oppa is...

457
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,290
running away from us. Am I the only one who thinks that?

458
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,670
Get me ice cream when the lady returns. Get Hyo Ri's, too.

459
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,770
I'm getting to work.

460
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,300
He's running away, though.

461
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,940
The architect is running away.

462
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,540
I'm jogging.

463
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,820
It looks like we share the same course.

464
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,000
So, have you thought about it?

465
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,620
Didn't you keep thinking about our house today?

466
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,820
No way.

467
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,750
Oppa, you know my friend who was with me?

468
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,390
She was called the "Wallpaper Queen" back in the day.

469
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,650
As long as you decide,

470
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:53,160
I can get you the Avengers of contractors.

471
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,600
Oppa, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

472
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,440
Why are you trying to fix that house?

473
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,660
To live in it.

474
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,300
I want to live a fun life with my Hyo Ri.

475
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,780
Huh? Gosh.

476
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,270
Forget it. I can't believe this.

477
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,990
He could just say no.

478
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,250
He can just explain why he can't.

479
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,790
How could he have no manners?

480
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,670
Seriously. Does he think so little of me?

481
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,450
Wow.

482
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,870
Okay.

483
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,820
I can't just insist that you take the job.

484
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,870
But still. If I'm trying this hard,

485
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,020
you should at least give me an answer.

486
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,310
Anyway, fine.

487
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,320
It's obvious that you don't want the job.

488
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,200
I won't bring it up anymore.

489
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,340
Let's do it.

490
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,900
Right.

491
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,200
Also, we only knew each other in high school.

492
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,130
We were just reunited after 20 years.

493
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,380
Calling you Oppa sounds too casual.

494
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,370
Let's be formal from now on, Mr. Ryu Jeong Seok.

495
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,880
Let's do it, Lee Ji An.

496
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,100
Lee Ji An! Let's do it!

497
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,560
You'll do it? You said you'll do it?

498
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,360
You'll really do it?

499
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,110
Oppa!

500
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,330
Really?

501
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,400
I knew it, Oppa. I had faith in you!

502
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,270
We'll make this work.

503
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,610
We will. We'll have fantastic chemistry.

504
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,100
Fantastic chemistry! Fantastic chemistry!

505
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,500
Gosh, those were the days.

506
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,920
Fighting! Fighting!

507
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Wow! Thank you so much!

508
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,940
Nine feet. Long boards.

509
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,270
Since it's wide and thick, it floats well.

510
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,360
What do you do, then?

511
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,500
It's much easier to balance and stand up.

512
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,600
Since you're a beginner,

513
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,700
- you'll use a long board.
- Okay

514
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,880
- Okay?
- Okay.

515
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,200
- Say hello. This is—
- Hi.

516
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,400
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Hyo Ri.

517
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,730
She's pretty. Nice to meet you.

518
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,070
I'm Yu Dong Seok.

519
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,650
There's a restaurant called "Dongseok Butcher House" at the village entrance.

520
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,950
- I'm their youngest son.
- Nice to meet you.

521
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,050
If you mention his name there,

522
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,200
his mom will slap your back. Don't bother.

523
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,200
I run a 2-hectare or 6,000 pyeong organic onion farm.

524
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,930
I'm a farm owner. Farm owner, Lee Jae Dong.

525
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,150
Nice to meet you.

526
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,460
She's Kim So Yeon. She's transparent.

527
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,520
She speaks whatever's on her mind.

528
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,900
She leads a tiring life.

529
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,000
Please be generous and empathetic toward her.

530
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,070
Okay, let's stretch!

531
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,340
Gather around.

532
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,300
Yes. Okay.

533
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,600
Stretch the spine first. One, two, three, four.

534
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,110
Slowly. That's right.

535
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,510
Stretch every joint.

536
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,650
That's right, Hyo Ri.

537
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,740
She's stiff.

538
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,280
- I don't want to do this.
- Hey, hey.

539
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,400
Good.

540
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Okay. Move on to the hips.

541
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,010
To the right. Stretch.

542
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,560
Yes.

543
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,510
That's right.

544
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:16,630
♫  Don't lock the door when the love comes to you  ♫

545
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,260
♫  If our eyes meet, say it's true  ♫

546
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,290
♫  That your heart is feeling it, too  ♫

547
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,240
Paddle with your hands.

548
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,750
Paddle forward.

549
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,920
One, two. The wave is here.

550
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,820
Get ready to push. Push.

551
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,000
Okay.

552
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,980
Nice. Good work.

553
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,580
What are you looking at? Look forward. That's right.

554
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,930
Go forward.

555
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:53,730
♫  When, when love comes to you  ♫

556
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,770
Become one with the ocean.

557
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,490
Drink the ocean water. Okay!

558
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,050
Have faith and lie face down.

559
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,600
Okay, paddle.

560
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,500
Push!

561
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,430
So close.

562
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,700
But you did a great job.

563
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,200
Nice, nice! That's how the first try goes.

564
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,800
Paddle. Push!

565
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,300
Up!

566
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,270
Nice, nice, nice.

567
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,750
It's okay.

568
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,920
It's okay.

569
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,100
Push!

570
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,600
Up!

571
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,350
Nice. Push.

572
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,440
Up, up!

573
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,200
Okay.

574
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,260
Nice.

575
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,580
Hold on. Hold on.

576
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,740
Should we...

577
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,900
rent a big duck tube and use that?

578
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,700
Tubes aren't bad.

579
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,030
It's so fun.

580
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,330
You'd be surprised.

581
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,270
Quack.

582
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,130
Quack, quack.

583
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:08,400
♫  When, when love comes to you  ♫

584
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:17,930
♫  The way I never felt before  ♫

585
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:36,400
♫  When, when love comes to you  ♫

586
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,100
There.

587
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,000
Good job!

588
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,270
You can do it!

589
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,270
You can do it!

590
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,900
♫  And I'm falling  ♫

591
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,450
♫  Don't hesitate  ♫

592
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,950
♫  And fall in love  ♫

593
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,500
Why me?

594
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,200
What did I do wrong?

595
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,500
♫  When the love comes to you  ♫

596
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,200
I saw hope.

597
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,060
Good work.

598
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,460
You've got the surfer's spirit.

599
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,870
You won't give up on me, right?

600
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,760
What? Give up?

601
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,100
I'm just providing a realistic suggestion.

602
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,500
Such as a duck tube.

603
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,200
You're good at everything, So Yeon.

604
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,600
Not everything. She was terrible at studying.

605
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,740
Geez.

606
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,600
I admit it.

607
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,900
What? What? Miss.

608
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,400
Miss!

609
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,260
Miss!

610
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,770
Let's go. Miss, please...

611
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,260
Push! Up!

612
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,810
Nice!

613
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,620
- Wow.
- Great student with a great teacher!

614
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,210
Aren't you tired? You were pushing it.

615
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,620
I'm not tired at all.

616
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,250
I didn't know something so frustrating

617
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,100
could be so much fun.

618
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,200
What are you doing? Close it.

619
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,010
Oh, okay.

620
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,080
So?

621
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,950
How did it feel to ride the wave for the first time?

622
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,500
It was totally exhilarating.

623
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,100
Totally?

624
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,700
I overcame my limit, not the waves today.

625
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,700
I think I have talent.

626
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,400
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

627
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,170
I must collect forms to submit and bring them to Oppa.

628
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,820
Hey.

629
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,800
Ask your architect to join us for dinner.

630
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,200
You need to feel comfortable together before you start working.

631
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,730
So, you can communicate easily.

632
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,650
Should I?

633
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,700
I can tell he's not easygoing.

634
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,200
You know I'm great at face reading.

635
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,140
I didn't like his face reading,

636
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,050
but he's your hometown friend. So, I'll trust him.

637
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,460
How's his face reading?

638
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,360
"Hey, I'm inflexible."

639
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,840
His face says that. It says, "I'm inflexible."

640
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,220
When will you let go of that habit?

641
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,170
You know nothing about face reading.

642
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,180
Whenever you meet someone, you bring up their face reading.

643
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,440
You judge people all the time. Seriously.

644
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,720
What? When you first came to the worksite,

645
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,660
people said, "She looks pretty rude."

646
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,690
And I said, "No, she doesn't look pretty rude.

647
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,900
She looks ridiculously rude."

648
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm the only one who saw it.

649
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,100
Everyone praises me for having a rudeness detector.

650
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,400
Shut up.

651
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,980
Jeong Seok isn't inflexible.

652
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,260
He's a heartbreaker.

653
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,000
Heartbreaker?

654
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,020
A handsome, heartthrob,

655
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,630
and childhood crush type?

656
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,730
Did you join a religion behind my back?

657
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:45,500
Since when were you so generous?

658
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,000
Someone had a crush on him in high school.

659
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,510
I'm telling you.

660
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,600
By chance,

661
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,500
is that someone...

662
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,200
in front of me right now?

663
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,300
When you got a test sheet in school,

664
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,860
without reading the questions, you spun a pencil

665
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,320
and guessed the answers. Right?

666
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,590
That's why you still say random things.

667
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,240
- Right?
- Hey!

668
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,340
I'm older than you.

669
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,590
That was actually pretty perceptive.

670
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,860
You're clever sometimes.

671
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,640
- Whatever. I'll call Oppa, then.
- Yes, call him.

672
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,160
Call him.

673
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,800
- Your fingers look so happy.
- No.

674
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,470
- You like him a lot.
- Geez, no.

675
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,160
Are you nervous? You're calling.

676
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,560
Gosh, why cover your mouth?

677
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,040
Why are you wet again?

678
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,080
- Did you almost drown again?
- No, no.

679
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,770
What do you mean, no? Be careful. It's dangerous.

680
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,600
We're returning from surfing.

681
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,160
- Surfing?
- Yes.

682
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,380
Thank you for today.

683
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,260
I don't know who she takes after.

684
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,900
We're having dinner together later. See you then.

685
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,900
- Okay.
- Really? Should I join you later?

686
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,840
You're back again.

687
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,570
I was told the dinner would take a long time.

688
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,890
It's okay. I need to fix Bo Hyeon's board.

689
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,020
I'll stay a long time.

690
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,430
Okay. See you later.

691
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,550
Okay, got it.

692
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,290
Hyung, it must be heavy. Let me help you.

693
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,490
It's okay. Come on, Bo Hyeon.

694
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,930
Choo-choo. Choo-choo.

695
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,020
See you later. Choo-choo.

696
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,260
He's borderline witty and clueless.

697
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,640
What a questionable character.

698
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,880
I should watch out for now.

699
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,600
- Here.
- Wow!

700
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,000
No joke, huh?

701
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,610
I just love it.

702
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:18,610
It's not over-the-top, clean, and unique.

703
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,000
You have good taste.

704
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Oppa, you have an eyelash.

705
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,340
I got it.

706
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,470
No!

707
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,590
It's not like that. How many times...

708
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,240
It's not like that.

709
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,220
There's nothing going on. We aren't doing anything.

710
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,560
It's not like that.

711
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,000
Bo Hyeon,

712
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,500
doesn't a strong no mean yes?

713
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,970
Hyung.

714
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,800
You're a divorcé.

715
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,980
It isn't weird if you date.

716
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,570
Are you a divorcé?

717
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,330
Tae Oh,

718
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,170
how about you take food to go?

719
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,100
Hyung,

720
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,940
are you looking out for me?

721
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,800
Okay. If so,

722
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,990
I'll take the leftovers after the meal.

723
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,910
Does that work?

724
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:29,960
I'm hungry.

725
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,730
Auntie, serve rice.

726
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,700
Okay, okay. Here comes the pollock stew.

727
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,670
- Come.
- Yo, yo, yo.

728
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,490
There won't be any leftovers.

729
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,160
Okay. Have a seat.

730
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,230
So noisy.

731
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,680
Have a seat. Have a seat.

732
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,330
Impressive, right?

733
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,340
- It's impressive.
- I made it.

734
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,390
Here, here.

735
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,220
Good job.

736
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,340
Well,

737
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,580
I...

738
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,430
heard.

739
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,670
She's here because she's sick.

740
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,230
It seems they just found out.

741
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,560
So...

742
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,630
So, I want her to have a comfortable stay with us.

743
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,110
I see.

744
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,500
If you decided to take on the job

745
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,600
- after hearing that—
- It's not like that.

746
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,090
A project happened to be delayed.

747
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,400
I have some time.

748
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,300
I like money. I need to make money.

749
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,970
Okay. Anyway, thank you.

750
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:50,480
Let's do this together.

751
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,650
Let me visit your Seoul home when you're free.

752
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,370
When I see people's old homes,

753
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,390
I get ideas for their new homes.

754
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,450
Okay. Let's do that.

755
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,070
I'll let you rest.

756
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,050
Is this all you see?

757
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,790
When does your vacation end?

758
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,480
I'm not going to Seoul.

759
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,640
What?

760
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,960
I quit my job.

761
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,680
What did you just say?

762
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,100
- You quit your job?
- Yes, I did.

763
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,000
I'll stay here instead of going back.

764
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,300
- So, just know that.
- Why did you quit your job?

765
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,780
Because I might die?

766
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,700
What?

767
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,030
Why would you talk like that?

768
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,860
She's making me feel that way right now.

769
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,800
She's acting like I'll die any day now!

770
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,610
Aren't you the one who's preparing to die and staying here alone?

771
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:06,300
What are you doing?

772
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,360
How would I feel living in Seoul alone?

773
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,870
I said I can't worry about your life, too.

774
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:13,210
I said I can barely take care of myself!

775
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:16,100
Hey, that's enough. Okay?

776
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,800
If you were me... If I were sick,

777
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,070
could you leave me alone?

778
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,100
I would.

779
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,400
If that's what you wanted.

780
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,720
Do you hate being with me that much?

781
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,760
Yes.

782
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,500
So, take back the resignation letter—

783
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,700
She got fired.

784
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,100
Some of the company's supplies were stolen.

785
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,820
It was a bad situation.

786
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,730
She was treated unjustly.

787
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,430
It's true.

788
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,810
So, stop.

789
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,200
Did you even argue?

790
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,700
Did you foolishly say, "Got it. I'll quit." Didn't you?

791
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,870
What's wrong?

792
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,700
Are you in pain? What's wrong?

793
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,100
Are you in pain?

794
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,010
Let go!

795
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,050
I can always find another job.

796
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:27,900
- Hyo Ri, let's cheer up together.
- You cheer up.

797
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,120
Cheer up alone if you want.

798
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,440
A family can't be apart.

799
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,060
Rather than fight every day together,

800
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,830
I'd rather see you occasionally and feel better.

801
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,360
Why can't we do that?

802
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:27,150
Hyo Ri, I prepared food. Eat it later.

803
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,730
Mom and I will step out.

804
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,800
Leave her alone.

805
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,080
Hey, how long will you do this for?

806
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,020
Hyo Ri?

807
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,550
Hyo Ri.

808
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,580
- Hyo Ri.
- She must be sick.

809
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,700
- What do we do?
- Hyo Ri!

810
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,130
Hyo Ri!

811
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,750
- My gosh.
- Hyo Ri.

812
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,710
Hyo Ri.

813
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,830
Hyo Ri.

814
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,470
- Are you Ms. Lee Hyo Ri's guardian?
- Yes, yes!

815
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,360
Ms. Lee's guardian?

816
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,070
It's acute tonsillitis.

817
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,300
She has a very high fever.

818
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,870
- Until she stabilizes—
- Doctor,

819
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,870
she has a brain tumor.

820
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:38,180
She's seeing a doctor in Seoul.

821
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,840
Can tonsillitis affect the brain tumor somehow?

822
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,410
She should be hospitalized

823
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,660
so we can check once the fever breaks.

824
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,670
If she needs additional treatment or tests,

825
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:56,410
then she should be transferred to her regular hospital.

826
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

827
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,060
What time is it?

828
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,270
It's 7:00 a.m.

829
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,930
You'll get breakfast soon.

830
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,800
I don't want to eat anything.

831
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,500
It's acute tonsillitis.

832
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,400
You won't need any treatment once your fever breaks.

833
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,520
When I was in high school,

834
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,720
after my dad passed away,

835
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,880
my mom dated three men.

836
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,500
One was a karaoke owner.

837
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,700
He turned out to be married.

838
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,010
One was a barbecue restaurant owner.

839
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,000
She had a meltdown because he was two-timing.

840
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:11,130
The third one was a jeans factory owner.

841
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,900
She ended up going to Vietnam with him...

842
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,400
when I was in the 11th grade.

843
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,890
She left me all alone.

844
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,010
Even when I close my eyes,

845
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,300
I can remember that night clearly.

846
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,200
Mom walking away for the last time.

847
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,890
The image of me left alone in that room

848
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,680
is vivid like a picture.

849
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,400
Should I have stopped her

850
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,500
and asked her to stay with me?

851
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,700
Or should I have begged her...

852
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:56,070
to take me with her?

853
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,980
Whenever I'm alone in the empty house,

854
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,800
I picture that night dozens of times

855
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,800
over and over again.

856
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:12,020
I blame her and myself.

857
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,700
I suffered for a very long time like that.

858
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,800
It was hard for me.

859
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,320
You said Grandma was nice.

860
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,390
She was the prettiest in the village. She made tasty soybean stew.

861
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,900
She took you to the cinema because she wanted to be an actor.

862
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,600
I wanted to tell you only good things.

863
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,970
Because nothing is ordinary in our lives,

864
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:42,530
I wanted your memory to be ordinary.

865
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,200
Do you know why I don't like you, Mom?

866
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,600
You think it's okay to pretend to be fine as if nothing's going on.

867
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,900
I hate that.

868
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,560
Because you pretend to be okay and fine,

869
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,370
I have to pretend to be okay and strong.

870
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,400
That was too burdensome and difficult.

871
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,190
Hyo Ri...

872
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,640
I'm scared.

873
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,600
I...

874
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,150
don't know what a good mom is like.

875
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,940
I didn't even give birth to you...

876
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:43,510
and my mom left me when I was young.

877
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,100
I'm so scared...

878
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,500
that you're sick.

879
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,060
But I don't know what to do.

880
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:03,360
When my mom left me,

881
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,900
I couldn't ask her...

882
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,500
to be by my side.

883
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,340
If she left even after I asked,

884
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,860
it meant that I was really abandoned.

885
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,600
I think I was afraid to confirm that.

886
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,370
But...

887
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,690
I regretted it for a long time.

888
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:27,000
"I should've stopped her.

889
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,900
I should've asked her to stay with me."

890
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,500
So...

891
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,700
I don't want to have regrets with you.

892
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,700
Hyo Ri, for my sake...

893
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,200
you can stay with me. Right?

894
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,800
I'm very afraid right now.

895
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,500
Now that you told me,

896
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,820
I can tell you, too.

897
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,100
- I'm sorry for making you feel scared.
- No...

898
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:21,320
But to be honest,

899
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,170
I'm scared, too.

✨ The Marvellous ✨ Team @ Viki.com

901
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,260
Mom, I'm so scared.

902
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,900
Mom, I'm scared...

903
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,710
I wanted to tell you that.

904
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,210
Mom...

905
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:49,440
I'm sorry, Mom.

906
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,070
To not be crushed by the weight of life,

907
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:02,600
I've hung in there desperately with my teeth clenched.

908
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,300
Because if I fell,

909
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,600
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get back up again.

910
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,300
But now I know.

911
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:15,810
Sometimes you need to fall completely

912
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:19,700
to support yourself back up again.

913
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:29,870
♫  Some things are leading now  ♫

914
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:33,610
♫  We’re looking through the stars  ♫

915
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,930
♫  and the sun  ♫

916
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,200
♫  No need to talk or prove  ♫

917
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,130
♫  When you're the one that I admire  ♫

918
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:47,620
♫  Live for rather than me  ♫

919
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:52,260
♫  Breathe in, let the ocean flow in  ♫

920
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,770
♫  I'll never hear a sound  ♫

921
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:03,690
♫  For you, it leads to where I’m meant to be  ♫

922
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,650
I'll live however I want.

923
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:10,070
Don't be afraid anymore.

924
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,070
You can cross bravely.

925
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:15,020
- I should go to Seoul to check out materials.
- I'll come with you.

926
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,600
Meet the construction team and see our place, too.

927
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,050
- This is an emergency.
- Fighting.

928
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,500
It's nice and admirable that you try hard,

929
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,990
but let's cherish life, too.

930
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:31,500
Your eyes didn't age at all.

931
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,670
Oppa,

932
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,830
you know what?

933
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,410
♫  Live for rather than me  ♫
