1
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:07,633
The true award is the love
given to us by our parents.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,767
Mother, wherever you are,
I'm now a valedictorian.

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,233
I shouldn't be the one in jail.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,133
Joan was the one
who did everything.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,833
I didn't take anything.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,267
I was just helping.

7
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,700
Here are the new inmates.

8
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:21,000
I know that one.

9
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:24,033
We're really having a reunion
inside the prison, Sharlene?

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,533
Divina is here too?

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,233
She took some jewelry,

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,967
so she was charged
with qualified theft.

13
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:32,500
They pretend that
the law has fangs.

14
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,200
If you're rich
and well-connected,

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,567
you get away easily.

16
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,000
Divina, you have a visitor.

17
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,100
Your lover's here.

18
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:40,000
Who else were you
expecting to visit you?

19
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:42,367
I'm the only relative
who still cares about you.

20
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:43,600
Have you found Cesar yet?

21
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,600
Turns out,
he has a new live-in partner.

22
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:46,767
If you didn't steal
Raymond from me,

23
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,300
we could've gotten back
together!

24
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,333
I wouldn't be imprisoned!
I wouldn't...

25
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,700
My baby!

26
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,900
Help!

27
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:59,467
- Hey, call the guard, quick!
- Leilani, help me!

28
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,000
My baby!

29
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:02,200
What happened?

30
00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:04,100
Baby, hold on!

31
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,533
Guard, quick!

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,367
What's going on here?

33
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:11,367
My baby! My baby!

34
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:12,600
- Help me!
- Come on!

35
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:14,167
- Wait! Careful.
- Careful.

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,800
Okay, Doc. Thank you.

37
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:53,867
Hon, the baby.

38
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:55,600
Baby?
Relax.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,667
Relax. She's okay.

40
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,233
She's safe.

41
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,133
Relax, relax.

42
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,933
There was just a rupture
inside your abdomen.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,600
But the doctor
has prescribed medicine

44
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,567
to prevent it
from happening again.

45
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:13,433
Hon, I don't want
to lose our baby.

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,933
I thought something bad
had happened to her.

47
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:18,533
I don't want to lose her, Hon.

48
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,933
Mom is gone,
my sibling is abroad.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,600
It's just you and the baby
who are my family, Hon.

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,033
If I lose her,
I won't be able to take it.

51
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,467
I won't be able to take it, Hon.

52
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:30,600
It won't happen.

53
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:31,733
No, no, no.

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,233
Nothing bad will happen
to our baby, okay?

55
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,700
The money we need to pay
the victim is ready.

56
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:40,433
All right?

57
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,233
Hon...

58
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:46,133
I promise you,
once I'm out of here...

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,667
I'll pay you back.

60
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,267
I'll work double shifts.
I'll pay it all back.

61
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,667
I'll pay it all back.

62
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:55,333
Hon...

63
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,100
I'm not asking you
to pay me back.

64
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,767
What's mine is yours too.

65
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,567
I don't care
if I spend all my money.

66
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,900
You and the baby
are more important to me.

67
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:06,733
All right?

68
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,700
I won't abandon you, okay?

69
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,133
I won't abandon you.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,467
Especially the baby.

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,967
Don't cry anymore, okay?

72
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:18,967
Don't cry anymore, all right?

73
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,567
I love you.

74
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,100
- I love you too.
- Love you.

75
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,400
Take it easy.

76
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,233
Okay, I'll take care of this.

77
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,200
Oh, you see this?

78
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:35,167
This will be your punishment
for the mess you caused, okay?

79
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,233
You'll clean this every day.

80
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:40,233
And no visitors allowed for you.

81
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,000
Please, have mercy on me.

82
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:45,333
I'm pregnant.

83
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:48,767
Oh, now you're using
your pregnancy?

84
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,633
But you couldn't stop yourself
from fighting with Sharlene?

85
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,967
One more thing, we'll transfer
you to another cell, okay?

86
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,167
And don't go near Sharlene.

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,167
Sir, can I have a different
punishment instead?

88
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:06,500
I heard your wife left you.

89
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:08,633
Do you want me...

90
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,100
to make you happy instead?

91
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,233
Knock it off, will you?

92
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,367
Damn it!

93
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,600
You know,

94
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:21,833
of all the mothers-to-be,
you're so cold-hearted, huh?

95
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,433
You should be happy you're going
to have a child, you know.

96
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,033
I hope this baby dies.

97
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,767
You don't know
what you're saying.

98
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:33,500
Do you know how painful it is
to lose a child?

99
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,767
It's even more painful to live

100
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,567
knowing you can't
take care of your child!

101
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,333
I will be in prison
for a long time.

102
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,867
Who do you think will
take care of my child?

103
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,100
My boyfriend who left me?

104
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,933
Ran away from me?

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,967
Or my siblings who disowned me?

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,567
What will happen
to me and my child?

107
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,833
We'll starve together?

108
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,433
Rot in here?

109
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,267
You're so quick to judge.

110
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,100
You don't even know
the whole story.

111
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,233
- Leilani, we'll go now.
- We'll go ahead now.

112
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,000
- All right.
- We'll go ahead.

113
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,533
Good thing nothing bad
happened to your baby.

114
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,767
Yes, thank goodness.

115
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,267
The doctor said she's okay.

116
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,733
And he said my child
is a fighter.

117
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,800
Try to understand Divina, okay?

118
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,200
She's been through
a lot in life.

119
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:34,867
It's all been bad luck for her.

120
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,233
Since I arrived here, she has
already had it out for me.

121
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:42,467
I've been patient with
everything she has done to me.

122
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,633
Because I know

123
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,567
she still feels bitter
about what happened before.

124
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:50,167
But if she puts my child's life
in danger again...

125
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,600
I'll fight her.

126
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,800
I understand.

127
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,767
I know what a mother
is capable of doing...

128
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,300
for her child.

129
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,167
It's time.

130
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,167
Hurry up there, okay? Because...

131
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,967
It's time for us to eat.
I'm hungry too.

132
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,300
And return that cutter here

133
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,467
because Ma'am Lydia
will count it later.

134
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:21,367
Take care of that, okay?

135
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm heading out first.

136
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:23,333
Leilani...

137
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,500
thank you, okay?

138
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,133
It's nothing.

139
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,967
I'll save you some food later.

140
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,633
That's enough.

141
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,800
Go back to your cell.

142
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,933
Don't cause any more trouble,
okay?

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,367
And don't go near
Sharlene again.

144
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:56,967
Go now.

145
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,167
Leilani?

146
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,133
Is that you?

147
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,900
Hi...

148
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,167
Sharlene.

149
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,733
Did you miss me?

150
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,800
Won't you ever leave me alone?

151
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,800
I'm just going to finish
the mess you started.

152
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,600
Started?

153
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,833
Divina, I've been
keeping to myself.

154
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,367
You're the one who does nothing
but cause trouble for me!

155
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,967
Because you ruined my life!

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,867
All the bad luck I've
experienced in my life

157
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:10,467
started the moment I met you!

158
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,967
From ruining my reputation
at the airline,

159
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,500
to stealing Raymond from me!

160
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,633
Because you broke up
with Raymond.

161
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,967
But if you hadn't seduced him,

162
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,600
we could've gotten
back together!

163
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,867
I should've been his wife,

164
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:24,133
and I wouldn't be
in this miserable life!

165
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on, then!

166
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,367
Come closer!

167
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Where's Sharlene?

168
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,700
I don't know,
I'm looking for Divina too.

169
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:46,300
She asked for help
moving her stuff

170
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,467
but I can't find her anywhere.

171
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,700
Don't come near me.

172
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,400
I endured everything
you did to me,

173
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:59,600
but the moment you hurt
my child, I will fight back!

174
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,467
Oh, you're feisty now?

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,100
I'm going into labor, Divina!

176
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,133
Divina.

177
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,333
Ouch!

178
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,633
Divina, I'm giving birth!

179
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,000
Help!

180
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,333
Oh, really?

181
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,500
Fine!

182
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,633
I'll help you deliver your baby!

183
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,667
Stop it!

184
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,167
It's an earthquake!

185
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:58,567
Stop it!

186
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,067
Help me!

187
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,200
I don't want to die yet!

188
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,667
My baby!

189
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:33,767
Divina.

190
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,233
Help us.

191
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,833
What's happening?

192
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,033
Wait a minute!

193
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,400
Hold on, hold on!

194
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,367
Sharlene.

195
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,400
Sharlene, come on.

196
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:49,933
Come on, let's get out of here.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,967
Quick.

198
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,667
Sharlene.

199
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,033
Sharlene.

200
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,100
Help!

201
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,000
Guard!

202
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,533
We're trapped here.

203
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
There's no other way out!

204
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,100
Help!

205
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,667
Sharlene!

206
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,400
I'm going into labor!

207
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,367
I'm going into labor!

208
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,667
Is anyone hurt?

209
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:46,867
Anyone?

210
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:47,867
Everyone stay here for now,
okay?

211
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,667
In case there's an aftershock,
all right?

212
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,900
Sir Pascual,
Sharlene isn't here.

213
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,667
Divina and Leilani
are not here either!

214
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,167
Where are they?

215
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,667
- Help!
- Sharlene!

216
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,233
Help us!

217
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,867
Divina, calm down for a moment!

218
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:04,767
It hurts!

219
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,733
A post fell on me.

220
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,967
My stomach hurts so much!

221
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:09,933
Wait a second.

222
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,867
Sharlene.

223
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,300
- Deep breaths.
- My stomach hurts so much!

224
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,433
Could it be
you're going into labor?

225
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,733
Help us!

226
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,600
You need to push.

227
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,267
Sharlene, one, two...

228
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:24,800
Three!
Push!

229
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,000
One more, one more.

230
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,000
There!

231
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,433
I can see the head, Sharlene!
One more!

232
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,833
One, two, three!

233
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:42,867
It hurts! Ouch!

234
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,867
Sharlene, one, two, three!

235
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,433
Here it comes!

236
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,200
Leilani.

237
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,233
It's a girl, Sharlene.

238
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,000
Sharlene.

239
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,300
Sharlene!

240
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,567
Sharlene, wake up!

241
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:03,167
Leilani!

242
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,533
Divina! Divina!

243
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,167
Come here!

244
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,133
Lie down here for now.

245
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,933
I can't take it anymore!

246
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:13,733
I'll help you.

247
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:16,667
Take it easy.

248
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:17,967
Copy that!

249
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,800
Sir, let's go back for Sharlene
and the others!

250
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:23,133
It's not safe
to go back inside yet.

251
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,100
The aftershocks keep coming.

252
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,267
But what about them?

253
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,633
The rescue team is on the way.

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,400
Don't move!

255
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,000
Hold on! Hold on!

256
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,467
It hurts!

257
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,167
Hold on, Divina!

258
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,267
I don't want to give birth yet!

259
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,933
Divina, lie down for now,
support your head.

260
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:59,167
Breathe deeply, Divina.
Breathe deeply.

261
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,100
Here it comes!

262
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,567
I'll count to three.

263
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,000
Push.

264
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,467
You can do this!

265
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:16,700
One!

266
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:17,633
Two!

267
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,433
Three! Push!

268
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,733
I can see the head, Divina!

269
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,000
Just push!

270
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,367
You can do this!
You can do this!

271
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:29,467
One!

272
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,500
Two!

273
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:31,567
Three!

274
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,867
Your baby is a girl.

275
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,200
Just like Sharlene's.

276
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,333
Here's your mother.

277
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:32,567
Hold on.

278
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,300
I'll just look for some water.

279
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,833
I feel sorry for your baby,
not like Sharlene's baby.

280
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,800
Even before she's born,
she's already a princess.

281
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,433
I will be here in prison
for a long time.

282
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,567
Who do you think will
take care of my child?

283
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,867
You stole the life
that was meant for me.

284
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:10,233
Well, my child will take
the life meant for your child!

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,433
What are you doing?

286
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,400
Are you switching the babies?

287
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,600
Don't interfere!

288
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,567
Put Sharlene's baby back,
Divina!

289
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:23,700
Sharlene stole Raymond
and my future!

290
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,267
This is my revenge.

291
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,900
I'll take their child.

292
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:32,800
She will live being loved and
cherished as the wrong child.

293
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,333
Will you prioritize your
anger over your child?

294
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
Raymond's family is wealthy.

295
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,867
They can give my child
a good life.

296
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,400
She will live like a princess.

297
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,400
What about Sharlene's baby?

298
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,733
Sir!

299
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,967
Sir, where are
the trapped people?

300
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:00,800
They're inside.
Follow me.

301
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,133
Let's go.
Over here!

302
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,100
This child...

303
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:08,900
is mine.

304
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,733
I'll be the one to raise
Sharlene's damn baby.

305
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,700
I'll make her life
a living hell.

306
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,133
She'll pay for
her mother's sins!

307
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:22,967
What?

308
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Sharlene won't know
which one is her child.

309
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:30,400
What's important is that

310
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:33,867
Raymond and his family
will raise my child.

311
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:37,600
My child will live
like a princess.

312
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,733
I don't like your plans, Divina.

313
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,333
Who's your friend here?
Me or that woman?

314
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,333
Don't you dare betray me.

315
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,900
If you do, I'll expose your
racket of smuggling contraband

316
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,333
here in the prison.

317
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,033
Do you want to end up
in solitary confinement?

318
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,000
Hurry!

319
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,267
Sharlene!

320
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,800
Divina! Leilani!

321
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,167
We're here!

322
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,300
- Where are you?
- Sir Pascual!

323
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,967
Help!

324
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,600
- Sir Pascual! We're here!
- We're here!

325
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,467
And we have babies with us!

326
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:07,867
Baby...

327
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,033
Sir, Sir.

328
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,300
All right, please hold on,
we're coming in.

329
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,400
Let's go!

330
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,033
The rescue team is here.
Just wait a moment, okay?

331
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,333
- Sir, is there a way through?
- Try saying anything...

332
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,133
We're on our way, don't move!

333
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,633
Sir, is there a way through?

334
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,367
Yes, Sir.

335
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,433
Hello.

336
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,033
My baby is so beautiful.

337
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,567
Baby, mother is awake.

338
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,133
Your mother is awake.

339
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:47,300
Hon, our baby is so pretty.
She looks just like you.

340
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,267
She's beautiful.

341
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,067
Is there anything wrong?

342
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:04,567
They say when you
hold your baby,

343
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:07,433
you feel a special connection.

344
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,800
I don't feel anything.

345
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,167
Sharlene.

346
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,533
Hon, maybe you're just tired.

347
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:24,600
You know, I know,
you've been through a lot,

348
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,967
both you and the baby.

349
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:30,567
What's important
is that you're safe.

350
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:33,167
And the doctor said
she's healthy.

351
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:35,933
Hon?
What is it?

352
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,333
Hon.

353
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,767
Sharlene, why?

354
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:44,133
Hon.

355
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,767
Hon, where's the...

356
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,533
What?

357
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:50,333
Where's her mole?

358
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,067
I know I saw a mole right here.

359
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,467
Mole?

360
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:55,733
Yes.

361
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,733
Where is it? Why is it gone?

362
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,300
I didn't see anything.

363
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:01,933
Are you sure?

364
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,867
The rescue team said
you were unconscious

365
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,800
when they found you
in the working room.

366
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:10,400
Maybe you're confused?

367
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:13,567
The earthquake
was pretty strong.

368
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,300
There was a lot of damage
in the prison.

369
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,100
Mommy and I thought it might not
be safe for the baby there.

370
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,733
What if we take her home?

371
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,167
Hon, no.

372
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:31,533
Hon, don't allow that.
I want to be with our child.

373
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,400
I want to be with her
as she grows up.

374
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:37,833
The Warden said I can take care
of her for a few months.

375
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,333
I can stay with her.
Don't allow it, Hon.

376
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't want her
to grow up like me...

377
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:46,000
without a mother.

378
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,167
Hon, don't allow it.

379
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,400
Don't worry, you'll be
with her every day.

380
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,833
Until she grows up.

381
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:04,733
You'll be with her until
she's as beautiful as you.

382
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,333
We have settled
with many victims.

383
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:12,367
There's only a little left,

384
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,300
the case against you
will be dropped soon.

385
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,167
Will Liberty and I get out?

386
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:21,667
Liberty?

387
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,533
Is that the name
of our daughter?

388
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Liberty.

389
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,167
It means freedom.

390
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,033
So beautiful.

391
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,833
It's hot.

392
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,833
The others...

393
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,233
can't clean properly.

394
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,433
Frowning again.

395
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,033
The baby's arriving.

396
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,533
Oh, lend her to me.

397
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,800
She's so cute.

398
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:15,167
Oh, she's so beautiful.

399
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:15,933
What's her name?

400
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,433
- What's her name?
- None.

401
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:19,567
None!

402
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:24,133
Your mother's so
grumpy, baby girl.

403
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,733
Think of a name, Divina.

404
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,533
What's the
matter with you?

405
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,800
She's a baby and a girl.

406
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,233
Baby girl then.

407
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,200
Everything's okay now?

408
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:33,800
Baby?

409
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:35,000
You should...

410
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,933
Your mother's so grumpy,
she better not inherit that.

411
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,867
Hey!

412
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:41,933
You're so loud.

413
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,100
Calm down, it's
just a baby.

414
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:44,067
Keep it down.

415
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,733
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

416
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:50,500
Even the baby
is getting involved.

417
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:53,600
Well, I heard Sir Pascual's
child died.

418
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,100
His wife blamed him and left.
That explains his behavior.

419
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,433
That explains it.

420
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,600
Let Sir be.

421
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,233
But our baby...

422
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,167
Let him be.

423
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:16,200
I feel guilty about
what we've done.

424
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:18,333
You killed your husband.

425
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,700
You're feeling guilty now?

426
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,967
Try to report me.

427
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,800
I have friends outside.

428
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:26,800
I'll have your child killed.

429
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:29,633
Don't touch my child.

430
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,633
Well, don't ruin
my child's future!

431
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:36,200
Don't you feel
sorry for Sharlene?

432
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,567
She saved you when you were
trapped during the earthquake.

433
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:43,700
She could have left,
but no, she chose to help you.

434
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,867
You owe her your life.

435
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:47,367
She's the one owes me.

436
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:50,300
Because she stole my life.

437
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:54,333
Well, my child
will take revenge.

438
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,000
My child will enjoy Raymond's
family wealth.

439
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,100
She'll live like a princess.

440
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:08,133
What about Sharlene's child?

441
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,133
She stays with me.

442
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:13,667
I'll make her life a living
hell.

443
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,633
They have also admitted
their wrongdoings.

444
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,067
They will drop the case
against you.

445
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:48,700
The attorney is also arranging
all your documents.

446
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,667
Hon, you will be free soon.

447
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,967
You will not leave here.

448
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,200
We'll face hell together...

449
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:59,833
Me, you, and that cursed
child of yours!

450
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,067
Let's end this.

451
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:02,767
You don't want to?

452
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,900
Then, your child
and I will settle it!

453
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,533
You've gone too far!

454
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,433
Sharlene, don't!

455
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,700
Kill me now, you criminal!

456
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:12,967
What is this?

457
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:15,800
That's a copy of the
warrant for Cesar.

458
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,200
He's been arrested.

459
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,967
You'll be free soon, Cousin!

460
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:21,533
I miss Baby Girl.

461
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:24,333
What's that?

462
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,233
Where is that coming from?

463
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:27,300
Where is that coming from?

464
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,933
Baby Girl?

465
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,700
It's Baby Girl!
