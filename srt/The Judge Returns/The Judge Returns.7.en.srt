1
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,008
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,345
EPISODE 7

3
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:40,055
Move your foot.

4
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,182
Your foot!

5
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,690
The thing is, Dong-gi has to stay healthy

6
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:51,441
without a single paper cut

7
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:53,193
or a random bruise.

8
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:56,113
Because if he doesn't pay me back,
I own him.

9
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:57,739
So

10
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:00,868
don't you dare lay a finger on him,
or else...

11
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:02,703
Alright?

12
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:16,800
I want him

13
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:19,678
to die.

14
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:22,139
Kill him.

15
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:23,515
Kill him!

16
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:27,019
I can finally hear you.

17
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:42,951
No!

18
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:02,054
Defendant Chu Yong-jin

19
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:05,057
the court hereby sentences you to death.

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,982
No!

21
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:17,277
Wait!

22
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,038
Let him out.

23
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:30,040
Just let him go.

24
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:32,251
Let him go!

25
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:34,711
Let him out...

26
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:04,950
Are you sure you won't regret it?

27
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:10,205
He never apologized to my son sincerely.

28
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,042
He'd apologize a million times
as long as he doesn't have to mean it.

29
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,170
He'd also beg a billion times
if it played in his favor.

30
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:18,255
I'm not asking

31
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:21,466
for him to be freed
for an insincere apology, either.

32
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:23,719
What I want is

33
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:27,055
for him and the world to know

34
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:30,559
the crimes he has committed.

35
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:35,856
Do you really want Mr. Chu to be tried?

36
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:39,735
Do you believe in the law?

37
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:43,780
Even when we've

38
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,783
finally got him in a sinkhole?

39
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,664
I can't help but think

40
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:56,126
about what good would come

41
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,669
from just burying him alive.

42
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:02,424
I guess we'll take him to the court, then.

43
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:06,553
I'm glad.

44
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:09,514
I know the law very well.

45
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:14,353
Nice to meet you.

46
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,313
I'm Judge Lee Han Young

47
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:18,690
at the Seoul Central District Court.

48
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:30,202
Are you okay, boss?

49
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:32,871
It stings!

50
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:35,290
Sorry, sir.

51
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:38,251
Be more gentle with it!

52
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:39,878
Damn it.

53
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:43,715
I can still feel sand in my mouth.

54
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:46,093
Hak-su.

55
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:47,552
Yes, boss.

56
00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:50,472
Keep an eye on Dong-gi
at all times from now on.

57
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:53,266
Those bastards are loansharks.

58
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,143
When they come to take his money

59
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:58,730
chop off a limb or something

60
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:00,482
and bring them here, alright?

61
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:02,818
Yes, boss.

62
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,162
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE

63
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,420
Yes, Mr. Kang.

64
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:27,592
Hot!

65
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:28,802
Ta-da!

66
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,595
Wow, this is...

67
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:31,680
I know, right?

68
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,348
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:35,100
I only cooked this for myself.

70
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:36,643
Want me to cook some more?

71
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:38,353
Of course! This is nothing!

72
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,855
Right? We need more?

73
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:41,231
I have leftover rice.

74
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:42,482
It's fine.

75
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,777
Gosh, this looks so good.

76
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,409
How's Na-yeong doing?

77
00:05:58,415 --> 00:05:59,499
She's doing well, right?

78
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,962
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

79
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:08,800
She insisted on working
just until midnight.

80
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,177
I lost to her.

81
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,471
She thinks she owns the place.

82
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,181
So, you got shown up by a kid?

83
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:15,515
Does she look like a kid?

84
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,766
She'll beat you anytime.

85
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,226
I'm a judge.

86
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,437
Other people's words can't sway me.

87
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,522
- Sure, whatever.
- Hello.

88
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,942
You can't be around drunk people.
It's not safe.

89
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:27,068
Just work on weekdays.

90
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:30,197
If I move to another province for college,
I'll have to rent.

91
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,698
I don't have money for that

92
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,617
meaning I have to go
to a college in Seoul.

93
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,744
And night shifts are perfect for studying.

94
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,454
But it's still dangerous.

95
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:39,706
But going to an out-of-state college is
more dangerous.

96
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:41,249
Yeah, it is.

97
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,126
Did your grandma approve?

98
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,921
I told her I'd have to move for college
if I didn't study now

99
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,297
and she immediately said okay.

100
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,052
You have a permit
for her to work at night?

101
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:53,887
Oh, man, that's too complicated.

102
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:56,181
So, you don't have it?

103
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:01,144
NIGHT WORK PERMIT FOR MINORS

104
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:04,898
No, we went through the complicated stuff
and got it.

105
00:07:04,981 --> 00:07:06,483
Yeah, complicated, baby!

106
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:08,985
You're even worse.

107
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,820
A judge is only human, huh?

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,331
Walk Na-yeong home.

109
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,291
People are drunk. It's dangerous.

110
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,709
Do you need a bag?

111
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:29,548
Sir, do you need a bag?

112
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:41,101
Grandma sleeps with the lights on

113
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:42,894
so it's safer for me to walk home.

114
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:46,356
She doesn't even turn the fan on

115
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,775
to save on electricity bills
when she's alone.

116
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:52,445
There's an air conditioner
at my parents' junkyard.

117
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:53,947
Should I set that up at yours?

118
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:57,117
She doesn't even use the fan
because electricity is expensive.

119
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,036
Oh, right.

120
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,415
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodbye.

121
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:04,666
Goodnight.

122
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:31,359
Grandma.

123
00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:35,405
Hey.

124
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:38,033
There's my little puppy.

125
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:40,702
- Grandma.
- Yeah?

126
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:43,580
You know what I love most
about having a part-time job?

127
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,459
Making money?

128
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:51,963
No, having the store owner walk me home.

129
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:55,675
Knowing that there's an adult with me

130
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,844
as I walk in the dark

131
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:00,597
makes me want to be a better person.

132
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:10,649
Grandma.

133
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:34,673
Looks like you won't need to sleep
with the lights on anymore.

134
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,107
Hey, don't push!

135
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,570
Why are you pulling?

136
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:58,905
Stop pushing me!

137
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,240
When did I do that?

138
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:01,616
Let's go again.

139
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,126
What's that, anyway?

140
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:12,836
Huh? This?

141
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,796
I didn't know what would fit.

142
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,507
You're an idiot.

143
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,676
You're a judge,
and a teenager beat you, so...

144
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:24,180
By the way, it looks like the repair
will cost more than the car.

145
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:29,102
Let me know if you can't afford it.

146
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,353
Your friend's a loan shark.

147
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,407
- Your Honor!
- Oh, gosh.

148
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:44,075
Good morning!

149
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,077
Who are you?

150
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:48,037
Angel!

151
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:50,749
Oh, you brought the car
from the Chungnam Court!

152
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,751
What brings you here?

153
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,630
I got it right from the dealership.
It's an express delivery.

154
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:04,387
Damn, Jeong-ho.

155
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:07,724
<i>So, how do you like it?</i>

156
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,186
I love it.

157
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,521
It's so spacious,
and the seat is so cushy.

158
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:14,606
<i>Hey</i>

159
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,525
you can pay in 60 installments.
That's doable on your meager salary.

160
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:18,985
Over 60 months?

161
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,490
You're hilarious.

162
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:26,075
Good job.

163
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,870
So, why did you choose such a big car?

164
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:39,005
Are you still handling things
with your fists?

165
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:41,591
No, sir.

166
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:44,385
I've never done that
since you helped me become

167
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:46,221
the District Mayor.

168
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,764
Exactly!

169
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:50,683
I made you the District Mayor

170
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:53,269
so you owe me, big time.

171
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:55,271
Yes, sir.

172
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:57,690
So, why is it so hard to get the victims

173
00:11:57,982 --> 00:11:59,567
to sign a damn settlement deal?

174
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:02,487
Sorry, sir.

175
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,614
I'll get it done as soon as possible.

176
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:08,993
Don't you go trying to play lawyer

177
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,163
and act like a real District Mayor
because you think you're one.

178
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:14,958
Just stick to your best expertise.

179
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,502
You know what I mean!

180
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:19,963
Yes, sir.

181
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:21,756
I'll do that.

182
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:24,092
CALL RECORD FROM THE SECOND CALL TO 911

183
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,886
911: HELLO, 911 EMERGENCY
CALLER: OH... THIS IS...UH...

184
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:46,281
How's it going with the sinkhole case?

185
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:51,160
If it were going well, how would it look?

186
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:54,998
There'd be nothing to consider

187
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:57,083
and no questions unanswered.

188
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,794
I guess it's not going well, then.

189
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,591
Let me know if I can help you.

190
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:21,524
<i>How's Judge Lee doing?</i>

191
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:27,530
<i>He's busy with the sinkhole case.</i>

192
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,491
<i>He hasn't done much else.</i>

WOO GYO-HUN REVEALS
HIS QUESTIONABLE FINANCES

198
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,218
ALLEGATIONS OF UNFAIR HIRING PRACTICES
BY WOO GYO-HUN

199
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:52,805
<i>Still no movement</i>
<i>from Prosecutor General Eom.</i>

200
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:58,436
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a
from the Central District Office.

201
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,731
<i>She recently arrested Jang Tae-sik,</i>
<i>the CEO of S Shopping.</i>

202
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:05,276
She'd also tear Mr. Woo apart
in a heartbeat.

203
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:12,992
Mr. Woo!

204
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:14,953
Did you falsify your residence?

205
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:24,128
My daughter had depression

206
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:26,923
in middle school.

207
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,426
She had one friend whom she could trust

208
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,763
but they ended up at different schools
for high school.

209
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:37,308
To help her move to her friend's school...

210
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,151
Regardless of my reason

211
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,821
I shouldn't have done so
as a public servant.

212
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,867
I'd like to take this chance
to apologize to the nation sincerely.

213
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:02,083
Coming through.

214
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,127
Do you admit to stock parking

215
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,170
making your brother-in-law keep
your stocks?

216
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:07,839
Where are you from?

217
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:09,674
I'm Reporter Han Jeong-won from YTM.

218
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,427
And you believe in fake news

219
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,595
when you're
from such an established agency?

220
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:16,389
I don't know what to say.

221
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:18,349
WOO GYO-HUN DISMISSES "STOCK PARKING"
CONTROVERSY AS FAKE NEWS

222
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,185
<i>Anyway, I'll clarify everything</i>

223
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,229
<i>at the confirmation hearing. Bye.</i>

224
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:25,106
<i>- Excuse me!</i>
<i>- Mr. Woo!</i>

225
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,650
Did you come up with that?

226
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:30,778
No, he's quick enough to answer that much.

227
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:32,113
What about the stock parking?

228
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:35,658
I had a civil organization expose him

229
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,702
so he can just say
it's under investigation.

230
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:40,496
Once he gets named the Minister of Justice

231
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,707
they'll drop the charges.

232
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,042
Sin-jin

233
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,628
why do you think I've chosen Gyo-hun?

234
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:51,424
Gyo-hun is full of flaws
but also full of greed.

235
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,052
He'll strike or keep whomever you choose

236
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:57,388
in the next presidential election season.

237
00:15:58,514 --> 00:15:59,599
In return

238
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:02,935
you'll keep quiet about his shortcomings

239
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,645
and give him what he wants.

240
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:10,276
And what do you want?

241
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:16,032
Justice in the Judiciary.

242
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:19,786
That's very ambitious.

243
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:29,462
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

244
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:36,052
Judge Lee lived

245
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:38,930
in Mak-dong, Yeongdeungpo District
throughout his school years.

246
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,640
His grades were alright

247
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,934
up to 11th grade

248
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:44,477
but in 12th grade

249
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,647
he suddenly started getting top grades.

250
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:50,983
Thanks to that, he was accepted
into a small, regional law school.

251
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:54,946
There's always a reason

252
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:57,240
for anyone's dramatic change.

253
00:16:57,824 --> 00:16:58,908
Yes, sir.

254
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:00,409
When he entered 12th grade

255
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:03,121
Mak-dong was designated
as a redevelopment zone.

256
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,581
It was then that his father fought

257
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,583
a guard from the construction company

258
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,336
and was sentenced to 1.5 years in jail
for aggravated assault.

259
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:14,382
YEONGDEUNGPO DISTRICT, A SUSTAINABLE CITY

260
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,301
CONTRACTOR FOR PROJECT

261
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:19,846
CONTRACTOR: S CONSTRUCTION

262
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,147
What a coincidence.

263
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:32,900
To think it was Judge Lee's father,
of all people.

264
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:52,128
Case Number 2007GH5432.

265
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:53,963
The verdict for Defendant Lee Bong-seok

266
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:56,382
on his violation
of the Punishment of Violences Act

267
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:59,468
in an incident
of a mass weaponized assault is ready.

268
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:01,554
I hereby announce

269
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:06,309
that the Defendant used a weapon

270
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:08,436
to cause fractures to the hired guards

271
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,522
in his conflict with them.

272
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:13,065
Furthermore

273
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,444
the witnesses' stories match

274
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:20,156
and the Defendant was confirmed
to have fled the site.

275
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:25,286
While the Defendant does not have
relevant prior convictions

276
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:27,663
the witnesses' testimonies match

277
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:29,707
the facts of the indictment

278
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,667
and despite many witnesses' statements

279
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,211
and evidence to prove them

280
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:34,545
the Defendant is presenting

281
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:37,632
excuses that are difficult to understand.

282
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:39,175
On top of that

283
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:41,594
despite there being many residents

284
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:43,554
and other witnesses on site

285
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:46,515
no evidence has been submitted

286
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:48,434
to support the Defendant's claims.

287
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:50,269
And despite the victim

288
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:52,355
suffering from a serious fracture

289
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:55,358
the Defendant did not make
any sincere effort

290
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:56,859
to take responsibility

291
00:18:56,943 --> 00:18:59,612
or to reach a settlement.

292
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:03,032
Therefore, the court has reached
the following decision.

293
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:04,575
The court hereby orders

294
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:06,410
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

295
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:09,622
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

296
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:20,883
The Defendant has one week to appeal

297
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:23,219
to the court's decision

298
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:25,012
from the day of the announcement.

299
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,431
If an appeal is not filed

300
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:29,850
the decision will be carried out

301
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,435
as announced.

302
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,709
Yeah.

303
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:56,544
Let's get lunch together.

304
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,388
You think Mr. Eom will do as you want?

305
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:10,433
He will.

306
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:13,102
Because he's already signed

307
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:15,229
to be Haenal's legal advisor.

308
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:18,274
You already have your results
before even submitting the test?

309
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,904
Mr. Eom has no way out now.

310
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:24,989
Mr. Woo thinks

311
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:27,783
he just needs to get
through the confirmation hearing

312
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:30,786
but he'll be more humiliated
than he ever imagined.

313
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,913
So, I can stop Gyo-hun.

314
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:36,625
And Haenal Law Firm gets Mr. Eom.

315
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:37,752
But what about you?

316
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:41,672
I just needed something

317
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:45,593
to bring to the table
to become Mr. Yu's son-in-law, anyway.

318
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:48,554
Interesting.

319
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:53,059
You also handed the list of draft dodgers

320
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:55,478
to Yi-seok without anything in return.

321
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,148
You said it was to get revenge
on your buddy from law school

322
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:00,941
but that can't be the real reason.

323
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:08,240
Judge Lee

324
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:11,160
what's your real reason
behind approaching me?

325
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:18,334
I've already told you.

326
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:20,002
<i>What do you think I'm like?</i>

327
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:22,963
<i>You look like someone who can lead me.</i>

328
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:25,758
I only hope to serve my rightful purpose.

329
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,968
But what do you want from me?

330
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,430
I'll tell you another time.

331
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,268
So, you do want something?

332
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:46,362
You've lived
in a redevelopment zone, right?

333
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:47,530
Yes, sir.

334
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:49,615
Didn't that lead to any issues?

335
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:52,535
Like compensation issues for demolition.

336
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:54,703
And maybe

337
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:56,372
such issues

338
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:58,916
led to bigger disasters of sorts.

339
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:02,837
<i>Kang Sin-jin knows about what happened.</i>

340
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:09,718
To be frank

341
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:14,432
my father had

342
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,475
an issue.

343
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:21,647
He was protesting against the demolition

344
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:23,983
and was imprisoned

345
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,985
for aggravated assault.

346
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,821
How unfortunate.

347
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,909
But that's all in the past.

348
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:39,582
MANWOL

349
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,418
Alright, see you around, then.

350
00:22:58,434 --> 00:22:59,685
What a ridiculous combo.

351
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:05,399
I have a bad feeling about Judge Lee.

352
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:09,361
Why? Because of the sinkhole case?

353
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:12,698
No, he'll be good in court.

354
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:14,450
You've seen him in the Chungnam Court.

355
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:15,701
What else, then?

356
00:23:15,784 --> 00:23:18,954
The first day
Judge Lee came to work in Seoul

357
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:21,749
I saw him coming out of Mr. Kang's office.

358
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,001
And it seems

359
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:26,086
that they had lunch together today.

360
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:33,761
I'm sure he has a good reason.

361
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:44,813
Would you like me to do it?

362
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:45,898
Look here, Byeon.

363
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,110
You think I'm doing this
because I have too much free time?

364
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:53,489
With every letter I glue down

365
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:56,033
with all my might

366
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,410
it feels like I'm stuffing trash

367
00:23:58,494 --> 00:24:00,829
down that bitch's throat.

368
00:24:01,497 --> 00:24:03,332
You have no idea how satisfying it is.

369
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,168
Why would I leave such a fun job to you?

370
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:08,420
But wait.

371
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:11,549
People these days
don't spell out the word "you."

372
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:12,925
Don't they just write "u"?

373
00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:15,261
Yes, that's short for "you."

374
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,805
Right? I knew it.

375
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,058
Nobody has time to spell everything right.

376
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:23,018
That's how it should be.

377
00:24:25,646 --> 00:24:27,898
Alright, I'm all done.

378
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,817
- Glove off.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:33,487
What?

380
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:35,281
What's this?

381
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:41,954
You know Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

382
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:43,956
Leave it to her.

383
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:46,750
I know she's crazy

384
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:49,587
but a Minister of Justice candidate is...

385
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:52,214
I'll take full responsibility.

386
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:55,801
Yes, sir.

387
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:06,228
Can't believe
I sent my kid abroad to study

388
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:07,521
for this bullshit.

389
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,885
Honey.

390
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:38,969
Honey!

391
00:25:40,554 --> 00:25:42,222
There are suspicious cars outside.

392
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:43,515
What's going on?

393
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:50,189
Yes, Mr. Chu.

394
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:52,900
I don't think

395
00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:54,985
they're coming tonight.

396
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:56,111
<i>Is that so?</i>

397
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:58,447
Time to cast the bait, then.

398
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:00,949
Offer double the settlement money.

399
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:03,744
If that's not enough, keep doubling it.

400
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,372
They're greedy for cash.

401
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,749
They'll come when they smell it.

402
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:11,043
Are you busy?

403
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:13,879
<i>How many times do I have to tell you</i>
<i>you have to say hello first?</i>

404
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:15,381
Let's meet.

405
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:17,007
<i>Aren't you going to say hi?</i>

406
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:19,802
It's about time you thank me
for helping you move to Seoul.

407
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:21,887
I'll thank you, alright?

408
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,516
Well, I can't break or manipulate the law,
so there's basically nothing I can do.

409
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:27,601
Let's get dinner together.

410
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:29,353
You're giving me the creeps.

411
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,939
Have dinner with me,
and we'll call it even.

412
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:33,482
Really?

413
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:35,442
You can't take it back, okay?

414
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:36,944
<i>I won't.</i>

415
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:38,320
<i>But</i>

416
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:42,700
you know that junior colleague
in the prosecution?

417
00:26:47,454 --> 00:26:48,497
Come and sit.

418
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:56,422
There's no way I'm closing
CEO Jang's offshore tax evasion case.

419
00:26:58,424 --> 00:26:59,425
Do whatever you want.

420
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:01,093
Love your spirit.

421
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:08,434
What's this?

422
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:10,853
A part of the set.

423
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:12,896
Do your thing with this, too.

424
00:27:13,188 --> 00:27:14,398
You're the only one

425
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:16,442
I can trust.

426
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,703
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A

427
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:29,788
Drugs?

428
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:33,500
Damn it.

429
00:27:36,795 --> 00:27:38,088
She's well-educated.

430
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:42,551
LETTER OF ADMISSION

431
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,636
Woo Hee-young?

432
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,768
FATHER, WOO GYO-HUN
MOTHER, HAN YEON-HWA

433
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:52,186
Woo Gyo-hun?

434
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:55,147
Woo Gyo-hun...

435
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:02,362
Woo Gyo-hun,
the Minister of Justice candidate?

436
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:08,535
Why is he handing me a ticking time bomb?

437
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:11,413
Damn it.

438
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:15,793
PARK CHEOL-WOO

439
00:28:16,877 --> 00:28:18,003
Hey, Cheol-woo.

440
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:21,048
<i>Are you free after work tonight?</i>

441
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:22,174
Tonight?

442
00:28:22,257 --> 00:28:23,425
<i>Do you have plans already?</i>

443
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,055
No, not really.

444
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:30,432
Where should we meet?

445
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:32,267
About the road collapse.

446
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:34,269
Taemyeong Construction built it

447
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:37,898
and rumors say Mayor Chu is
the real boss there.

448
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:42,110
I expected as much
from someone of his caliber.

449
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:43,821
I guess he's a gangster, after all.

450
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:52,955
Are both Defendant and Plaintiff here?

451
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,290
I'm Hong Sang-gi,
the Plaintiff's representative.

452
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:00,671
Hello, I'm Attorney Yu Ha-na
from Haenal Law Firm.

453
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:04,466
<i>It's been a hot minute,</i>
<i>my dear sister-in-law.</i>

454
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:13,058
Hello.

455
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:18,897
Oh.

456
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:20,524
Se-hee's blind date?

457
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:21,608
Yes.

458
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,154
A single judge in a civil division?

459
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:28,740
- Yes.
- Great, then.

460
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:32,327
We needed someone in the civil division.

461
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:35,247
Going forward, run your verdicts by me

462
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,958
before finalizing them
for any cases represented by Haenal.

463
00:29:40,335 --> 00:29:41,336
Sorry?

464
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:45,382
Why are you so surprised?

465
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,177
You don't expect me
to write the verdict, too, do you?

466
00:29:49,845 --> 00:29:50,846
Oh...

467
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:52,306
You got fast-tracked to Seoul

468
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:54,349
as soon as you became
my family's son-in-law.

469
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:55,934
That wasn't for free.

470
00:29:56,685 --> 00:30:00,063
At least we don't care
about your education or family.

471
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:01,940
Just as long as you're obedient.

472
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:16,079
Firstly, I'd like to express deep regret

473
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:18,040
to all the victims in the sinkhole case...

474
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:19,374
What victims?

475
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:21,877
Sorry?

476
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:25,881
One died

477
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:28,216
and some

478
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:30,093
got injured

479
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,845
right?

480
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,222
Are you asking me, the judge,
to answer that?

481
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,393
No, it's nothing like that.

482
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:39,770
You just caught me off-guard.

483
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:41,146
PLAINTIFF

484
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:51,239
MEDIATION ROOM

485
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:00,123
It's me.

486
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:01,541
<i>The court date will be scheduled soon.</i>

487
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,753
This is a special request
from Assemblyman Kang of the ruling party.

488
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:06,505
You sure you can win?

489
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:08,173
Don't worry.

490
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,133
I even have an insurance policy.

491
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,554
Mr. Heo, you said you'd work with me

492
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:16,974
to spread the word about this case.

493
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,727
You have to tell me
exactly what happened that day.

494
00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:23,271
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:28,110
- Sir.
- Honey

496
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:30,362
- they must be back again.
- Mr. Heo!

497
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:33,240
- Mr. Heo!
- I'll call the police.

498
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:35,283
- Wait, Ms. Song.
- Are you inside?

499
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:40,706
They'll definitely return.

500
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,916
Don't fight them. Just agree to settle.

501
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,167
I'll expose Yong-jin

502
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:46,712
and all his illegal acts in court.

503
00:31:47,754 --> 00:31:49,339
I'm going to settle.

504
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,718
- What?
- Honey!

505
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:56,138
It's okay. You can open the door.

506
00:31:56,221 --> 00:31:58,306
- Dong-gi.
- It's fine.

507
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:00,308
Let them in.

508
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:10,152
I don't want to be hurt anymore

509
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:12,612
and my Min-gu will understand.

510
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,700
You might regret this later.

511
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:18,326
I'll call the cops

512
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,703
and write all about this.

513
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:20,871
Ms. Song

514
00:32:22,122 --> 00:32:25,417
thanks for everything. I mean it.

515
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,631
But please respect my decision this time.

516
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:33,633
Please.

517
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:36,053
Please don't say anything.

518
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:38,555
Mr. Heo...

519
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:42,642
My, my.

520
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:45,187
I'm tired of coming back, alright?

521
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,279
Count carefully.

522
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:56,031
That's 100 million right there.

523
00:32:57,574 --> 00:33:00,243
Is 100 million won enough?

524
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:02,204
From the looks of those thugs

525
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:03,830
they'd skin you from head to toe

526
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:05,373
if you don't pay them back.

527
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:08,335
Dong-gi, what is he talking about?

528
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:10,212
Mr. Heo!

529
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:11,630
It's okay.

530
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,008
You think those loansharks took him

531
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:16,885
on a sweet little picnic or what?

532
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:18,804
Man, you’re clueless.

533
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:24,976
All good now?

534
00:33:33,693 --> 00:33:34,903
When you see them

535
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:37,197
tell them I miss them dearly.

536
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:38,907
Don't forget.

537
00:33:42,202 --> 00:33:43,245
Goodbye, then.

538
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:49,000
Mr. Heo.

539
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:51,336
No, I'll report them to the police.

540
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,462
Honey!

541
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:57,968
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

542
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,680
PLAINTIFF HEO DONG-GI

543
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:06,726
Mr. Kang!

544
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,853
Yes.

545
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:11,481
I closed the last settlement deal.

546
00:34:12,107 --> 00:34:13,108
Yes.

547
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:24,202
Ms. Kim?

548
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:34,129
Oh...

549
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,052
<i>Where are you?</i>

550
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,686
- Jin-a!
- Hey, Cheol-woo.

551
00:34:53,273 --> 00:34:55,567
He's a judge I've known
since Chungcheongnam-do.

552
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,235
She's Kim Jin-a, the upright prosecutor

553
00:34:57,319 --> 00:34:59,237
a junior prosecutor
at the Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

554
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,448
Hello, I'm Lee Han-young.

555
00:35:01,531 --> 00:35:03,158
I'm Kim Jin-a.

556
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:05,368
What's going on?

557
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:08,413
Sorry, I double-booked myself.

558
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:14,044
I've actually come today
to discuss something with you.

559
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:16,171
- Huh?
- Let's meet another time.

560
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:18,965
I guess you can't tell him around a judge?

561
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:20,926
Sorry?

562
00:35:21,343 --> 00:35:23,803
You can't say what you want
around a judge?

563
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:29,100
Isn't it a bit early to be crossing lines?

564
00:35:29,184 --> 00:35:30,268
What are you doing?

565
00:35:30,352 --> 00:35:32,145
- Me?
- Cheol-woo

566
00:35:32,854 --> 00:35:34,731
- see you next time.
- Okay.

567
00:35:35,315 --> 00:35:37,192
I guess it's something shameful?

568
00:35:46,368 --> 00:35:47,369
Hey!

569
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:49,496
We've met before.

570
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,042
In our previous lives?

571
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:56,670
Oh

572
00:35:57,504 --> 00:35:59,214
you pretended to know me

573
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:01,716
a few mornings ago, right?

574
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,635
- Nope.
- No?

575
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:06,554
Whoever he thought I was,
he waved at me like we were old pals.

576
00:36:06,638 --> 00:36:09,182
I was waving at my friend
who also moved from the Chungnam Court.

577
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:10,642
No, you two were so awkward.

578
00:36:11,476 --> 00:36:14,271
You know what's really awkward?

579
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:17,440
A nobody prosecutor going
after the Ministry of Justice candidate.

580
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:23,613
You double-booked yourself on purpose,
huh?

581
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:25,031
What do you think you're doing?

582
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:27,158
You just said you wanted to say hi.

583
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:28,243
Prosecutor Park!

584
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:29,411
I'm sorry.

585
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:33,415
Prosecutor Park owes me one.

586
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,791
I see.

587
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,211
I'd really better get going.

588
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:40,505
Enjoy your dinner.

589
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:46,803
- What are you...
- "I love u"?

590
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,974
"I love u"!

591
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,019
I hope

592
00:36:54,394 --> 00:36:56,438
my dear Prosecutor Kim Jin-a realizes

593
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,648
how much I love her.

594
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:05,363
Isn't this blood?

595
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,865
Wow.

596
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:09,993
He loves you so much
that he vomited blood.

597
00:37:14,998 --> 00:37:15,999
Oh.

598
00:37:16,624 --> 00:37:19,085
Must be from one of those guys
I locked up in jail.

599
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:20,962
It's made with love.

600
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:22,797
Not a bad souvenir.

601
00:37:23,214 --> 00:37:25,925
Looks like it's from someone
you failed to lock up in jail.

602
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:31,097
How long are you going to let CEO Jang
send these little souvenirs?

603
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:33,641
CEO Jang Tae-sik of S Shopping?

604
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:35,185
Bust Woo Gyo-hun's daughter.

605
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:37,437
Then, I'll help you bust Jang Tae-sik.

606
00:37:39,064 --> 00:37:40,357
Didn't know you were a pathological liar.

607
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,151
Bust Woo Hee-young and stop her daddy
from becoming the Minister.

608
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:44,694
I'm the mastermind behind it.

609
00:37:50,158 --> 00:37:52,494
Didn't you want to bust Jang Tae-sik?

610
00:37:53,578 --> 00:37:56,581
Mr. Woo's confirmation hearing would be
the perfect day for it.

611
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:07,092
I'd like to pay, please.

612
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:09,844
Oh, Mr. Lee!

613
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:11,304
Hey.

614
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:15,725
I'm hungry.

615
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:25,944
Mr. Lee, are you hungry?

616
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:30,615
Your credit card, please.

617
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:38,123
Wow!

618
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:40,417
I made it for you. It looks like you.

619
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,794
Me? Is that why he's smiling?

620
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:44,838
<i>So, Judge Lee.</i>

621
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:46,339
<i>What's he really like?</i>

622
00:38:48,383 --> 00:38:49,551
I don't know much, either.

623
00:38:50,343 --> 00:38:54,013
But I think I know what lies in his heart.

624
00:38:55,598 --> 00:38:56,975
It's not justice.

625
00:38:57,517 --> 00:38:59,102
Instead, there's animosity.

626
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:02,772
He empathizes with the victims
a little too much.

627
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:07,694
That's dangerous.

628
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:20,540
This bastard!

629
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,628
This is for you. I know you're into this.

630
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:19,182
Didn't know you were so cute, Mr. Jang.

631
00:40:24,979 --> 00:40:26,981
I wanted something bolder.

632
00:40:30,902 --> 00:40:31,986
I'm disappointed.

633
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:40,036
Guess you didn't like my love letter.

634
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:44,123
Should I have gone
with something more normal?

635
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:48,169
Here.

636
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,171
Finish it.

637
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,759
- Let's go, Byeon.
- Yes, sir.

638
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:17,657
So, that prosecutor bitch's dad is
in the hospital?

639
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,741
Yes, sir.

640
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,661
Most of her salary goes to pay
for his hospital bills

641
00:41:21,744 --> 00:41:23,788
so she just lives in a shoebox apartment.

642
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:27,000
What a crazy bitch.

643
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,002
She thinks she can live off her wage

644
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:31,504
just by being a prosecutor?

645
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:32,922
I know, right?

646
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:35,592
What should I do?

647
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:36,926
What else?

648
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:41,431
Time to shove money down her throat
until she chokes.

649
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:44,517
She's just not tasted
the power of money yet.

650
00:41:47,228 --> 00:41:49,272
What a funny bitch.

651
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:56,070
Hey, why aren't they coming?

652
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:58,114
What if he already paid them off?

653
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:01,159
Nobody from the family has stepped
out of the house.

654
00:42:03,494 --> 00:42:06,331
Why aren't those bastards getting to work?

655
00:42:06,414 --> 00:42:08,082
How do they get all their money?

656
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:13,463
Hey, are you sure you paid him right?

657
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:15,757
Yes, sir.

658
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:29,020
A civic group should've filed a case

659
00:42:29,604 --> 00:42:31,814
regarding your stock parking by now.

660
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:35,652
What did you just say?

661
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:37,028
Who would do that?

662
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:41,532
Wait, today is Saturday.

663
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:44,327
They have until 1 p.m.

664
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:53,169
So, what do I do now?

665
00:42:54,629 --> 00:42:58,633
"It's not appropriate for me
to comment on an ongoing investigation."

666
00:43:00,218 --> 00:43:01,844
Just say that.

667
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:12,355
What a pain.

668
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:20,738
Okay.

669
00:43:24,283 --> 00:43:26,327
WOO GYO-HUN REFUSES TO COMMENT
ON STOCK PARKING ALLEGATIONS

670
00:43:26,411 --> 00:43:28,204
SAYING IT'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION

671
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:30,707
It already smells like a set-up.

672
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:36,045
Alright!

673
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:39,090
It's rent collection day, so it's on me.

674
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:40,967
What, you own a whole building now?

675
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:43,928
This is mine.

676
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,143
Huh? You actually own this building?

677
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:51,352
You didn't know?

678
00:43:51,436 --> 00:43:52,478
Of course not!

679
00:43:55,106 --> 00:43:57,942
You could've even paid for my car.

680
00:43:58,025 --> 00:44:00,611
I can't do that.
That'd cause you big trouble.

681
00:44:00,695 --> 00:44:02,488
Isn't there a law against that?

682
00:44:03,906 --> 00:44:06,492
MY SON HAS FALLEN,
AND I AM STILL STANDING THERE

683
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:09,662
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

684
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:15,793
Hello.

685
00:44:15,877 --> 00:44:17,044
<i>Hi, Ms. Song.</i>

686
00:44:17,545 --> 00:44:19,380
One of the victims in the sinkhole case

687
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,759
lost his pet dog.
Would you like to see him?

688
00:44:23,718 --> 00:44:25,052
No.

689
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:27,555
The only sinkhole victim I'm focusing on

690
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:30,767
is the one who lost his son.

691
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,477
<i>That's why I'm telling you to see him.</i>

692
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,811
<i>It'll help you.</i>

693
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:39,150
Aren't you a team with Ms. Yu Se-hee?

694
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:41,736
<i>Haenal wouldn't appreciate you doing this.</i>

695
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:43,613
Judges don't take sides.

696
00:44:43,696 --> 00:44:44,822
I'll send you the address.

697
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:49,452
Who is it? A woman?

698
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,828
No, a reporter.

699
00:44:51,162 --> 00:44:54,081
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG:
12, CHOLIM-RO, NAMMYEON DISTRICT, SEOUL

700
00:44:54,874 --> 00:44:57,168
Does he really think I'd go?

701
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:59,045
He's not even on my side.

702
00:45:00,588 --> 00:45:02,256
<i>Judges don't take sides.</i>

703
00:45:02,548 --> 00:45:04,509
My gosh.

704
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:09,722
You know what?

705
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:12,308
Reporters don't take sides, either.

706
00:45:12,683 --> 00:45:14,018
Let's go.

707
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:24,695
<i>Who's there?</i>

708
00:45:25,488 --> 00:45:28,950
Hello, I'm Song Na-yeon,
a reporter at Daejin Daily.

709
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:33,579
BAMTOL

710
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:40,753
Nice to meet you.

711
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,422
What brings you here?

712
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:48,261
HAND-PULLED SUJEBI AND KALGUKSU

713
00:46:03,192 --> 00:46:05,027
Could you tell me

714
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:07,280
what happened?

715
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:15,538
I spotted an odd crack in the road
the day before the accident

716
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:19,000
so I reported it to the District Office.

717
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,293
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

718
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:21,502
PLAINTIFF LEE JANG-SEOK

719
00:46:26,465 --> 00:46:28,509
DEFENDANT

720
00:46:30,261 --> 00:46:33,890
The Plaintiffs and the Defendant seem
to have reached an agreement.

721
00:46:34,265 --> 00:46:38,477
Yes, Your Honor.
All 12 Plaintiffs agreed on a settlement.

722
00:46:39,812 --> 00:46:40,897
Okay, then.

723
00:46:42,064 --> 00:46:43,733
I'll respect the mutual agreement

724
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:46,319
and conclude the case.

725
00:46:47,403 --> 00:46:48,487
Good work.

726
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,365
Your Honor!

727
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:54,577
There's proof
that the Defendant coerced a settlement.

728
00:46:56,662 --> 00:46:57,747
Wait!

729
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:03,669
Hello, you represent Mr. Heo Dong-gi,
right?

730
00:47:04,462 --> 00:47:05,630
Yes.

731
00:47:05,713 --> 00:47:08,007
This is a video
of a Nammyeon District officer

732
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,301
coercing the victim to settle.

733
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:13,471
- Your Honor!
- Overruled.

734
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:16,182
- What?
- Sit.

735
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:26,192
<i>A million won is plenty</i>
<i>for a damn dog's death.</i>

736
00:47:26,692 --> 00:47:28,277
<i>What more do you want?</i>

737
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:30,029
<i>The sinkhole didn't kill just a dog.</i>

738
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:32,323
<i>It killed my family!</i>

739
00:47:33,074 --> 00:47:34,867
<i>You got a dog stroller, too?</i>

740
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:37,119
<i>- That's right!</i>
<i>- Serve the nation. Have kids instead.</i>

741
00:47:37,203 --> 00:47:38,955
<i>You're doing a disservice to the country!</i>

742
00:47:39,497 --> 00:47:40,623
<i>What, you bastard?</i>

743
00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:42,249
Where did they get that?

744
00:47:48,047 --> 00:47:49,548
What's that doing there?

745
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:50,841
Turn it off right now!

746
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:51,926
Just be quiet!

747
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:54,929
What the hell?

748
00:47:57,682 --> 00:48:00,601
Seems like there was an agreement,
but it wasn't consensual.

749
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:03,771
Your Honor, based on the video

750
00:48:03,854 --> 00:48:06,524
we cannot deny
that there were some unfortunate acts.

751
00:48:06,607 --> 00:48:09,610
However, that's just one officer
going rogue.

752
00:48:09,694 --> 00:48:10,695
You cannot assume

753
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:12,613
all other victims were also coerced

754
00:48:12,697 --> 00:48:13,864
based on just one video.

755
00:48:13,948 --> 00:48:15,491
It's not just one case.

756
00:48:15,574 --> 00:48:17,159
I've confirmed

757
00:48:17,243 --> 00:48:19,412
the restaurant owner behind the complaint
was also threatened.

758
00:48:19,745 --> 00:48:22,498
What did the District Office employees
come and say to you?

759
00:48:22,915 --> 00:48:24,375
What else?

760
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:26,168
They didn't even come.

761
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:28,713
What? They didn't even come?

762
00:48:28,796 --> 00:48:29,922
To assess the situation?

763
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:32,133
Not at all. No officers here.

764
00:48:33,592 --> 00:48:35,970
Not anyone who looked
even remotely connected to the District.

765
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:39,098
The office claims they checked the site
upon receiving the report

766
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:41,684
and didn't find any issues.

767
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:47,231
You haven't told this to anyone, have you?

768
00:48:47,314 --> 00:48:49,150
I tried!

769
00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:53,988
I saw Mayor Chu lying bluntly on TV

770
00:48:54,613 --> 00:48:55,906
so I got mad.

771
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:59,243
I tried to tell the reporters
who came to see the sinkhole

772
00:48:59,326 --> 00:49:02,371
that Mayor Chu was lying

773
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:04,707
but someone came from behind

774
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,668
and grabbed my shoulders.

775
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:09,545
This guy came

776
00:49:10,087 --> 00:49:11,714
and stared right through me.

777
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:13,090
<i>I got so scared</i>

778
00:49:13,466 --> 00:49:15,051
<i>that I couldn't say anything.</i>

779
00:49:16,802 --> 00:49:17,803
Is that so?

780
00:49:24,143 --> 00:49:27,188
This means we'll have to see

781
00:49:27,271 --> 00:49:30,775
if the other Plaintiffs were also coerced
into settling.

782
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:32,860
Your Honor!

783
00:49:32,943 --> 00:49:33,986
Overruled.

784
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:39,450
What the officer did in the clip was

785
00:49:39,867 --> 00:49:42,203
an act of assault and coercion.

786
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:44,663
This constitutes a criminal offense

787
00:49:44,747 --> 00:49:46,457
and there is clear proof of it.

788
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,336
Please face your criminal charges first.

789
00:49:51,337 --> 00:49:53,631
A criminal trial?
What are you going to do now?

790
00:49:54,048 --> 00:49:56,467
It's on you for threatening the victims!

791
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,593
No, I...

792
00:49:59,303 --> 00:50:01,347
You're kidding me!

793
00:50:03,182 --> 00:50:05,851
<i>This is only the start.</i>

794
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,978
As the trial's outcome depends

795
00:50:08,062 --> 00:50:10,189
on the outcome of the criminal case

796
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:11,857
this civil case will be postponed

797
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:15,069
until the criminal case is concluded.

798
00:50:15,861 --> 00:50:17,988
We'll soon find out

799
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:19,740
why he had to resort to violence and rush

800
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:23,285
just to settle mere 500 million won.

801
00:50:24,703 --> 00:50:26,831
To start, go to the prosecution
for your investigation.

802
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:28,707
That is all.

803
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:50,020
Good work.

804
00:50:50,646 --> 00:50:51,647
It's nothing.

805
00:50:59,113 --> 00:51:01,949
Someone played a clip
of a district employee beating a victim.

806
00:51:02,032 --> 00:51:04,243
Judge Lee requested
the prosecution to investigate.

807
00:51:05,286 --> 00:51:07,788
But the prosecutor in charge is

808
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:11,333
Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo

809
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,127
who helped Judge Lee catch
the serial killer.

810
00:51:14,211 --> 00:51:16,547
They were hired in Seoul
around the same time.

811
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:19,300
If Mayor Chu gets busted

812
00:51:19,383 --> 00:51:21,427
it'll put Assemblyman Kang at risk.

813
00:51:23,095 --> 00:51:25,431
How much money went into Kang's funds?

814
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:27,850
Around two billion won.

815
00:51:29,894 --> 00:51:31,395
Tell Assemblyman Kang

816
00:51:31,478 --> 00:51:33,022
to cut off all ties with Mayor Chu

817
00:51:33,272 --> 00:51:34,773
and to erase all traces.

818
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:36,734
Yes, sir.

819
00:51:37,693 --> 00:51:38,694
But

820
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,448
what are you going to do with Judge Lee?

821
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:46,035
I don't believe

822
00:51:46,744 --> 00:51:48,579
Judge Lee is one of us.

823
00:51:51,248 --> 00:51:52,791
You think I don't know that?

824
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:56,503
They found a video of the victims

825
00:51:56,587 --> 00:51:58,631
being coerced into settlement
by the officers.

826
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:01,634
I guess it'll be a criminal case, then.

827
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:02,927
Yes, Mr. Baek.

828
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,303
That's enough of that.

829
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:09,475
Don't you have something to tell me?

830
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:11,310
<i>What does he mean?</i>

831
00:52:11,644 --> 00:52:13,187
<i>Is he suspecting something?</i>

832
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:18,901
I apologize
for not concluding the case myself

833
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:21,779
when you trusted me with it.

834
00:52:23,697 --> 00:52:24,907
That's okay.

835
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:27,159
Come anytime
if you have anything to tell me.

836
00:52:27,701 --> 00:52:29,119
Or a favor to ask me.

837
00:52:31,288 --> 00:52:33,582
CHIEF JUDGE OFFICE

838
00:52:37,544 --> 00:52:39,505
It's too early to tell him the truth.

839
00:52:47,471 --> 00:52:49,807
How did this end up playing
in the middle of the trial?

840
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:53,435
Mayor Chu is in a gang.

841
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:56,730
He must've used his guys
to coerce the victims into settling.

842
00:52:59,191 --> 00:53:01,777
All our clients are veteran criminals.

843
00:53:02,152 --> 00:53:04,321
It doesn't matter
if he's a gangster or a murderer.

844
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,198
You should've been more prepared.

845
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:07,449
Zip it.

846
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:08,784
Handle it, alright?

847
00:53:09,326 --> 00:53:10,703
While minimizing the risk.

848
00:53:11,078 --> 00:53:12,204
Okay.

849
00:53:15,749 --> 00:53:18,127
Oh, my, what's with the glum faces?

850
00:53:20,045 --> 00:53:21,297
Don't I look great?

851
00:53:21,964 --> 00:53:23,424
The insurance was no help.

852
00:53:23,757 --> 00:53:24,967
Clean it and put it back.

853
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,260
Whatever.

854
00:53:26,343 --> 00:53:29,305
You know
how expensive the cancellation fee is.

855
00:53:31,348 --> 00:53:32,391
Well...

856
00:53:35,269 --> 00:53:36,353
Hello.

857
00:53:37,604 --> 00:53:40,482
I figured you must be quite stressed
about Mayor Chu's case.

858
00:53:41,483 --> 00:53:44,153
That's nothing to stress over.

859
00:53:46,905 --> 00:53:48,365
That's Judge Lee Han-young.

860
00:53:49,033 --> 00:53:50,659
He'll be our family soon.

861
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:52,619
Family? Who says?

862
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:56,540
- Yu Jin-gwang.
- Lee Han-young.

863
00:53:56,623 --> 00:53:57,958
<i>It's been a minute, Jin-gwang.</i>

864
00:53:58,042 --> 00:54:00,044
<i>Presiding Judge Lee Han-young.</i>

865
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:02,796
Here's a delivery for you.

866
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:04,214
What is it?

867
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:06,550
The final verdict for S Group's case.

868
00:54:07,343 --> 00:54:09,470
<i>You'll have to write</i>
<i>the final verdict of your life</i>

869
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,388
<i>in prison.</i>

870
00:54:11,472 --> 00:54:12,681
What a handsome guy.

871
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:13,849
Have a seat.

872
00:54:21,899 --> 00:54:23,192
If you're so worried about us

873
00:54:23,275 --> 00:54:26,153
you shouldn't have accepted
the victim's video as proof.

874
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,075
If I dismissed the case,
even with a clip of the coercion

875
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:33,035
the press and the Plaintiffs

876
00:54:33,118 --> 00:54:36,080
would've questioned
my ties to Haenal Law Firm.

877
00:54:37,164 --> 00:54:39,500
A judge has to be fair, indeed.

878
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:41,418
Dad!

879
00:54:43,253 --> 00:54:44,963
Mayor Chu will be exposed

880
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:46,965
for funneling illegal funds soon.

881
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,510
Are you sure?

882
00:54:49,593 --> 00:54:50,761
Cutting him off will be

883
00:54:50,844 --> 00:54:53,555
the firm's best way
of minimizing the risks.

884
00:54:58,644 --> 00:55:01,939
That's unfortunate for my client.

885
00:55:02,564 --> 00:55:06,068
BEEF ENTRAILS

886
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:15,327
I wondered why people ever chose this
over all the good food

887
00:55:15,411 --> 00:55:16,954
but this is seriously good.

888
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:26,213
Eat up.

889
00:55:26,296 --> 00:55:27,423
Don't worry.

890
00:55:29,091 --> 00:55:30,884
Two more orders of the intestines!

891
00:55:30,968 --> 00:55:32,678
Okay, coming!

892
00:55:35,222 --> 00:55:36,223
Please!

893
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,861
Drink slowly.

894
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:50,821
Do you come here often?

895
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:53,615
<i>This is where Se-hee said</i>
<i>she'd only have one piece</i>

896
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:55,993
<i>and had three servings</i>
<i>in our previous lives.</i>

897
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:57,494
Have some.

898
00:55:58,412 --> 00:56:00,539
I've been here with a colleague.

899
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:03,375
Colleen?

900
00:56:04,835 --> 00:56:05,919
Talk about a ladies' man.

901
00:56:07,212 --> 00:56:09,006
- What's for Round Two?
- I have plans.

902
00:56:09,089 --> 00:56:10,299
Don't be such a snob!

903
00:56:11,216 --> 00:56:12,718
Where are my intestines?

904
00:56:14,428 --> 00:56:15,596
Is it a girl?

905
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:16,722
A colleague.

906
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:18,557
Did I ask for her name?

907
00:56:18,974 --> 00:56:21,602
Why the hell do you keep mentioning
this Colleen girl?

908
00:56:21,685 --> 00:56:22,728
A colleague.

909
00:56:24,563 --> 00:56:25,731
Yeah, so...

910
00:56:27,274 --> 00:56:28,484
Someone he knows.

911
00:56:30,569 --> 00:56:31,820
Someone he knows...

912
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:33,822
A colleague.

913
00:56:36,241 --> 00:56:37,367
Someone he knows...

914
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:41,830
This is embarrassing.

915
00:56:42,873 --> 00:56:44,208
I feel like an idiot!

916
00:56:49,463 --> 00:56:53,759
PROSECUTION SERVICE

917
00:57:17,824 --> 00:57:19,952
<i>Mayor Chu is backed by Assemblyman Kang.</i>

918
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:22,996
<i>If you aren't prepared to take both down,</i>
<i>don't even bother starting.</i>

919
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,843
You own Taemyeong Construction, don't you?

920
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:43,016
It's time for me to take my meds.

921
00:57:43,475 --> 00:57:44,560
Go ahead.

922
00:57:48,355 --> 00:57:50,023
I don't have any health conditions.

923
00:57:50,107 --> 00:57:51,400
They're just supplements.

924
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,278
We, Koreans, can't skip any meal.

925
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:57,948
But I've skipped too many
because I was busy doing my mayor work.

926
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:59,616
That's what the supplements are for.

927
00:58:01,994 --> 00:58:02,995
Why do you think

928
00:58:03,245 --> 00:58:05,539
I've called you before Mr. Cheon Hak-su

929
00:58:06,123 --> 00:58:07,416
who actually beat up people?

930
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:11,003
I know Assemblyman Kang

931
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:14,089
scrubbed your record
as the Obok gang's boss

932
00:58:14,965 --> 00:58:16,258
to get you elected.

933
00:58:23,682 --> 00:58:25,642
I didn't know
Mr. Kang ran a cleaning service.

934
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:29,062
It was game over for you
the moment you sat down.

935
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:30,939
Choose me

936
00:58:31,315 --> 00:58:32,357
before they abandon you.

937
00:58:32,691 --> 00:58:34,109
Don't you want to be re-elected?

938
00:58:45,037 --> 00:58:48,165
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

939
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:00,510
Mr. Chu just left.

940
00:59:01,345 --> 00:59:02,929
Mr. Kang will have a lot on his mind

941
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:05,140
once he sees Chu's easy release.

942
00:59:10,395 --> 00:59:11,521
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE

943
00:59:12,522 --> 00:59:13,649
Yes, Mr. Kang.

944
00:59:13,732 --> 00:59:15,233
Jeong-tae is already calling him.

945
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:19,571
Seems like their trust will break
sooner than I expected.

946
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:21,323
Did he mention me?

947
00:59:21,406 --> 00:59:23,367
No, he didn't mention your name.

948
00:59:23,742 --> 00:59:25,077
You sure about that?

949
00:59:25,452 --> 00:59:26,536
Of course.

950
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:27,746
Alright, then.

951
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,541
Don't do anything
and wait until I call you.

952
00:59:32,584 --> 00:59:33,627
Sorry?

953
00:59:37,547 --> 00:59:38,840
"Wait"?

954
00:59:39,508 --> 00:59:41,259
What am I, his lapdog?

955
00:59:42,052 --> 00:59:43,303
Gosh.

956
00:59:56,525 --> 00:59:59,486
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

957
00:59:59,778 --> 01:00:06,827
SEONHWAGAK

958
01:00:15,419 --> 01:00:17,963
Mayor Chu should be fine.

959
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:21,717
Jeong-tae

960
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:25,470
make sure Yong-jin is the only one
getting prosecuted here.

961
01:00:26,221 --> 01:00:27,222
Yes, sir.

962
01:00:27,305 --> 01:00:28,974
If this affects you, too

963
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:31,893
it'll affect your support base
in the next election.

964
01:00:33,103 --> 01:00:34,187
Sin-jin

965
01:00:34,271 --> 01:00:36,022
Chu's trial shouldn't affect us, right?

966
01:00:36,106 --> 01:00:38,817
I hear he was in a gang.

967
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:39,985
Is that true?

968
01:00:42,946 --> 01:00:45,198
Yes, but not anymore.

969
01:00:45,282 --> 01:00:48,118
He's now just an earnest mayor
who works for the district.

970
01:00:52,164 --> 01:00:53,957
Why is he the boss
of Taemyeong Construction

971
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,042
that's full of gangsters, then?

972
01:00:57,961 --> 01:00:59,629
Oh, man.

973
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:05,469
Even the tail can wag the dog
when it’s desperate.

974
01:01:07,179 --> 01:01:08,221
You mean...

975
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:29,701
You have to cut it off before it wags you.

976
01:01:45,675 --> 01:01:46,760
Yes, Mr. Kang.

977
01:01:47,594 --> 01:01:49,888
<i>Just consider it a holiday</i>

978
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:51,473
<i>until things calm down.</i>

979
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:52,933
Yes, sir.

980
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:55,477
I got it. Okay.

981
01:02:00,941 --> 01:02:02,400
- It's all good.
- Okay.

982
01:02:02,943 --> 01:02:04,778
- Everything's ready?
- Yes.

983
01:02:04,861 --> 01:02:06,154
But

984
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,281
what if we're stuck there forever?

985
01:02:08,782 --> 01:02:09,866
You're funny.

986
01:02:11,493 --> 01:02:13,328
Gosh.

987
01:02:15,247 --> 01:02:19,417
This is a ledger of all the kickbacks
I've paid Jeong-tae.

988
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:20,794
What's he going to do?

989
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:23,421
He'd better treat me well

990
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:27,384
if he wants to stay out of jail
and keep his seat in the government.

991
01:02:30,512 --> 01:02:32,889
Hak-su, when's the ferry leaving again?

992
01:02:32,973 --> 01:02:34,850
It departs at 3 a.m.

993
01:02:34,933 --> 01:02:36,017
Okay.

994
01:02:36,101 --> 01:02:38,353
I can't be a Mayor again

995
01:02:38,436 --> 01:02:40,897
so I might as well stick to being
Jeong-tae's upper hand.

996
01:02:41,606 --> 01:02:43,483
You know how much I've been through

997
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:44,943
to save him from trouble.

998
01:02:45,735 --> 01:02:47,070
You're right, boss.

999
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:48,446
Hey, Han-young.

1000
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,032
Yong-jin is taking a ferry
in Incheon tonight.

1001
01:02:52,325 --> 01:02:53,577
I'll send you the meeting location.

1002

LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE

1003
01:02:54,744 --> 01:02:56,204
I'll get on my way now

1004
01:02:56,288 --> 01:02:58,498
so don't approach him first, okay?

1005

LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE

1006
01:03:44,878 --> 01:03:46,296
Gross.

1007
01:03:46,379 --> 01:03:49,424
The dust in this place will kill me
before I even get on the ferry.

1008
01:03:50,091 --> 01:03:52,469
Just wait a sec.

1009
01:03:53,053 --> 01:03:55,430
- Why?
- I know you get seasick.

1010
01:03:57,307 --> 01:03:58,433
Good boy.

1011
01:03:59,017 --> 01:04:00,018
You can go.

1012
01:04:05,482 --> 01:04:07,442
Gosh.

1013
01:04:41,893 --> 01:04:45,438
LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE
WE BUY AND SELL USED BOOKS

1014
01:04:53,655 --> 01:04:54,698
I knew it.

1015
01:05:14,384 --> 01:05:17,929
THE JUDGE RETURNS

1016
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:43,621
How much do you trust me?

1017
01:05:43,788 --> 01:05:46,207
<i>Kang Sin-jin, the Senior Presiding Judge.</i>
<i>He has a bad reputation.</i>

1018
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:47,333
<i>You know Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo, right?</i>

1019
01:05:47,417 --> 01:05:49,377
<i>Fieldwork is for prosecutors,</i>
<i>not for judges.</i>

1020
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:51,671
<i>Hurry, Prosecutor Kim.</i>

1021
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:54,758
<i>You'll need to fight for your life</i>
<i>if you choose to start.</i>

1022
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,343
<i>Seems like you've already put your life</i>
<i>on the line.</i>

1023
01:05:59,554 --> 01:06:01,681
<i>I told you I was the mastermind behind it.</i>

1024
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:04,309
<i>Judge Lee isn't one of us yet.</i>

1025
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:05,727
<i>I really wonder</i>

1026
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:07,562
<i>why you approached me.</i>

1027
01:06:07,645 --> 01:06:09,856
<i>How much do you trust me?</i>
