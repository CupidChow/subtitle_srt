00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:36,628
You should have a conscience.

193
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:39,764
You betrayed us first, so it is only natural.

194
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:43,969
What did you do to my father, you bastard?

195
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:47,188
Don't you feel sorry for your dad?

196
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:51,476
But

197
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:53,061
they say being truly unfilial is

198
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:54,646
dying before your parents.

199
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:57,198
What did you do to my father...

200
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:01,786
What kind of nonsense is that?

201
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,075
When you return to the detention center,

202
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:10,211
there will be guys waiting for you.

203
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:12,998
Don't suffer needlessly.

204
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:14,499
Take this as soon as you get there.

205
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:17,552
No matter how you die,
it will be ruled an accident.

206
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,153
Did you get rid of
Choi Jong Hak this way too?

207
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:28,180
Hey, you still have some composure left.

208
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,318
You are even worried about others.

209
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,767
Is this Chairman Jang Tae Sik's doing?

210
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,018
You really are a judge.

211
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:34,770
You are so curious about everything.

212
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,439
You weren't like that during the trial.

213
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,775
Think about it carefully.

214
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,359
Starting with your wife...

215
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,745
Isn't it strange that no one is on your side?

216
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:49,117
Chairman Jang Tae Sik didn't plan this alone.

217
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:52,370
From arrest to indictment and trial.

218
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,291
Don't you think it was too fast?

219
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,626
Chief Justice Kang Shin Jin

220
00:18:57,626 --> 00:19:00,378
has a lot of interest in this trial.

221
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:02,930
Chief Justice Kang Shin Jin.

222
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,802
Since you know why you are dying, no regrets.

223
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:09,387
Also, I'll tell you
because you might be curious.

224
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,890
The safe

225
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,391
you hid in the nursing home closet.

226
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:15,029
I took it.

227
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,145
You saved up quite a bit
while working like a lapdog.

228
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:18,480
Why?

229
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,481
What's wrong?

230
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:21,733
It is useless money once you die anyway.

231
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,069
What?

232
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,654
You piece of trash!

233
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:27,072
Because a piece of trash pretended
to be a judge,

234
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:29,574
you ended up like this.

235
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:31,993
If you were trash,
you should have lived like trash!

236
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:35,413
If you had lived like trash,
you might have at least been useful.

237
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,715
You frustrating bastard.

238
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:52,013

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,473

00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,942
He is such a wicked guy.

242

243
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,235

Please call 911.

246

I told him to take it at the detention center.

247
00:20:55,994 --> 00:20:57,795
Geez.

248
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,498
[Emergency Center]
Pulse and respiration are very unstable.

249
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:02,346
- Prepare for gastric lavage.
- Yes.

250
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:03,907
The patient likely ingested some pills.

251
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:06,911
- When were they taken?
- Around 15 minutes, give or take.

252
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,429
Check the patient in 30 minutes

253
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:15,430
and notify me.

00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,231
Yes.

00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,455
Contact the prison guard immediately.

258
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:45,711
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:48,075
I told you to keep a close eye on him!

260
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:57,188
I cannot die as a piece of trash.

261
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:11,820
This is Kim Yun Hyeok.

262
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,621
Go ahead.

263
00:25:33,438 --> 00:25:36,490
Who is that guy? What's wrong with him?

264
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:22,070
The Seoul City Council passed a policy
imposing a fine of up to 10 million won

265
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,404
on the homeless people

266
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:26,074
for city aesthetics and citizen safety.

267
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:30,411
This is the 18th ordinance of 2035.

268

Just Die!

273
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:17,978
Get off me!

Please.

277
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:37,361
Save me.

278
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:07,057
This is the end.

279
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,841
It is too unfair to die like this.

280
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:32,093

I'm sorry.

00:32:25,016 --> 00:32:27,067
I'm sorry.

00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:50,453
I believe I asked you that first.

563
00:50:50,453 --> 00:50:53,623
Then the person who asked first
should answer first.

564
00:50:53,623 --> 00:50:56,042
The "Psycho Judge" has been trending all day.

565
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:57,711
We should add "Power-Tripping Judge"
to the list.

566
00:50:57,711 --> 00:51:00,213
We will see who is tripping whom soon enough.

567
00:51:00,213 --> 00:51:02,549
Didn't you come here
because you felt something was off?

568
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:03,550
What could be off?

569
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,385
He climbed a wall because he was hungry.

570
00:51:05,385 --> 00:51:06,720
I just came to check,

571
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,888
but what could possibly be here?

572
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:10,773
What could...

573
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,997
What could possibly be here?

574
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,465
What?

575
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:38,168
- Are you a princess or something?
- You scared me.

576
00:51:38,168 --> 00:51:39,969
Move over.

577
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,766
Just like this.

578
00:51:52,766 --> 00:51:55,484
Boom. It's done.

579
00:51:56,352 --> 00:51:57,937
See that? Just like that.

580
00:51:57,937 --> 00:52:01,357
But isn't this property damage
under the Criminal Act?

581
00:52:01,357 --> 00:52:03,359
It's not damage. I removed it cleanly.

582
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,160
Without a warrant?

583
00:52:07,197 --> 00:52:10,165
You removed it, so go in and open the door.

584
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,212
I think I got mixed up in something bad.

585
00:52:22,212 --> 00:52:24,430
This is insane.

586
00:52:34,015 --> 00:52:36,320
What exactly are you looking for?

587
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,561
You have handled violent crimes, right?

588
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:40,446
Of course.

589
00:52:44,821 --> 00:52:46,569
I am opening it.

590
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:48,418
One.

591
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,219
Two.

592
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,556
Three.

593
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:04,900
A body...

594
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,058
Why would a body be here?

595
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:13,639
Let go of me. You scared me.

596
00:53:15,932 --> 00:53:17,858
A body...

597
00:53:18,601 --> 00:53:20,937
Is there something in there?

598
00:53:20,937 --> 00:53:23,572
I've almost untied it.

599
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,325
- Wait.
- What is that?

600
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:37,871
Do you usually scream

601
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:39,539
- out of joy when opening a fridge?
- It's not here.

602
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:40,456
It should definitely be here.

603
00:53:40,456 --> 00:53:42,125
What on earth are you looking for?

604
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,126
Hey...

605
00:53:43,126 --> 00:53:44,460
Stop asking and just look.

606
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,212
I don't know!

607
00:53:46,212 --> 00:53:48,298
I thought this was a bone.

608
00:53:48,298 --> 00:53:50,683
You have to tell me what to look for.

609
00:53:52,135 --> 00:53:54,137
I must find proof that Kim Sang Jin

610
00:53:54,137 --> 00:53:55,805
is a serial killer.

611
00:53:55,805 --> 00:53:56,890
His third murder happened

612
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,058
three days before his arrest for trespassing.

613
00:53:59,058 --> 00:54:00,393
The records said the victim's body

614
00:54:00,393 --> 00:54:03,529
was found in the fridge.

615
00:54:06,816 --> 00:54:09,819
If you are done, please come out.

616
00:54:09,819 --> 00:54:13,128
Before we get charged
with trespassing and damage.

617
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,929
I said, come out.

618
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,797
Was there a temporary storage spot

619
00:54:29,797 --> 00:54:32,057
for the body?

620
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:38,229
It is a different brand.

621
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:39,641
Why are people in this neighborhood

622
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:42,317
so obsessed with cleaning?

623
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,668
Are you going to give
the death penalty for that?

624
00:54:46,272 --> 00:54:50,037
You hold a grudge, don't you?
I didn't know that.

625
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,436
Do you know me?

626
00:54:51,436 --> 00:54:54,079
No. Just a feeling.

627
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,177
What's with that casual
hands-behind-the-back stance?

628
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:14,634
Good choice.

629
00:55:14,634 --> 00:55:16,435
Good eye.

630
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,040
You are an Eagles fan, aren't you?

631
00:55:24,894 --> 00:55:26,862
How did you know?

632
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,069
I only came because you offered to buy dinner.

633
00:55:33,069 --> 00:55:35,832
I don't want to get involved
with you anymore...

634
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,240
Hey.

635
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,910
Hey, hey! Oh my gosh!

636
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,711
Why did he...

637
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:44,414
It is fine.

638
00:55:44,414 --> 00:55:46,165
The Eagles will win anyway.

639
00:55:46,165 --> 00:55:47,667
But it will go into overtime.

640
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:49,752
A comeback home run
in the top of the 11th inning.

641
00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:51,720
The Eagles win.

642
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,840
Are you spreading false information?

643
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,508
Do you want to bet?

644
00:55:55,508 --> 00:55:59,061
The loser grants the winner one wish,
no matter what.

645
00:56:03,516 --> 00:56:05,317
Deal?

646
00:56:06,936 --> 00:56:08,737
Deal?

647
00:56:09,939 --> 00:56:11,990
- Deal.
- Water.

648
00:56:20,283 --> 00:56:23,252
This is the theft record...

649
00:56:33,713 --> 00:56:35,840
No, no.

650
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,593
The third victim's body

651
00:56:38,593 --> 00:56:41,777
was definitely found in a fridge.

652
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:45,027
Was the case file wrong?

653
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,809
No.

654
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:48,311
I remember seeing

655
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:51,822
the on-site inspection photos.

656
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:32,939
What on earth

657
00:57:32,939 --> 00:57:35,657
possessed him?

658
00:57:38,945 --> 00:57:41,079
You are here?

659
00:57:42,115 --> 00:57:44,450
Yes.

660
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,536
Did he pull an all-nighter?

661
00:57:46,536 --> 00:57:49,372
Yes, I think so.

662
00:57:49,372 --> 00:57:52,090
Why did he do that to Kim Sang Jin?

663
00:57:52,725 --> 00:57:55,360
Well, I am not sure either.

664
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,464
Aren't you two from the same class?

665
00:57:58,464 --> 00:58:00,265
Yes.

666
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:03,219
Tell him to come up after breakfast.

667
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:06,472
Oh, seriously, first thing in the morning...

668
00:58:06,472 --> 00:58:08,724
I don't know
why my stomach is like this lately.

669
00:58:08,724 --> 00:58:10,393
Tell him to come up.

670
00:58:10,393 --> 00:58:12,194
Yes.

671
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,896
Have a good day.

672
00:58:13,896 --> 00:58:15,781
Yeah, okay.

673
00:58:19,735 --> 00:58:23,030
Seriously? This gross, this early?

674
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:26,875
Why does he keep coming down here
and making it awkward?

675
00:58:32,665 --> 00:58:34,333
Oh, it's the nice Kim Yun Hyeok.

676
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:36,665
Of course, I am nice.

677
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,754
Did you sleep here?

678
00:58:38,754 --> 00:58:40,555
Yeah.

679
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,260
The Chief Judge wants you to come up.

680
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,089
Okay.

681
00:58:57,743 --> 00:59:00,590
It is exactly like the old days.

682
00:59:12,288 --> 00:59:14,673
Just the same.

683
00:59:18,242 --> 00:59:22,190
[Chungnam District Court]

684
00:59:24,634 --> 00:59:26,435
Look at this guy.

685
00:59:29,222 --> 00:59:31,106
Did you call for me?

686
00:59:39,398 --> 00:59:42,287
I was just going to close the door.

687
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,550
- Sit down.
- Yes.

688
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:49,291
Oops.

689
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,597
Acting like a chief already?

690
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,755
If you act like this
right after starting solo trials,

691
01:00:02,755 --> 01:00:05,508
you'll rotate through the provinces
until you retire.

692
01:00:05,508 --> 01:00:06,842
Chief Judge Baek Yi Seok came here

693
01:00:06,842 --> 01:00:08,761
because he upset the higher-ups,

694
01:00:08,761 --> 01:00:11,063
but shouldn't you aim for Seoul?

695
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,080
What will you do about Kim Sang Jin?

696
01:00:15,851 --> 01:00:17,853
It is an attempted theft
committed out of hunger.

697
01:00:17,853 --> 01:00:19,786
I will sentence him

698
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:21,368
according to the sentencing guidelines.

699
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,638
You are in your right mind, correct?

700
01:00:25,111 --> 01:00:27,666
I ask

701
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:31,878
for your continued strict guidance.

702
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,121
Sweeping the search trends is
an experience for a judge.

703
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:37,206
If you want attention, tell me anytime.

704
01:00:37,206 --> 01:00:38,874
I will give you plenty of attention.

705
01:00:38,874 --> 01:00:40,675
Yes.

706
01:00:43,045 --> 01:00:44,846
You can go now.

707
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:03,149
Why do I feel so uneasy?

708
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:04,623
Huh?

709
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:06,569
The court orders.

710
01:01:06,569 --> 01:01:08,404
The defendant, Kim Sang Jin,

711
01:01:08,404 --> 01:01:10,656
shall be punished with one year in prison.

712
01:01:10,656 --> 01:01:12,085
However,

713
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,577
the execution of the sentence
shall be suspended for two years

714
01:01:14,577 --> 01:01:17,337
from the date this judgment becomes final.

715
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:42,487
Where have I seen her?

716
01:01:43,105 --> 01:01:44,440
- Here he comes.
- Judge!

717
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,525
Judge Lee Han Young!

718
01:01:46,525 --> 01:01:48,110
You mentioned the death penalty last time.

719
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,862
Isn't one year with two years probation

720
01:01:49,862 --> 01:01:51,697
too drastic a change?

721
01:01:51,697 --> 01:01:54,283
My previous thought was actually more drastic.

722
01:01:54,283 --> 01:01:55,493
As a judge who must make fair

723
01:01:55,493 --> 01:01:57,787
and common-sense judgments,

724
01:01:57,787 --> 01:02:00,255
I sincerely apologize.

725
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:02,375
Ah, well...

726
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:03,626
Let's stop here for today.

727
01:02:03,626 --> 01:02:05,795
Have you all eaten?

728
01:02:05,795 --> 01:02:08,589
Please go eat and get some rest.
Okay?

729
01:02:08,589 --> 01:02:10,432
I will be going now.

730
01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:14,887
What is with that aura?

731
01:02:14,887 --> 01:02:16,889
I thought I was looking at a Chief Judge.

732
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:19,308
Isn't this his first solo trial?

733
01:02:19,308 --> 01:02:20,726
Hey, get a photo of him.

734
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:23,445
- Wait a second.
- Oh, gosh.

735
01:02:41,664 --> 01:02:44,549
That guy really has a killer smile.

736
01:02:49,755 --> 01:02:53,225
Judge Lee Han Young, let's take a picture.

737
01:03:05,438 --> 01:03:08,691
- Do you have any words for the families?
- Look here!

738
01:03:08,691 --> 01:03:11,826
Kang Ju Young. That's her.

739
01:03:15,448 --> 01:03:16,782
It was a kimchi refrigerator.

740
01:03:16,782 --> 01:03:18,033
Kim Sang Jin's third victim

741
01:03:18,033 --> 01:03:19,660
was found in a kimchi refrigerator.

742
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,370
There was a terrible reason for that.

743
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,539
[Woman's Body Found in a Kimchi Refrigerator]
I went to do a repair because they said

744
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,458
the bedroom AC was broken.

745
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:28,461
The kimchi refrigerator was blocking
the outdoor unit.

746
01:03:28,461 --> 01:03:31,046
So I pushed it aside slightly.

747
01:03:31,046 --> 01:03:32,298
And the woman freaked out.

748
01:03:32,298 --> 01:03:33,048
What's wrong?

749
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:35,301
- What's in here?
- So...

750
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:36,802
- That kimchi refrigerator...
- Wait.

751
01:03:36,802 --> 01:03:39,305
- It was weird that it was in the bedroom.
- Do not touch this.

752
01:03:39,305 --> 01:03:41,474
The woman was making such a fuss,

753
01:03:41,474 --> 01:03:43,225
so I got curious.

754
01:03:43,225 --> 01:03:46,061
[Lee Chun Soo, First to Discover the Body]
So when she went to the bathroom for a moment,

755
01:03:46,061 --> 01:03:48,613
I peeked inside.

756
01:03:49,565 --> 01:03:51,449
I was shocked.

757
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:04,997
What?

758
01:04:04,997 --> 01:04:06,798
Hey.

759
01:04:25,935 --> 01:04:27,686
Ha Yeon.

760
01:04:27,686 --> 01:04:29,939
Did you have fun?

761
01:04:29,939 --> 01:04:32,274
Let's go home, eat dinner,

762
01:04:32,274 --> 01:04:33,609
and come back out to play.

763
01:04:33,609 --> 01:04:34,693
Okay, Mom.

764
01:04:34,693 --> 01:04:35,444
Brush off your hands.

765
01:04:35,444 --> 01:04:37,996
Get your toy.

766
01:04:38,781 --> 01:04:40,115
Let's go. Hold Mommy's hand.

767
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:41,961
Let's go. Good girl.

768
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,786
Look at this.

769
01:04:43,786 --> 01:04:46,539
As for this car, it's at a used price,

770
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:48,207
but it's like brand new.

771
01:04:48,207 --> 01:04:49,208
There is a scratch here...

772
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:52,294
Ah, it is brand new. Brand new.

773
01:04:52,294 --> 01:04:54,797
Please put in a good word

774
01:04:54,797 --> 01:04:56,298
for me to Seok Jeong Ho.

775
01:04:56,298 --> 01:04:58,099
- Ah, sure.
- Thank you.

776
01:05:16,777 --> 01:05:19,321
Hello.

777
01:05:19,321 --> 01:05:20,823
I would like to ask you something.

778
01:05:20,823 --> 01:05:21,574
- Yes.
- Did anyone

779
01:05:21,574 --> 01:05:23,409
buy a lot of this at once?

780
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:25,494
Oh...

781
01:05:25,494 --> 01:05:26,829
Well.

782
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:28,914
What did they look like?

783
01:05:28,914 --> 01:05:30,833
She was wearing a hat, so I'm not sure,

784
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:33,252
but it was a woman.

785
01:05:33,252 --> 01:05:34,253
I'm not sure.

786
01:05:34,253 --> 01:05:35,588
It is this brand.

787
01:05:35,588 --> 01:05:38,173
Ah, we don't have this one.

788
01:05:38,173 --> 01:05:39,758
- Okay, I understand.
- Bye.

789
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:41,604
Thank you.

790
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,929
- Yes, Prosecutor Park.
- It's me.

791
01:05:43,929 --> 01:05:46,348
Kim Sang Jin hasn't moved an inch
from his house.

792
01:05:46,348 --> 01:05:47,933
Anyway...

793
01:05:47,933 --> 01:05:49,435
That baseball game wasn't a rerun,

794
01:05:49,435 --> 01:05:51,294
so how did you know?

795
01:05:57,443 --> 01:05:59,747
Yes!

796
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,614
- Another run comes in on a home run.
- What?

797
01:06:01,614 --> 01:06:04,283
I just guessed. I just hoped that would happen.

798
01:06:04,283 --> 01:06:07,335
Anyway, do not lose sight of him.

799
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:12,507
That game is what made me an Eagles fan, too.

800
01:06:15,294 --> 01:06:17,046
I am coming over tonight,

801
01:06:17,046 --> 01:06:19,097
so be ready.

802
01:06:27,389 --> 01:06:30,267
He came outside.

803
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:32,061
Kim Sang Jin is a serial killer.

804
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:34,699
Tonight, he will kill a six-year-old girl...

805
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,546
No.

806
01:06:37,399 --> 01:06:40,118
I cannot let that child die again.

807
01:06:42,404 --> 01:06:43,405
Excuse me.

808
01:06:43,405 --> 01:06:47,375
There was a woman
who bought a ton of something else.

809
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,145
Kang Ju Young.

810
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:01,757
Another victim who nearly became
Kim Sang Jin's third sacrifice,

811
01:07:01,757 --> 01:07:04,771
I know you are being blackmailed
by Kim Sang Jin.

812
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,993
but survived.

813
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:12,567
Kang Ju Young.

814
01:07:15,854 --> 01:07:17,189
I know everything.

815
01:07:17,189 --> 01:07:18,774
He threatened to kill your mother

816
01:07:18,774 --> 01:07:20,943
at the market and your nephew,

817
01:07:20,943 --> 01:07:23,445
so you had no choice but to go along with him.

818
01:07:23,445 --> 01:07:25,698
I am sorry. I am sorry.

819
01:07:25,698 --> 01:07:28,628
- I am sorry. I am sorry.
- Open the door.

820
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,934
I am sorry. I am sorry.

821
01:07:58,981 --> 01:08:05,988
I am sorry.

822
01:08:05,988 --> 01:08:09,324
It is okay.

823
01:08:09,324 --> 01:08:11,410
I should have died back then.

824
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:13,495
I should have died.

825
01:08:13,495 --> 01:08:15,797
It should have been me!

826
01:08:25,758 --> 01:08:27,009
What is going on? Are you okay?

827
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:28,761
Please save me.

828
01:08:28,761 --> 01:08:31,229
Just a moment.

829
01:08:45,444 --> 01:08:47,029
Judge.

830
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:49,698
Please sentence me to death.

831
01:08:49,698 --> 01:08:51,794
I need to die.

832
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,035
No.

833
01:08:53,035 --> 01:08:54,453
Why should you die?

834
01:08:54,453 --> 01:08:56,205
You said you would give him the death penalty,

835
01:08:56,205 --> 01:08:58,123
but you let him go.

836
01:08:58,123 --> 01:08:59,374
Why did you do that?

837
01:08:59,374 --> 01:09:01,926
Why did you lie? Why!

838
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:07,613
Now he is going to kill my mom and nephew.

839
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:10,643
I didn't lie.

840
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:14,807
I let him go to really catch him.

841
01:09:14,807 --> 01:09:17,059
Not as an attempted thief,

842
01:09:17,059 --> 01:09:19,360
but as a murderer.

843
01:09:20,562 --> 01:09:22,363
So,

844
01:09:25,234 --> 01:09:27,118
trust me.

845
01:09:34,743 --> 01:09:36,328
- Ye Na.
- Yes?

846
01:09:36,328 --> 01:09:37,246
- Let's go eat.
- Yes.

847
01:09:37,246 --> 01:09:39,714
- Where are you going?
- Come on, hurry.

848
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:56,731
He's at the playground right now.

849
01:09:58,183 --> 01:10:00,519
And I am stopping here.

850
01:10:00,519 --> 01:10:02,938
- The rest is...
- Arrest him right now.

851
01:10:02,938 --> 01:10:04,439
Seriously?

852
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:06,358
Are you out of your mind?

853
01:10:06,358 --> 01:10:07,860
On what charges can I arrest a man

854
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,362
eating snacks at a playground?

855
01:10:10,362 --> 01:10:12,281
- Did you not see the text I sent?
- I saw it.

856
01:10:12,281 --> 01:10:14,324
Kim Sang Jin is a serial killer?

857
01:10:14,324 --> 01:10:16,785
Do you still think that?

858
01:10:16,785 --> 01:10:20,171
Is there a girl wearing a duck character shirt
at the playground?

859
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:24,877
How did you...

860
01:10:24,877 --> 01:10:26,211
Where are you?

861
01:10:26,211 --> 01:10:28,380
Arrest that bastard right now.

862
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,515
Otherwise, that child will die.

863
01:10:34,303 --> 01:10:37,723
That is just ridiculous...

864
01:10:37,723 --> 01:10:39,607
nonsense...

865
01:10:42,728 --> 01:10:45,981
I answered his call.

866
01:10:45,981 --> 01:10:47,232
Do not worry.

867
01:10:47,232 --> 01:10:48,734
I will make sure

868
01:10:48,734 --> 01:10:51,369
he never calls you again.

869
01:10:56,992 --> 01:10:58,918
Did you catch him?

870
01:11:03,498 --> 01:11:05,250
He looked at something on his phone

871
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,752
and suddenly ran off.

872
01:11:06,752 --> 01:11:09,171
I am chasing him,
but is he really a serial killer?

873
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:11,340
You must not lose him.
Catch him no matter what.

874
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,141
All right.

875
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,076
There is a hidden camera here, right?

876
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,480
The doll.

877
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:26,104
I had forgotten.

878
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:27,731
That he openly installed a hidden camera

879
01:11:27,731 --> 01:11:31,026
to blackmail Kang Ju Young.

880
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:32,994
Where are you now?

881
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:41,184
There are some really high stairs
in front of me.

882
01:12:01,181 --> 01:12:02,641
What about now?

883
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:06,778
I reached the top and I'm on my way down.

884
01:12:09,314 --> 01:12:11,400
Do you know where that is?

885
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,486
He is going to kill my mom and nephew.

886
01:12:14,486 --> 01:12:16,405
Judge, please.

887
01:12:16,405 --> 01:12:17,823
I need to go to my mom.

888
01:12:17,823 --> 01:12:19,825
I need to go to my mom! Judge, please!

889
01:12:19,825 --> 01:12:20,742
I know.

890
01:12:20,742 --> 01:12:23,996
That is right. I am a judge.

891
01:12:23,996 --> 01:12:25,580
So,

892
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,250
let's put him on trial together.

893
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,886
So he can never touch your mom or nephew.

894
01:12:37,601 --> 01:12:40,111
Do you know which way leads to the top?

895
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,512
Repeat after me loudly.

896
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,849
To the murderer Kim Sang Jin.

897
01:13:20,093 --> 01:13:27,559
To the murderer Kim Sang Jin.

898
01:13:27,559 --> 01:13:31,146
Louder!

899
01:13:31,146 --> 01:13:33,065
To the murderer Kim Sang Jin.

900
01:13:33,065 --> 01:13:35,400
Louder!

901
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,736
To the murderer Kim Sang Jin.

902
01:13:37,736 --> 01:13:43,624
I sentence you to death!

903
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,787
Execute!

904
01:14:49,905 --> 01:14:52,690
- Is a judge allowed to act like this?
- A judge doesn't have to be nice.

905
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:55,296
Don't you know rulings stay on the record?

906
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:57,530
I heard there is
an interesting judge in Chungnam.

907
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:59,769
Find a case
and give it to Judge Lee Han Young.

908
01:14:59,769 --> 01:15:02,730
A bride-to-be died in a car accident.

909
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:04,360
At first, I thought it was a simple accident.

910
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,875
The problem is that
the beneficiary was designated.

911
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:09,949
Bring my daughter back to life!

912
01:15:09,949 --> 01:15:11,782
If you are a judge, do your job properly!

913
01:15:11,782 --> 01:15:13,250
Is he really the culprit?

914
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:16,045
He will be a flash in the pan without backing.

915
01:15:16,045 --> 01:15:19,480
Who exactly are you? Are you really a judge?
