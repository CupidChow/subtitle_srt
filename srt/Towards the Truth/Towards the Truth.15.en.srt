1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,480
Oh no!

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,560
No.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,680
Oh no!

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,320
What's wrong?

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,280
I...

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:21,960
He...

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
What's wrong with him?

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,200
He was hit.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,720
He hit me.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,960
Tell me.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,880
Hurry up.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,200
He gave a girl

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,920
to a little girl.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,280
to be a husband.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,040
Honey.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,960
Here.

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,800
Yuan Kan, look.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,400
This tea house belongs to our family.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,280
Do you remember?

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,720
This used to be a butcher alley.

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,640
I don't remember.

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,760
No.

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm not San Lang.

24
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,960
Yuan Kan, it's not me.

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,200
Yuan Kan.

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,280
You don't recognize me?

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,920
Are you abandoning me?

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,520
I don't.

29
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,360
No.

30
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,040
It's San Lang.

31
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,280
I didn't abandon you.

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,920
No.

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,720
Yuan Kan, you've been in the army for six years.

34
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,320
Wuniang waited so long.

35
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,560
Let's live a good life in the future.

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,640
Let's go.

37
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,400
Yuan Kan.

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,160
Sit here.

39
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,920
I'll make you some tea.

40
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,240
Our boss is not in a good place.

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,080
Hero, go!

42
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,039
Don't get entangled.

43
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,360
Take good care of her.

44
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,880
Where are you going?

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,200
Is he really a deserter

46
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,240
I really became a deserter.

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,440
and married a girl from the north.

48
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,680
Get back here!

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,039
Sir.

50
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,640
Yuan Kan is my husband.

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,880
It's my family business to hit him.

52
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,560
You have to take care of him too.

53
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,920
Zhi Xiang.

54
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,160
Here.

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:52,880
Chef.

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,960
You said you went back to the capital to find your wife.

57
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,320
Now you really found her.

58
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,720
What are you talking about?

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,680
What are you doing?

60
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,640
How can you call this trouble?

61
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,920
A reunion.

62
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,720
It's a happy day.

63
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,600
Gongsun is far away from you.

64
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,800
You know

65
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
your boss

66
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,160
mistook my brother

67
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,640
as her husband.

68
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,120
If I expose him now,

69
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,120
I'm afraid it will break your heart again.

70
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,440
In my opinion,

71
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,800
we should

72
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,200
let her be.

73
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,240
Since she knows nothing about Dinghe Camp,

74
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,680
you need to pay attention to it.

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,840
Let her be for now.

76
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,720
No.

77
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,240
This...

78
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
It doesn't make sense.

79
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,920
Mind your own business.

80
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,960
No mistake.

81
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,840
It's a good deed.

82
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,400
Don't go.

83
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,720
I...

84
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,600
Chef.

85
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,280
Serve the guests well.

86
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,560
Yuan Kan, come with me.

87
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,320
Yuan Kan.

88
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,840
Chef.

89
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,880
Gongsun Li.

90
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,640
Chef.

91
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,280
Yuan Kan.

92
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,440
Come.

93
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,200
Sit.

94
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
Sit down.

95
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,120
It was crowded outside just now.

96
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,200
I can't ask more.

97
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,320
Yuan Kan.

98
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,040
Why did you suddenly return to Kyoto?

99
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,720
Is it like what the people outside said?

100
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,760
You really deserted?

101
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,040
I am not a soldier.

102
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,520
What did you say?

103
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,440
No.

104
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,280
Actually...

105
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,960
Fine.

106
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,680
Now you don't even recognize the soldiers.

107
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,920
Have you forgotten what you told me?

108
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,280
The climate of Wuding River

109
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,720
is as cold as the Central Plain.

110
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,400
Since there's a war,

111
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,520
I can't sit back and watch.

112
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,960
Wuniang.

113
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,680
I've wasted your youth.

114
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
If you are willing to wait,

115
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,440
I'll return as a marquis.

116
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,760
When the country is in trouble,

117
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,800
Everyone is responsible.

118
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,600
You made me wait

119
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,760
You ruined my youth.

120
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,200
You fought at the front line.

121
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,440
I was scared every day.

122
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,840
I was afraid that you would die on the battlefield.

123
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,200
You wrote to me

124
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
that you brothers and colleagues

125
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,960
take care of each other.

126
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,840
We will win.

127
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Then why did you run away?

128
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,080
Do you know

129
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,840
If you run away,

130
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
your previous injury will be in vain.

131
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
Yuan Kan has such ambition.

132
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,040
how could he escape?

133
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,520
Thank you.

134
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,720
Is that crow neck gun

135
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,760
was the weapon used by Second Brother?

136
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
I saw that

137
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,159
there's a cocoon in his finger.

138
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,080
He must be an expert with guns.

139
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,440
Crow neck gun is the military system.

140
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
It's heavy.

141
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,560
Other soldiers can't do it.

142
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
Excuse me,

143
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,480
fought a war in Beiguan?

144
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,800
The manager said

145
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,800
that Yuan Kan is a soldier of the Dinghe River.

146
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,040
If you had fought in Beiguan,

147
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,880
maybe

148
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,840
he's also a soldier from Dinghe.

149
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,760
What's the relationship

150
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,120
with Yuan Kan?

151
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,360
Have you forgotten?

152
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,760
If you lose your ambition,

153
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,640
he'll be gone.

154
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,240
Yuan Kan, I hope you can live.

155
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,440
But...

156
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,440
Is this really living?

157
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,640
If you really become a deserter,

158
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,840
the imperial court will come and get you.

159
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,120
I...

160
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,680
I'll prepare some money for you.

161
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,680
No.

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,240
Where's the money?

163
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,720
Who are you?

164
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,760
Why are you in my room?

165
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I said I'm San Lang.

166
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
will you believe me?

167
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,600
Stop!

168
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,680
Stop!

169
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,240
Give me back San Lang's letter.

170
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,840
Zhi Buyan, catch him!

171
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,320
Chef.

172
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,120
Stop!

173
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,360
Yuan Kan, what did you do?

174
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
Tell me!

175
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,360
Thief!

176
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,440
I cut off an arm.

177
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,200
Remember to be a good man.

178
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,080
Okay.

179
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,440
Why are you

180
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Why are you still here?

181
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,120
I'm waiting to remove my arm.

182
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,360
No.

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,960
Let's go.

184
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,640
Let me fight him.

185
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,880
I'm not convinced.

186
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
I'm not convinced.

187
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,400
Okay, it hurts.

188
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm not convinced.

189
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,040
All right.

190
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,159
What did you find?

191
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,280
The manager is always bad.

192
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
He didn't say much.

193
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,200
But there's one thing.

194
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,360
Her third son

195
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,520
should be a good soldier.

196
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,480
How do you know?

197
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,159
Let's talk on the way.

198
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,880
Here.

199
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,400
Boss.

200
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,720
I've seen them before.

201
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,360
They are officials.

202
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
I thought Pang Ji would plead guilty soon.

203
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,520
With Wuniang's current situation,

204
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,800
to appeal.

205
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,960
There's no injustice in the river.

206
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,200
can make the people

207
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
about the rebels

208
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,840
about the rebels of Dinghe.

209
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,480
I didn't expect that the government would come.

210
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,200
He's a coward.

211
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,840
Coward.

212
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,640
Go out and scare them.

213
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,600
Don't let them ruin our plan.

214
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,440
Yes.

215
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,760
Originally,

216
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,560
I wanted to

217
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,640
to show you.

218
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,880
She suddenly came to her senses.

219
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,320
But according to her,

220
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,640
in her book,

221
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,080
in her book.

222
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,200
If Yuan Kan is a deserter,

223
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,680
I won't believe it.

224
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,159
Look at that.

225
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,600
Liu Wu'er.

226
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,600
How is she?

227
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,760
She doesn't remember the war in the northwest.

228
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,120
She even said Black Mountain.

229
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,280
In my opinion,

230
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,320
she only remembers what happened seven years ago.

231
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
Her memory

232
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,840
stopped seven years ago.

233
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,120
And that guy

234
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
named Ji Buyan.

235
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,240
What's wrong with him?

236
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,640
He doesn't look like a martial artist.

237
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,040
As I expected.

238
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
He should be...

239
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,640
Now I know.

240
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,800
He's San Lang.

241
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,520
What?

242
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,040
How could she not remember?

243
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,840
Move!

244
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
Run!

245
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,880
Give me back my paper man!

246
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,040
Give me back my paper man!

247
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,200
Stop!

248
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,920
Sir.

249
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,880
Give it to me.

250
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,600
Thank you for saving me.

251
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,080
It's just that...

252
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,680
destroyed a

253
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,160
a vivid paper strip.

254
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,400
It's so vivid.

255
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
You think so too?

256
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,640
I drew it

257
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,400
when I was young.

258
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,520
Right?

259
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,720
Yes.

260
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,200
Since you're here,

261
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,320
Let's go.

262
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,679
Let's have some hot tea at my place.

263
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,039
Let’s go.

264
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,200
Zhi Buyan just gave himself away at the tea house.

265
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
When we left the tea house,

266
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,560
someone tried to assassinate us.

267
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,040
What a coincidence.

268
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
What is this cup made of?

269
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,480
It's so white.

270
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,560
The fetus is also good.

271
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,600
A bone porcelain.

272
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,440
bone porcelain.

273
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,680
The ashes were burned.

274
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,480
Done.

275
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,120
All right.

276
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
You know Yellow Magic.

277
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,120
Before being a butler in the morgue,

278
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,640
I practiced medicine.

279
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,600
If someone dies, we can't treat him.

280
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,160
Change the plate.

281
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
A few days ago,

282
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I saw them put up a new menu and wrote meat cakes.

283
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,280
I saw it was a new dish.

284
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,720
I went in and ordered some.

285
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,800
And then?

286
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,840
The black face said he won’t sell me.

287
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,040
He said there was no such dish.

288
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,240
Fight the meat.

289
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,160
Sir.

290
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,520
It was the lunar day.

291
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
The day before.

292
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,720
I still remember

293
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
that night,

294
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,120
they had a lot of guests.

295
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,880
Lamb tongue.

296
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,640
Swallow the needle.

297
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,040
Grilled meat to release blood.

298
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,400
Fight and kill.

299
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,240
The three dishes in the teahouse

300
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,680
and these three cases.

301
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,360
So

302
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,880
this tea house is the base of Wuding Restaurant.

303
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,800
And these dishes

304
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,520
are the notification of their gathering.

305
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,080
I'll use crow-neck spear when I'm informed.

306
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,840
and interrogated him.

307
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,240
but he didn't answer.

308
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,360
He still protected Liu Wu'er.

309
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,720
The relatives of Yuan Kan.

310
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,040
The assassins outside the tea house

311
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,760
might be his doing.

312
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,240
Gongsun Li.

313
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,640
We might have touched the rat hole.

314
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,880
The person

315
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,440
is someone from the Wuding River.

316
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,720
Liu Wu'er's memory stopped seven years ago.

317
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,880
I'm afraid her third son

318
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
is also a soldier who died in a war.

319
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,040
who died in battle.

320
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
are still alive.

321
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,920
Those soldiers are still alive.

322
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,560
No.

323
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,320
I won't plead guilty.

324
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,440
I won't.

325
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,080
We've fought for six years.

326
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,560
when will it end?

327
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
It's me.

328
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,520
I earned peace at the border.

329
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,480
I did nothing wrong.

330
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,240
Minister.

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,960
Get lost!

332
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,840
Stop!

333
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,360
Is this something you can move?

334
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,960
What did he say to you?

335
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,440
A monster

336
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,120
asked me to give this to you.

337
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,320
If you

338
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,360
destroy the evidence

339
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,600
about him 13 years ago.

340
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,200
He will protect your life.

341
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,880
Chef Shen, you crazy dog.

342
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,720
I'll kill you sooner or later.

343
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,160
Minister, please.

344
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,560
You want to hurt Shen Shaodwen?

345
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,360
If he keeps investigating,

346
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,760
sooner or later,

347
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,840
the Wuding River Camp sooner or later.

348
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,040
I still have it at home.

349
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
Mother wants...

350
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,600
to stop the war.

351
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,640
Are you threatening me?

352
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,360
I dare not.

353
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,480
You didn't know about

354
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,800
what happened in the northern Pass.

355
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,080
You should know that

356
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,960
I can't do anything

357
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,720
to sacrifice Wu Dinghe Camp.

358
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,680
Only 500 people

359
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,280
for peace.

360
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,880
It's worth it.

361
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,080
But now,

362
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
the sky has changed.

363
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,400
When His Majesty grows up,

364
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,440
we need to settle it in the front.

365
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,080
So?

366
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,400
promoted a chef

367
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,440
to the top.

368
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,600
The cunning hare will die and the dog will be cooked.

369
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,680
Mother.

370
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,360
The higher-ups...

371
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,600
You and I should stand in the same position.

372
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,080
If you want to threaten me,

373
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,520
I

374
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,040
I should answer the question

375
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,920
13 years ago.

376
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,440
Wuding River died in the army.

377
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,120
The emperor died 13 years ago.

378
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,760
The whole family of the close minister Shen Shaodwen.

379
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,560
Pang Ji.

380
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,680
You asked me to kill

381
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,880
who escaped from the barracks to Shen Village.

382
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,920
Even if you don't admit it,

383
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,400
the previous dynasties in the palace

384
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,280
regard me as one of your people.

385
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,520
I work for you.

386
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,880
After Shen Shaodwen died,

387
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,400
I can take a high pillow.

388
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,160
You can also have a high pillow.

389
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,640
I'm really old.

390
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,080
Even you

391
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,920
show your teeth in front of me?

392
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,680
I spoke without thinking.

393
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,400
Please punish me.

394
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
His Majesty values Shen Shaodwen.

395
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,040
If you plot against him,

396
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,040
I'm afraid he'll be in trouble.

397
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,560
Don't worry, Mother.

398
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,120
How clean do you want, Mother?

399
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,720
I can

400
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,880
can be wiped clean.

401
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,120
Your people

402
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,400
just a dog

403
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,040
for 13 years.

404
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,320
It's his blessing

405
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,240
It's his blessing.

406
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,360
Okay.

407
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,520
Pangji.

408
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,680
Your heart

409
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,200
is cruel enough.

410
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,280
I was raised

411
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,560
I was trained by you.

412
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,520
Thank you for your education.

413
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,160
You've crossed the line.

414
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,440
It's just

415
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,880
for 17 years.

416
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,280
It's his blessing

417
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,440
is his blessing.

418
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,120
Chef.

419
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,040
Pang Ji is not right, right?

420
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,280
You mean

421
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,240
he suddenly stopped being anxious?

422
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,880
We've been watching Pang Ji.

423
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,640
We found that he was in a panic.

424
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,200
and wanted to plead guilty.

425
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,920
But somehow,

426
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,040
after entering the palace today,

427
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,200
after entering the palace today.

428
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,080
Entering the palace?

429
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,600
Did you see His Majesty?

430
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,440
Guo Huaiwei's door

431
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,600
seems to be going to Ci Ning Palace.

432
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,960
Mother has been relying on the Pang family for many years.

433
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,240
The only thing she can ask for now

434
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,120
is Ci Ning Palace.

435
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,880
I'm thirsty.

436
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Why are you back?

437
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,120
I told you to watch.

438
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,320
What are you looking at?

439
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,400
When Pang came back from the palace,

440
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,760
he went to Qinxiang Pavilion

441
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,240
and had tea with those officials.

442
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,160
I seem to have forgotten that silly son.

443
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,960
Stop spinning.

444
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,240
Isn't it strange?

445
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,440
If what you said is true,

446
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,440
the soldiers in the Dunghe Camp

447
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,960
was wrongfully killed by him.

448
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,120
Now he's forcing him with his son's life.

449
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,840
How could he have the mood to drink tea?

450
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,040
Why is he suddenly calm?

451
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,920
Chef

452
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,520
Chef

453
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,120
Chef

454
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,880
What's wrong, chef?

455
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,400
Don't use heavy eyes.

456
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,320
Chef.

457
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,560
Mr. Pang is not in a hurry.

458
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,600
but you were so worried.

459
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,200
Chef.

460
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,800
Look at me.

461
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,520
Wuding River Camp.

462
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,840
Wuding Building.

463
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,160
Chef.

464
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Pang family?

465
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,920
Pang Ji was in the Ministry of War.

466
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,400
He was the one who suggested peace.

467
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,040
Wu Dinghe Camp rebelled.

468
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,400
The army is dispersed.

469
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,080
Wuding River.

470
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,360
Do you remember anything?

471
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Chen Xiuqian.

472
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,240
In Chen Xian's letter,

473
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,120
mentioned Wuding Pavilion.

474
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,280
in Wuding Pavilion.

475
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,040
I'm guilty.

476
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,840
Innocent!

477
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,400
What is Pangji thinking?

478
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,760
I want to see.

479
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,320
Let's go.

480
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,320
Don't.

481
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,200
Let me try.

482
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,960
I told him not to use it.

483
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,920
He insisted.

484
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
What should we do?

485
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,240
There's no human form.

486
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,360
Stop!

487
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,440
Chef!

488
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,680
Chef, are you okay?

489
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,680
Chef

490
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,960
Done.

491
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,720
Mr. Han,

492
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,800
You still have one eye in your eyes.

493
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,480
Why are you here?

494
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,400
You left in a hurry.

495
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
I didn't have time to ask.

496
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
What's the name of the poison?

497
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,640
Do you know it?

498
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,560
I don't know

499
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,680
I don't understand.

500
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,040
I feel itchy.

501
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
This poison is called Miss Ghost.

502
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,120
The poison in the Western Region

503
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,320
There's no poison in the Central Plain.

504
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,440
Miss Ghost.

505
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,480
But Mr. Han,

506
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,800
how do you know the chef's heavy pupils

507
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,240
can be controlled by a ruler?

508
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,480
It has nothing to do with the ruler.

509
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,880
It's the yang part of the upper arm.

510
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,720
It should be thanks to

511
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,120
his strange eyes

512
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,200
causing his Yin pulse to suppress the Yang meridians.

513
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,960
I hit his upper arm

514
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,720
to activate his Yang vein.

515
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,080
That's why he came to his senses.

516
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,040
In that case,

517
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,760
we can use this ruler

518
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,720
to suppress his heavy pupils.

519
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,520
In your dreams.

520
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,040
The Yin vein has suppressed the Yang vein.

521
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,240
Our method can't cure the root.

522
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,640
If you want to remove the root,

523
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,720
try my prescription.

524
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,520
You mean

525
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,240
you know how to cure

526
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,360
to cure my eyes.

527
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,440
I might as well give it a try.

528
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,720
Forget it.

529
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,200
It's okay.

530
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,640
I came here for a cup of good tea.

531
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,200
and found out the name of the ghost girl.

532
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,880
Goodbye.

533
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,920
Mr. Han did help us a lot.

534
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,920
But your heavy pupils...

535
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,440
We tried so many doctors

536
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,480
but failed to cure them.

537
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,520
You gave your life

538
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,720
to such a person.

539
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,360
with such a person.

540
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,440
Anyway,

541
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,760
you know how to

542
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,960
to suppress my heavy pupils.

543
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,320
When this matter is settled,

544
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,200
after this.

545
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
I suddenly thought that

546
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,960
if Pang Yu is not in the hands of the enemy,

547
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,800
Pangji wouldn't have become fearless.

548
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,160
There must be something wrong with Wuding Pavilion.

549
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,440
Zhan Mao'er, hurry up.

550
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,120
Send a letter.

551
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,240
Tell Zhi Buyan that Pangji is abnormal.

552
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,040
Tell them to wait for me.

553
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,520
We must convince them.

554
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,360
Hand over Pang Yu.

555
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,040
Okay.

556
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,040
It's okay.

557
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,160
Where is the menu?

558
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,680
He's gone.

559
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,560
The thing is gone.

560
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
No signs of fighting.

561
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,840
They probably moved away overnight.

562
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,600
Wuding Pavilion was frightened and scattered.

563
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,360
and couldn't get information about the Pang family.

564
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,040
If Pang Ji really has a backup plan,

565
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
I'm afraid the lives of these soldiers

566
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,120
will be killed.

567
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,320
We've been investigating from Hell Music until now.

568
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,520
this tea house is the only clue.

569
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,320
If they really disappear,

570
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,480
it will be hard

571
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,880
to find them.

572
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,800
Pang Ji hasn't confessed yet.

573
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,040
If we miss this day,

574
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,360
If Wuding Pavilion wants to seize the chance again,

575
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,160
to reveal the truth

576
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,280
of Wu Dinghe Camp

577
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,200
to reveal the truth.

578
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,800
I've been hiding for seven years.

579
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,800
I finally got a chance.

580
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,360
If this is done hastily,

581
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,440
I won't be willing.

582
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,320
If Pang Ji refuses to plead guilty today,

583
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,560
in order to clear his name,

584
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm afraid he'll do something even weirder.

585
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,160
By then,

586
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,400
those innocent people from Wuding Building

587
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,880
will become real sinners.

588
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,600
You just said

589
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,040
we only have one clue.

590
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,840
Yes.

591
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,240
Anything else?

592
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,960
Don't forget.

593
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,080
Wuding Restaurant receives

594
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,560
The prayers and curse of the owner

595
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,720
are in the temple.

596
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,360
You mean

597
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,920
we're going to the Yin Temple to guard?

598
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,480
We can't wait.

599
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,880
I want them to see me.

600
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,800
What are you doing?

601
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,760
Go find Mr. Han.

602
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,520
Tell him

603
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,200
my heavy pupil can't make any more mistakes.

604
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,200
He needs treatment now.

605
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,320
Why are you looking for him now?

606
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,640
Just go.

607
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,480
I have my own plan.

608
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Trust me.

609
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,160
Okay.

610
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,240
I'll go if you say so.

611
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,960
Bring Cat Zhan with you.

612
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,200
Why should I go?

613
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,840
I'm afraid you'll be rude.

614
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,040
Don't worry.

615
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,480
What's the hurry?

616
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,240
Hurry up, Mr. Han.

617
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,440
Let me carry you.

618
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,400
We can't make any more mistakes during the investigation.

619
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,120
The disease comes like a mountain.

620
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,240
The chef can't wait.

621
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,960
Can you slow down

622
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,280
Wait.

623
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,480
No.

624
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,640
I don't need to carry it.

625
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,600
Hurry up.

626
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,760
Hurry up.

627
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,280
Hurry

628
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,040
Chef.

629
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,360
Qin.

630
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,240
Qin.

631
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,760
I'll kill you!

632
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,640
Chef.

633
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,920
You're awake.

634
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,280
Have some water.

635
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,240
Where is Qin?

636
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,800
How dare you ask?

637
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,920
Qin is so powerful.

638
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,680
If it weren't for you,

639
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,800
he wouldn't have bled so much.

640
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,160
Zhan Mao took him to the hospital.

641
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,960
The heavy pupil is having a seizure again.

642
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,040
I don't remember at all.

643
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Drink the water first.

644
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,240
I'll go check on Qin.

645
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,200
Save it.

646
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,880
If we hadn't found Mr. Han,

647
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
I’m afraid you’ll make a bigger trouble.

648
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,160
I'll prepare the medicine.

649
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,680
and send someone to pick it up on time.

650
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,160
Thank you, Mr. Han.

651
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,320
I've been avoiding doctors.

652
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
and offended you.

653
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
It's not too late.

654
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,920
Gongsun Li, help me get the medicine.

655
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,680
Mr. Han, please come with me.

656
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,480
Sir, this...

657
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,600
Someone reported

658
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,840
Lord Shen assaulted an innocent woman.

659
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,400
Li Qin.

660
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,360
My lord doesn't want to take care of it.

661
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,520
But Zhan Mao

662
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,400
beat the drum of grievance.

663
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,840
The people heard it.

664
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,200
We have to catch him.

665
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,160
My friend Shen Songwen

666
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,760
was wrongly imprisoned.

667
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,120
and trapped in the Six Princes of the T-subsidiaries.

668
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,920
Please help me.

669
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,280
Criminal Shen Song

670
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,440
Zhan Mao'er accused you of being ungrateful.

671
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,480
and injured Li Qin.

672
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,400
Do you plead guilty?

673
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,160
No.

674
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,840
I’m innocent.

675
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,640
How dare you say you’re innocent in hell?

676
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Crazy!

677
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,640
Check the life and death book.

678
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,840
if his life has passed.

679
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,120
Good and evil will be punished by God.

680
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,480
Sinner, put the pot in the pot.

681
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,920
Put it in the pot!

682
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,760
Put it in the pot.

683
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,480
Put it in the pot.

684
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,600
The division of work in Wuding Pavilion is clear.

685
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,120
Someone is responsible for hijacking people from prison.

686
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,480
Someone is responsible.

687
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,560
to play the show in the temple.

688
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Someone must

689
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,080
to find out the truth of the case.

690
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,960
You found out that Qin and I

691
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,680
was just a show.

692
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,160
So...

693
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,320
Innocent.

694
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,360
In this oil pot,

695
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,120
you only put an innocent brand.

696
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,240
As for the boiling oil,

697
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,720
When the vinegar is boiled, it's just warm water.

698
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,600
The oil is overflowing

699
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,880
The smell of vinegar

700
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
will not

701
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,920
a trick of deceiving people.

702
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,400
Come out if you know anything.

703
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,880
Leave us.

704
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,920
Yes.

705
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,280
I knew you were not in prison.

706
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,880
I knew you wanted to see me.

707
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,440
Officer Shen,

708
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,440
Since you've found out about me,

709
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,160
I knew I couldn't hide it from you.

710
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,320
or hide from you.

711
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,840
Now that you're here,

712
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,440
I only have one word.

713
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,720
What's your position?

714
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,520
Know Buyan.

715
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,920
I want to save you.

716
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,200
to save the entire Wuding River Camp.

717
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,520
I've investigated the cases you're involved in.

718
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
You saved innocent people.

719
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,400
I know you are not

720
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
evil people.

721
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,080
These three songs murders

722
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,880
all the crimes

723
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,240
are all evils.

724
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,120
Seven years ago,

725
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,440
Pang Ji framed Wu Dinghe Camp for rebellion.

726
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,520
and made 500 soldiers

727
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,720
become a traitor despised by everyone.

728
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,560
So you hid your identities

729
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,640
in the martial world

730
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,320
and transform into the Tower.

731
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,560
You captured Pang Yu

732
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,160
to force Pang Ji to plead guilty.

733
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,320
right?

734
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,320
Know Buyan.

735
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,280
Give Pang Yu to me.

736
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,200
I'll give you what you want.

737
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,320
How arrogant!

738
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,600
Shen Qingtian,

739
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,680
What can you give us?

740
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,400
The injustice is clear.

741
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,800
You're well-known.

742
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,080
I swear

743
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,720
I will make you

744
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,480
your names.

745
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,680
and live

746
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,080
live under the sun.

747
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,760
Under the sun?

748
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,960
Officer Shen,

749
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,120
If you come to save Wu Dinghe Camp,

750
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,440
you're too late.

751
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,520
The Wuhe Camp

752
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,040
has already become the withered bones of Black Mountain.

753
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,040
In the battle of Heishan,

754
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,360
Wuhe Camp.

755
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,160
499 soldiers

756
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,880
died for the country.

757
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,880
This war has never been recorded.

758
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,920
Just because General Pang Ji's marching map

759
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,560
to the barbarian.

760
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,400
He used our 500 brothers' lives

761
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,600
to complete the peace talk.

762
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,280
and made his way to promotion.

763
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,200
After that,

764
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,560
all these comrades who died for the country

765
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,200
were all deserted.

766
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,080
And only one

767
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,680
is one man.

768
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,720
Officer Shen,

769
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,440
The one standing in front of you

770
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,120
is the Dunghe Camp.

771
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,600
in the Dunghe Camp.

772
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
And this loneliness

773
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,200
wandering in the world of the world.

774
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,880
It's just because this matter is gone.

775
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,720
Officer Shen,

776
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,200
I know you're a good person.

777
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,920
But if you stop me today,

778
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,200
I have to take you down.

779
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,520
There's a mole.

780
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,920
Impossible.

781
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,480
There must be a mole.

782
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,280
Know Buyan.

783
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,880
I thought

784
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,080
I thought that Wuding Building has strict discipline.

785
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,800
and invincible.

786
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,240
That's because I became a pavilion.

787
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,560
is the Wuding River Camp.

788
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,320
You are enemies.

789
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,360
Of course you're loyal.

790
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,920
But now you tell me

791
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,880
Wuding Pavilion is a temporary gathering.

792
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,400
Keep your mouth shut.

793
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
You hate Pang Ji.

794
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,680
Others may collude with the Pang family.

795
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,160
Are you sure

796
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,560
everyone is loyal to you.

797
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,760
Wuding Building comes from the innocence.

798
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,920
I saved them myself.

799
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,920
It’s impossible to betray Wuding Building.

800
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,560
You are the army.

801
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,040
You think the whole army is united.

802
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,120
But those innocent sins

803
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,320
are not necessarily the same.

804
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,680
Pang Ji was threatened by you

805
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
due to your threat.

806
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,200
But he suddenly stopped panicking these days.

807
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,680
Now it seems

808
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,480
there must be a mole.

809
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,040
Know Buyan.

810
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,960
Stop hesitating.

811
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,880
You know who I am.

812
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,040
You know I want to

813
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,520
to bring Pang Ji to justice.

814
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,600
Give Pang Yu to me.

815
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
There's no injustice in Dinghe Camp.

816
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,480
Let me help you.

817
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,120
Okay.

818
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,199
Please don't let me down.

819
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,639
Bad news!

820
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,719
Go ahead.

821
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,840
Pang Yu is missing.

822
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,480
But the person Wu was looking at

823
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,480
The fifth person stabbed someone in the chest.

824
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,480
Now...

825
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,159
chest.

826
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,280
Yes.

827
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,120
You must be familiar

828
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,880
must be familiar.

829
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,920
The mole has taken action.

830
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:43,920
Zhi Buyan.

831
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,040
block all carriages to the Pang family.

832
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,280
I hope it's not too late.

833
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,639
Go!

834
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,280
Yes.

835
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,400
Chef.

836
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,720
How is it?

837
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,040
I found it.

838
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,680
Look.

839
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,760
I've asked someone to examine it.

840
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,120
There is a ghost girl

841
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,360
in the medicine Mr. Han prescribed for you.

842
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,920
Here.

843
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,520
He really wanted to hurt me.

844
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
But when he helped you,

845
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,920
he did his best.

846
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,480
How did you suspect him?

847
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,200
With that face,

848
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,240
almost let my guard down.

849
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,760
and helped me investigate cases several times.

850
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,560
and made me believe him gradually.

851
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,360
He treated Zhan Mao'er

852
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,760
and forced my heavy pupils away with a ruler.

853
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,360
just to make me believe

854
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,320
he knows Yellow Magic.

855
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,160
He can cure me.

856
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:46,920
So,

857
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,920
I asked Qin

858
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,080
to act for him.

859
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,160
I want you to pretend to be hurt by me.

860
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,080
When Zhan Mao'er comes back,

861
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,040
let him report to the government.

862
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,120
and let Peng Hyo-yu catch me.

863
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,440
After I go to prison,

864
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,800
Gongsun Li will cooperate with me

865
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,760
to persuade Zhi Buyan to hand over Pang Yu.

866
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,800
And you and Zhan Mao'er go to the countryside

867
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,480
to see Li's grave.

868
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,400
Was it passive?

869
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,040
If you did, open the coffin and examine the body.

870
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,360
Let go of me!

871
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,680
Get down!

872
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,040
But since we found out that

873
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,560
Wu Ding Pavilion was disguised.

874
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,280
Chen Xiuqian once told us

875
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,120
that Wuding Pavilion has a reform technique.

876
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,680
I started to suspect him.

877
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,480
That face...

878
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
That's almost Lee's face.

879
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,840
But his face

880
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
is different from Li's face.

881
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,960
That mole

882
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,040
was the mole that made me suspicious.

883
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,800
Now that I think about it,

884
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,800
it wasn't just a regular spot.

885
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,400
It's a mortar.

886
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Corpse spots?

887
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,640
If he's from Wuding Pavilion,

888
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,920
he can approach us at will.

889
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,120
I think he's relatively free.

890
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,480
It's quite high in the building.

891
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,280
I met Yeomra

892
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,800
I met Yeomra.

893
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,800
and the ghost police.

894
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,960
But in my opinion,

895
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,320
someone important is missing.

896
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,560
Sir.

897
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,960
When the people of Wuding Pavilion gathered at the Yin Temple,

898
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
he was not there.

899
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,120
Pang Yu was taken away.

900
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,640
So he is the judge

901
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,920
and the mole who stole Pang Yu.

902
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,240
How can we prove it?

903
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Soon.

904
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,360
Chef.

905
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,360
Are you okay?

906
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,440
Are you okay?

907
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,720
Chef.

908
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
You guessed right.

909
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,160
Li's grave

910
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,560
was indeed moved.

911
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,520
Uncle opened the coffin for us.

912
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,760
I found Li.

913
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,280
Li.

914
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,320
Li is shameless.

915
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,320
What?

916
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,120
Chef.

917
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,640
In order to get close to us,

918
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,200
to get close to us.

919
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,880
and made Li suffer again.

920
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,640
He died without a full body.

921
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,280
But if he just

922
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,480
hiding in Wuding Pavilion

923
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
to save Pang Yu.

924
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,600
Why would he approach you?

925
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,920
I'm just beating around the bush.

926
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,200
So,

927
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,640
there must be something I don’t know.

928
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,680
Mr. Han's real purpose.

929
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,600
Who is it?

930
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,400
Mr. Han is the judge.

931
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,760
He is the mole in Wuting Building.

932
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,800
We failed to stop

933
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,920
to the Pang family.

934
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,600
But the number of people in Wuding Building

935
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,040
except him.

936
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,840
I'm sure it's him.

937
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,400
Have you seen the morgue?

938
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,400
People are gone.

939
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:48,960
He left.

940
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,360
I left you a letter.

941
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,760
The letter is yours.

942
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,320
I'll continue to track down the traitor.

943
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,520
I’ll leave you alone.

944
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,560
Shen Shaodwen,

945
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,280
It’s said that you’re observant.

946
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,320
for decades.

947
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
You did well.

948
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,240
I gave you your heavy pupils.

949
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,080
But you are as blind

950
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,800
and didn't recognize me.

951
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,480
and see if anyone is alive.

952
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,120
Don't let anyone escape.

953
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,880
Okay.

954
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,280
Look at you.

955
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,440
You have beautiful eyes.

956
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,360
Let go of me!

957
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,360
I'll give you an evil eye.

958
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,440
If you succeed,

959
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,760
it will be my other hand.

960
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,120
If not,

961
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,480
you can only say that you're unlucky.

962
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,600
No!

963
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Let go of me!

964
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,480
I want your eyes.

965
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,360
Let go of me!

966
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,760
Now,

967
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,440
you must have recognized me

968
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,880
through Li's face.

969
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,360
You haven't remembered everything.

970
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,880
right?

971
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,720
I'll tell you when you see me.

972
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,720
Remember to come alone.

973
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,680
Otherwise,

974
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,480
I'll kill you alone.

975
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,240
I asked someone

976
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,480
with high-quality iron.

977
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,600
It contains my heart.

978
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,120
Your name is engraved on it.

979
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,120
When you feel relaxed,

980
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,320
hold it tightly.

981
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,200
The pain will wake you up.

982
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,880
Chef Shen came to search before.

983
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,920
Now you're here too.

984
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,360
Are you trying to bully me?

985
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,840
No.

986
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,680
We've searched everywhere.

987
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,240
If we search again,

988
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,280
to search again.

989
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,240
Nonsense!

990
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,760
Peng Xiaoyu.

991
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,640
My son was kidnapped

992
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,720
in the prison of the government.

993
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,960
I haven't complained about you in front of His Majesty.

994
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Now you're here.

995
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,080
Fine.

996
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,400
Come with me to see His Majesty.

997
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,160
No.

998
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,360
Sir.

999
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,720
We need to find him when he's missing.

1000
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,920
Go ahead.

1001
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,760
You're blocking us from entering.

1002
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,360
If it falls into the eyes of others,

1003
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
I feel guilty.

1004
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,320
You...

1005
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,960
No.

1006
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,960
The informant said

1007
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,400
your son has returned to Pang Mansion.

1008
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,560
If it's wrong,

1009
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,440
you can take me

1010
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,400
with me.

1011
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,280
An informant?

1012
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,640
Who is the informant?

1013
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,440
I am

1014
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,120
It's me.

1015
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,160
Look.

1016
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,720
The son of Minister of Revenue

1017
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,080
How could he make things up?

1018
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,840
It doesn't make sense

1019
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,120
It doesn't make sense.

1020
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,120
Minister, bad news.

1021
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,440
Minister, Young Master...

1022
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,320
Say it.

1023
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,040
He killed himself with a white ribbon.

1024
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,880
