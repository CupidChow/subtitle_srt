1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,760
It's cold. Who's there? Who's there?

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,440
Who is it?

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,360
Wealth is good.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,200
Good morning.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,360
When will the long-lasting world be?

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,120
Happy

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,120
You're heartless.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,120
The vanity is like a dream

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,280
and live a carefree life.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,360
Wrong.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
The camp is good.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,520
Good morning.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,320
Everything in the world is fleeting.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,480
The east wind is weak.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,720
The spring flowers fall

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,680
Evil thoughts rest

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
Cause and effect are inevitable.

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,600
Momo.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,360
Miss.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,440
It's already midnight.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,480
Let's go home.

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,560
Miss.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,120
Ghost.

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,160
Ghost!

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,880
Help me!

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,440
Help me.

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,720
Help...

29
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,000
Help!

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,320
The so-called Ten-yuan Soup

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,880
use stone ear, stone hair, stone wire,

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,240
Seaweed seaweed, deer horn, fat

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,320
Celestial scale, sandfish, sea eel white, Shi Jiming.

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
Shrimp Sauce and other 10 delicacies.

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,800
and

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,120
Chicken, duck, sheep, quail,

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,800
Definitely, shrimp, whale.

38
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,360
and soak the soup.

39
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,520
Done.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,320
Put it in the box.

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,440
Okay.

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,680
Spinach.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,280
squeeze out green juice.

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,960
and noodles.

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,720
Steam the carrots

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,880
Making a lotus

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,960
Okay.

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,600
Uncle.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
Nanke Restaurant gave me a few riddles.

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,440
Seven sentences.

51
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,800
The last phrase is golden on the ground.

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,440
Make it sweet and sour

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,560
The last dish is for customers to digest.

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,280
These girls from Nanke Restaurant

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,840
are really elegant.

56
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,040
Set a banquet

57
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,480
He even asked us to guess.

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,840
Nanke Restaurant only opens once a month.

59
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,760
I heard that Ms Liu Qin is beautiful and modern.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,120
What a grand scene.

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,160
Noble ladies

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
you're just being tricky.

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,160
She knows how to do business.

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,000
Chef.

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Chef

66
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,560
Help me

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Here.

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,360
This lantern house

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,840
in the lantern house.

70
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
Help me cut it.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,160
Go find the murderer if someone dies.

72
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,880
Why are you arresting me?

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,440
No.

74
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
Don't go.

75
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,520
Three years ago,

76
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,760
if I hadn't picked you up from the street

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,520
to my uncle,

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,200
you would have been drunk to death.

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,400
I saved your life.

80
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,480
If you don't help me,

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,280
I can't.

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
Who is he?

83
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,600
Help!

84
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,560
My baby!

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,320
Don't kill me!

86
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,320
No!

87
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,279
No!

88
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,840
Shen Song.

89
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,080
You’re here.

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
How did I get in this time?

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,200
The power of the heavy pupil...

92
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,600
can't be controlled by you.

93
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,240
I can't control you

94
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,360
Do you feel it?

95
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,080
The night watchman was burned to death.

96
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,159
It takes at least an hour.

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
It's like he's being restrained.

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,920
and lost his soul.

99
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,040
It smells pungent.

100
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,160
It's getting stronger.

101
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,840
This is the smell of a corpse.

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,200
Do you see the Hammer on the pillar?

103
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
It's the key.

104
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,080
Pull it out.

105
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,960
you'll see the truth.

106
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,400
Pull out the key.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
The truth is revealed.

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,560
Come out.

109
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
Chef.

110
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,360
Protect Lord Peng.

111
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,200
Nanke Building.

112
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,120
Have a look.

113
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,120
Take a look.

114
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,800
Sir.

115
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,120
The competition of poetry and literature

116
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
is about to begin.

117
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,240
Let's go.

118
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,600
Look at what you wrote.

119
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,200
With these poems,

120
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,240
with these poems?

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,040
What my young master did...

122
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,560
for Qin'er.

123
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,720
It's been a long time since someone filled this one.

124
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,840
Please allow me to give it to you.

125
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,480
Wait.

126
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,280
Who is your young master?

127
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,440
I'll buy the word.

128
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,880
You're not qualified to buy my poem.

129
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,440
Lu Laoer,

130
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,680
Aren't you afraid that

131
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,360
you'll go bankrupt?

132
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,080
Gongsun Li.

133
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Since the opening of Nanke Building,

134
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,560
the competition will be held on January 1 in three years.

135
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,920
I've been waiting for the competition of Shiwen.

136
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,000
With me here,

137
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,440
no one can go upstairs.

138
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,800
This...

139
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,520
You...

140
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,560
Wait.

141
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,320
Shen Song, cook of Fengle Restaurant, comes to deliver the eighth dish.

142
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,760
is not as red as roses.

143
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,880
The Eight Treasures Banquet. It's ready.

144
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,200
All here.

145
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,880
By the way, I want to see your master.

146
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,280
Qin.

147
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,720
You?

148
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,040
Mr. Shen, please go upstairs with me.

149
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,960
Why?

151
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,520
I want to play poems with him.

152
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,120
I'm just a cook.

153
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
That's why I'm not convinced.

154
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,120
The two of you fought together.

155
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,400
You have one hour.

156
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,159
No need.

157
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,679
Half an hour is enough.

158
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,720
How arrogant!

159
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Listen up.

160
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,040
Yutang Poetry Contest

161
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,800
Bury dead bodies downstairs.

162
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
What kind of poem is this?

163
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,120
None of your business.

164
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,040
Thousands of households sing a song.

165
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,840
It's your turn.

166
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
You Lan is crying in grief.

167
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,680
[Bear to exchange the fish eye for the pearl.]

168
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,160
Gold and jade are defeated.

169
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,360
How can the Zhumen see the snow?

170
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
How can there be snow at Zhu door?

171
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,080
Your Highness.

172
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,280
You lost.

173
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,760
Thank you.

174
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,480
There is no snow at the Zhu Gate.

175
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
Shen Song, the cook of Feng Le Restaurant.

176
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,680
Not easy.

177
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,840
Please.

178
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,240
The weight of gold is not right.

179
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,400
This orchid leaf

180
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,040
Something is wrong.

181
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,920
Enough.

182
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,160
Sir.

183
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,280
I was in a hurry.

184
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
I was bewitched

185
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,360
I was bewitched by a bell.

186
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,760
When I went up,

187
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,080
I saw the golden house again.

188
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,440
and Yan Ruyu.

189
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,560
It must be your bell.

190
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,120
I've heard of a rumor.

191
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,960
There is a magic in the East Sea.

192
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,520
It's used to make people possessed.

193
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,280
The caster can make people hallucinate or fall in memories.

194
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,680
The watchman pointed at the back window of Nano Building

195
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,240
and reached out in the fire.

196
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,760
or asking for help.

197
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,720
or testifying the murderer.

198
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,880
So the death of the watchman must be related to you.

199
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,400
Besides, you were spying on me upstairs.

200
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,880
I think you want to observe my skills.

201
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,520
How did you know that?

202
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,200
Your heavy pupil has the ability to peep.

203
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,480
can find clues in detail.

204
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,600
The day the bones are exposed to the world,

205
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
the government may not dare to investigate.

206
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,000
Although your heavy pupil

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,200
after using them.

208
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,760
But it's still a vote.

209
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
Since you are so capable,

210
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,320
why don't you find out the truth

211
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,160
and clear their name?

212
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,280
I'm just a cook.

213
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,080
I'm not that capable.

214
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,080
There's no reason to be alone in this world.

215
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,720
If the government is so foolish,

216
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,760
the people in the capital would have died.

217
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,920
You know the victims are from the capital.

218
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,400
You tricked me.

219
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,760
Investigate it if you want.

220
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,160
What if I don't?

221
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,200
You can try

222
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,520
to be disobedient.

223
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,440
How can the Zhumen see the snow?

224
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,200
Going out again?

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,320
I told you

226
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,880
there are female fairies there.

227
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,360
Sooner or later, they'll suck you into pieces.

228
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,240
Father.

229
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,800
I told you

230
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,800
females have good qualities.

231
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
You're old.

232
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,000
I can't play anymore.

233
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,640
Don't talk about me.

234
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,520
Okay.

235
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,840
Okay.

236
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,200
Chiyu

237
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,480
Play by yourself for a while.

238
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,560
I'll kill you.

239
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,480
Father!

240
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,960
Father!

241
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,280
Father.

242
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm old, right?

243
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,800
I'll kill you.

244
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,600
Siyu is the legitimate son of the Gongsun family.

245
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,680
I'm old, right?

246
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,120
I...

247
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,560
Master.

248
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,240
You're from the Mortal Realm.

249
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,200
You can't hit him.

250
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,960
What a literature star!

251
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,480
has long been dismissed by a decree.

252
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,440
It's good that you can't beat him to death.

253
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,320
Don't get into trouble.

254
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
I'll support him for the rest of his life.

255
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,120
Father.

256
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
It’s enough that one of us can make it.

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm the God of Wealth in the Ministry of Revenue.

258
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,960
What am I afraid of?

259
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,760
You...

260
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,560
Master.

261
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,160
Calm down.

262
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,920
Calm down.

263
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,040
What do you know?

264
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,560
Calm down.

265
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,800
The lantern house that His Majesty built for Mother's birthday

266
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,920
was burned last night.

267
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,400
dozens of bones were dug out.

268
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,040
Everyone in the court

269
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,160
in the imperial court.

270
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,040
Father.

271
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,360
The doors and buildings are built by chi.

272
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,120
The silver is from the Ministry of Revenue.

273
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
The Court of Judicial Review is here to check on the Ministry of Revenue.

274
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,240
The Municipal Council built the building.

275
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,680
It's just that the money was withdrawn from the Ministry of Revenue.

276
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,840
Besides, there are many suspense cases.

277
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,960
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival now.

278
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,720
Due to your dignity and dignity,

279
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,440
the magistrate of Kaifeng

280
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,960
of Kaifeng Prefecture.

281
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,080
Don't go out too often these days.

282
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,680
We can't count on Peng Xiaoyu.

283
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,480
to bury dead bodies downstairs.

284
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Shen Song.

285
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,200
This chef is really something.

286
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,680
What can you do to me?

287
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,720
Are you really not going to investigate?

288
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,720
No matter where you know my heavy pupils,

289
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,960
or why you want me to investigate the case.

290
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,640
I have something to tell you.

291
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,680
There is no truth in this world.

292
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,440
Everything is fake.

293
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,320
Only those who can eat

294
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
is real.

295
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,520
Stop looking for me.

296
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,400
What can I do?

297
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,160
You'll know.

298
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,920
You're not young anymore.

299
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,720
Later,

300
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,320
I'll arrange a marriage for you.

301
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,640
Do you like fat or slim?

302
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,720
Uncle.

303
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,560
You

304
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,599
care about Li first.

305
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:07,720
Shen Song.

306
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,359
Someone reported you

307
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,839
the murderer of the murder of the corpse pit in Lantern Building.

308
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,400
Come with us.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,880
This kid is a scholar.

310
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,520
and tender.

311
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,760
So please

312
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,200
please forgive me.

313
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:22,720
Okay.

314
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,040
I'll tell you later.

315
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:24,680
Okay.

316
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:31,960
Here.

317
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,000
Come on. Steamed buns with meat.

318
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,400
I want to eat golden and silver rice.

319
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,640
Is this a place to order?

320
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,720
Why are you picking food when you're dying?

321
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,520
Whatever. I'll put it here.

322
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
If Peng Hyo-ok really handed me in as a criminal,

323
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,400
We know each other.

324
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,280
Tell me the truth.

325
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,120
Where did you go that day?

326
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,240
If you were really a thief, you would have admitted it.

327
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,440
Beat him up.

328
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
You can't deny it because of this.

329
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,040
and then you will be sentenced to death.

330
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
I told you.

331
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,200
I didn't go out that night.

332
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,720
How did he see you?

333
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,240
This case

334
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,720
is bad for us.

335
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,520
Sir.

336
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,360
What do you mean?

337
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:18,920
Look.

338
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,560
The money for building the building was from the Ministry of Revenue.

339
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,160
If His Majesty blames it, he will be punished.

340
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,920
the Supreme Court

341
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,280
will definitely find out about our Ministry of Revenue.

342
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,440
My father will be implicated.

343
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,920
I heard

344
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,160
the murderer was caught.

345
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,400
That’s the problem.

346
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,240
What is he hiding

347
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,640
behind Shen Song?

348
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
It's not that simple.

349
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,120
This...

350
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,240
What could he hide?

351
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,080
Suspect.

352
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,160
What do you want?

353
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,000
My lord.

354
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,960
According to the law of our dynasty,

355
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,320
is a death row row.

356
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
If you are not convinced,

357
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
you can go to another office for another trial.

358
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,000
You scoundrel!

359
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,920
Are you trying to make a big deal out of this?

360
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,520
I only have one head on my neck.

361
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,200
Do you think it's a big deal?

362
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,120
Yes.

363
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,680
Transfer him to another trial.

364
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,720
Change a good official.

365
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,240
Yes.

366
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,040
Change a good official.

367
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,960
Yes.

368
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,960
If you don't want other departments to intervene,

369
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,400
let the witness testify against Shen.

370
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,200
My lord.

371
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,880
If you don't let him confront the witness,

372
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,720
he won't accept it.

373
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,240
Why don't you find the witness

374
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,120
and make it clear.

375
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
so that we can convict him.

376
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,560
Get down.

377
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,400
Yes.

378
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,600
The testimony is solid.

379
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,480
I want to see how you can reverse the case.

380
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,400
Bring him in.

381
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,120
Greetings, my lord.

382
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
My lord, you are wise.

383
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,920
On the 15th of last month,

384
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,440
I slept outside Phoenix’s door.

385
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,440
I saw Chef Shen digging a hole outside the city gate

386
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,440
and pushed the body down.

387
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Alone?

388
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,400
Just you.

389
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,160
I was awakened by the sound of your excavation.

390
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,760
You carried a dead man down from the carriage.

391
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,480
How did I carry it?

392
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,600
You moved it from the carriage.

393
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,240
from the carriage.

394
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,200
Hug.

395
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,160
Carry it.

396
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,800
Throw it into the pit.

397
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,600
Chef, stop quibbling.

398
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,320
It's true.

399
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,760
Are you alone?

400
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,640
You said you can see clearly.

401
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,640
But the terrain outside Phoenix’s gate is wide.

402
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,480
You may not know if you are far away.

403
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,360
At this distance,

404
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,320
15 steps.

405
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,560
I saw it clearly.

406
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,440
It was you.

407
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,160
You really only saw me?

408
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,640
Just one?

409
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
Just wear this.

410
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,120
My lord.

411
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,600
I’m done.

412
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,880
Is what the witness said wrong?

413
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,800
Yes.

414
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,400
Okay.

415
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,720
It's wrong.

416
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,280
You're the one who's wrong.

417
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,280
How dare you!

418
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,040
How dare you bite me?

419
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,320
I asked a witness to demonstrate the body.

420
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,440
The witness only did a few moves in vain.

421
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,320
his hands started trembling unconsciously.

422
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Witness said he saw Shen’s movements clearly.

423
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,560
But it was 15 steps away just now.

424
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,440
The witness couldn’t see

425
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,040
was two fingers.

426
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,040
So what?

427
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,920
What does these details have to do with this case?

428
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,000
My hands tremble and my eyelids.

429
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,200
are symptoms of drinking.

430
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,840
He said he could see clearly.

431
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
Who knows if he wasn't drunk

432
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,360
that he wasn't drunk.

433
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,760
Everyone,

434
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,880
this person always keeps the bottle with him.

435
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,920
He's a drunkard.

436
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,000
How can he testify?

437
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,240
That's right.

438
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,240
That's right.

439
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,000
Let him go.

440
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
He's innocent.

441
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,560
So what if there's no testimony?

442
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,200
Chef Shen.

443
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,920
The law of this dynasty

444
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,920
has always been guilty.

445
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,800
As long as there is no other suspect,

446
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
I can punish you.

447
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,120
Guards!

448
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,040
Yes.

449
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,080
You knew the case was suspicious,

450
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,440
but you don't want to ask.

451
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,800
Are you going to get promoted with the life of a commoner?

452
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,080
No one can prove your innocence.

453
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,520
You can't get out of this office.

454
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,720
He has a witness.

455
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,880
I am his witness.

456
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,040
Who are you?

457
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,200
My lord.

458
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,080
I can testify for him.

459
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,280
There was no moon on the 15th of last month.

460
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,520
You can't see anything.

461
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,480
Can you see Chef Shen kill and dump the body?

462
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,080
Who are you?

463
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,520
How can you remember the moon on the 15th of last month?

464
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,360
Have you forgotten?

465
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,400
The government announced it would rain at nine last month.

466
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,360
but it didn't rain.

467
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,560
It's cloudy.

468
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,400
Where is the moon?

469
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,000
Yes, I remember it too.

470
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,480
It was cloudy that night.

471
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,360
Yes.

472
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,680
There's no moon in cloudy days.

473
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,920
Where is the moon?

474
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,560
Sir.

475
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,560
Please let him go.

476
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,800
You wronged a good person.

477
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,200
Who taught you

478
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,080
these testimony today?

479
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,160
No one taught me.

480
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,280
Have you been to Nanke Building recently?

481
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,240
Yes.

482
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,640
I went there.

483
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,040
You came out fast.

484
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,720
You're good.

485
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,280
You even forged

486
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,760
can be altered.

487
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,080
What should I do?

488
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,240
He saw through me.

489
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,320
If you refuse to investigate,

490
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,640
he wanted to frame me.

491
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,960
You don't have to force me.

492
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,200
Master wants you.

493
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,720
You kept rejecting me.

494
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Do you think you deserve to die?

495
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,520
Who is your master?

496
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,960
You don't deserve to know.

497
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,720
I only ask you.

498
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,040
Are you going to investigate it or not?

499
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,080
I’m not threatened.

500
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,880
You can leave now.

501
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,560
Chef Shen.

502
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,600
I gave you the chance

503
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
I gave you a chance

504
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,240
to let you come out and be recruited by your master.

505
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,520
If you still don't know what's good for you,

506
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,680
there must be a criminal in the building case.

507
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,320
If you don't investigate,

508
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,680
he is the real murderer.

509
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,480
Uncle.

510
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,440
If you are willing to investigate,

511
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,400
he will know nothing.

512
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,640
Just think that he slept.

513
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,280
How is it, chef?

514
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,000
Are you going to check it or not?

515
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,680
Aren't you going to do it?

516
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,000
It's all because of your uncle.

517
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,080
What does it have to do with my uncle?

518
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,200
Stop asking.

519
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,240
If you want to investigate a case, you need a government badge.

520
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,120
Do you have it?

521
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Peng doesn't care.

522
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,440
I'm just afraid that our supervisor

523
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,120
How could he give up his power?

524
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Do you have money?

525
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,600
I do.

526
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,200
It's enough.

527
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,680
You've spent

528
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,120
all my money.

529
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,280
You still have money to buy a way to hell.

530
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,560
You can only get what you want if you give up.

531
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,800
Listen to it.

532
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,280
What are you talking about?

533
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,280
How is it?

534
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,080
Beg us for anything.

535
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,640
Dream on.

536
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,200
Peng Xiaoyu

537
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,960
Peng Buwei.

538
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,880
Lord Peng,

539
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,600
You can't bribe me with a chicken.

540
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,320
I won't investigate this anymore.

541
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,440
Hang in there.

542
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,040
How?

543
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,440
You need money everywhere.

544
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,160
Your pocket is cleaner than your face.

545
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Hold on with me.

546
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,160
Your uncle said

547
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,560
you can sell a few mu of land in your countryside.

548
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,080
Five lashes of lightning.

549
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,040
It's you! It's you!

550
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,440
It's you.

551
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,440
The white rainbow shines on the spring mountain

552
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,880
Good sentence.

553
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,880
OK.

554
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,840
Just a compliment for me.

555
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,040
You went to the court to contradict Peng Xiaoyu.

556
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,160
To be honest,

557
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,960
I'm Sun Li.

558
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,440
I've never lost anyone

559
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,000
I've never lost in poetry.

560
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,160
Except Shen Tuo,

561
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,240
Shen Tuo is talented.

562
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,280
One compliment is ten sentences.

563
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,480
Just be content.

564
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,760
I have nothing special.

565
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,800
I have nothing to thank you for.

566
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,680
You should thank me.

567
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,640
I've been running business for generations.

568
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,720
However,

569
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,480
I'm not interested in the ledger calculations.

570
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,920
The most interested thing is to promote the prison break.

571
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,880
I heard you two are investigating a case.

572
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,040
Could you bring me along?

573
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,920
No.

574
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,520
Forget it.

575
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,200
Since you're not willing to help me,

576
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,160
I'll

577
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,920
this meal.

578
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,360
Mrs. Su.

579
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,120
Coming.

580
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,440
100 taels.

581
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,680
Wait.

582
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,760
Young people don't know the rules.

583
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,760
They don't have the right to pay in this wonton stall.

584
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,160
Here.

585
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,680
Keep the change.

586
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,400
So stingy.

587
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,960
Chef.

588
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,120
This guy is good.

589
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,680
Sun.

590
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,120
Yes.

591
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,400
Call a carriage.

592
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,240
Okay.

593
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,240
Although Pal Pun is not smart,

594
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,640
He's rich.

595
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,080
Brother Shen asked me to find these gifts.

596
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,160
Where are we going?

597
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,440
Here's the thing.

598
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,920
If you want to do something, learn to be a human first.

599
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Just learn.

600
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,840
What are you doing?

601
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,760
I'm not hungry.

602
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,920
My lord.

603
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,640
Take a look.

604
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,080
It's from Shanhai House.

605
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,400
Good stuff.

606
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,360
Are you hungry?

607
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,040
Of course.

608
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,560
Yes.

609
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,160
Mr. Liu of the previous dynasty drew the joy of his bedroom.

610
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,520
The only good book left.

611
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,400
I wonder if you like it.

612
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,440
Yes.

613
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Chef Shen.

614
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Did you steal the bank account?

615
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,640
Don’t worry.

616
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,720
I have never committed crimes.

617
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,080
Does it work?

618
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,240
It really works.

619
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,600
Where are we going?

620
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,160
The Ministry of Revenue

621
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,600
Ministry of Revenue?

622
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,600
The brand of the government doesn't work.

623
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,280
The money in the money bag is not working either.

624
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,560
I'm afraid we can't enter the Ministry of Revenue

625
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,040
If the Ministry of Revenue doesn’t cooperate,

626
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,160
the list of participants

627
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,400
can’t be found.

628
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,480
Now we can only turn the skeletons upside down.

629
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,280
Where's the money bag?

630
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,000
Yes. Where is the money bag?

631
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,760
Here.

632
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,040
He said

633
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,200
he went to the toilet because he had a stomachache.

634
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,440
There are so many lives.

635
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,800
His Majesty will investigate it again.

636
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,920
Now Shen Song

637
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,680
the Ministry of Revenue.

638
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,920
Then my father will be in trouble.

639
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,040
No, I have to find out first.

640
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,400
Did you find anything?

641
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,360
Hurry up.

642
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,000
Come here.

643
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,040
If the Minister of Revenue knows

644
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,080
I let you in,

645
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,880
I don't need to be the Vice Minister.

646
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,800
Don't talk about that.

647
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,160
Let me ask you, what's going on?

648
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,000
It's part of our business to distribute the settlement.

649
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,320
Why is the signature Long Yan Nian, Minister of Works?

650
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,360
Brother Gongsun, you are white.

651
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,200
You can't

652
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,080
these things.

653
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,200
Remember.

654
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,200
Don't listen or look.

655
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,920
My father is the Minister of Revenue.

656
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
You are my best friend.

657
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,800
Your dereliction of duty has nothing to do with me.

658
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Do you know something?

659
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,880
I...

660
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,280
Tell me.

661
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,720
Yes.

662
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,040
I did give the money to the workers.

663
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,320
It's all for the government.

664
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,920
Well,

665
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,400
Minister Long from the Ministry of Works is short-tempered.

666
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,880
We can do whatever we want.

667
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,480
It's always been like this.

668
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,520
It's okay.

669
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,880
It's fine if nothing happens.

670
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,000
If something happens to you,

671
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,840
just like the lantern house now.

672
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,400
Our Ministry of Revenue is not clean.

673
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,160
We can't afford to be investigated.

674
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,920
Do you know that?

675
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,120
I don't think so.

676
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,320
Why not?

677
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,560
Brother Zhao Dong, you've only been an official for two years.

678
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,440
Of course you don't know the depth.

679
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Don't tell anyone.

680
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,760
I'll figure something out.

681
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,240
Sun,

682
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
You came from a wealthy family.

683
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,080
Can you identify this for me?

684
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,960
Sheep fat is so jade.

685
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,680
Among these victims,

686
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,040
only this female body was wearing a jade pendant.

687
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,240
I'm afraid her identity is different from others.

688
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,240
Can you recognize the origin of this jade?

689
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,960
May you enjoy happiness and longevity.

690
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,920
It looks like a gift from an elder when a woman was mourning.

691
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,400
To show my goodwill.

692
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,360
It's a pity

693
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,840
I didn't get to enjoy the happiness

694
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
I didn't get to enjoy my birthday.

695
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,560
Li.

696
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,960
This belongs to the dead.

697
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,960
It's inappropriate.

698
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,120
I want you to draw a picture

699
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,840
to find the victim.

700
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,560
This jade is probably a clue.

701
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,040
Ask the painter to draw it carefully.

702
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:17,920
Oh.

703
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,320
All 66 corpses.

704
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,480
One of them.

705
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,280
So many people.

706
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,400
disappeared for no reason.

707
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,440
No one went to the court to look for him.

708
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,239
Yes.

709
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,880
It's fine if it's one or two.

710
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,600
There are over 60 of them.

711
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,520
Don't they have family?

712
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,679
No one noticed?

713
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,840
You're right.

714
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,920
I'm afraid

715
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,080
is the family of ordinary people.

716
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,400
The whole family of ordinary people.

717
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,880
What about the neighbors?

718
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,960
Didn't the neighbors find out?

719
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,200
Unless there is a reason

720
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,560
it wouldn't be strange if the whole family went missing.

721
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,000
Wang Youseok.

722
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,000
Kim Jiayue.

723
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,320
Winni Liang.

724
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,320
He Congrui.

Liang Rulong.

729
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,480
Wang Rujia.

730
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,440
Shi Song.

731
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,440
Mr. Zheng.

732
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,400
Ren Yan.

733
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,400
