1
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,160
Prince Rui's Residence.

2
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,320
Stop the car.

3
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,640
Greetings, Prince Rui.

4
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,600
What's wrong?

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,920
The prince outside

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,880
has a grudge against me.

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,280
Hide yourselves.

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,240
Keep quiet.

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,120
Long live the princess!

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,640
Princess.

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,720
Who is the princess?

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,760
You are the princess.

13
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,320
You are the princess.

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,320
Aren't you Rong Hua?

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,560
Rong Hua?

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
The title is Rong Hua.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,880
No wonder

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
you look familiar.

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,520
Yes.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,680
We met during the proposal.

21
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,720
Yes.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,039
We met during the marriage proposal.

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,920
Rong Hua.

24
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,520
You are the princess bestowed by the emperor.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,760
You should set an example for all daughters.

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,600
But you stayed out all night.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,120
Do you admit your mistake?

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,160
Yes.

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,040
But...

30
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,079
Enough.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
I know

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
you think

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,520
it's boring

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,760
in this mansion, right?

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,920
I think this mansion is boring too.

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,160
Exactly.

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,680
you and I

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,120
should understand each other better.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,480
But you've been busy all the time.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,920
In this mansion,

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,400
in this mansion.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
Qi came back and said

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
he lost you.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
My heart

45
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,840
is like being

46
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,320
being trampled in mud.

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,120
Father, don't be angry.

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,960
Okay.

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,200
Don't be angry.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,200
It's good that you're back.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,440
Qi.

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,280
Serve your princess back home.

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,320
Yes, Your Highness.

54
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,640
Father.

55
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,440
Let me introduce you to

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,880
a new friend of mine.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,000
Who is it?

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,920
This is...

59
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,480
the famous chef, Shen Shaodwen.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,280
He is...

61
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,760
He's not usually like this.

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,880
He must have been startled during the investigation.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,840
Father.

64
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,720
Your carriage is also here.

65
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,840
Why don't we go to the palace

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,720
and ask an imperial physician to treat him?

67
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,040
He has no rank or rank.

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,880
How could he be so lucky?

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,200
As the Imperial Envoy,

70
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,360
I can't control myself

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,680
I can't control myself.

72
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,440
What right do you have to walk for His Majesty?

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,520
Enough.

74
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,080
Go home now.

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,920
Come on. Let's go.

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,720
You're busy all day.

77
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,720
you'll meet

78
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,519
bad luck.

79
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,440
Our dynasty has a scholar.

80
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,280
to recruit talents.

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,360
Without Shen Shaodwen,

82
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,560
The position of Imperial Envoy is not short of people.

83
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,760
How is it, doctor?

84
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,560
The pulse is tight.

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,120
This seems to be the symptom of Turks.

86
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,200
However,

87
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,640
the Turks won't be unconscious forever.

88
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you tired?

89
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,000
Not really.

90
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,440
Forgive my incompetence.

91
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,120
I'll prescribe two medicine to calm you down.

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
Take it.

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
Please come with me to make the prescription.

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,760
Okay.

95
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,080
This is the sixth one.

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,600
I prescribed a bunch of calming prescriptions.

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,160
No one can say anything.

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,720
When I was young,

99
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,200
in the countryside.

100
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,080
Let's try.

101
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,680
He hates nonsense.

102
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,400
Don't think about those evil ways.

103
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,040
Is he annoying?

104
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,480
Then he...

105
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,560
I've informed the mansion.

106
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,600
Call my father.

107
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,280
Get some more good doctors.

108
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,120
Li,

109
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,000
Has Zhan Mao's sealing document been issued?

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
The murderer is not Zhan Mao Er.

111
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,480
I'm going to find Peng Buwei now.

112
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,240
Remove the document.

113
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,000
Calm down.

114
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,760
We can't leave.

115
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
If the chef

116
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
if the murderer takes advantage of him,

117
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
he'll come after him.

118
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,800
If you want to catch Cat Zhan,

119
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,920
just arrest him in public.

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,240
If the murderer wants to escape,

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,880
he will be quiet for some time.

122
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,040
and won't commit another crime.

123
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,400
Commander Tian.

124
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,640
Tian 2.

125
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,400
Commander Tian Er.

126
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,640
Zhan Mao'er.

127
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,480
He is seven feet tall.

128
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,640
He always wears

129
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,360
with a big knife.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,400
This man

131
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,480
killed two daughters.

132
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,080
and committed many crimes.

133
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,320
and show the world

134
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
Anyone who can report their whereabouts

135
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,040
ten taels of silver.

136
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,640
Capture the sender.

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,440
300 taels of silver.

138
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,880
300 taels?

139
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,600
Have you seen him?

140
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,160
No.

141
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,400
Have you seen this man?

142
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,920
Have you seen him?

143
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,200
This, this, this.

144
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
Whose car is this?

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Constable Li.

146
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,320
Morning.

147
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,320
Mr Dong.

148
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,320
Going to court?

149
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,360
I'm going out to check the tax today.

150
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,800
What are you doing?

151
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,600
Isn't this

152
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,040
The one we know together.

153
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,640
Zhan Mao.

154
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,880
He has caused a huge trouble.

155
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,000
Now that we've searched everywhere,

156
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,480
I was thinking

157
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,320
if he had no choice,

158
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,400
will he

159
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
go to you one day?

160
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,200
If he dares to come,

161
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,440
I'll send him to the government office.

162
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
But he...

163
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,159
he saved your life.

164
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,000
So what?

165
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,159
I'm an official.

166
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
He is a thief.

167
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,640
You're so prepared.

168
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
No wonder Zhan Mao'er hates officials.

169
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,360
Once a person becomes an official,

170
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,840
your eyes will turn white.

171
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,960
Benefactor.

172
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,320
Thank you.

173
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,640
We have about an hour.

174
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,240
the carriage will leave the city.

175
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,640
I've prepared a carriage.

176
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,480
By then,

177
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,200
to my hometown.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,880
Zuo You.

179
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,760
can avoid the officials in the capital.

180
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,560
I heard that there was a commotion in the next courtyard yesterday.

181
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,280
The government ordered someone to close the door.

182
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,680
I found out

183
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,880
I found out it was Lord Tao.

184
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,480
Perfect.

185
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,280
Mr. Sun is my old friend.

186
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
He's good at

187
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,920
in brain disease.

188
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,200
He's a master.

189
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,040
So I lured him here.

190
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,160
We will accept

191
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,640
on behalf of the chef.

192
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,800
Sir, how is it?

193
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
A dead body has one ear.

194
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,000
What else can I say?

195
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Prepare the funeral.

196
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,800
What?

197
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,160
What happened?

198
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,480
Doctor.

199
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,840
He's alive and well.

200
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,280
No way.

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,760
If you can't cure it,

202
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,560
we can pay the medical fees.

203
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,840
There's no need to curse people.

204
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,480
I can't save myself

205
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,680
I can't save myself,

206
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,000
but no one can save me.

207
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,040
According to "The Tale of Differentiation",

208
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,360
This disease is called Soul Disease.

209
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
What is it?

210
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,640
It’s a serious illness.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,800
Shen Song.

212
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
I’m your destiny.

213
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,840
Whether you die or not

214
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,840
is not up to you.

215
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,720
But...

216
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,680
I'm a monster.

217
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm the evil person

218
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,720
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,280
I broke my promise.

220
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,760
I can only make this decision.

221
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,800
If I can't solve my problem,

222
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,880
I will abandon the vanity of life.

223
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,000
Like a clay cow entering the sea.

224
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,920
Brother.

225
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,800
Don't go.

226
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,680
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,280
My brother is a monster.

228
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,960
A monster must die.

229
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Chef.

230
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,800
You said

231
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,840
to walk this thorn path with me.

232
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
I'm already on the road.

233
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
You can't just leave.

234
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,680
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,680
The monster must die.

236
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,240
No.

237
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,840
Chef

238
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,440
Chef.

239
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,480
Shen Song.

240
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Shen Song.

241
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
Why did you commit suicide?

242
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,720
Say something, Shen Shaodwen.

243
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,200
Why did you commit suicide?

244
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,520
What did I do to you?

245
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,000
you can tell me.

246
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,120
Say it.

247
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,480
Chef.

248
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,840
We agreed

249
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,080
We promised to keep going.

250
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,360
We can’t die.

251
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,240
Say something, Shen Shaodwen.

252
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,960
As a doctor,

253
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,520
is to protect the heat in his heart.

254
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,760
There are indeed

255
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,920
in this prescription.

256
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,840
It's hard to find.

257
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,040
It's hard to find.

258
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,160
I'll find him.

259
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,600
If he dies,

260
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,240
I'll drag him back from hell.

261
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,040
It doesn't matter.

262
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,080
There are many channels here.

263
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,040
I

264
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,920
find it for you.

265
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,720
Thank you.

266
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,480
This prescription can only kill you.

267
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,440
It can't be right.

268
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,760
Remember,

269
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,320
If we want to save him,

270
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,320
he has to wake up himself.

271
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,440
Are you begging me?

272
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
Chef Shen lost control of his pupils.

273
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,160
and unconscious.

274
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,560
The words are parasites

275
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,560
He's determined to die.

276
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,720
The master told him the word "mayfly".

277
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,040
I was thinking

278
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,680
If we want to save the cook, we should save the chef. Let's go.

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,480
only the master

280
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,200
Tell me what is a hose parasite.

281
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,000
You should know

282
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
you should know one or two.

283
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,000
You hate him, don't you?

284
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,440
Don't ask.

285
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,080
Just tell me about the Magnolic Parasis.

286
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,240
Even if you know,

287
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,480
I can't tell you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

288
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,600
Please.

289
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Call me sister.

290
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,560
Say it.

291
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,560
Just kidding.

292
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know anything.

293
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,320
Master's arrangement is reasonable.

294
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm afraid I've thought about this

295
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,560
I'm afraid he has thought of this.

296
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,200
You know.

297
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,680
Our pawns

298
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,480
can't question our master.

299
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,720
Why are you so anxious?

300
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
kill people all the time.

301
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
We used to be trained and went on a mission together.

302
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,960
How many survived?

303
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,120
You didn't even cry.

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,040
Why is it with him?

305
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
Why do you want to be a living Buddha?

306
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,400
They're all pawns.

307
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,840
It doesn't matter if he dies.

308
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,480
I won't watch him die.

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,320
If the King of Hell wants him to die,

310
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,400
What can you do?

311
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,160
Young Master.

312
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,880
Okay.

313
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,000
I need to go to the toilet.

314
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:22,880
Hurry.

315
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm in a hurry.

316
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,560
OK, wait a moment.

317
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,920
Slow down.

318
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,720
Untie me.

319
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,640
Young Master.

320
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,600
Master said

321
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,080
within 50 miles away from the capital,

322
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,400
within 50 miles away from the capital.

323
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,400
Please make do with it.

324
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,680
Excuse me.

325
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,160
What are you doing?

326
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,760
Don't I need to help you?

327
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,720
I'm not used to it.

328
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,560
Untie me. Hurry up.

329
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,800
I don't think this will work.

330
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,520
Hurry up.

331
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,320
I'm not running.

332
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,400
Okay.

333
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,840
I'm sorry.

334
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,560
Thank you for your master's kindness.

335
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,760
But I still have things to do.

336
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,440
My soul is back.

337
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,320
The soul is back.

338
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,400
God Returns to the Temple.

339
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,040
It's a ghost's grave.

340
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,440
Hu Huang Changpyeong returned to the forest.

341
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,080
Those who hit the famine, take the famine away.

342
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,120
Shen Song.

343
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,840
Come back.

344
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,400
Shen Shaodwen

345
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,800
Shen Shaodwen

346
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,640
Come back.

347
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,520
Shen Shaodwen.

348
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,599
It’s useless.

349
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
What's the problem?

350
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,359
Try to sprinkle some dust.

351
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Is your incense ash fake?

352
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,359
The incense ash from Jinlong Temple.

353
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,280
It's from the main hall.

354
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,000
Is it a headache?

355
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,240
It doesn't matter if he sprinkles some first.

356
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,560
It's useless.

357
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,440
How is it?

358
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,000
It's useless.

359
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,600
Still like this.

360
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
I'm so anxious.

361
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,440
Do you think

362
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,120
locked by the King of Hell?

363
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,840
Uncle.

364
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,280
But he can't say these nonsense.

365
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,800
He can't listen to this.

366
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,000
You scared me.

367
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,160
When I just came back,

368
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,320
I saw Peng.

369
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,280
He and his men

370
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,160
to seal the yard.

371
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,240
I was thinking on the way.

372
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,160
he was in that courtyard.

373
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,520
Do you think

374
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,960
still in that courtyard?

375
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,320
Uncle.

376
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,600
Stop causing trouble.

377
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,280
You're scaring me too.

378
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,920
There's already...

379
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,720
is full of yang energy.

380
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,640
The murderous aura is strong.

381
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
You have swords and swords.

382
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
Even if his soul comes back,

383
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,400
he wouldn't dare to come in.

384
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,600
Li.

385
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,800
I think uncle is right.

386
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,360
The doctor said

387
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,040
a heart medicine is needed for a heart disease.

388
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,840
The chef poured it in the secret room.

389
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,440
Let's go back now.

390
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,160
Maybe we can find some reason.

391
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,880
Besides,

392
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,040
once Peng gets involved,

393
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,640
the scene will be destroyed.

394
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,640
Let's go.

395
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll go over there.

396
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,880
Li.

397
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,080
I remember it right.

398
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,280
It's exactly the same.

399
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,560
Zhan Mao'er is such a villain.

400
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
He also worships Master Stone?

401
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,120
The chef said

402
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,360
the murderer was someone else.

403
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
Not him.

404
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,840
Not necessarily.

405
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,640
We're looking for it outside.

406
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,560
But even if this monster is someone else,

407
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,400
we can't let him get away with it.

408
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,760
Master Stone.

409
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,440
only for your hometown.

410
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,000
Where is your hometown?

411
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,840
Linzhou XingCounty.

412
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
at the east side of Shiqiao Village.

413
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,360
It's easy if you know where it is.

414
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,600
I need to go.

415
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,320
You

416
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,160
Eat something.

417
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,000
If he doesn't,

418
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,720
I won't eat it.

419
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,960
Then why are you fighting with him?

420
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
If you don't take care of yourself,

421
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,760
how can I take care of him?

422
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,920
It seems that

423
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,800
Chairman Luo's medicine

424
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,040
really works.

425
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,040
Dr. Sun said

426
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,200
he's just hanging his life.

427
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,400
He doesn't want to wake up.

428
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,960
What can we do?

429
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,760
Chef.

430
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,800
I

431
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,320
found many new clues about the mandrill

432
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,040
I

433
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,040
I don't want to tell you. I want to know.

434
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,560
Do you want to know?

435
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,160
If you want to know, get up and ask yourself.

436
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,720
Actually,

437
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,280
he can't do it.

438
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,840
I don't know what to do.

439
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,680
I don't know what I can find in Linzhou this time.

440
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,400
But...

441
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,120
You're a dead cook.

442
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,360
What are you talking about?

443
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,280
Bad luck.

444
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,720
I'm a jinx.

445
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,880
You won't die.

446
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,040
You won't die even if I die.

447
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,360
I'm lucky.

448
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,160
Don't die.

449
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,200
If you die,

450
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,720
Who do you expect?

451
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,080
Fine.

452
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,880
I'll be back in three or five days.

453
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,160
Don't worry too much.

454
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,440
He'll be fine.

455
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,640
If there is any clue,

456
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,120
if there is any clue,

457
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
he will jump up immediately.

458
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,920
This cook

459
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,560
had no one to rely on.

460
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Luckily, we're here.

461
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,800
So he fell.

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,960
We can't fall.

463
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,880
Be careful.

464
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,320
Who dares to touch the constable in the capital?

465
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,040
I'm leaving.

466
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Please forgive me.

467
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,960
We have no fruit today.

468
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,320
If you open your eyes,

469
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,240
please give me

470
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,080
for 70 years.

471
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,880
Thank you.

472
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,640
Forget it.

473
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,800
What I said before doesn't count.

474
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,360
How about this?

475
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Please show mercy.

476
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,480
Send back

477
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,440
back.

478
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
You worship Lord Rock here.

479
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,000
Is there any saying?

480
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,160
There is a legend in our village.

481
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,680
a girl fell in love with a demon.

482
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,400
But the villagers worked together to kill the demon.

483
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,520
This demon

484
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,240
turned into a stone man

485
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,720
and protect this girl forever.

486
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,840
A demon and a girl.

487
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,280
This is a story about love.

488
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,840
Thank you.

489
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,400
Ms. Yeon-hwa.

490
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,080
Someone sent something.

491
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,080
This is from the Chamber of Commerce.

492
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,960
Young Master Luo is really interesting.

493
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,760
The Chamber of Commerce has given us gifts for many years.

494
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,280
you didn't even take a look.

495
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,680
but he still gave it to me.

496
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,800
I didn't ask to see him.

497
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,200
Ms. Yeon-hwa.

498
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,640
I'll get going.

499
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,280
Chengyuan.

500
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,840
Is this dragonfly pretty?

501
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,720
This is for you.

502
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,560
Help!

503
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,440
Help!

504
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,280
Help!

505
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Help!

506
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,640
Help!

507
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,240
Help!

508
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,640
Zhan Mao'er is here to kidnap me.

509
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,240
Help!

510
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,320
Cat Zhan is here to rob us.

511
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,520
Sir.

512
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,360
Sir, help me!

513
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,200
Zhan Mao'er

514
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,240
The mandrill ran that way

515
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,160
Go

516
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,040
Let's go.

517
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,320
Is the lotus worshipping stone people

518
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,120
because of her lover?

519
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,640
These are important clues.

520
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,360
When the chef wakes up,

521
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,440
we must ask him to help us analyze.

522
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,560
Who is it?

523
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,360
This...

524
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
It's in the middle of nowhere.

525
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,040
It's scary.

526
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,440
It's okay.

527
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm fine.

528
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,720
Constable Li.

529
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,840
I've been waiting for you.

530
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,520
Chef.

531
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
This time,

532
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,080
I'm afraid I can't go back.

533
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,920
Go out for a walk.

534
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,240
Don't always stay here.

535
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,720
Someone died again?

536
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,520
Where is Lord Li?

537
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,160
What’s wrong with him?

538
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,600
Ever since he followed Chef Shen,

539
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,040
he doesn't care about the government affairs.

540
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,960
He doesn't even come at noon.

541
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,560
How could he get his salary?

542
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,280
Sir, you are right.

543
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,880
I've sent someone to look for him.

544
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,680
Isn't this Li?

545
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,000
My lord.

546
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,920
Li.

547
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,280
Li.

548
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,720
was found dead in Bianhe this morning.

549
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,320
Please

550
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,400
to identify the zoom.

551
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,960
Let's go.

552
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,680
Who is this?

553
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,520
How did he die?

554
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,960
It was Duke Li from the Imperial Army

555
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,840
To investigate the mandrill case,

556
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,880
he went south alone

557
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,160
but was killed by the evil.

558
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,360
He died on his way back to the capital.

559
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,280
He's a good constable.

560
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
and a good friend.

561
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,840
Young Master.

562
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,360
Can you catch that monster

563
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,080
and avenge Constable Li?

564
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,760
Yes.

565
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,040
Chef, drink some.

566
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,920
Drink it and you'll wake up

567
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,600
Give it to me.

568
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,560
Give it to me.

569
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,520
Are you crazy?

570
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,920
Does it work?

571
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,280
After trying so many ways,

572
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,680
Does it work?

573
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,120
Does it work?

574
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,840
Li won't give up

575
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,760
Li went to catch the mandrill

576
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,120
Where is Li

577
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,080
Li is dead.

578
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,800
Where is he?

579
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,640
Lie here.

580
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,880
as if nothing happened.

581
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,040
Aren't you upset?

582
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,120
I am.

583
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,480
Shen Shaodwen,

584
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,640
Don’t you feel wronged?

585
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,160
Open your eyes.

586
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,480
He's so afraid of pain.

587
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,200
His bones were broken.

588
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,440
How painful was he when he died?

589
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,080
How painful was it?

590
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,960
Almost.

591
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,040
Almost.

592
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,320
Li was back.

593
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,720
I know you can hear me.

594
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,920
You told me

595
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,960
you said there are no nobleness on the thorns.

596
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,080
it's nothing but the descendants.

597
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,480
We are determined to speak for the bitter master.

598
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
I promise you.

599
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
I'll be with you.

600
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,640
Now,

601
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,320
break your promise again.

602
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,080
It's okay.

603
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
If you want to be a coward,

604
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,120
I'll grant your wish.

605
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,800
But I can't.

606
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,080
I have to keep investigating.

607
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,480
I'm going to fight that monster.

608
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,560
If I die,

609
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,920
And Qin.

610
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,480
Li is waiting for me.

611
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,640
If you can't wake up,

612
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,080
just wait to collect my body.

613
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,040
Chef.

614
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,920
The chef is awake

615
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,880
Chef

616
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,520
Uncle, go take a rest.

617
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,199
Let us send Li off.

618
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,320
and prepare some tofu rice for him.

619
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,480
Li went to Lotus Village to investigate.

620
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,800
He was killed on his way back to the capital.

621
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,120
He must have found the vital part.

622
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,920
Although he didn't send the message back,

623
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,560
we can guess

624
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,960
the murderer

625
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,960
must meet two conditions.

626
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
First,

627
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,840
is the hometown of lotus flowers.

628
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,520
Second,

629
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,400
and Li's whereabouts.

630
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,600
We will catch the murderer

631
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,000
we will catch the murderer.

632
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,560
We already have a clue.

633
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,040
We will find it.

634
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,000
Who is that monster?

635
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,240
No need to investigate.

636
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,280
What?

637
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,400
No need to investigate.

638
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,920
What do you mean?

639
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,400
Chef.

640
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,480
What are you thinking?

641
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,800
I don't want to know who that monster is.

642
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,720
All I know is that he went to the capital

643
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,240
and killed innocent people.

644
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,880
and killed Li.

645
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,920
He is unforgivable.

646
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,040
I don't care who he is.

647
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,680
as long as I kill him,

648
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,200
I don't know who it is.

649
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
How can you investigate it?

650
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,080
Don't blame me for doing this.

651
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,320
I will make that monster pay with his blood.

652
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,720
A corpse floating on the river

653
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,800
It's said that a mandrill harms people

654
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,400
But it's not

655
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,960
The villains

656
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,160
was possessed by evil magic.

657
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,560
He only dares to come out at night.

658
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,360
He's not our kind.

659
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Rat ears.

660
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,680
On the bridge, under the bridge, on the road,

661
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,040
Don't be afraid.

662
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,880
There is the blue sky and the soil.

663
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,160
and the world is bright.

664
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,360
The retribution is unpleasant.

665
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,680
I have found out

666
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,280
the murder case in the city.

667
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,960
[the evil man is standing up.]

668
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,120
Tomorrow,

669
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,680
I will examine it in court.

670
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,880
May I ask you to come and tell me?

671
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,040
Listen,

672
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,600
50 pence.

673
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,400
Li,

674
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,040
You got the wrong person.

675
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,920
70 years of wealth

676
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,120
will go down the drain.

677
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,160
Coming.

678
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,560
Kitchen Imperial Envoy.

679
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,440
You want to see me?

680
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,280
You're indeed a monster created by the Parasyte Jutsu.

681
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,680
I'm a monster.

682
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,440
But how did you know about the Parasyte Jutsu?

683
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,520
Because...

684
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,360
I'm a monster too.
