1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,400
I know.

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,600
you have your right.

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,360
But I have my own persistence.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,080
You're Sun Li.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,840
and Gongsun Li.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,240
Do you know

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,680
I’m Shen Song.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,960
I’m also Shen Shaodwen.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,880
Shen Shaodwen?

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,920
Shen Shaodwen.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,160
Three years ago, there was a palace selection

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,800
I was summoned by His Majesty to answer the questions.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,720
But after the secret talk,

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,720
he was chased out of the palace.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
and kicked out of the palace.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,840
Shen Shaowen!

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,480
It’s you.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,280
Do you know why I didn't investigate

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
Why didn't you ask me?

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,600
I did.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,880
In order to find out the truth,

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,520
I've been studying at Ciyou Temple for ten years.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,200
Three years ago,

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
I finally got the chance to speak.

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,720
Shen Shaodwen,

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,680
I’ll recruit you

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,560
I recruited you to the Forbidden City.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,480
I thought you had

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,960
about the current situation.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,280
No.

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,680
you only asked me to investigate a case for you.

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,240
Since Shen Song entered Ciyou House,

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,680
since he entered Ciyou House.

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,880
I only hope to see you one day

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,280
to clear the name of the clan in the underworld.

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
My people died wrongly.

37
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,520
The government didn't investigate it.

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,800
They only sold the register.

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,600
as if they never lived.

40
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,560
and let the people of Shen Village die again.

41
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,120
The murderer is the real murderer.

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,840
The government is also the murderer.

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
But Shen Song can’t

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,200
Shen Song can’t break the game.

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,440
If the emperor doesn’t care,

46
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
who would care?

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,840
If what you said is true,

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,400
it's just a solid evidence.

49
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,200
All alone.

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,640
I can’t judge.

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,680
Shen Song knows that there is no solitary evidence.

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,720
I need His Majesty to give an order to investigate.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,120
You're not an official.

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,680
There are many things you don't understand.

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,280
The dead is gone.

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,560
You still have a bright future.

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,240
You know you're wronged,

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,720
I can't investigate it.

59
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,360
I just think that the past ten years of cold window

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,800
for ten years.

61
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,760
It's better to wear white.

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,079
to comfort myself.

63
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,280
I must do it.

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,160
I can’t.

65
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
Your son, Shen Song, I’m flattered.

66
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,079
Forbidden to be impolite.

67
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,360
and disrespectful.

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,600
Considering his name, he's the top student

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,360
Ka-eun is exempted from death

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
and strip his title

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,280
and never accept the challenge.

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,960
There are 81 plum blossom nails.

73
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,360
right?

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,160
Like you.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,480
The highest place in this world

76
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,200
[in this world.]

77
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,079
I once said

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,320
When I was seven,

79
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,079
I was His Majesty's study partner.

80
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,160
I said something

81
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,320
I said something.

82
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,800
I said the way of ancestors

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,240
is ruthless.

84
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
It's true.

85
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,000
That's the truth.

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,560
I was kicked out of the palace by Mother.

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,840
I will never be able to take the job again.

88
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,839
Chef.

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,440
I'm not lying.

90
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,480
We used to be the same.

91
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,800
In this world,

92
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,240
can remove people's tongue,

93
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,560
but it can't destroy one's mind.

94
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,159
You can't forget the tragedy of the Shen family, right?

95
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,600
So you want the dead to speak.

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
How?

97
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,159
I don't know.

98
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
But I know in this world,

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,120
when someone shout out the drum

100
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,200
and tell the truth,

101
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
I also know

102
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
in this world.

103
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,680
Maybe I’m a loser.

104
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm a burden to my family.

105
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,160
and wasted so many years.

106
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,560
I always feel distracted.

107
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,520
But chef,

108
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,920
Here's to you.

109
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,760
And I understand you.

110
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,320
If you want to investigate,

111
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,840
we'll do it.

112
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
It will take three days to write the memorial.

113
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,800
Let's try again

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,720
before he's arrested.

115
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,560
Okay?

116
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,200
You are unstable.

117
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
If you're a drinking friend,

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,600
is good.

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,440
But the journey along the thorns

120
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,840
I don't believe you.

121
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,880
I know you don't trust me.

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
So until I die,

123
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,840
I will make you believe me.

124
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,040
Peng Buwei,

125
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,920
The case is closed.

126
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,159
Too anxious.

127
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,280
Clean this up.

128
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,040
You're right.

129
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,280
There's nothing left.

130
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,080
I'll look over there.

131
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,000
Look for it.

132
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,440
I can't find anything.

133
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,640
The murderer didn't leave any clues.

134
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,480
Chef.

135
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,400
What should we do?

136
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,840
Don't worry.

137
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
Long Yan Nian is waiting for someone.

138
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,680
The person who went to the appointment

139
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,320
is the murderer.

140
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
The one who poisoned

141
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
was Long Yan Nian.

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,159
He wanted to poison the murderer,

143
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,480
but he was killed by the murderer.

144
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,640
Chef.

145
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,560
What's wrong?

146
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Your eyes just now...

147
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,960
Why?

148
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,720
When I was seven,

149
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,120
I gave birth to this unidentified heavy pupil.

150
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,680
If I concentrate and gather my energy,

151
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,000
it can help me to see the unknown.

152
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,000
That's right.

153
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,840
It's just a side effect.

154
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,680
Listen to me and never use it again.

155
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Your health is more important.

156
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,760
Let's try another way.

157
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,960
Look.

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,520
Long Yan Nian prepared poisoned wine to harm that person.

159
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,840
He was strong.

160
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
Instead, he drank the poisoned wine to Long Yan Nian.

161
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,000
He even disguised Long Yan Nian's confession

162
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
to deny himself.

163
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,120
Yes.

164
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,000
His servant said

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,320
their master said he wanted to meet a guest last night.

166
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,560
But later they thought

167
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,120
Master wanted them to commit suicide.

168
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,280
So no one cares.

169
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,880
Isn't he the guest

170
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,760
Yes.

171
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,960
Long Yan Nian found out his beloved daughter is dead today.

172
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,400
he will take action tonight.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,560
I'm afraid...

174
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,480
he knew Long Yu'er's death

175
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,960
Long Yu'er's death.

176
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,800
But he didn't report to the government,

177
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
but wanted to seek revenge.

178
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,680
He is the murderer.

179
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,160
in the corruption case,

180
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Although Long Yannian embezzled the settlement fund,

181
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
but there are 66 lives

182
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,080
has 66 lives in total.

183
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
on this person.

184
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,600
No.

185
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,280
It's 67 now.

186
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,840
And the dragon extended year.

187
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,120
The 67 lives

188
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,960
are like 67 spider webs.

189
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
and complicated.

190
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,920
There are more than thousands of people involved.

191
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,360
How can we investigate it?

192
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,000
It's all spider webs.

193
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,080
What do you mean?

194
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,240
You mean...

195
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,200
Long Yu'er?

196
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,080
That's right.

197
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
Long Yu'er is an official's daughter.

198
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,680
and raised her in a noble family.

199
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,680
The relationship is simple.

200
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
It's a perfect breakthrough.

201
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,280
You three are men.

202
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,400
and taint her innocence.

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,120
As a noble lady,

204
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,920
as a noble lady.

205
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,720
How?

206
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,680
Why would I run with someone?

207
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,160
I saw you guarding her coffin.

208
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,760
Your lady must have treated you well.

209
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
She is kind.

210
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,800
She treats everyone well.

211
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,120
Since your lady is kind,

212
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,520
why didn't you tell me

213
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,480
Why didn't you tell me?

214
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,880
Are you colluding with the murderer?

215
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,560
I...

216
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,760
Wait.

217
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,760
Miss.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,280
You refused to mention it.

219
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,320
to protect the reputation of your lady.

220
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,680
We understand.

221
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,200
You may not know

222
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,560
because of your protection,

223
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,080
the murderer is at large.

224
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,080
As a lady from a noble family,

225
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,120
she died outside the mansion.

226
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
Even if we don't investigate,

227
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,440
people will talk about it.

228
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,200
Right?

229
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,160
If you want her to live in peace,

230
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,480
cooperate with us

231
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,080
and clear her name.

232
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,160
Okay?

233
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,240
Forget it, Gongsun Li.

234
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,800
We've done nothing wrong.

235
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,600
Let's go.

236
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,480
Let's go.

237
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,840
I heard that you made an engagement

238
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,080
when you went out.

239
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,920
Young Master and Miss were childhood sweethearts.

240
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,480
But after you came to the capital,

241
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,200
he deliberately wanted to break the engagement.

242
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,960
and let her

243
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,480
marry into a noble family.

244
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,840
That day, she received a letter from her husband

245
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
and asked you to meet her.

246
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,800
But after she went out that day,

247
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,520
she never came back.

248
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,120
When I

249
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,560
At the top corner,

250
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,760
A childhood friend.

251
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,080
These are letters

252
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,440
to Long Yu'er.

253
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,200
Look.

254
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,320
Yuedong.

255
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,600
Dong Zhaodong, Assistant Minister of Revenue,

256
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,640
He was promoted three years ago.

257
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,200
Let me

258
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,280
Early May last year,

259
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,960
to the Ministry of Revenue.

260
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,320
He's smart.

261
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,880
and rose rapidly.

262
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,600
It's only been a year,

263
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
in just a year.

264
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,200
Every poem meeting,

265
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,160
For fairness,

266
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,600
everyone used a name.

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,080
His name was Yuedong.

268
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,840
Brother Zhao Dong.

269
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,240
Brother Gongsun.

270
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,400
That's right.

271
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,760
I am Yuedong.

272
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,720
How is your relationship with the Long family?

273
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,040
I was engaged to Yu'er.

274
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,440
But after Lord Long was promoted,

275
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,080
he thought my family was too low.

276
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,080
and refused to contact.

277
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,840
But Yu'er still remembers the past.

278
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,040
She has been communicating with me for a long time.

279
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,160
You're still in touch?

280
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,240
It's just that

281
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,520
we cut ties.

282
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,520
A woman obeys her father at home.

283
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I don't blame her.

284
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,680
But I didn't expect

285
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,240
she would suffer such a disaster.

286
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,160
How do you explain

287
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,840
the last letter?

288
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,040
In the letter, you invited Long Yu'er out for a while.

289
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,280
After that, Long Yu'er never returned home.

290
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,960
There's a maid, Yu-jin to testify.

291
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,400
This letter wasn't written by me.

292
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,400
Someone imitated me.

293
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,800
I see.

294
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,640
Long Yan Nian is dead.

295
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,360
No one organised Long Yu'er's funeral.

296
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,000
Since Mr Dong has such a connection with Long Yu'er,

297
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,920
you can write a letter...

298
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,920
to the Long Residence.

299
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,560
Is there anything difficult for you, Mr Dong?

300
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,440
No.

301
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,520
Lord Gongsun,

302
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,560
The case has been closed.

303
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,160
The murderer is Long Yan Nian from the Ministry of Works.

304
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,440
It has nothing to do

305
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,560
with your Ministry of Revenue.

306
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Lord Gongsun, you are clean and upright.

307
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,800
Everyone in the court is well-known.

308
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,880
Besides, your son is a handsome man.

309
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm envious of him.

310
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,200
But

311
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,640
Recently,

312
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,000
you must have made some nasty friends.

313
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,520
and was kidnapped.

314
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,120
to investigate the corpse pit case.

315
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,840
is hard for me.

316
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,920
I am

317
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,200
is the chef

318
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,640
Chef Shen

319
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,920
The chef here.

320
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,240
The chef abducted the young master

321
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,640
to cause trouble.

322
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,280
What would people think?

323
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,920
This...

324
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,280
Isn't this ruining your reputation?

325
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,200
This is...

326
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,120
Unfilial son.

327
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,920
What did you see?

328
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,760
Vice Minister Dong's handwriting

329
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
is really elegant and elegant.

330
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,760
Among the six sections,

331
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,200
among the six ministries.

332
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,800
But this letter

333
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,040
is good,

334
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,120
but it shows a sense of restraint.

335
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,560
He seems to be hiding something.

336
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,520
This is bad.

337
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,880
Bad news!

338
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,400
Sun.

339
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,320
Your father?

340
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,680
My father is here.

341
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,080
Your father is here.

342
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,440
Your father is outside the door.

343
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,360
You unfilial son!

344
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,160
Father!

345
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,400
Go!

346
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,440
Be gentle.

347
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,040
You're always fooling around with those nasty people.

348
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,800
Why do you think I met Dong Zhaodong

349
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,920
at Feng Le Pavilion?

350
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,760
Why?

351
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,040
I read the order this morning.

352
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,680
I knew Peng Xiaoyu would invite Gongsun Yao

353
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,600
to let him see it.

354
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,040
Then why?

355
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,440
Let Gongsun Li get lost.

356
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,320
I didn't know

357
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,920
you hold a grudge.

358
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,080
If I want to kill the people of the Ministry of Revenue,

359
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,720
I can't believe Gongsun divorced.

360
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,600
What is this?

361
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,800
The removal money is in Nanke Building.

362
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,960
was used to sell debts.

363
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,920
This is the corner of the loan.

364
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
This character is in Dong Chaodong’s name.

365
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,640
The handwriting is the same.

366
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,240
Isn't he the real murderer?

367
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,960
Why did you let him go?

368
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,320
Because I found another clue.

369
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,319
I'm afraid there's a case.

370
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,640
This letter wasn't written by me.

371
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,440
Someone imitated me.

372
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,440
If the real murderer is Dong Chaodong,

373
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,319
those letters

374
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,119
must be written by someone else.

375
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,440
Dong Chaodong was forced to write the obituary by me.

376
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,520
he would deliberately

377
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,880
different from the handwriting of the last letter.

378
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,680
The handwriting is really different.

379
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,120
Li.

380
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,640
Open all the letters.

381
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,520
Look.

382
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,960
In a hurry,

383
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,600
All he cared about was handwriting

384
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,360
is different from the last one.

385
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
But the handwriting

386
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,000
is quite different from the previous few.

387
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,080
This character

388
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,440
It's different.

389
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,960
Round.

390
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,800
The strokes are completely different.

391
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,400
The characters in these letters

392
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,200
in these letters.

393
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
Didn't Dong Chaodong write the first few letters?

394
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
That's impossible.

395
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
The murderer must be a master of copying the handwriting.

396
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,400
He can do the best he can.

397
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
is the last letter to trick Long Yu'er.

398
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,840
So the last letter

399
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,440
was written by the murderer.

400
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,880
What you said is just speculation.

401
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,800
How can you prove there are two Dong Zhaodong?

402
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,000
A sinister snake spits out a letter in secret.

403
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
He knew Long Yan Nian was exposed,

404
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,280
he killed Long Yan Nian and escaped.

405
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,560
He is meticulous.

406
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,800
After that, he must know what he did today.

407
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,640
If he wants to escape this time,

408
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,280
someone will be unlucky.

409
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,440
Li.

410
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,160
Before he bites his poisonous teeth,

411
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,440
before he bites his teeth.

412
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,080
Come on.

413
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,040
Cheers.

414
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,960
Let's drink.

415
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,200
Good wine.

416
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,560
Have some meat.

417
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,520
Great.

418
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,160
Good wine.

419
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:17,960
Good wine.

420
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,400
Again.

421
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,920
As I expected,

422
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,760
Dong Chaodong is someone else.

423
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
This...

424
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
This is impersonating an imperial official.

425
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,400
How dare you!

426
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,000
It's nothing to pretend to be an imperial official.

427
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He has 67 lives.

428
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,760
No.

429
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,800
If the real Dong Chaodong is also killed by him,

430
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,480
that would be 68 clauses.

431
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,680
This is a big deal.

432
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,680
Peng Xiaoyu won't leave it alone this time.

433
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,680
I just hope that the real Dong Chaodong is still in the mortal world.

434
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,440
That way,

435
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,760
we have a chance to win.

436
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,520
How long will you find so many?

437
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,600
Can you find them?

438
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,920
As long as he's alive,

439
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,760
I will sue you.

440
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
If you sue him, there must be a file.

441
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,560
This is the only way we can find him.

442
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,520
I found him.

443
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,040
Two years ago,

444
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,280
this person sued the court

445
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
someone took his name

446
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
and became an official.

447
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,440
Take a look.

448
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,040
Have you seen him?

449
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,600
Do you remember what he looks like?

450
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
It's been so long.

451
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,520
How could I remember?

452
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
I do.

453
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,080
He's crazy.

454
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,600
He's a mess.

455
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,640
and crazy.

456
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,480
He wants to sue a court official.

457
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,480
Of course Peng doesn't care about him.

458
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,240
He scolded him

459
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,640
Peng kicked him out.

460
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,640
Go!

461
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,800
Hurry up.

462
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,080
This is the Beggar Alley.

463
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,240
In the capital,

464
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,880
most homeless and beggars

465
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,440
live here.

466
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,960
There is a killer living here.

467
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,160
named Zhan Mao Er.

468
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,720
He beats people

469
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,520
whenever he sees us.

470
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,920
How can we beat him?

471
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,840
Fortunately,

472
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
With him, these beggars

473
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,320
They were all quiet.

474
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,920
We didn't interfere with each other.

475
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,040
We've been doing nothing.

476
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
You came in to make trouble.

477
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,760
My benefactor asked me to sue him.

478
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,840
Benefactor!

479
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,440
Let me sue him.

480
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,840
I beg you.

481
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,120
Even the officials know that the officials can't be trusted.

482
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,960
But you have to believe it.

483
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,640
In the beggar alley,

484
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,560
Everyone is wronged.

485
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,320
But you have nothing.

486
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,160
Those corrupt officials...

487
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,880
They protect each other.

488
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,320
If you fall into their hands,

489
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,120
if you fall into their hands.

490
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,760
Do you still believe them?

491
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Have you forgotten how you were hunted down?

492
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,720
Only here can keep you safe.

493
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,880
I have a very mature idea.

494
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,400
We can come back

495
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,120
when they are asleep.

496
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,640
That's him.

497
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,240
Li.

498
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,600
Hurry up.

499
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,120
It's a misunderstanding.

500
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,280
Misunderstanding

501
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,400
Zhan Mao'er.

502
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,920
Don't be ungrateful.

503
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,440
We're helping him.

504
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,200
Help him?

505
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,880
You're so sweet.

506
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,120
You are Min.

507
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,960
Me too.

508
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,640
You are wronged.

509
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,440
Me too.

510
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,280
Yes.

511
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,760
I may not be able to empathize with it.

512
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,640
Yes.

513
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
I don't believe the government.

514
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,480
Give him to me.

515
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,280
I will give him justice.

516
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,080
Benefactor.

517
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,000
What's wrong with you?

518
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,920
You still believe them?

519
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,280
Haven't you died enough?

520
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
Your mother passed away early.

521
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,120
so I spoiled you.

522
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,800
But you never listen to me.

523
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,720
Why do you have to hang out with those people?

524
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
He's not an indecent person.

525
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,280
What did you say?

526
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,680
My father said Shen Shaoswen is an indecent man.

527
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,680
But I want to be like him.

528
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,800
Fine.

529
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,720
You're so shameless.

530
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,960
I...

531
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,600
abandoned you for someone who suspected you.

532
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,800
for someone who betrayed you.

533
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,120
I'll kill you today.

534
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,960
I will!

535
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,400
Why didn't you dodge?

536
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,000
Does it hurt?

537
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,400
Dong Chaodong.

538
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,680
You are not crazy.

539
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,520
You are the real Dong Chaodong.

540
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,560
Because it's used in

541
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,760
in the official silver of the Ministry of Revenue

542
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,680
of the Ministry of Revenue.

543
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,320
is exactly the same

544
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,080
of the Ministry of Revenue.

545
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,640
But the handwriting is different from the letter

546
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,400
were written by two people.

547
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,040
So one of them must be fake.

548
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,440
I found Dong Chaodong's file in the Ministry of Revenue.

549
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,960
The fingerprint on it was ink.

550
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,280
So I believe this person must be a fake.

551
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,280
Three years ago,

552
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,200
I saw you on the list.

553
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,480
No.16 in Grade 2.

554
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,920
You're a poor scholar.

555
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,160
and lost your fame.

556
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,720
And Long Yu'er.

557
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,080
She was deceived

558
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,720
because she loved you.

559
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,080
and died tragically under the gate tower.

560
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,320
It's too cold. Let's have some hot tea.

561
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,520
Let's find a shelter.

562
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,040
Here.

563
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,240
Fish maw.

564
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,760
That man looks like an old friend.

565
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,560
Let's go back.

566
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,440
Come with me.

567
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,920
I will clear your name.

568
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,840
How dare you!

569
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,840
Father.

570
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,680
He's not suspecting me of abandoning me.

571
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,960
but the world.

572
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,960
He is

573
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,960
Abandon him.

574
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,960
He doesn't like the world.

575
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,520
Neither do I.

576
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,920
So I must trust him.

577
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,960
and help him.

578
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,960
What's so good about him?

579
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,200
Because he's not smart.

580
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,840
Father is smart.

581
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,560
You know you can protect yourself with your mouth shut.

582
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,840
I'm smart too.

583
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,920
I hit the south wall

584
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
and understood it.

585
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,880
But Father,

586
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,880
In this world,

587
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,400
in this world.

588
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,240
We investigate the case

589
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,800
is not a living person who can speak.

590
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,240
but a dead person who can never speak.

591
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,800
If you really want to clear your name,

592
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,720
you should first

593
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,160
to yourself.

594
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,040
Their death is your death.

595
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,400
Their injustice is your injustice.

596
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,800
Why must you go through this thorn road?

597
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,680
and die like them.

598
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,880
and crawled back from the Netherworld.

599
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,360
My heart, spleen, lungs were crushed.

600
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,720
I dare to say I have a clear conscience.

601
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,760
Father.

602
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,760
I didn't know until I met him.

603
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,440
People

604
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,560
can live in another way.

605
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,520
Calm down.

606
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,440
Crazy!

607
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,600
Benefactor.

608
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,240
Do you know

609
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,120
how hard this road is?

610
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,640
Father.

611
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,120
I'm awake.

612
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,640
I can't go back.

613
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,000
Benefactor,

614
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
I want to speak for myself.

615
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,440
Get lost.

616
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,960
Don't forget to go home.

617
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,360
Okay.

618
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,760
Sir.

619
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,080
Why are you here?

620
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,160
My father doesn't allow you to follow me.

621
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,120
Don't make him angry.

622
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,360
You didn't ask me to inquire.

623
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,840
Li and the others came to our Ministry of Revenue these days.

624
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,000
They seem to be investigating.

625
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,560
Dong Zhaodong, Assistant Minister of Revenue,

626
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,120
It’s part of our business to distribute the payment.

627
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,440
Why is the signature Long Yan Nian, Minister of Works?

628
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,720
Brother Gongsun, you are white.

629
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,680
You can't

630
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,400
these things.

631
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,560
Okay, I'll go find him.

632
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,720
Aren't you investigating the case with Mr. Shen?

633
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,040
Why are you

634
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,480
have the mood to drink with me?

635
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,040
Don't mention it.

636
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:36,800
Here.

637
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,480
Here.

638
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,840
That cook

639
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,720
is not only cold,

640
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,680
but also clumsy.

641
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,320
You're as stubborn as a bull.

642
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,800
Just thinking about it makes me angry.

643
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,120
He

644
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,560
doesn't deserve

645
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,440
to be with Mr. Gongsun.

646
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,720
Brother Chaodong

647
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
are the most suitable for me.

648
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,960
Chaodong,

649
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,040
Do you remember?

650
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,240
Last month at the vase,

651
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,840
we were drunk.

652
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,160
It feels so good.

653
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,160
Here.

654
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Let's toast to our enjoyable time.

655
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,600
To our fullest.

656
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,800
Brother Zhao Dong.

657
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,920
Chaodong.

658
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,080
If it’s really Dong Chaodong,

659
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,120
there must be a trace.

660
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,120
Mr. Gongsun,

661
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,240
If you trust the wrong person,

662
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,720
you have to pay the price.

663
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,240
Brother Shen?

664
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,720
You know me?

665
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,880
Mr Dong asked me to give this to you.

666
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,440
The folding fan of Gongsun Li.

667
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,720
What did he say?

668
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,720
Mr Dong said

669
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,040
we need to retreat.

670
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,840
There's no turning back now.

671
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,160
Brother Shen.

672
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,480
Am I wrong?

673
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,680
You're right.

674
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,480
What does Dong mean?

675
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,120
The venomous snake is going to bite.

676
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,520
Li,

677
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,560
