1
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,120
Good for you.

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,320
You found so much rice.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,400
If the refugees had rice,

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,120
they wouldn't cause trouble.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,560
The refugees won't cause trouble.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,720
my gauze will be safe.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,920
is safe.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm here

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,160
to ask you to do something.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,160
I owe you.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,760
Go ahead.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,600
I want you to find

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,960
called Tian Deng.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,880
It's the one in the Fengdeku.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,840
The mole, right?

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,160
We were in the underground granary.

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,120
the person we lost

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,440
is most likely Tian Deng.

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,240
He knew we found the secret vault,

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,360
he would have escaped.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,320
Tell me.

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,440
He's just a storehouse.

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,320
created such a huge secret granary.

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,080
Tian Deng deserves to die.

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,760
He's not that capable.

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,840
He's just working for someone.

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
Locking up food during the disaster is a serious crime.

28
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,320
How dare you

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,640
to steal the relief grain.

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,760
The owner of the underground granary

31
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,120
must be powerful and powerful.

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,360
On the surface, we can't find anything.

33
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,440
We can only find this rat

34
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,760
to find this rat.

35
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,440
If the rats are not eliminated,

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,039
the people will suffer.

37
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,440
Let's investigate in secret.

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,840
Are you afraid of offending someone?

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
That's not all.

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,880
You've never been an official.

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,759
You don't understand.

42
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,320
The capital is not big.

43
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,800
But if someone makes up his mind

44
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
to hide like this.

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
you can't hold it.

46
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,440
The louder the noise,

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,800
the harder it is to succeed.

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,360
If we don't catch him,

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,320
No.

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,680
I want you to seal four gates

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
and make a big fuss on the street.

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,640
Let him know

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,080
as long as he drowns the capital,

54
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
he will be caught sooner or later.

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,360
and force him to escape.

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
Isn't this the fate of asking for fish?

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,280
In this case,

58
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,240
he has only one way to go.

59
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,840
Waterway?

60
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,240
Only one hole is left.

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
the rat will go inside regardless of its life.

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,240
Chef Shen.

63
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,960
Chef Shen is really something.

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,079
Peng Xiaoyu is catching Tian Deng everywhere.

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,880
Tian Deng sent someone to deliver a letter at this time.

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,920
to save him.

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,120
The granary is gone.

68
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
Tian Deng wants to live.

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,079
Come here.

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,760
Nice fabric.

71
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
Strong.

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,040
For my father,

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,520
for my father.

74
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,040
was gone overnight.

75
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,160
The granary was exposed.

76
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,920
Tian Deng still wants to live.

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,960
Let me tell you.

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,160
Being a dog of the Pang family

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,960
can not bite.

80
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,320
But

81
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,640
If it bites its owner's hand,

82
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,600
it should be stewed with meat.

83
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,640
Got it?

84
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:37,960
Yes.

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,160
Got it.

86
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,920
Mr. Xie, please spare my life.

87
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,160
Be careful.

88
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Put it here

89
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,400
Come and help me.

90
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
Since you came to me,

91
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,760
you want to be a dog of our Pang family.

92
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
for a year, right?

93
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes.

94
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,519
I asked you to do something.

95
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,480
Now it's all in vain.

96
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,800
I should send you off myself.

97
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,200
You received my letter

98
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,760
after receiving my letter.

99
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,200
I think

100
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,280
you've figured out where to go.

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,040
I heard you have no parents or children.

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,320
You died three years ago.

103
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,560
You ruined my plan.

104
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,320
You deserve this cup of tea.

105
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,440
in this cup of tea.

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,040
Peng Xiaoyu is outside.

107
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,040
All four gates are closed.

108
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,360
All the soldiers in the city

109
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,640
are guarding the city gate.

110
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,320
Do you know

111
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,880
why he chose to leave this waterway?

112
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,640
I think

113
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,120
Peng Xiaoyu is not capable

114
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,960
nor determination.

115
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,200
Only the Imperial Envoy Shen Song

116
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,520
can do anything.

117
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,960
I think

118
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
he left this for me.

119
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
to me.

120
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,720
He left the way to me.

121
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,320
So I walked up.

122
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,760
So I wrote to you

123
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
and told you

124
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,480
if you don't protect me,

125
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,159
I'll confess to you.

126
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm sure you won't forgive me

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,400
can't tolerate me.

128
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,720
Half of the sailors outside are soldiers.

129
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,560
They followed Lord Shen's order

130
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,840
to guard here in disguise.

131
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,040
Young Master's whereabouts have been leaked.

132
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,680
It's too late.

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Lord Shen must be somewhere nearby.

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,520
Young Master.

135
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
You can't escape.

136
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,640
When he arrives, he will find out

137
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,920
You killed me to silence me.

138
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
You even want to drag me into this.

139
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,960
Who are you?

140
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
I...

141
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,200
I'm a ghost.

142
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,760
Three years ago,

143
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,200
The ghost who died in the house.

144
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,480
Two years ago,

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,760
Duke of Security found me.

146
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,400
He knew that the granary

147
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,800
to help you steal them.

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,640
So he arranged me to enter the granary

149
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,520
He taught me to impress you with my conscience

150
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,800
to steal food for you.

151
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
He also told me

152
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,640
you wanted to kill Lord Shen.

153
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,040
Let me dig out the tunnel

154
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,080
and head straight to the private storehouse.

155
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
and bring Lord Shen to find the grain.

156
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,400
The grain that was from me

157
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,200
has finally returned.

158
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,680
Pang Yu.

159
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,040
It's time to settle the score between us.

160
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,360
Three years ago,

161
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,240
the Pang family framed Guan family to rebel.

162
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,440
The Yang clan was destroyed.

163
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,600
You must have never thought of that.

164
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,760
the Spectre of Guan family

165
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,160
will come back to you.

166
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,400
and pester you.

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
No.

168
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,560
It's none of my business.

169
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,720
Who are you?

170
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,720
I...

171
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm your aunt's servant.

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,159
Sister.

173
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,240
Although you married the butler,

174
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,040
you are a woman of the Pang family.

175
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,080
Use your blood

176
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,480
with your blood.

177
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,240
Aunt.

178
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,280
You work for me.

179
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,560
Mistress saved me from hunger and cold.

180
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,920
and raised me to work in the manor.

181
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
After the matron married into the butler,

182
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,960
she misses you the most.

183
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,040
Her good nephew.

184
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
She knew Pang Ji was strict with you.

185
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,680
She took care of you at home.

186
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,760
I still care about you after I got married.

187
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,680
But you...

188
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
When the Mistress was killed by Pang Ji,

189
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
did you say something for her?

190
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,360
Did you see

191
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,760
your father killed Mistress

192
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,240
and framed the Guan family with her life.

193
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,320
for the Pang family

194
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
in the court.

195
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,799
In your eyes,

196
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,799
everyone is a pawn.

197
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,760
It's none of my business.

198
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,039
It's all my father's doing.

199
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,440
Pang Yu.

200
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
For the past year,

201
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,600
you must have had nightmares every night.

202
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,040
How did you know?

203
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,200
When I first came here,

204
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,560
the first time I came here,

205
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,320
I found

206
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,960
you kept the white ribbon that strangled Mistress.

207
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,960
Then I put a stone

208
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,360
on the white ribbon.

209
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,600
The more guilty you worship,

210
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,360
you will become more frightened and dreamy.

211
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,200
If you're not guilty,

212
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,480
you won't see ghosts.

213
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
If you're guilty,

214
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
you will be haunted by ghosts.

215
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,680
You...

216
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,920
Are you going to kill me?

217
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,200
Kill you?

218
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,960
Death is too light for you.

219
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
You stole government grains.

220
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,200
the Pang family will clear your name.

221
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,640
But if the Imperial Envoy sees you

222
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,960
kill me,

223
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,360
Guess what will happen?

224
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,320
Pang Yu.

225
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,160
I want the entire Pang family

226
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,480
to be buried with the matron.

227
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,480
I won't let you succeed.

228
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,800
The Pang family won't collapse.

229
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,040
Don't you want to kill me?

230
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
Come on, kill me.

231
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,200
No.

232
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,880
Don't you want to kill me?

233
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,720
Kill me!

234
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,520
Don't you want to kill me?

235
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Kill me!

236
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,680
No!

237
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
Mistress.

238
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,160
Tian Deng.

239
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Thank you.

240
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,920
Zhan Mao'er.

241
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,760
Coming

242
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,400
Busy.

243
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,960
It's annoying.

244
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,120
It's been a few days since I submitted the memorials to His Majesty.

245
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,040
There's still no sound.

246
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
Back then, it was Empress Dowager's order.

247
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,960
It must be hard for the emperor.

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,520
If the way of university

249
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,040
is the best.

250
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,960
Chef.

251
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,840
We did our best this time.

252
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,400
If there's anything else,

253
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,880
I won't feel guilty.

254
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,640
With food in the capital,

255
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
this difficulty

256
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,960
is finally over.

257
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,320
Rudong.

258
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Rudong!

259
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,200
It depends on fate.

260
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
I wonder

261
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,080
Are you satisfied?

262
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Speaking of this,

263
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,280
I found someone

264
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,960
I found someone.

265
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,200
Who?

266
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,440
Chen Xian.

267
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,960
Jin Hyun.

268
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,440
Who is it?

269
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,320
Chen Xian

270
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,080
was also Mr. Guan's student.

271
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,360
He liked him very much.

272
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,120
I just don't want

273
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,160
he fell in love with

274
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,520
his second daughter.

275
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,680
Mr. Ou forbids marriage to enter the court.

276
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,680
So Chen Xian

277
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,920
was gradually forgotten.

278
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,600
He is a disciple,

279
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,960
and his son-in-law.

280
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,520
But three years ago, when the family was wiped out,

281
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,200
there was no such couple.

282
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,720
I thought

283
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,280
the Duke of Security is seeking justice for you.

284
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,120
I'm afraid

285
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,320
is Chen Xian.

286
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,440
If it's really him,

287
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,920
he would have done a great job.

288
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,840
Unfortunately, I only met him once.

289
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,480
I didn't expect

290
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,600
he would create such a career in the future.

291
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,520
Sister Qin.

292
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Sister Qin.

293
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,160
Is Sister Qin not back?

294
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,440
She stole it.

295
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,080
He doesn’t eat at the kitchen.

296
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,600
Is it Mr. Shen Song, the Imperial Envoy?

297
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,960
What is it?

298
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,440
Two days ago,

299
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,240
a girl came to our Imperial Bureau

300
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,560
to check Chen Xiuqian's student status.

301
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,400
He said the Imperial Envoy wanted her.

302
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,360
What kind of girl is she?

303
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,960
She didn't leave her name.

304
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,160
He only said it belongs to the Imperial Envoy.

305
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,280
Destiny?

306
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,280
Master.

307
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,360
Qin.

308
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
Mingde Hall in Jiangning.

309
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,960
No.

310
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,960
The countryside school is called a museum.

311
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,840
It's only been three years.

312
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
In the past or in school

313
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,640
There's something wrong with Chen Xiuqian's student record.

314
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,040
Chen Xiuqian

315
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,480
Zhan Mao'er.

316
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,280
Is the Duke of Security still there?

317
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,960
Give it to me.

318
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,160
Luckily I didn't throw it away.

319
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,840
Gongsun Li.

320
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,240
Look at these words.

321
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,120
Is there any problem?

322
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,160
No.

323
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
Exactly the same.

324
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,960
No.

325
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,280
How could a person write this?

326
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,160
Exactly the same.

327
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,240
Every word on it

328
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,280
on it.

329
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,360
Totally the same

330
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
It's not handwritten.

331
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,360
It's a living handprint.

332
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,360
Living characters.

333
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,480
It's very useful.

334
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,920
The interior

335
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,760
Chen Xiuqian is now an editor

336
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,480
I'm ashamed that I'm not good at it.

337
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,840
I only had an interior at the Imperial Academy.

338
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,240
Have a look.

339
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,240
Brother Chen,

340
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,960
Do you know why I came to you today?

341
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,200
Please go ahead.

342
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,360
You...

343
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,360
right?

344
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,360
Chen Xian.

345
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,680
This name

346
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,040
called this name for a long time.

347
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,360
Are you really Chen Xian?

348
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,720
Chen Zhongming.

349
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,400
Wait.

350
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,920
When I met you before,

351
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,200
you weren't like this.

352
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,400
At the reception,

353
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,920
I lost to

354
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,560
Brother Gongsun's "Fairy Magpie Bridge"

355
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,040
I lost three glasses of wine.

356
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,600
It's really you.

357
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,320
Yes.

358
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,880
My face has changed.

359
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm a medium-level person.

360
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,600
I'll solve your confusion later.

361
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,680
But you know I'm Chen Xian.

362
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,920
you'll know

363
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,160
I'm the Duke of Security.

364
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,760
But you two,

365
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,720
what can you do to me?

366
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,760
You're Mr. Guan's family.

367
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,560
After the incident,

368
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,680
you hid your identity

369
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,360
to modify the school record

370
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,400
and go to the bus

371
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,480
to reverse the case for you.

372
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
is Qianniang's wish.

373
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,320
and the promise I made three years ago.

374
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,880
You arranged Tian Deng, right?

375
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,280
Because of your design,

376
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,960
Pang Yu has been imprisoned.

377
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,880
So what?

378
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,160
Peng Hyo-yu won't go to trial

379
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,200
nor a trial.

380
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,119
My son.

381
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,400
My teacher.

382
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,839
More than 400 lives of my classmate.

383
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,800
Officer Shen,

384
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,720
Is it really like a weed?

385
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,359
Why am I the one who can't sleep

386
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,079
I'm the one who can't sleep

387
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,520
not Pang Ji.

388
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,720
Brother Chen.

389
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,960
A master should know how to behave.

390
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,400
Bad deeds can't do good deeds.

391
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,960
Please return in time.

392
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,360
After reading this letter,

393
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,440
after reading this letter.

394
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,960
In this world,

395
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,440
even if you have no intention,

396
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,880
it also depends on fate.

397
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,080
If the sky is right,

398
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,480
If we act rashly,

399
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,560
Personnel loss.

400
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,240
Now,

401
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,760
it's the time for everyone to succeed.

402
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,600
If the gentry are not eliminated,

403
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,800
three years later,

404
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,080
in three years.

405
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,640
If we want to hurt Ludong,

406
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,720
the people and the officials

407
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,600
all see the disadvantages of Ludong.

408
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,280
But if there is a disaster,

409
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,840
the government will help us.

410
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,520
The disadvantages of Ludong

411
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,800
might be hidden.

412
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,320
So, sir,

413
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,760
tell me in advance.

414
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,360
I've thought about it for a long time.

415
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,960
Only by burying suspicion

416
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,120
with my death.

417
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,280
Three years later,

418
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,200
During the disaster,

419
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,960
in the imperial court,

420
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
in the court,

421
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,320
everyone will bear the injustice of the steward.

422
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,600
Everyone hates the disadvantages of Ludong.

423
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,440
Officials are not Min's parents.

424
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,160
Min is the parents of the government.

425
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,480
sacrificing for the people

426
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,720
is the duty

427
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,120
is my duty.

428
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,800
Father. Sir.

429
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,360
Sir.

430
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,720
The best way

431
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,960
For people,

432
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,840
if we sail on the boundless sea

433
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,960
Far shore

434
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,320
cannot be reached.

435
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
I'll go full speed ahead

436
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,480
Although I've improved a bit,

437
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,520
but you have a good smile.

438
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,680
I want to enter the palace.

439
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
I'm here to avenge

440
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,800
for Mr. Guan's spirit.

441
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Mr. Guan said

442
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,320
everyone has their own difficulties.

443
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,080
but we should do our best

444
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,960
and do my best.

445
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,600
Mr. Guan was once the Grand Tutor of His Majesty.

446
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,320
He must have taught His Majesty this before.

447
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,360
Have you forgotten?

448
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,680
The bones have been buried in the soil for three years.

449
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,880
Mr. Guan.

450
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,080
I’m wronged.

451
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,680
I accept the decree.

452
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,400
Order Shen Song to investigate the fields thoroughly

453
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,160
and bring peace to Ludong.

454
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,560
I want to re-investigate the farmland case.

455
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,400
and give Mr. Guan

456
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,400
to the Rudong refugees.

457
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,080
Punish Pang Yu.

458
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,880
I, Pang Ji,

459
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,600
framed my butler

460
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,040
and then embezzled the disaster grain.

461
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,760
causing starvation everywhere.

462
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,040
The people are suffering.

463
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,120
If Pangji is still alive,

464
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,640
the court will be in danger.

465
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,440
If the Pang family doesn't collapse,

466
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,040
and our country will suffer.

467
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,440
I want to sue the government.

468
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,120
Peng Xiaoyu, you...

469
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,320
You're a bully.

470
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,880
You've been living on your own.

471
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,160
You covered up for the Pang family.

472
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,400
Bah!

473
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,760
Bastard!

474
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,840
Bastard!

475
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,680
Look.

476
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
It's been tortured.

477
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,080
Now you're full of

478
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,800
you are Mr. Guan.

479
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,880
You've been insulting the Pang family.

480
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,200
His Majesty ordered

481
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,720
to investigate the case of Mr. Guan three years ago.

482
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,760
and issued an edict to the Pang family.

483
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,240
Minister Pang Ji

484
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
is on his way back to the capital.

485
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,120
to cooperate with the Supreme Court.

486
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,440
If we keep investigating,

487
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,360
the dirty tricks of the Pang family

488
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
will always float on the stage.

489
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,240
If everything goes well,

490
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,960
the Pang family will collapse.

491
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,800
He can understand.

492
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,800
He's pretending.

493
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,600
Your father...

494
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,240
Pang Ji

495
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
he only blamed you

496
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,600
on you.

497
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,800
At most, he'll be punished for not being strict with the family.

498
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,640
And you can't live.

499
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,440
Not enough.

500
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,520
The Pang family colluded with the Ludong family

501
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,400
The disaster is coming.

502
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,800
Chop their heads.

503
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,640
Cut their heads off.

504
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,840
Let me out!

505
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,680
Let me out!

506
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,640
I'll interrogate him.

507
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,320
The Pang family is afraid he'll spit.

508
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,960
Let me out.

509
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,800
to get me out.

510
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,400
Find a doctor for him.

511
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,760
Okay.

512
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,440
Let me out.

513
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,720
Let me out!

514
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,560
Minister.

515
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,680
Done.

516
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,840
Yes.

517
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,400
I used Soul Disappearing Pill for you.

518
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,920
Even if you torture him,

519
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm not afraid that you can't hold on.

520
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,280
But that pill

521
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,440
can only last for seven days.

522
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Seven days later,

523
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,560
after seven days.

524
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,320
If the government tortures him again,

525
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,080
I'm afraid...

526
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Seven days is enough.

527
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,520
Did you find out

528
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,760
Did you find out?

529
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,960
It's Chen Xiuqian.

530
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,840
He's from the royal mansion.

531
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,440
is the son-in-law of Prince Rui.

532
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,080
Yes.

533
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,480
because of the engagement.

534
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,600
They don't seem familiar.

535
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,960
Since it's not Prince Rui's order,

536
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,840
he must be the remnant of the steward.

537
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,320
A lonely soul.

538
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,560
I know too much.

539
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,360
Don't keep it.

540
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,320
Yes.

541
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,200
The bookstore and his family

542
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,160
and his house.

543
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,880
Where is the mansion?

544
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,800
Not here either.

545
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,960
Why did he disappear

546
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,160
disappear?

547
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,440
It doesn't matter if he disappears.

548
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,160
First, Qin hasn't come back.

549
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,240
Secondly, Pang Yu is crazy.

550
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,400
to interrogate the old case.

551
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,040
Chen Xiuqian is the last witness.

552
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,680
No.

553
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,840
He is a witness.

554
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,640
We know.

555
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,960
But the Pang family may know.

556
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,640
Is it possible that

557
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,960
fall into the hands of the Pang family?

558
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,560
That's what I'm afraid of.

559
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,360
We're looking for the missing one outside.

560
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120
You bastard!

561
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,480
You should have died three years ago.

562
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,920
Today, we kindly sent you off.

563
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,480
to keep that old man company.

564
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,680
Who dares to kill my people?

565
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,760
If Qi is obedient, break his limbs.

566
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Kill those who disobey.

567
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,480
Yes.

568
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Mr. Chen, stay with us

569
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,960
stay with us.

570
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,440
After the court,

571
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Brother Chen will be safe.

572
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,920
Please forgive me.

573
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,960
I read the Yin Talisman Scripture too.

574
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,400
Let me take a look.

575
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,400
Ambush!

576
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,320
Hurry!

577
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,160
Find cover.

578
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,120
Get out first.

579
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,800
Let's go.

580
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,440
Chen Xian.

581
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,720
Jin Hyun.

582
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,880
Are you okay?

583
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,440
Qin.

584
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,480
Find cover!

585
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,280
The testimony.

586
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,960
The best.

587
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,400
Qianniang.

588
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,240
Teacher.

589
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,280
I...

590
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm here for you.

591
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,560
Jin Xian.

592
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,400
Jin Xian.

593
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,880
Jin Xian.

594
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,480
Jin Xian.

595
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,720
Chen Xian.

596
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,440
Let's go.

597
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,760
Set the horse at the palace gate.

598
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,960
to see you overnight.

599
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,200
Pang Ji.

600
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,200
You've crossed the line.

601
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,440
On Mother's boat,

602
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,560
The oars are our Pang family.

603
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,600
The oars are rotten.

604
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,360
Are you threatening me?

605
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,280
I dare not.

606
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Three years ago,

607
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,880
I asked you to manage it

608
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,960
because the gentry are all in the previous dynasty.

609
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,800
If the gentry's interests were affected by then,

610
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,200
the court will be in turmoil.

611
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,760
Although I have issued an edict,

612
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,560
I never let you

613
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,160
colluded with the Rudong clan.

614
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,680
Now Jin Xian's testimony

615
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,280
has exposed this matter.

616
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,360
How can I

617
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,680
save you?

618
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,240
Please show mercy.

619
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,280
I didn't expect

620
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
to bury clues

621
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,240
with his death.

622
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,040
Three years later,

623
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,920
he used Chen Xian again.

624
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
It's not that I'm still alive.

625
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,960
The Rehabilitation

626
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,640
is really an extraordinary talent.

627
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,400
He can change day after death.

628
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,960
The three-year plan

629
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,640
Like a cicada.

630
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,440
He's an old cicada.

631
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,440
You can do it too.

632
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,560
Idiot.

633
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,400
You've been working with the Rudong clan for years.

634
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,480
you should have something on you.

635
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,640
Now that His Majesty wants to hurt Ludong,

636
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,680
to kill Lu Dong.

637
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,840
The evidence you have

638
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,880
are exactly what His Majesty needs.

639
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,160
Mother.

640
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,080
Pang Ji.

641
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,160
Don't be too greedy.

642
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,080
Uncle.

643
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,720
Look at this.

644
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,400
Pangji

645
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,560
said he colluded with the Ludong clan.

646
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,520
But now he's willing to reveal it.

647
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,680
to investigate

648
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,040
that the family colluded with private soldiers.

649
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,320
He's willing to break his wrist to survive.

650
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,360
He gave a good excuse to send troops.

651
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,160
Do you admit it or not?

652
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,160
With the evidence of recruiting soldiers,

653
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,920
the big trouble in Ludong has been solved.

654
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,960
He helped us.

655
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,360
Besides, he went to Ci Ning Palace last night.

656
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,520
It was his idea.

657
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm afraid His Majesty will give me some face.

658
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,560
I've already honoured your kindness.

659
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,840
and re-investigated the old case.

660
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,240
To clear Mr. Guan's name, he pulled out Pang family's claws.

661
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,400
As for Pang Ji,

662
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,840
let him live for a few more days.

663
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,320
Announce the decree.

664
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,240
The eight clans of Ludong are private soldiers of Tungtan.

665
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,560
They are ambitious

666
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,040
and overturned the fields.

667
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,440
and harm the people.

668
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,920
is a heinous crime.

669
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,120
Hence, he was stripped of his title.

670
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,640
The implicator will investigate.

671
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,720
The Guan family is loyal.

672
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,560
He was wronged.

673
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,920
The title of Duke of Security was conferred.

674
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,440
The valiant spirit of the steward shall be sealed one by one.

675
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:39,960
Yes. Yes.

676
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,200
Pass.

677
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,520
Xian.

678
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
Thank you.

679
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
I’ll always remember it.

680
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,960
Money bag.

681
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,760
The chef always said there is no ghost in the world.

682
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,040
But if Mr. Guan can return his soul,

683
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,240
that would be great.

684
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,920
There are no ghosts in the world.

685
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,320
But your spirit is still there.

686
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,440
We are your future.

687
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,040
Sir.

688
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,680
is also our future.

689
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,280
His Majesty gave you a position.

690
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,680
Why won't you accept it?

691
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,560
Haven't you had enough bird aura?

692
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,120
Isn't it good to be an official?

693
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,400
To maintain its peace.

694
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,960
The Qi family hasn't done it yet.

695
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,120
how can we rule the world?

696
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,280
I don't believe it.

697
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,080
You're just giving His Majesty a hard time.

698
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Shut up!

699
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,800
You guys made up.

700
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,200
Have you ever been bad?

701
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,560
Chef, where is my sugar bag?

702
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,720
Here.

703
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,880
What candy?

704
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,520
It's not my candy.

705
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,960
Your malt candy

706
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
won't hurt your teeth if you eat too much.

707
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,440
I've changed it for you.

708
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,480
But the owner gave it to me.

709
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,200
I gave it to you.

710
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,080
Why, chef?

711
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,560
Why do you make her angry?

712
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,200
she has candy.

713
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,240
Where is my candy?

714
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,520
Chef.

715
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,680
I never stopped you from harming you.

716
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,960
You should trust me now.

717
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,120
You may not be trustworthy,

718
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,040
[I'll do my best.] I'll do my best.

719
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,760
Chef.

720
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,520
Qin, where is the chef?

721
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,080
Chef.

722
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
A pigeon is on the wall.

723
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,400
on the wall.

724
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,160
In Wuding Pavilion,

725
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,960
I'm guilty.

726
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,680
The innocent has changed.

727
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,520
[He's completely different.]

728
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,600
I'm confused about

729
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,360
I'm here to resolve my confusion.

730
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,960
Wuding Pavilion.

731
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,160
This building

732
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,520
changed Chen Xian's face.

733
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,760
Virtuous Villa.

734
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,920
Keep a low profile.

735
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,560
Actor table.

736
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,199
