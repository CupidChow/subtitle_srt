1
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,720
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,880
go find Peng Xiaoyu.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,720
Why?

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,960
That fool acted on his own after I chased him away.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,080
Now he's in the hands of that venomous snake.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,880
If we use troops now,

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,240
I'm afraid Gongsun Li will die.

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,360
If you want me to find out the truth,

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,640
you can only help me find him.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,200
I only care about you.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,080
That's because you're the chess piece that Master has chosen.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,880
What does others have to do with me?

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,840
You can control me.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,920
I can handle you.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,600
Oh.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,520
Are you talking about the butler's death?

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,880
Yes, I did.

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,720
So what?

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,760
He is afraid of the power

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,960
and let the innocent die.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,920
It's my magic.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,120
He died

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,759
because he's guilty.

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,759
He is guilty,

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,960
you have no right to torture him.

26
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,840
Self-punishment?

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,880
You should know

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,360
the evil in everyone's heart

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,640
is torturing himself.

30
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,600
I didn't kill the watchman.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,000
but the ghost in his heart.

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,720
If you say I killed him,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,960
I won't admit it.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,160
I understand

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,440
I understand.

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,880
I only have one question.

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,920
How can I help you?

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,480
You know what I want.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,079
You become the master's pawn.

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,079
When I'm happy,

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,720
when I’m happy.

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,600
Do you have to control me now?

43
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,480
If you want something,

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,440
I have bargaining chips.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,720
If I don't control you now,

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,640
if I don't control you now?

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,840
Okay.

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,000
Please cooperate with us this time.

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,960
Mr. Gongsun,

50
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,760
I don't think you know what pain is.

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm jealous.

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,160
You've lost your career,

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,200
you still have countless glories.

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,440
Forget it.

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,040
You're going to die anyway.

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
My ancestors practised medicine.

57
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,720
I had a good life.

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,480
Unfortunately,

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,480
my father is a gambler.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,400
He lost his family because of gambling.

61
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,600
and was killed in the gambling house.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,680
My mother and I

63
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,400
can only survive by eating wild greens.

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,560
In order to support me,

65
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,760
to help me study.

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,280
One day,

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,600
my mother started coughing.

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,240
I didn't expect

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,000
she coughed up blood.

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,560
She didn't even dare to call a doctor to visit.

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,560
I know it's tuberculosis.

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,520
But

73
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,480
I failed.

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,480
But that loser got on the list.

75
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,640
Heaven is not mine.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm not convinced.

77
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,320
I should have countless glories.

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,399
countless wealth.

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,920
Those who stepped on my head

80
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,040
are trampled on by me.

81
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,120
Including you.

82
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,200
What are you looking at?

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,760
What are you looking at?

84
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,880
What are you looking at?

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,440
Don't look at me like that.

86
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,200
Don't look at me like that.

87
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,480
I know

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,920
I was exposed

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
was already exposed.

90
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,200
But now you are in my hands.

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,440
what can Shen Song do to me?

92
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,800
Even if he dares to risk your life,

93
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,880
Peng Xiaoyu wouldn't dare.

94
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,920
My lord.

95
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
About the incident at Lantern Tower,

96
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,520
We have cleared the truth.

97
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,960
The criminal is Dong Zhaodong, Deputy Minister of Revenue.

98
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,440
The witness is here.

99
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,680
Please investigate, my lord.

100
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,200
In that case,

101
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
Guards!

102
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,960
Tie these three people

103
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,240
who framed the official.

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,720
Yes.

105
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,640
Slowly.

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,159
It won't change.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,480
It won't change.

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,520
Why?

109
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,880
So the person you threatened

110
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,320
not Shen Song,

111
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
but Peng Hyo-yu.

112
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,680
That's right.

113
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,320
If only

114
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,560
only Chef Shen,

115
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,680
I can kill him to silence him.

116
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,880
But now,

117
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,120
I want him to investigate faster.

118
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,360
I want him to find the witness

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,760
because of you.

120
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,440
Yes.

121
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,520
My nightmare

122
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,480
Chef Shen and the witness

123
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,320
should be in Peng Xiaoyu's hands.

124
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,680
I told Peng Hyo-ok

125
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,120
If I kill them,

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,840
I will spare your life.

127
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,920
Peng Hyo-yu will kill them

128
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,920
I will kill them.

129
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,080
By then,

130
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,159
will be the real dead without evidence.

131
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,240
Who can do anything to me?

132
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,160
Chef Shen

133
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,320
He can't imagine what he did

134
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,840
is helping me out.

135
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,200
Don't ask.

136
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,400
Behead him.

137
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,160
Tell the public that the three of them refused to arrest.

138
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,240
and had to be executed.

139
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,480
Bastard!

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I've been with you for so many years.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
Can you bear to kill me?

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,360
Peng Xiaoyu.

143
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,400
You may be foolish,

144
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
you're not bloodthirsty.

145
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,160
If the murderer threatens you,

146
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,520
if he threatens you today,

147
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,920
you will regret in the future.

148
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,159
Behead!

149
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,320
My lord.

150
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,159
Benefactor!

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,480
Qin, Zhan Mao'er.

152
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,000
How dare you!

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,840
How dare you!

154
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,800
Are you trying to steal people from the government?

155
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,159
Yes, we are.

156
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,280
Bastard!

157
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,920
This is not a trivial matter.

158
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,560
Take them down!

159
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,120
We can't let them escape.

160
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,920
You know

161
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,800
whether they are guilty or not.

162
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
If you can do it,

163
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,600
Grandpa Zhan's blade

164
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,240
specializes in killing animals who have lost their conscience.

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,240
Those who disobey will be punished.

166
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,000
Who dares?

167
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,240
Let's see who dares.

168
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,760
Let's go.

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,880
Go after them!

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,280
We have to.

171
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,160
Catch him!

172
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,040
Draw a picture.

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
Peng Hyo-yu, you piece of trash.

174
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,240
I have you.

175
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,640
I want to see what they can do to me.

176
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,320
Run!

177
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,160
The unparalleled Mr. Gongsun

178
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,520
should have a better place to go.

179
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,280
Why are you two together?

180
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,680
He was worried that a crazy man would watch you from the roof of the government office.

181
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,080
I just want to see

182
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
what will happen

183
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,680
who believed in the government?

184
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,840
Thank you for your help.

185
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,320
Why should I help you?

186
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,680
But since Master likes you,

187
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
your life

188
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,040
your life.

189
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,360
Dong Zhaodong.

190
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,680
You are the only witness now.

191
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,960
I brought a banquet to the rich men in the eastern suburbs today.

192
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
You pretended to be a servant and went out with the carriage.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,040
to keep you alive.

194
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,920
When the capital is over,

195
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,760
we'll invite you to the capital to testify.

196
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,880
What about you?

197
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,760
Gongsun Li is still in the hands of that fake.

198
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,920
We can't leave.

199
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,880
Chef.

200
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,000
Someone sent this letter to Feng Le Restaurant.

201
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,880
If you want Gongsun Li to survive,

202
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,720
at 5 p.m., we'll meet in the private room of the Sky-subsidiaries.

203
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,400
Gongsun Li.

204
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,560
Suspect Shen Song. Arrest him.

205
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
obstructing the government.

206
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,360
You'll be punished.

207
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,000
Before your letter came,

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,160
I knew that after this banquet,

209
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,000
you and I will only be free.

210
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,960
I had a full meal before I was beheaded.

211
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,600
He won.

212
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,040
What's the rush?

213
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,520
Everyone is watching.

214
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,920
I don't think you dare.

215
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,360
I'll treat this meal as a gift for you.

216
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,440
You wait outside.

217
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,320
Yes.

218
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,600
Be careful.

219
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,320
Wild vegetable soup.

220
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,080
What does it mean?

221
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Do you know why I ordered this vegetable soup for you?

222
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
There is a candidate

223
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,400
from a poor family.

224
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,200
How poor?

225
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,160
If we have wild greens soup at home,

226
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,440
I'll be satisfied.

227
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,960
But he is ambitious.

228
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,440
He wanted to be successful.

229
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,000
So he went to the capital to take the exam.

230
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,440
Three years ago,

231
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,520
he met another candidate on the way to take the exam.

232
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,640
Cheers!

233
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,080
They look alike.

234
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,040
and became best friends.

235
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,320
But in the end,

236
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,960
he failed.

237
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,800
The other one

238
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
was on the list.

239
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,000
He was jealous.

240
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,120
He was very dissatisfied.

241
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,960
So, he tricked him to drink the poisoned wine in the name of the banquet.

242
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,960
Brother Zhao Dong.

243
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,640
Brother Zhao Dong.

244
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,000
Then, he dumped his body and buried him in a mass grave.

245
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,000
Fortunately, those who pass the exam should not die.

246
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
He's just unconscious.

247
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,960
for days.

248
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,880
But the loser took his name and became an official.

249
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,880
But he found that the winner was still alive.

250
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,840
So he sent an assassin to kill him.

251
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,720
How vicious.

252
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,000
The peach is stiff.

253
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,600
He's good.

254
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,280
My lord.

255
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,720
Try this peach plum sashimi.

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,080
After becoming an official,

257
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,960
the fake thought about the marriage of the winner.

258
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,320
According to his handwriting,

259
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,480
the woman,

260
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,880
which means Long Yu'er had a letter contact.

261
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,800
But Master Long

262
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,200
doesn't like a minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

263
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,200
He still refuses to marry his daughter off.

264
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,240
So he harbors evil thoughts

265
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,680
and tricked Long Yu'er out.

266
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,800
Yu'er.

267
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,640
But I didn't expect

268
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,160
Long Yu'er was loyal

269
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,400
He immediately recognized that he was a fake.

270
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,320
During the dispute,

271
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
Long Yu'er was killed by that man.

272
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,000
and buried her body at the lantern gate.

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
under the construction site.

274
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,760
Poor Long Yu'er.

275
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,120
A flower-like girl is like this.

276
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,920
As expected of a knowledgeable chef

277
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,320
The dialogue novel is amazing.

278
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,040
Don't worry. There's the last dish.

279
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,040
Serve.

280
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,200
Although Long Yan Nian doesn't want to marry that man,

281
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,680
he agreed to conspire with him

282
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,560
and lied about the number of people moving.

283
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,960
will be transferred to the Ministry of Revenue.

284
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,040
But he was greedy

285
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,840
He thought the money was too little.

286
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,600
So he used the chance to distribute the money

287
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,440
to kill 65 people who moved the people.

288
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,280
and buried them under the gate tower.

289
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,560
Just for 2,600 taels?

290
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,080
I wonder

291
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,760
Do you like it?

292
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,880
Just 2,600 taels.

293
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,160
Chef.

294
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,400
How dare you!

295
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,040
Do you know

296
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,200
are worse than dogs.

297
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,120
[Long Yan Nian lost his beloved daughter]

298
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,040
Long Yan Nian lost his beloved daughter.

299
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,920
and blamed the fake.

300
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,600
But unexpectedly,

301
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,880
he thought he had a dog,

302
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,720
but a wolf.

303
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,040
Old man.

304
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,880
If you want revenge,

305
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,040
go down with your daughter to be a good father and daughter.

306
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,720
Not only that,

307
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,680
he also kidnapped Gongsun Li who has been his friend

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,800
to threaten the government not to sentence him.

309
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,560
Do you think

310
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,200
is bold?

311
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,000
Where is the evidence?

312
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,680
It's not a court.

313
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,520
What evidence?

314
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,359
Everything is just a matter of truth.

315
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:08,960
My lord.

316
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,480
Don't bully good people.

317
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,880
You poisoned the wine.

318
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,800
Today, he came to collect debts.

319
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
and served the last dish.

320
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,280
Your heart is delicate,

321
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,359
but it's a mess.

322
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,160
There's no entrance to my chopsticks.

323
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,400
My lord.

324
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,480
Bye.

325
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,040
Single Chengming.

326
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,120
It's been three years.

327
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,680
Can't you recognize me?

328
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,440
Dong...

329
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,440
Dong Zhaodong.

330
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,440
What did you put in the dish?

331
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,280
Qin.

332
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,440
In My Dream.

333
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,400
Chaodong.

334
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,280
Don't make more mistakes.

335
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,440
With you here,

336
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,920
Chef Shen and the others dare not run away.

337
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,480
Once we catch them,

338
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,160
and you die,

339
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,120
Who in the world knows I'm guilty?

340
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,280
Gongsun Li.

341
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,440
Wait for your death.

342
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,800
A Dream of Nanke.

343
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,880
He was on guard when he passed by Nanke Building.

344
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I saw Gongsun Li in his dream.

345
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,400
but I only found the sound of water there.

346
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,280
You killed me and you want to save Gongsun Li?

347
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
No way!

348
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,360
Where is Gongsun Li?

349
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,040
He was born rich.

350
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
I was born poor.

351
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Why?

352
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,560
My hands are covered with blood.

353
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,080
You have poisoned me again.

354
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,040
Gongsun Li,

355
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,440
Just wait to die with me.

356
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,240
I finally admit it.

357
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,680
I'll die anyway.

358
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,760
I'll admit it.

359
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,440
I killed those people.

360
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,800
I also killed Long Yu'er.

361
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,480
I also killed the old man

362
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,680
was also killed by me.

363
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,400
He asked me to lie about the number of people moving.

364
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,200
but he only gave me 5,000 taels.

365
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,480
How can I bear it?

366
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,960
How did you kill so many people alone?

367
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,600
Don't brag in front of me.

368
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,880
I'm boasting.

369
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,960
A cook is a cook.

370
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,600
The Ministry of Revenue is responsible for supervising.

371
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,360
I used my position

372
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,960
to poison those people in the suburbs of the capital.

373
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,200
and buried them in the sandstone cart

374
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,680
and buried under that grand foundation.

375
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,840
You're crazy.

376
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
In terms of madness,

377
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,320
You're the crazy ones.

378
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,440
How dare you poison me in front of the officials?

379
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,160
Who said we poisoned him?

380
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,160
The money bag is right.

381
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,440
lies are shortcuts.

382
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,560
Li.

383
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,840
The criminal has confessed.

384
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,640
Keep this in mind.

385
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,000
I heard everything.

386
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,880
Don't worry.

387
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,040
He didn't poison you.

388
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,680
You lied to me.

389
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
You bastards!

390
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,160
How dare you lie to me?

391
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,160
Scholar Shan.

392
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,760
Go back to the court with us.

393
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,960
I'm an imperial official.

394
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,200
You...

395
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,240
I won't let you interrogate me.

396
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,760
If you want to save Gongsun Li,

397
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,960
It's too late.

398
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,560
See you on the way to hell.

399
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,440
He fell down.

400
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,280
He fell down.

401
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,800
Li, Zhan Mao'er.

402
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,760
Follow me to find someone.

403
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,040
Excuse me.

404
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,400
have you seen a gentleman?

405
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,400
He's not tall.

406
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,600
Have you seen a gentleman?

407
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,600
Excuse me.

408
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,280
about this tall?

409
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,040
No, no.

410
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,920
Thank you.

411
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,640
Chef.

412
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,800
How is it?

413
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,720
We've searched everywhere but couldn't find him.

414
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,880
We've searched around Bianhe.

415
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,720
Yes.

416
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,360
Search again.

417
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,560
Follow me.

418
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,640
Yes.

419
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,600
Chef.

420
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,960
How is it?

421
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,480
There's no clue at all.

422
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,280
If this goes on,

423
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,480
I'll be starving no matter how hard I try.

424
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
If you want to save Gongsun Li,

425
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,120
It's too late.

426
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,840
What time is it now?

427
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,880
Seven quarter past six.

428
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,200
Seven quarter past six.

429
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,720
Scholar Shan said...

430
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,800
It's too late.

431
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,760
It means even if he doesn't do it,

432
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
the money bag will die.

433
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,920
It's too late.

434
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,600
It's too late.

435
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,440
9 p.m.

436
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,080
What exactly will happen at 7 p.m.

437
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,400
The sewage in the Imperial City was seized from Fushou Ravine at 7 p.m.

438
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,320
Fushou Ravine?

439
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
I haven’t found it.

440
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,240
Fushou Ravine?

441
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,720
Go!

442
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,360
You two keep looking.

443
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,560
Let's go.

444
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,040
Help!

445
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,000
Help!

446
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,960
Anyone else?

447
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,560
Am I

448
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,360
die here today?

449
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,880
Father.

450
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,320
I'm sorry.

451
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,480
This is the end of my life.

452
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,400
Let me take care of you from now on.

453
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,680
You look awkward.

454
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Who is it?

455
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,520
Chef

456
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,680
Chef

457
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm here.

458
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,440
Chef

459
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,520
Chef

460
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,760
I'm here.

461
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,400
I'm here.

462
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,760
I'm not dead yet.

463
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,440
Help me!

464
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,800
Hurry up. Cut the crap.

465
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm dying.

466
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Please hurry up.

467
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,840
Here's the water.

468
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,000
Let's go.

469
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,520
Go!

470
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,120
Hurry!

471
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,720
Go!

472
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,400
Go!

473
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,920
Go!

474
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,440
Go.

475
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,080
Go up

476
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,840
Chef come up

477
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,440
Hurry

478
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,560
Okay.

479
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,120
If we were two steps late,

480
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,520
I would have died down there.

481
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,800
Do whatever you want.

482
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,200
You're useless.

483
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
You still want to touch the hard stuff?

484
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,280
Chef, I have to help you.

485
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,560
If I don't help you,

486
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,640
you won't believe me.

487
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,840
You treat me as an outsider.

488
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,000
You're finally helpful.

489
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,040
We need to save one more person.

490
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,880
Besides,

491
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,080
if you die,

492
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,960
So what if I trust you?

493
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,600
I won't die.

494
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,080
Aren't you here to save me?

495
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,240
How did you know?

496
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,360
I just know

497
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
you don't want me to die.

498
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,000
right?

499
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
That scoundrel, Shan Xiucai.

500
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
to provoke me.

501
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,880
If you die,

502
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,280
I won't lose.

503
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,680
Your reward.

504
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,560
A parasite.

505
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,720
I want your eyes.

506
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,480
No.

507
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,480
Did the chef remember something?

508
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
I can't see clearly.

509
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,160
It's a memory.

510
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,320
I know that memory belongs to me.

511
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,920
But I don't remember anything.

512
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,680
Take your time and you'll see clearly.

513
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,880
Fire!

514
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,120
Fire!

515
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,880
Miss Qin.

516
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,440
Bad news! Fire!

517
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Fire!

518
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,720
Hurry up.

519
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,320
Look at the fire.

520
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,040
Someone accidentally knocked over the oil lamp

521
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,320
and ignited the space.

522
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,680
Chef.

523
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,960
I don't have a home.

524
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,440
Who is this?

525
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,920
Shen Shaodwen.

526
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,520
It’s been three years.

527
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
Do you still know me?

528
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,120
Eunuch Chen.

529
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,920
You solved the case.

530
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,800
Have you ever thought about

531
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,120
ask His Majesty for rewards?

532
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,360
Your Majesty.

533
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,120
Do you remember Shen Song?

534
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,960
Shen Shaoswen, accept the decree.

535
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,240
Look at you.

536
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,400
Humanity is...

537
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,000
you offended His Majesty three years ago.

538
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,440
In my opinion,

539
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,480
it seems that His Majesty has offended you.

540
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,640
I accept the decree.

541
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,720
Shen Shaodwen from Wuyang

542
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,720
You should be careful.

543
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,040
It may be able to solve problems.

544
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,560
He has no moral conduct and walked around the people.

545
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,920
for inspection.

546
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,320
The imperial edict is granted.

547
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,160
When the officials see the imperial edict, it's like meeting the emperor.

548
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,480
They must take advantage of it.

549
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,760
Don't refuse.

550
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,320
Being an Imperial Envoy is different.

551
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,520
It's strange that you refused to accept the recruitment of the master.

552
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,640
Now you've become the Imperial Envoy.

553
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,000
No class.

554
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,080
Not even a salary.

555
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,400
It seems that my money bag is still needed.

556
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,320
It's just a name.

557
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,520
to scare Peng Hyo-ok.

558
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,320
It saves me some trouble.

559
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,720
Peng Xiaoyu has asked Li

560
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,080
to remove our image last night.

561
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,200
Boss.

562
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,600
Three bowls of wontons.

563
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,400
Okay.

564
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,320
It still tastes the same.

565
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,600
I lived in Kyoto when I was young.

566
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,960
A kind sister

567
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,240
bought me a bowl of wonton.

568
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,960
Right here.

569
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,840
She said she would bring me to a good life.

570
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,960
I think she's the kindest person I've ever seen.

571
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,680
I want to follow her.

572
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,680
I can't even live a good life.

573
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,080
How can I promise you a good life?

574
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,840
I was abducted that night.

575
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,240
He said she sold me.

576
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,800
I was only eight then.

577
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,920
And that man was a beast.

578
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,400
I didn't let him succeed.

579
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,720
I killed him.

580
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,640
Then?

581
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,960
Where did you go?

582
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,320
I went back to find her.

583
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,400
You want revenge?

584
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,280
I'm thinking

585
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,720
she sold me

586
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,120
She must be short of money.

587
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,920
So I took all his money

588
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,400
I took all his money.

589
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,120
and wanted to give it to that lady.

590
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,520
I think

591
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,240
maybe

592
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,680
she won't sell me out.

593
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,080
When she saw me covered in blood,

594
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,280
she refused to recognize me.

595
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,200
Back then,

596
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,200
I was like a cat and a dog on the street.

597
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,400
just want a home.

598
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,440
But...

599
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,040
Eat.

600
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,200
Nanke Building is gone.

601
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,040
What are you going to do?

602
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,040
Yeah, where are we going?

603
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,600
I found a place to stay.

604
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,120
No.

605
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
The kitchen is small.

606
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,760
can't tolerate you.

607
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,840
I don't mind.

608
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,240
I'm a man.

609
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,480
Men and women are different.

610
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,560
Isn't there a woodshed in the yard?

611
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
It's not convenient for a woman to live in the wood room.

612
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,840
Right?

613
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
What about that room?

614
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,440
Wrong.

615
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,560
Up.

616
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,200
Okay.

617
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,080
Uncle.

618
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,480
Yes, it's not convenient.

619
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
So you live in the wood room.

620
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,840
Why?

621
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,160
I'm your destiny.

622
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,320
I eat and live with you.

623
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,400
to eat and live with you.

624
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,720
On the day of the fire at Nanke Building,

625
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,520
I saw over 20 boxes of silver carried out.

626
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,400
Don't tell me you can't afford the inn.

627
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,440
But...

628
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,920
I'm afraid of being alone.

629
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,080
You're scared?

630
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,200
The dogs on the street dare not bark when they see you.

631
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Are you scared?

632
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,320
Fine.

633
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,480
Since you don't want to,

634
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,040
the guest of Nanke Building

635
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,800
may take me in.

636
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,360
Get up.

637
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,800
A stone heart.

638
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,680
Buy your own mattress.

639
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,520
Okay.

640
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,720
The owner said you did a good job.

641
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't know why.

642
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,120
Since I was young, you only asked

643
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,520
you only ask the master for a pack of candy.

644
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
You have to eat more.

645
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,280
Okay.

646
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,240
I'll just pass the message.

647
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,760
You crazy jerk.

648
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,920
If you think I talk too much,

649
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
you can change someone next time.

650
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,400
Nanke Building.

651
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,680
Did you burn it?

652
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,840
I know you have feelings for that building.

653
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,080
This is the master's order.

654
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,360
Never mind.

655
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,200
What's your next plan?

656
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,400
Master said

657
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,920
since this blade is out of its sheath,

658
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,000
and blood,

659
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,640
there’s no reason to take it back.

660
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,640
Master wants you to follow Shen Song

661
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,880
and help him

662
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,080
until the whole world knows his existence.

663
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,480
until his words became the faith of the world.

664
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,480
until he becomes the master.

665
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,400
Peace and prosperity.

666
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,920
Live and work in peace.

667
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,200
We drink at night.

668
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:16,960
Who?

669
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,560
Stop!

670
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,920
I told you to stop

671
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,920
