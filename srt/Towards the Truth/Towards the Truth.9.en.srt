1
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,200
Mr. Li said he'll be rich for 70 years. He'll be rich for sure. He'll be rich for sure.

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,320
to keep him rich for 70 years.

3
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,040
I failed.

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
Li is greedy.

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,600
He always thinks about getting promoted and getting married.

6
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,080
and earn a conferred life for his mother.

7
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,640
Now he left empty-handed.

8
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,960
if you leave empty-handed.

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,800
When you were in a coma,

10
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,600
Li was busy

11
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,800
He's worried every day.

12
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,840
I asked him if he was tired.

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,480
He said no.

14
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,479
for wealth.

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,680
But we all know

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,960
he misses you.

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,000
I fell on the street

18
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Drunken cat

19
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,360
If he hadn't reached out to me,

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,280
I would have become a monster in the mud.

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,759
He saved me.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,000
but I got him involved in this disaster.

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,840
If it weren't for me,

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,880
he would still be in the government office playing cards with others.

25
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,080
He'll get paid then.

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,840
You're bragging.

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,640
and live a peaceful life.

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,560
I think

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,200
Lee doesn't want that kind of life.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,240
He doesn't want that kind of life either.

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Besides,

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,160
he's had enough of playing cards.

33
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,200
Both Li

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,880
and me,

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,680
or Qin.

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,680
even Zhan Mao'er.

37
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,920
If it weren't for you,

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,760
our life

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,720
are simple

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
and repeat.

41
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,480
So you have to trust me.

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,840
We chose to follow you.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,680
is our own decision.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,840
We will never regret it.

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,680
Don't drink too much.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,480
Did you see that?

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,560
Yes.

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,400
I see it.

49
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,760
It turns out

50
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,840
you still can't let go.

51
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,560
Do you think

52
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,400
Na Kyung hurt her like that.

53
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,240
Why would she die with Na Kyung?

54
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,120
In the end,

55
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,400
Na Kyung is not the murderer.

56
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,920
If they go together,

57
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,960
it's better than suffering between love and hate.

58
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
Lotus was bullied.

59
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
and scars.

60
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,680
Na Kyung became a monster.

61
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
They all think they're dirty.

62
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,640
and keep things from each other.

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,360
Now the grudges are entangled.

64
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,320
we can't tell if they're enemies or friends.

65
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,440
It's an ill-fated relationship.

66
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,160
It's a pity that the caster

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,880
died because of Na Kyung.

68
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,960
because of Luo Qing's death.

69
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,080
Let's look it up from the Chamber of Commerce.

70
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,120
Maybe we can find out some details.

71
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,640
Peng Hyo-yu sent someone to investigate.

72
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,320
The clues were wiped clean.

73
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
We found nothing.

74
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,920
You are really resourceful.

75
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,400
Cat,

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
I have something to tell you.

77
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,840
This

78
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,440
called Baihui Soup.

79
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,360
Don't you have something to say?

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,440
What

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
next?

82
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,520
The truth of the silver robbery case seven years ago has been solved.

83
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,840
Lotus

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,480
is gone.

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,680
I'll take revenge.

86
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,000
It's time to leave.

87
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,080
Life is full of flavors.

88
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,920
hate or love,

89
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,360
or love or bitterness.

90
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,320
The taste

91
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
is always hard to say.

92
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,159
But if someone had shared weal and woe,

93
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,560
you might not be so lonely.

94
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,159
Cat.

95
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,159
I want you to stay.

96
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,680
Forget it.

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,800
Since I met you,

98
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,520
you've been unlucky for eight times.

99
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,840
You want me to stay

100
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,760
because you want me to be your sword?

101
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,880
But I can't

102
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,280
your head.

103
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
I want you to be my sword.

104
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,840
but a sword

105
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,840
a sharp blade.

106
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,480
You don't like Guan Ge, do you?

107
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,760
I want you to kill me.

108
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,480
You don't want to?

109
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,840
You...

110
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
We all saw

111
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
how Luo Chengyuan became a mandrill step by step.

112
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,320
Zhan Mao'er

113
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,520
I have my weakness.

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,560
I'm afraid

115
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,400
Li has died because of me.

116
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,360
I can't implicate others anymore.

117
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,360
If that day comes,

118
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,159
if I’m no longer Shen Shaoshan,

119
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,960
you want me to kill you who became a demon,

120
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,160
I want you to be sharp forever.

121
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,160
and decisive.

122
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,360
Interrogation.

123
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,320
Use your blade

124
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,760
with your blade.

125
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,400
What a yummy soup.

126
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,880
Okay.

127
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,640
You're funny.

128
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,840
From now on,

129
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,440
Grandpa Zhan's knife

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,480
is hanging on your head.

131
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,960
But remember,

132
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,360
no one

133
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,480
no one can take your life.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
How is it?

135
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,200
There's an extra one to squeeze the kitchen.

136
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,000
Not bad.

137
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,120
Call me sister.

138
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
Let me help you.

139
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,320
Sister.

140
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,840
Let's go.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Here's something for you.

142
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,800
No.

143
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,400
Your family has no money.

144
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,080
You should at least give him a gold one.

145
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
I'm an honest official.

146
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,080
I asked someone to get good iron

147
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,240
to refine it.

148
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,680
It contains my heart.

149
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
Your name is engraved on it.

150
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,600
You're ignorant.

151
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,360
This is not more valuable than gold.

152
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,080
When you feel relaxed,

153
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,280
hold it tightly.

154
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
Pain can wake people up.

155
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,120
That's a good thing.

156
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,440
Thank you.

157
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,120
It's nothing.

158
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,120
It's just scrap metal.

159
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,960
I just want you to remember

160
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,040
you’re just Shen Shaoswen.

161
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,840
Stop.

162
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,160
Sister Qin, Shen Song.

163
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,640
Princess.

164
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,440
I was going to find you.

165
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,840
Father invites you to come tomorrow

166
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,960
to drink and play chess together.

167
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,920
Do me the honor.

168
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

169
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,040
You look so upset.

170
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
After all

171
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,160
catching the mandrill is a capable one

172
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,000
Tell me about it

173
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,280
Sister Qin, you go too.

174
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,840
It's a robbery.

175
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Stop hiding.

176
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,280
Come along.

177
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,440
By the way,

178
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm about to get married.

179
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,200
I'll get married.

180
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
You're not wasting my time.

181
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,400
You always show your face when we meet.

182
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,160
How boring.

183
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,200
Besides,

184
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,480
my father and Lord Gongsun

185
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,520
because of what happened before.

186
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,520
After all,

187
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,960
it's our junior's business.

188
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm sorry

189
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,600
Isn't that unfilial?

190
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,800
I'm leaving.

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,480
See you tomorrow.

192
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,760
Hya!

193
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:24,840
Hya!

194
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,360
It was a mistake.

195
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,440
is finally married.

196
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,360
Are you satisfied?

197
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,240
She is a nice person.

198
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,960
But I will never marry

199
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,320
I will never marry her.

200
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,800
Pretending to be aloof.

201
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,680
Pretending to be serious.

202
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
What a fool.

203
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,040
Hey.

204
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,200
Who are you talking about?

205
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,400
The disaster of Lu Land.

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,160
Let me make this clear.

207
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,800
It's not a natural disaster.

208
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
It's a man-made accident.

209
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,920
I'm wronged.

210
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,800
I'm wronged.

211
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,200
Don't come to me when I worship you.

212
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,440
Please.

213
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,160
Don't come to me.

214
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,240
I'll worship you.

215
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
Don't look for me.

216
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,440
Ludong Grand famine.

217
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,520
Many refugees escaped to Kaifeng.

218
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,000
There is no food now.

219
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,320
If I don't starve to death,

220
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,760
It's already God's mercy.

221
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,960
Stop talking and dig.

222
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,080
Here.

223
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,560
Eat.

224
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,040
Hurry.

225
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,680
Man Tou.

226
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,840
There are steamed buns.

227
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,800
There's food.

228
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,440
Come on, there's food. Hurry.

229
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,160
Thank you.

230
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,280
Thank you.

231
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,200
Look at that old man.

232
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,200
It looks like a shroud.

233
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,120
That's right.

234
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,880
The disaster of Lu Land.

235
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,240
Let me make this clear.

236
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,800
It's not a natural disaster.

237
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,320
It's a man-made accident.

238
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,760
Thank you.

239
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,400
Take it.

240
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,480
Thank you.

241
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,040
Thank you.

242
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,280
Thank you.

243
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,040
Thank you.

244
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,520
Thank you.

245
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,160
Thank you, benefactor.

246
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,400
Thank you.

247
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,400
What a pity.

248
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,760
Take him to a nice meal.

249
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,040
Let's go.

250
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
Everyone, line up.

251
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,240
Don't grab.

252
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,040
Everyone has it.

253
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,040
Let me do it.

254
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,080
Okay.

255
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,520
Young Master.

256
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,400
Young Master!

257
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,680
Come here.

258
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,360
A dog who did evil for the tiger!

259
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,360
How dare you touch Princess Rong Hua?

260
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,040
Your Pang family must be tired of living.

261
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,800
Let's go.

262
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,520
Keep the money.

263
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,320
Don't let others see it.

264
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,680
From now on,

265
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,160
when you mess with someone.

266
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,960
Got it?

267
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,800
Ping’an got it.

268
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
Thank you, Ms. Fairy.

269
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,760
Your name is Ping’an?

270
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,000
I think

271
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,480
your parents want you to grow up safely.

272
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,920
Unfortunately,

273
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,080
Safe.

274
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,880
Will you go with me?

275
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,320
Let me go! Let me go!

276
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,000
I said I don't want to go!

277
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,320
Traitor!

278
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,080
Stop arguing.

279
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,840
Take a rest.

280
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,360
Traitor!

281
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,000
Today, your Uncle Gongsun

282
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,120
asked me to tie you up

283
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,320
because of your marriage.

284
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,760
because of your marriage.

285
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
They want to make up.

286
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,120
What do you know?

287
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,440
Rong Hua is married because of my boss.

288
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,920
Now she's finally married.

289
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,160
I have to come and make up.

290
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,280
It's so awkward.

291
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,400
Gongsun Li, don't flatter yourself.

292
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
How do you know it's because of you?

293
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,320
Many refugees are lacking clothes and food lately.

294
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,800
We took in more than 100 people in the beggar alley.

295
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,480
It's nothing.

296
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
I can't help much.

297
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Huh?

298
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,200
Do you think

299
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,640
why the disaster in Ludong

300
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,520
in Rudong?

301
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,320
What's so strange about it?

302
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,760
Mr. Guan predicted three years ago

303
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,079
Without investigating the fields,

304
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,800
there will be a disaster in Ludong.

305
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,119
Mr. Guan.

306
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,720
Who is it?

307
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,240
You came to the capital three years ago.

308
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,640
Of course not.

309
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,800
Mr. Guan is in charge of

310
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,800
200 scholars in charge

311
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,280
were killed.

312
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,920
Mr. Guan is a great scholar.

313
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
After he died,

314
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,800
I can't even mention it.

315
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,040
This way, please.

316
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,320
Not here.

317
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,760
Watch your head.

318
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,680
Please.

319
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,640
Hurry up.

320
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
It's my turn.

321
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,680
Your Highness.

322
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,560
He's here.

323
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,080
Your Highness.

324
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,520
Are you...

325
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,200
Chen Xiuqian.

326
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,600
You know everyone.

327
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,760
That's me.

328
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,960
Brother Chen.

329
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,800
This...

330
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
I can't forget

331
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,120
I can't forget it.

332
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,360
I miss you so much.

333
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,480
I read someone's article three years ago.

334
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,080
I thought I was invincible.

335
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,040
But after reading your policy,

336
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,960
I realized

337
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,800
there's someone out there.

338
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,160
There's no heaven out there.

339
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,000
Especially the one about the way of college.

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,320
It's...

341
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,560
Wonderful.

342
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,440
How are you compared to him?

343
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,640
I am

344
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,280
Of course I'm fertile.

345
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
Brother Chen and I are connected.

346
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,800
Although I can't be an official,

347
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,280
but I have no regrets

348
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,960
I have no regrets.

349
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,560
I should have no regrets.

350
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,440
You can't marry Rong Hua.

351
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,240
and he did it for you.

352
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:54,880
What?

353
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,040
I invited you here today

354
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,000
for two things.

355
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,720
First, Shen Song.

356
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,720
You solved the case.

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,560
You did a great job.

358
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
I like you.

359
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,840
Second,

360
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,000
the marriage of Rong Hua

361
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,760
fell into Chen Tan Hua's hands.

362
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,080
I’m happy.

363
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,240
Shen Song.

364
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,440
Let me ask you.

365
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,960
Chen Tan Hua,

366
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,000
is my son-in-law.

367
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You are so handsome.

368
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,000
You're a perfect match for her.

369
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,040
Your Highness.

370
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,680
As a noble lady,

371
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,880
isn't it too hasty

372
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,880
be too hasty?

373
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,400
It's none of your business.

374
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,640
It turns out that you solved the case.

375
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,040
Nice to meet you.

376
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,920
The pillar of Tan Hua Kingdom.

377
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,560
A handsome man.

378
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,400
I'm ashamed.

379
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,560
I'm not good at it.

380
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,240
He's just an interior at the Imperial Academy.

381
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,640
You're too modest.

382
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,920
The interior of the Imperial Academy

383
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,880
Only those who are educated can do it.

384
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,680
The magistrate is here.

385
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,120
Everyone,

386
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,960
Ludong caused a disaster.

387
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,160
His Majesty is kind-hearted.

388
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,800
He ordered Lord Peng

389
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,120
to pray

390
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,400
Bow to Duke of Security.

391
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,720
If the Earth Lord becomes a marquis,

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,320
he will bless us

393
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,560
and prosperity.

394
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,280
You're safe and sound.

395
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,040
Please.

396
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,520
Folks,

397
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,080
Bow to God of Earth.

398
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,000
Protect Lord Tao!

399
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,800
What?

400
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:27,920
Well...

401
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,640
What is this?

402
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,000
What is this, my lord?

403
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,080
The disaster of Lu Land has long been predicted.

404
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,600
It's not a natural disaster.

405
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,560
It's a man-made accident.

406
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,640
The Security Marquis.

407
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,840
Ghost!

408
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,000
Ghost!

409
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,280
My lord. My lord.

410
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
What's wrong, my lord?

411
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,760
My lord.

412
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,800
Have you made up your mind?

413
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,360
Come with me.

414
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,040
Xiuqian

415
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,760
She's not usually like this.

416
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,640
She's always like this.

417
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,160
You...

418
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,160
You are Chen Tan Hua?

419
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,160
It's you.

420
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Stay home and prepare for the wedding.

421
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,120
I'm going out to investigate a case.

422
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,880
This is too hasty.

423
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,080
What would a robber know?

424
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,760
We're waiting for you.

425
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,400
Let's go.

426
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,920
This...

427
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,360
It's almost done.

428
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,040
There's no blood on the floor.

429
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,920
This is not the crime scene.

430
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,720
Restore.

431
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,360
The body was sitting

432
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,240
but the blood didn't go down.

433
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,880
It was obviously moved here after his death.

434
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,200
The dead can't walk.

435
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,120
There must be a murderer in this case.

436
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,640
Tell Peng Xiaoyu

437
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,680
Ask him to send more men

438
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,920
to look for the crime scene.

439
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,760
Take these two bodies

440
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,880
to the coroner.

441
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,080
Yes.

442
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,760
It was stolen.

443
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,760
What's wrong?

444
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,480
Rehabilitation.

445
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,320
Blood is cinnabar.

446
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,960
There is white phosphorus powder on it.

447
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,760
Smoke triggers the spontaneous combustion of white phosphorus powder.

448
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,960
There are blood characters after it burns out.

449
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,640
Pretending to be a ghost

450
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,360
It's just a trick.

451
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,920
The person who created the blood

452
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,120
must be the one

453
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,800
the two bodies here.

454
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,480
Rehabilitation.

455
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,160
Is it the Mr. Guan you mentioned?

456
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,720
Yes.

457
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,760
How is it?

458
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,960
Officer Shen, I've checked.

459
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,360
These two have abdomen

460
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,440
They were starving refugees.

461
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,120
A woman died from a stab in her chest.

462
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,960
The child's face was colored.

463
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,800
He died of suffocation.

464
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,280
His mouth is dirty.

465
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,920
No strangling marks on the neck.

466
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,160
He was covered to death.

467
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
The murderer has a knife.

468
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,760
Why did he cover the child?

469
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,520
Who will be killed first?

470
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,800
From the perspective of zombies,

471
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,480
the child was covered in front.

472
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,240
and stabbed a woman in the back.

473
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,400
They are all refugees.

474
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,160
Who would do anything to the refugees?

475
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,000
Sir.

476
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,320
This stain

477
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,080
is the same as the filth of a child's mouth.

478
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,680
Could it be...

479
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,640
she killed this child?

480
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
The same thread.

481
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,680
They are mother and son.

482
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,520
How do you know that?

483
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,960
When a mother makes clothes for a child,

484
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,760
she sews the threads by her own clothes.

485
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,040
to embroider a safety button

486
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
in the corner of the child's clothes.

487
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,920
Thank you, sir.

488
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,440
After the investigation document is stored,

489
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,200
it will be worth it.

490
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,600
How could she kill her son?

491
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,920
The mother loves her child so much.

492
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,440
and sewed a safety button for him.

493
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,160
Why did you kill him?

494
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,160
This case

495
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,840
there are two strange things.

496
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,800
What do you mean?

497
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,920
First,

498
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,960
Mother killing her son is an immoral crime.

499
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,360
It was impossible.

500
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,280
But it happened.

501
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,880
Second,

502
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,080
they were just refugees.

503
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,760
but the bodies appeared on the altar of the Earth Temple.

504
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,000
It's indeed strange

505
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,600
It's indeed weird.

506
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,480
But if there's a third person,

507
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,360
it will make sense.

508
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,120
You mean

509
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,000
the murderer who killed his mother?

510
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
A mother killed a son.

511
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
would never happen.

512
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,600
Unless someone forces them.

513
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,120
after the third person forced the mother and son to death,

514
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,560
and moved the bodies to the Earth Temple.

515
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,360
It's scary.

516
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,240
With the ghost on the wall,

517
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,320
with the ghost on the wall.

518
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,320
This person

519
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,560
is the Duke of Security who pretended to be reinstated.

520
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,960
The mansion was haunted a few days ago.

521
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,080
The spirit is back.

522
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,480
Rumor has it that

523
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,560
he was wronged three years ago.

524
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,320
Now he's asking the Duke of Security

525
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,480
for the people.

526
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,560
It's all nonsense.

527
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,160
The body will be stiff

528
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,280
the body will become stiff.

529
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,320
The Security Marquis moved two bodies

530
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,080
from the crime scene to the Earth Temple,

531
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,240
it won't take more than three hours.

532
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,080
If manpower transport

533
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,040
within two miles,

534
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,560
If the carriages and horses

535
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,960
under the weight,

536
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
is only ten miles away.

537
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,280
So the crime scene

538
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
must be in this circle.

539
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,160
This is...

540
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,520
The house.

541
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,560
Let's take a look.

542
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,880
The timing is not right.

543
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,840
I can't go.

544
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,600
When did you get there?

545
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,680
It's dark and windy.

546
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,280
It's just right.

547
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,280
Qin.

548
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,240
Pull me up first.

549
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,600
You'll be sentenced to prison if you destroy the Yellow Seal.

550
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,040
Then hurry up.

551
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,120
and run away.

552
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,640
Who knew we destroyed it?

553
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,200
There are no traces on the other side.

554
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,280
Come and catch the traitor!

555
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,080
Hurry!

556
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,680
Oh no.

557
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,840
It's the patrol soldiers.

558
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,800
Hurry.

559
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,000
This way.

560
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:20,920
Hurry.

561
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,280
Go over there.

562
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,120
Yes.

563
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,360
There are footprints.

564
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,360
Follow the footprints.

565
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,280
Yes.

566
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,520
Let's go.

567
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,880
Who?

568
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,440
Officer Shen.

569
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,280
Shen Song.

570
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,120
How dare you!

571
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,080
I'm still sick.

572
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,000
I heard that

573
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,560
to destroy the Yellow Seal of the mansion and rebel.

574
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:08,960
You...

575
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,880
You're really good at doing great things.

576
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,160
I told you there's something wrong with the house management.

577
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,920
It's very likely

578
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,760
is the crime scene of the Body Dumping at the Earth Temple.

579
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,120
The house.

580
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,720
That's a forbidden place.

581
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,680
It was Madam Guan

582
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,560
reported the rebellion.

583
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,960
How dare you destroy the Yellow Seal of the mansion?

584
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
This is against His Majesty's order.

585
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,480
You'll be exiled.

586
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,760
There was a murder in the house.

587
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,720
Someone cleaned the scene

588
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,440
Drop the dust

589
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,600
and moved the vase.

590
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,760
There was dust under the vase just now.

591
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,800
My lord, calm down.

592
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,160
My lord!

593
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,000
Let me out!

594
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,720
Let me investigate the case.

595
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,040
There's a word "Guan" on this case.

596
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,760
You can't get involved.

597
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,480
Don't worry about ghosts.

598
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,680
I'm saving you.

599
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
You have to cherish it.

600
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,160
Understand?

601
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
As long as

602
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,440
I'll come back to take the punishment.

603
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,800
It doesn't make sense.

604
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,600
You...

605
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,560
My lord.

606
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,480
My lord.

607
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,400
Lord Peng.

608
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,080
Get in.

609
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,840
Lord Peng.

610
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,320
Peng Xiaoyu.

611
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,360
I can take you out of prison.

612
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,240
We didn't really rebel.

613
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,280
but we will be exiled if we break out.

614
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,240
Don't worry.

615
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,120
The money bag is still outside.

616
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,400
Sir.

617
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Where did you get

618
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,320
Where did you get it?

619
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,440
Love.

620
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,760
I copied it from the Supreme Court

621
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,240
I copied it from the Supreme Court.

622
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,360
Copying documents is a capital crime.

623
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,360
It's not a crime if you don't get caught.

624
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,160
Who is it?

625
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,440
It's me.

626
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
How many times have I told you?

627
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,720
We're on the same side.

628
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,120
Can you walk through the door?

629
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm used to it.

630
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,920
Money bag.

631
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,640
Is there anyone who is good at martial arts?

632
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,280
Lend me two.

633
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,520
I need reliable ones.

634
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,520
Pick whatever you want in the yard.

635
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:08,840
Okay.

636
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,120
Why do you want him?

637
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,800
Prison break.

638
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,720
What?

639
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,720
The cook and Qin are inside.

640
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm going to get them.

641
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,280
Of course.

642
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,040
They broke into the mansion at night

643
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,800
and tore the yellow seal.

644
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,600
Peng Xiaoyu caught him.

645
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,720
This is great.

646
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,360
In prison.

647
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,320
I can't defend myself.

648
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,400
However,

649
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,560
they found out that

650
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,400
it's very likely that

651
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,080
is the first scene of the Earth Temple case.

652
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,240
But Peng Hyo-ok found the reason

653
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,720
They won't let go

654
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Chef!

655
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,120
You're too reckless.

656
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,520
Why are you laughing?

657
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,440
I'm laughing at you.

658
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,760
You're worried about Lord Shen.

659
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,120
You're not avoiding me?

660
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,760
Whose Lord Shen

661
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,000
is not my Lord Shen.

662
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,600
Let's get down to business.

663
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,080
Peng and the chef

664
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,240
with the cook.

665
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,800
Now the refugees came to the capital.

666
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,560
This is great.

667
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,000
We have to settle

668
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,160
with each other.

669
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,520
If he accuses the chef,

670
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,040
we will be passive.

671
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,160
If His Majesty knows about this,

672
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,200
we can talk first.

673
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,160
You mean...

674
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,720
Since His Majesty started his studies,

675
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,120
Mr. Guan

676
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,720
has been an official's teacher for 13 years.

677
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,160
Three years ago,

678
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,320
it was Mother who filed a complaint against Mr. Guan.

679
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,040
The one who reported Mr. Guan's rebellion was the Pang family.

680
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,080
His Majesty didn't interfere.

681
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,840
In this way,

682
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,680
Let's bet.

683
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,640
What bet?

684
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,160
Let's bet on the friendship in His Majesty's heart.

685
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,120
to see if he's willing.

686
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,800
to investigate further.

687
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,120
In that case,

688
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,440
I'll go to the palace.

689
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,080
Princess.

690
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,120
Can I have one more

691
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
can I join you?

692
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,440
Didn't Mother forbid you to enter the palace?

693
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
What time is it now?

694
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,840
Chef's life is more important.

695
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,600
Everyone is raised by their parents.

696
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:32,679
Everyone has a family.

697
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,560
They said there was a strange case

698
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:47,880
there was a strange case in the temple.

699
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,880
This is a new drama.

700
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,120
It's new.

701
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,639
Only His Majesty heard it.

702
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,000
I was bald once too.

703
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,560
Mother heard that you've returned to the palace.

704
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,400
She specially sent Guo Huai to deliver the fruit.

705
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,240
Security Hou Xiansheng.

706
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,560
Mother and son are dead.

707
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,520
Your Majesty.

708
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,760
This is...

709
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,040
The way of being a king is also to help the people.

710
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,520
This is my gift to you.

711
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,360
Yes.

712
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,320
He said he's the Imperial Envoy of the Shen family. He said he's the Imperial Envoy of the Shen family. He said he's the Imperial Envoy of the Shen family. He said he's the Imperial Envoy of the Shen family. He said that he's the Imperial Envoy of the Shen family

713
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,000
Rong Hua

714
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,360
I was supposed to walk by order.

715
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,760
This play is not bad.

716
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,640
But my throat

717
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,160
sounds so familiar.

718
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,000
Your Majesty.

719
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,440
Your Majesty.

720
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,520
Gongsun Li.

721
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,320
Since you were kicked out of the palace,

722
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,520
I've instructed you several times,

723
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
but you didn't listen.

724
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,880
You acted like you're no longer my sister.

725
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,240
You didn't even marry my sister.

726
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,560
Now you sneaked into the palace.

727
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,600
in the palace?

728
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,000
For the people.

729
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,520
For whom?

730
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,040
For Shen Song.

731
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,080
Shen Song is

732
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
in prison.

733
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,920
I understand what you mean.

734
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,200
Shen Song is in prison.

735
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,760
He removed the Yellow Seal without permission and has evidence.

736
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,600
He should be punished severely.

737
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,760
Choose an auspicious day and kill him.

738
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,480
Chop.

739
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,640
Chop.

740
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,560
Princess, slow down.

741
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,800
Open it.

742
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,440
Be careful, Your Highness.

743
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,880
Kneel before His Majesty.

744
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,520
Shen Song, accept the decree.

745
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,680
Shen Song broke into the mansion at night and destroyed the Yellow Seal.

746
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,120
It's disrespectful to commit a rebellion.

747
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,880
Ask Kaifeng Prefecture to deal with him.

748
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,240
Find another day.

749
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,120
Ex...

750
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,280
Execute...

751
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,320
Execute him on another day.

752
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,280
The money bag is making a big deal out of it.

753
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,480
I just wanted to scare him.

754
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,680
How dare you sue him?

755
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
Aren’t you friends?

756
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,320
Shen Song.

757
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,080
The injustice has its source.

758
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:37,920
You...

759
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,680
It's not my fault.

760
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,880
When you get down there,

761
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,240
don't accuse the wrong person.

762
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,760
Remember this face.

763
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,600
Shen Song, take the order.

764
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,200
No matter how hard the refugees in Ludong are,

765
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,400
Kaifeng Prefecture is wide in the capital.

766
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,040
should have stabilized a place.

767
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,200
Now the refugees have lost their homes and a major case has occurred.

768
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,880
I was negligent.

769
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,760
It’s understandable that Shen Song broke the rules.

770
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,160
The case of the Earth Temple is very important.

771
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,520
and made Shen Song redeem himself.

772
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,160
If there is any involvement, we should investigate thoroughly.

773
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,440
If you don't arrest him, you'll be executed.

774
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

775
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,120
Your Highness, you're just talking.

776
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,160
That's enough.

777
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,480
His Majesty is most filial.

778
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,200
Why did you bring a bowl of white porridge with sand?

779
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,640
His Majesty wants me to understand

780
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,320
that the misjudgment case three years ago...

781
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,120
Mother.

782
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,760
and demonstrate the world.

783
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,480
It can't be wrong.

784
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,520
Is there any gossip

785
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,560
Is there a discussion?

786
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
Well...

787
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,600
It's just some silly words.

788
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,360
Foolish words?

789
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,440
Left

790
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,400
It's just some superstitious remarks.

791
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,000
What are you talking about?

792
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,880
He died of injustice.

793
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,960

795
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,560

796
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,880
Oh.

797
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,080
Restore.

798
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,280
If your soul really came back,

799
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,960
would you dare to seek revenge on me?

800
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,520
This...

801
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,480
Prince, His Majesty has issued an edict.

802
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Royal edict?

803
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,640
What did he say?

804
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,520
His Majesty ordered

805
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,640
to investigate all the implications.

806
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,640
Please spare my life.

807
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,960
Please spare my life.

808
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,160
It's been three years.

809
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,840
Why are you still pestering me?

810
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,760
Stay away from me.

811
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,120
Go away!

812
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,880
Go away!

813
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,480
A dead thing

814
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,520
