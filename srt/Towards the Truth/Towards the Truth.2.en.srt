1
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,520
Stop!

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,320
Stop!

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,160
Stop!

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,960
You didn't listen to me.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,040
I have something to ask you.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,400
You have to answer honestly.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,320
The government needs land to build a building.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,800
A group of people who used to live outside the Vermilion Bird Gate

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,360
moved away.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,400
You sleep outside everyday and beg.

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,040
You see more than others.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,840
Do you know where they moved to?

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,040
I have no money to buy wine recently.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,480
Where did they move to?

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,600
I don't know.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,720
On the Dragon Boat Festival,

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,440
the government just gave them money.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
The next day,

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,920
the doors and buildings were stacked.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,800
All those people

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,120
in one night.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,600
All of them

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,400
in one night.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,040
Chef.

25
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,400
How long does it take to turn a body into a skeleton?

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:05,640
A square body lamp.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
A body lamp?

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,080
The weather is hot now.

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,160
Worms and ants can travel for a season.

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,080
You two go somewhere else to post it.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,400
Li.

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,920
A few households were demolished.

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,960
About 50 or 60.

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,280
Check the exact number.

35
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,840
Hurry.

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,440
Got it.

37
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,720
That's not right.

38
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,400
The number of people and the number of demolition

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,200
It doesn't match.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,280
How is that possible?

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,880
It's such a big project.

42
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,120
There are only dozens of people demolition.

43
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,600
Sun,

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,960
Do you know something?

45
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,320
No.

46
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
Let me tell you the truth.

47
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,800
We've taken over the government's manufacturing project.

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,640
We have received

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
in this project.

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
has never been missing a few hundred people.

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Sun,

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,360
You want to investigate the case with me?

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,360
Do you know

54
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,200
why you investigate the case?

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,480
Isn't it to uncover the unknown

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,320
and clear your name,

57
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,200
Isn't that great?

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:24,800
No.

59
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,640
Investigating a case

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
to talk.

61
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,600
66 skeletons downstairs.

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,920
Because of death,

63
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,200
[because of his death.]

64
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,120
My family was destroyed.

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,880
no one can complain.

66
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,600
We investigate the case

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,960
is not a living person who can speak.

68
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,480
but a dead person who can never speak.

69
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,400
If you really want to clear your name,

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,200
you should first

71
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,680
to yourself.

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
Their death is your death.

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,720
Their injustice is your injustice.

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,800
Why must you go through this thorn road?

75
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,520
and die like them.

76
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,000
and crawled back from the Netherworld.

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,640
My heart, spleen, lungs were crushed.

78
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,920
I dare to say I have a clear conscience.

79
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,680
Sun,

80
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,600
That day at the court,

81
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,720
you stepped forward slowly

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
You seem to defend me,

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,280
but in fact,

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
in order to gain my trust,

85
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,840
Then you approached me at the wonton stall

86
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,360
to find out what I did.

87
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,600
You suddenly disappeared

88
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,040
you suddenly disappeared.

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,640
I guess

90
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,360
you were nearby.

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,400
When you mentioned the moving,

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,760
you looked flustered.

93
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,640
and distracted.

94
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,280
Although I don’t know your purpose,

95
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,840
since you’re working with me,

96
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,160
you need trust

97
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,400
is trust.

98
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,480
You helped me.

99
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,920
I won't force you.

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,520
Now I only ask you one question.

101
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,680
Investigating a case is a thorny path.

102
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,720
Are you

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,200
are the same kind of people?

104
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,960
Of course.

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,160
What are you afraid of?

106
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
Fine, I won't tell you.

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,920
Uncle.

108
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,560
Let's eat.

109
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,440
Don't go.

110
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:35,840
Hey.

111
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,480
Come back.

112
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,400
My...

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,280
a relative

114
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
He works in the Ministry of Revenue

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,440
When I visited him the other day,

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,640
I happened to see the record of the relocation of the lantern house.

117
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,760
47 households in Lantern Gate Building, 645 people.

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,840
Minister of Works.

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Long Yan Nian.

120
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,160
The number of people in the case

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,560
47 households, 645.

122
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,000
We found 65 people moving.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,880
In that case,

124
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,680
that case looks like a murder,

125
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,720
but there's actually

126
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
corruption.

127
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
The Ministry of Revenue lied about the number of moving people

128
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,600
580.

129
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,600
40 taels of dismantlement for each person.

130
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,720
and fold the fake money.

131
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,600
23,200 taels.

132
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,159
Shen Tuo,

133
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,840
the person who signed the case was not someone else.

134
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,400
It was Long Yan Nian, Minister of Works.

135
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
It's true.

136
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
It can't be wrong.

137
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:57,880
May you live forever.

138
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,040
Yu'er.

139
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,640
Yu'er.

140
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,800
My condolences, Lord Long.

141
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,840
Yu'er.

142
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,960
Lord Long.

143
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,000
Lord Long.

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,640
Master.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,640
My lord.

146
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,240
I can't investigate anymore.

147
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,360
Why?

148
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,080
Shen Tuo.

149
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Shen Tuo!

150
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,360
Let go!

151
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
We must investigate.

152
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,440
If it’s just murder,

153
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,640
the suspect or subordinates embezzled tens of thousands of taels.

154
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,840
Guess

155
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,080
how big an official cap the person who handles it is.

156
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,240
At least he's an assistant minister.

157
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
Who do you think we are?

158
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,920
A cook.

159
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,600
a merchant,

160
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,240
plus Li, a useless officer.

161
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,320
He's the Vice Minister.

162
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,920
We are dogs.

163
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,640
Sun Li.

164
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,120
Let go.

165
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,600
We can't find anything.

166
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,640
Go out and have a bowl of golden rice with me.

167
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,240
and drink some wine.

168
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,280
It's worth our friendship.

169
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,280
Shen Tuo.

170
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,240
Brother.

171
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,640
Master.

172
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,040
I beg you.

173
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,920
Keep investigating.

174
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,080
only you can help me

175
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,480
who can help me.

176
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,840
I gave it to someone else.

177
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,200
I can't rest assured.

178
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,280
Let go!

179
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,080
Shen Tuo.

180
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,200
Chef.

181
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Sun.

182
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,840
Excuse me.

183
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,560
Li.

184
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
What did you find?

185
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,400
Didn't you ask me to keep an eye on

186
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,880
the result of finding the owner?

187
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,920
Guess what happened?

188
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,360
What happened?

189
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,720
The victim is the daughter of the Minister of Works, Long Yan Nian.

190
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
Long Yu'er.

191
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,160
What?

192
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,360
Shen Tuo,

193
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,240
I beg you.

194
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,000
Keep investigating.

195
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,160
only you can help me

196
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,640
who can help me.

197
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,280
Keep investigating.

198
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,880
128 members of the Shen family were killed.

199
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,880
I also want to seek justice for them.

200
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,880
But you and I

201
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,280
the consequences.

202
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,920
Sun Li,

203
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,040
Do you know this is a road of no return?

204
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,799
His Majesty likes crispy food.

205
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,480
But this chestnut cake

206
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
is always glutinous.

207
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,840
Mother.

208
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,160
Do you really not care

209
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
those rumors?

210
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,600
The rumor

211
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,800
can be spread,

212
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,800
it's approved by His Majesty.

213
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,080
His Majesty

214
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,640
is going to kill the Six Ministries in my hands.

215
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,760
His Majesty

216
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,040
is a filial son.

217
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,760
Is it not from my belly

218
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,880
No matter how filial you are,

219
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,000
he won't be able to wait.

220
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,000
His Majesty gave Kaifeng Prefecture the authority to investigate this case.

221
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
I think

222
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,840
he's going to make appetizers with the second section of workers.

223
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
I think

224
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,880
my chestnut cake will be enough.

225
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,000
With this magic,

226
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,360
you always think you are the best pawn of your master.

227
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,200
Although Shen Song hasn’t entered the game,

228
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,160
he seems to be favored by the master.

229
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,600
Jing Ge, you're so smooth-tongued.

230
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,760
How annoying.

231
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
Even if it's a piece,

232
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm still the best pawn.

233
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,880
Who do you think you are?

234
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,080
Are you crazy?

235
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,400
Jing Ge.

236
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,360
Master asked you to pass the message and learn the tongue.

237
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,440
If you lose your tongue,

238
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,920
if you lose this tongue?

239
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,280
I won't do it again.

240
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,040
What else do you know about him?

241
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,400
Master said he has a deep heart.

242
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
Even if he's in the game, he may repeat it.

243
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,840
This sachet will be a bait.

244
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,880
and let him work for us.

245
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,760
I promised you

246
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,600
to find the murderer.

247
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,640
I'm going to break my promise now.

248
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,840
You want the real murderer.

249
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,600
Since you're here to collect debts,

250
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,960
let me be the real murderer.

251
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,000
to find out the truth.

252
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,840
it's just death.

253
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,720
No.

254
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,720
The death is just around the corner.

255
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,600
Miss.

256
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,040
Do it.

257
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,240
But I have a request.

258
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,400
I’m pure and inexperienced.

259
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,240
Don't get him involved.

260
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,360
Sun Li lied to you.

261
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,600
Are you still willing to help him?

262
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,520
He helped me investigate the case.

263
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,720
for justice,

264
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,520
but he never stopped me.

265
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Besides, he really wanted to help me

266
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,720
he really wanted to help me.

267
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,480
It's been three years.

268
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
People who treat me well

269
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
is just Li,

270
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,000
and an uncle.

271
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,440
Now we have a grandson.

272
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,520
There's no conclusion about the case.

273
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,080
Everyone is in a dilemma.

274
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,360
Why don't you let me take all the blame?

275
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,920
Fine.

276
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,720
I'll grant your wish.

277
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,320
Then try

278
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,760
more painful than death.

279
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,840
Shen Song.

280
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,640
Shen Song.

281
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,920
Shen Song.

282
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,520
Shen Song.

283
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,760
I found you.

284
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,240
I really found you.

285
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,400
Chef.

286
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,480
Chef

287
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,040
Look at me

288
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,480
Chef.

289
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,080
Wake up It's okay

290
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,800
It's okay

291
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,280
Chef.

292
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
What sorcery did you use?

293
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,360
Chef.

294
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,840
Is the person in your dream

295
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
is an old friend?

296
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,040
I don't remember.

297
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,800
No.

298
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,080
Do you remember?

299
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,080
They're all dead.

300
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,280
And you can't forget them.

301
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,200
I think about it every night.

302
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,280
I became the demon in my heart.

303
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,440
You really have a grudge.

304
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
You can't clear your own name.

305
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,200
So you don't believe that the bones' injustice can be cleared.

306
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,360
Really?

307
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,120
I said I don't remember.

308
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Chef Shen.

309
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,240
Since you don't remember,

310
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,400
I guess you don't care about that anymore.

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,360
No.

312
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,840
You can pretend to be heartless.

313
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,760
But the crate was wiped clean.

314
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,040
the things inside must be important.

315
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,000
If I burn it,

316
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,320
if I burn it?

317
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,360
How dare you!

318
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,760
Are you going to investigate?

319
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,040
No.

320
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,720
The chef is fine.

321
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,800
It's not burnt inside.

322
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,160
Shen Qianfan.

323
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,960
Shen Lv

324
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,600
Shen Zhuo Yuan.

325
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Shen Yun'er.

326
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,440
Shen Qiao

327
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,240
Yuan Xin.

328
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,120
There are 128 members of the Shen family.

329
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,160
How did they die?

330
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,080
Once they were destroyed,

331
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,080
I don't know why.

332
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,440
Why not?

333
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,160
You think I didn't investigate it?

334
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,760
It's useless.

335
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,200
I won't investigate useless things anymore.

336
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,600
You can kill me

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,080
as you wish.

338
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,400
Are you sure?

339
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:46,840
Yes.

340
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,240
If he doesn't,

341
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll do it for him.

342
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,400
I will.

343
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,160
Killing him will only kill another person.

344
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,680
It won't help you.

345
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Give me two days.

346
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,240
Trust me.

347
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,440
None of your business.

348
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,640
Why not?

349
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,360
Chef.

350
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,040
You said

351
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,760
Solving cases is to defend the dead.

352
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,560
If you die,

353
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
I have to speak up for him.

354
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,200
Miss,

355
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,640
I'll investigate for him.

356
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,480
This fool is quite straightforward.

357
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,400
It's worth your help.

358
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,520
Okay.

359
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,720
I won't let you investigate for nothing.

360
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,280
As for you,

361
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,400
Master knows more than you.

362
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,920
Master has sealed the secret of your eyes

363
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,760
in this bag.

364
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,720
What master?

365
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,960
What owner?

366
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,880
No hurry.

367
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,600
When you solve this case,

368
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,880
this sachet will be your reward.

369
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,000
Chef.

370
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,000
Chef

371
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,720
Wait for me

372
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,760
Chef.

373
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Who is that woman

374
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,760
She's fierce and weird.

375
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
What do you owe her?

376
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,760
Not really.

377
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,200
She wants me.

378
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,400
I want her.

379
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

380
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,680
I can ask for someone,

381
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,760
but I can do it for you.

382
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,520
That's not necessary.

383
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,760
I'm afraid she doesn't like you.

384
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,720
She doesn't like me?

385
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
I'm smart and handsome.

386
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,119
and loyal.

387
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,560
How can he look down on me?

388
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:18,880
Lord Long.

389
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,599
My condolences.

390
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,240
Your wife died.

391
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,119
We shouldn't have come here.

392
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
But to find the murderer as soon as possible,

393
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,600
I still want to ask you

394
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,720
My dear daughter.

395
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,280
I feel sad

396
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,680
I feel sad.

397
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,000
I couldn't entertain you.

398
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,680
Lord Long doesn't seem to want to know who killed you.

399
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,720
You don't want to know?

400
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,040
or you already know?

401
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,760
Stop talking nonsense.

402
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,160
If I know who the murderer is,

403
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,080
I will tear him into pieces

404
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,560
and scatter him.

405
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,800
I feel exhausted.

406
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,920
Please

407
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,160
Please leave.

408
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,040
Miss Long is 28 years old.

409
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
and raised her in a noble house.

410
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,120
Officials value honor the most.

411
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,440
Could it be that Miss Long

412
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,680
with someone?

413
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,320
How could you hit him?

414
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,640
Get lost!

415
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,040
Shen Tuo!

416
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,160
He's holding a funeral.

417
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,760
You said her daughter was a pervert.

418
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,360
He didn't deserve this slap.

419
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,360
Do you think he's really sad?

420
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,080
It's sad.

421
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,640
But

422
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,120
it's a bit strange.

423
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,920
Because we want to clear his daughter's name,

424
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,560
but he refused to say anything.

425
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,760
and kicked us out.

426
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,080
Yes.

427
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,520
The lantern gate.

428
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,600
It's a royal job.

429
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,960
Other than him, the first chairman of the Municipal Council,

430
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,240
who dares to kill over 60 people?

431
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,880
If we question him, he's overstepping his authority.

432
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,360
and asked for allowance.

433
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,600
If the daughter finds out,

434
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,480
he can kill her to silence her.

435
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,880
Now that Long Yan Nian doesn't cooperate,

436
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,200
the case will be closed.

437
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,120
What should we do?

438
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,040
It's easy.

439
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,400
Let's check Nanke Building.

440
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,880
Shen Song.

441
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,480
Have you lost your mind?

442
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,920
Why do you want to investigate Nanke Building?

443
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,760
From the beginning,

444
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,000
from the beginning.

445
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,080
She knew about the body hiding downstairs.

446
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,520
What does she want?

447
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,040
No matter what she wants to do,

448
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,800
I think there must be

449
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,640
there must be something I want.

450
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,720
On the left of the second floor,

451
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,960
is Qin'er's bedroom.

452
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,960
Qin'er is too hard to deal with.

453
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,160
I'll give it a try.

454
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,440
You do the rest.

455
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,400
Help!

456
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,000
A thief broke in on the second floor.

457
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,640
Who are you?

458
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,440
Stop!

459
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm not a thief.

460
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,120
It's a misunderstanding.

461
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,000
It's a misunderstanding.

462
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,120
Don't pull my clothes.

463
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,720
Chef.

464
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,920
You're so cruel.

465
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,800
If you die in my hands one day,

466
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,040
Don't scream down there.

467
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
It's all your fault.

468
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,000
All right.

469
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't be angry.

470
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,480
You should thank me for getting this clue.

471
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,600
In the chaos,

472
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,400
I entered Qin'er's room

473
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,720
and held it.

474
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,280
and backward.

475
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,160
Master won't blame me for helping you.

476
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,720
I found this in the money box.

477
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,400
It's a Taotie tattoo.

478
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,440
That's why it should be used by the signature.

479
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,640
I suspect he left this corner when it was destroyed.

480
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,560
There should be a wooden character in his name.

481
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,800
Since the money has been transferred to Nano Building,

482
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
why don't you ask Qin'er?

483
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,880
Her identity is affected.

484
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,960
She won't tell me.

485
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,920
You're right.

486
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,920
After all, he's a guest of Nanke Restaurant.

487
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,920
It's hard to disclose privacy.

488
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,400
Long Yan Nian is suspicious.

489
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,760
But if he really committed murder by embezzlement,

490
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,240
how do you explain this character?

491
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,320
Maybe

492
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,360
he gave money to someone else.

493
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,160
If the dragon really extends his life,

494
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,920
Long Yu'er was killed by his father,

495
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,320
when Long Yu'er was killed by her father.

496
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,400
Master!

497
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,560
Master, help!

498
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,200
Help!

499
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,800
Tell me.

500
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,440
You're a third-rank official.

501
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,200
is greedy.

502
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,000
How dare you commit murder by embezzlement?

503
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
I've let His Majesty down.

504
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,960
Yes.

505
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,880
Fortunately, he has a conscience.

506
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,760
He wrote down the crime before he died.

507
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,560
Sir.

508
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,760
The cause of death is poison.

509
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,120
My lord.

510
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,160
Several boxes of official silver were dug out from the backyard of Long Residence.

511
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,480
All the money from the Ministry of Revenue.

512
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,240
Okay.

513
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,400
Long Yan Nian committed suicide to escape punishment.

514
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,520
The evidence is solid.

515
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,640
You may leave.

516
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:11,960
Yes.

517
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,320
Lord Peng.

518
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,040
Constable Li.

519
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,680
My lord.

520
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,440
You've been working hard.

521
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,320
I can see that.

522
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,200
I'll remember your first contribution.

523
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,360
Thank you, my lord.

524
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,760
You don't need this cook to investigate the case anymore.

525
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,000
Don't say that.

526
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,200
How could you...

527
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,280
Let him see.

528
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,160
It's solid evidence.

529
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,400
Don't jump to conclusions.

530
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,320
What are you talking about?

531
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
Here is the confession letter.

532
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,680
Long Yan Nian killed a girl and regretted it.

533
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,920
The evidence has been confessed in the document.

534
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,400
This case is settled.

535
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,360
You chef.

536
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,640
Don't make trouble.

537
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,280
No.

538
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,600
If he pleads guilty,

539
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
how could he not admit it during my night visit?

540
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,160
This confession is not true.

541
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,120
Someone forged it.

542
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,680
Get out of my way!

543
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,640
Sir

544
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,720
Chef, what are you doing?

545
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,160
My lord.

546
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,240
If he didn't plead guilty,

547
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,120
I think it was him too.

548
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,920
But now that I think about it,

549
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,600
If Long Yan Nian wants to embezzle money,

550
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,320
it's just a false report.

551
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,440
Why kill him?

552
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,640
We just asked him.

553
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,720
he died right after that.

554
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,520
Before the trial,

555
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,960
Don't you think it's strange?

556
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,040
Chef, stop talking.

557
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,200
Shut up.

558
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
You want me to shut my mouth and promote you?

559
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:24,800
I...

560
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,120
Who asked me to help investigate the case?

561
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,320
Li.

562
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,480
The bones in your eyes

563
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,480
is just the staircase of your promotion

564
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,880
not a life?

565
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,320
Why are you mad at me?

566
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,280
The upper Liang is not good, the lower Liang is crooked.

567
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,800
Who did you say is wrong?

568
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,480
Me?

569
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,200
I have an uncle.

570
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,640
Go away!

571
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,200
You slandered a court official!

572
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,040
Guards!

573
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,200
Arrest him!

574
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,120
Take him down!

575
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,880
No need.

576
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,360
Let go of me!

577
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,120
Beat him!

578
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,680
Why can't you solve the case?

579
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,760
My lord.

580
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,320
Sun.

581
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,440
Stop him from making wild guesses.

582
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,960
Who let you in?

583
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,960
Arrest him!

584
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,480
My lord.

585
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Take me.

586
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,680
What a stupid card!

587
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Don't move!

588
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,200
Brother Gongsun.

589
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,080
Isn't he Sun?

590
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,960
Don't be rude.

591
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,680
Yes.

592
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,600
This is...

593
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,840
Minister of Revenue.

594
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,360
Gong Sun Li, son of Lord Gongsun.

595
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
Gongsun, Ministry of Revenue.

596
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,720
A relative

597
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,240
works in the Ministry of Revenue.

598
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,320
Congratulations on solving another strange case.

599
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,640
Your promotion

600
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,920
It's just around the corner.

601
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,440
Work for the people.

602
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,840
Work for the people.

603
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,320
I see.

604
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,720
Fine.

605
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,400
I was too ignorant to recognize you.

606
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,320
I think it's time for you

607
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,600
you should tell Lord Peng

608
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,680
to Lord Peng.

609
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,400
Tell me.

610
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,800
You know.

611
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,520
There's a character "Mu" in the suspect's name.

612
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Tell him

613
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,920
that even if Long Yan Nian is involved in this,

614
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,000
is not the only criminal.

615
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
The case is unclear.

616
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,400
We can't close the case.

617
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
No.

618
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
What character of wood?

619
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
I've never heard of it.

620
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,400
Chef.

621
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,040
It's time to end it.

622
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,200
Your relative

623
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,320
is safe enough.

624
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,520
Really?

625
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
What did you say?

626
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,240
I don't understand.

627
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,960
The murderer has been found.

628
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,400
No one will threaten you anymore.

629
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,200
Go find that woman and get the pouch back.

630
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,200
Why bother?

631
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,520
Shen Tuo,

632
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,760
I beg you.

633
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,560
Keep investigating.

634
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,600
only you can help me

635
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,000
who can help me.

636
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,800
Investigating a case is a thorny path.

637
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,200
Are you

638
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,400
are the same?

639
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,360
Of course.

640
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,640
I thought

641
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,120
you and I

642
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,800
like me.

643
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,720
Who wants you to change

644
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,200
and change the thorns on the road.

645
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,880
Are you disregarding human life, Gongsun Li?

646
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,000
You disregarded my life.

647
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,160
I didn’t do you wrong.

648
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,560
What about those bones?

649
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,360
The dead are gone.

650
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,200
I don't know Zuo You either.

651
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Brother Gongsun,

652
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,440
I am his witness.

653
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,960
Shen Tuo.

654
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
Keep investigating.

655
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,880
We must investigate.

656
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,040
Yes.

657
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,440
I'll investigate for him.

658
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,120
I will.

659
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Li Qin.

660
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,600
Come out!

661
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,640
Come out!

662
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,760
Come out.

663
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,000
Come out!

664
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,520
Give me the reward.

665
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,200
If you say the culprit is Long Yan Nian,

666
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,040
I can't give it to you.

667
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,440
You do know who the real murderer is.

668
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,440
But you kept silent.

669
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,400
because of your master's order.

670
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,600
Is that so?

671
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,200
So all of you

672
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,880
Li.

673
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,600
Peng Xiaoyu.

674
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,160
Gongsun Li.

675
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,000
All of you speak for the living.

676
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,440
right?

677
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,520
Shen Song.

678
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,600
Everyone has their own feelings.

679
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,880
You want the dead to speak,

680
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,840
But you have to allow the living to speak.

681
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,320
Bring him here.

682
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,320
Yes.

683
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,680
Let go of me!

684
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,800
I'm going to find the chef.

685
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,560
Let go of me!

686
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,200
Chef, I'm looking for you.

687
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,360
I have something to tell you.

688
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,600
I don't want to see him.

689
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,920
A wrong has a source.

690
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,240
Don't take it out on me.

691
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,920
I know this fool offended you.

692
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,640
I brought him here for you.

693
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,920
Beat him up.

694
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,000
Let's continue tomorrow.

695
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,640
Is she Qin?

696
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,960
Chef Shen.

697
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,760
Lock the door.

698
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,280
I run errands for you.

699
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,800
and spend money for you.

700
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,400
and help you investigate the case.

701
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,360
Can't you even look at me?

702
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,560
Long Yan Nian has official silver.

703
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,520
The corruption is solid.

704
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,640
He deserves to be the first criminal.

705
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,160
I'm talking to you.

706
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,400
Disgusting.

707
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,200
Chef, let me finish.

708
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,760
I'll help Peng Xiaoyu investigate the case.

709
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,160
for Peng Xiaoyu's case.

710
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
I know your plan.

711
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,360
I don't care who the culprit is.

712
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,560
As long as your father is not involved, right?

713
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,120
Long Yan Nian is not clean anyway.

714
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,320
So you won't feel guilty.

715
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,240
Of course I don't want my father to get into trouble.

716
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,800
But I didn't do you wrong.

717
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,520
You told me not to give up.

718
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,120
You went to Long Residence with me.

719
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,640
It's you.

720
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,360
You said you were on my side.

721
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,880
I believed it.

722
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,560
But what about you?

723
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,120
You dragged me to this thorny path

724
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,120
and stabbed me with a lie.

725
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,840
I stabbed you.

726
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,240
Chef.

727
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,760
You look down on me.

728
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,640
I was protecting you.

729
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,400
If I didn't obey Peng Xiaoyu,

730
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,880
you would have died.

731
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,280
I'd rather die

732
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,280
than live without conscience.

733
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,960
That's what I want to say.

734
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,920
I lied with Peng Hyo-ok.

735
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,120
The discussion has subsided.

736
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,200
The six departments are stable.

737
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,720
Everything is stable now.

738
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,920
the murderer will let his guard down.

739
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,080
He might give himself away.

740
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,520
Chef.

741
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,800
Sometimes lies are shortcuts.

742
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,480
Let me ask you.

743
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,600
If the real murderer takes the chance

744
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
and get away,

745
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,880
Once we get the file,

746
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,640
Even if we find the murderer,

747
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,560
Do you think Peng will retrial the old case?

748
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,440
Young Master.

749
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,280
You can afford it.

750
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,320
Can you afford

751
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,160
Can you afford it?

752
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,320
We're defending them.

753
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,760
So if you want to speak,

754
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,480
Tell the truth

755
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,480
Chef.

756
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,280
Why are you here?

757
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
I know.

758
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,480
you have your right.

759
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,239
But I have my own persistence.

760
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,960
You're Sun Li,

761
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,880
and Gongsun Li.

762
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,280
Do you know

763
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,760
I’m Shen Song.

764
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,880
I’m also Shen Shaodwen.

765
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:29,800
Wang Youseok.

766
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:29,800
