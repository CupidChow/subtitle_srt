1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,160
I'm a monster.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,680
But how did you know about the Parasyte Jutsu?

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,160
Because...

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm a monster too. I'm a monster too.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,800
That's interesting.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,880
I see.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,720
The respected Imperial Envoy

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,080
is the same as me.

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,400
I got this eye.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,520
I think it's a good thing

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,040
If I have help,

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,360
I feel weird.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,360
So I left the crowd to live.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,640
Even if a friend

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,840
who thinks he's different.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,480
When I knew you were like me,

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,840
I felt less lonely.

18
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,080
I'm here

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,520
to know

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,920
what's going on

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,080
What's going on?

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,880
Parasyte Technique.

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,520
is just our help.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,520
Adults can try

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,680
give all your thoughts to your eyes.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,320
You'll feel endless power.

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,600
full of power.

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,479
I just killed a few people.

29
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,000
Even if you want half the capital,

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,320
to join hands with me.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,800
to work with me.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,240
I'm afraid he killed more than a few.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,120
Seven years ago,

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,480
seven years ago, right?

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,760
Every time you commit a crime,

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,480
every time you commit the crime.

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,160
The silver robbery case seven years ago

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,720
in the silver robbery case seven years ago.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It was you.

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,680
You hid in the dark

41
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,720
and made them take the blame.

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,200
More than 20 of them died.

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
That's right.

44
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,640
When I return to the capital,

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
I need some money to start a fire.

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,120
The Ministry of Revenue

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
is the best choice.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,280
Thanks to Peng,

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,480
and made them take the blame for me.

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,040
Nice.

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,840
Peng Hyo-ok.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,360
Are you dead?

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,240
Seven years ago

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,080
The mandrill monster has confessed

55
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
It wasn't done by a ranger

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,880
Now Zhan Mao is still alive.

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,000
Please calm him down.

58
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,760
My monster brother.

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,960
It's time to show me who you are.

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,240
How dare you lie to me?

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
If you act rashly,

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
the first one to die

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,880
is your Imperial Envoy.

64
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,520
Lord Shen.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,160
You know you're weak,

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400
how dare you come to see me?

67
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,880
If I die,

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,520
you won't leave here alive.

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,079
Who said I want to live?

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,320
Shoot!

71
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,079
I'm a monster too!

72
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,800
Kill them all!

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Shoot!

74
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,600
Peng Hyo-yu!

75
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,760
Shoot!

76
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Lord Shen.

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,360
From now on,

78
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,320
I'll worship you.

79
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,960
Shoot!

80
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,880
Release your mother!

81
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,720
Who is it?

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,200
Do you have a heart

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,880
The chef is still in the mandrill

84
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,000
Mr. Gongsun

85
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,360
What are you looking for?

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,440
What are you looking for?

87
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,720
Zhan Mao'er.

88
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,960
I asked you here

89
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,279
to clear your name

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,640
Let people know the mandrill is someone else

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
You ruined my plan

92
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,920
Chef.

93
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,640
You are the last good official in this world.

94
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,000
Besides,

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,440
I'm going to kill this bastard myself.

96
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,000
and avenge my brother seven years ago.

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,280
The chef can't go.

98
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,200
Watch out!

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,400
Thank you.

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,240
Your brothers died for me.

101
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,120
Zhan Mao'er.

102
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,360
Thanks to Zhan Mao'er and Qin'er,

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,080
God didn't let you die.

104
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,040
How dare you!

105
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,560
Qin.

106
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,040
Look at you.

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
You used so much strength

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,159
The mandrill didn't kill him

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,200
You almost killed him

110
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,920
I am your destiny.

111
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,240
You drugged us.

112
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,200
and committed suicide.

113
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,880
Do you think we're a bunch of people?

114
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,040
You're right.

115
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,120
Chef.

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,480
Do you think of us as friends?

117
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
In the secret room in the yard

118
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,640
I know the mandrill and me

119
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,240
are monsters

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
My will was deprived.

121
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,640
How dare he hurt you?

122
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm not blaming you.

123
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
for making decisions for me.

124
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,640
I'm afraid...

125
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
What are you afraid of?

126
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,840
You're afraid that becoming a monster will hurt us.

127
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,640
so you refused to become a monster.

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,720
That's why I was in a coma.

129
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
When I was sick,

130
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,400
I heard your voices in my ears.

131
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,120
I know you want me to wake up.

132
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,120
But I shouldn't wake up.

133
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm a monster.

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,280
You're not a monster.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,880
Chef, who said you are a monster?

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,600
When I woke up that day, I knew

137
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
you knocked Qin and me out

138
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,480
because you wanted to face the mandrill alone

139
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,080
I knew you wanted to die with that monster

140
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,960
Chef.

141
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,320
You are too innocent.

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,920
You can't tolerate any evil in yourself.

143
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,880
But everyone has good

144
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,040
and evil.

145
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,120
It has nothing to do with the parasite.

146
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,520
Look at me.

147
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,720
I even dug the window of Nanke Building.

148
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
You can still tolerate me.

149
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,240
Why can't you tolerate yourself?

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,440
Luckily Zhan Mao'er brought us here.

151
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,040
Otherwise, you'll suffer

152
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,880
and die with that bastard.

153
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,600
I received a message from you

154
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,760
and asked me to go to the bridge.

155
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,960
I thought it was strange.

156
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,360
So I came here to find you.

157
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,120
I saw them fainted.

158
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,400
so I woke them up.

159
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,480
Gongsun Li guessed your purpose

160
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,400
to clear my name.

161
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
I was worried about you.

162
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,520
so I brought Qin to you.

163
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,640
Aren't you afraid?

164
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,360
Aren't you afraid that I'm a monster?

165
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
You've been under the Monster Eye for 13 years.

166
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,200
you suppressed it with your own will for 13 years.

167
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,320
That monster...

168
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,320
No matter who it is,

169
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,040
he chose evil.

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,200
Shen Shaodwen,

171
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,520
It doesn’t matter what you are.

172
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,800
What matters is your choice.

173
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,800
If you choose not to be a monster,

174
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,880
then you're not a monster.

175
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,240
You still remember to clear my name when you're about to die.

176
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,520
If this is a monster,

177
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,320
then what's so scary

178
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,760
a monster?

179
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,320
That's right.

180
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,680
What's so scary?

181
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
Since you are not afraid of me,

182
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,480
I won't be afraid of me.

183
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,360
Stinky chef.

184
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,280
We didn't find the body.

185
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,240
That's all we found?

186
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,120
The cat definitely killed him.

187
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
A cut to his throat.

188
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,200
Yes.

189
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,040
I saw it when I fell into the water.

190
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,080
I saw it wrong.

191
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,000
His joints are reversed.

192
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,960
different from others.

193
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,600
If his life

194
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
It's not in the throat

195
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,160
What do you mean?

196
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,160
If you can give me the Parasitic Jutsu,

197
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,320
or give him something else.

198
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,880
Cut his throat.

199
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,840
I may not be able to kill him.

200
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,920
He might not die.

201
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,920
What?

202
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,680
Sister Lotus.

203
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,720
How is this box of embroidery?

204
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,040
is the same as before.

205
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,240
Chairman Luo did it.

206
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,440
Zhan Mao Er.

207
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
I thought I should ask you

208
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,640
after the case is closed.

209
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,440
But now

210
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,280
we still haven't found the mandrill's body

211
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,480
I understand

212
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,720
You don't want him to get away with it.

213
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,120
Go ahead.

214
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,000
We all know

215
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
you're not that monster.

216
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,760
But why do you keep showing up at the crime scene?

217
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,400
Seven years ago,

218
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,440
when the government wiped out the wanderers,

219
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,560
Lotus saved me.

220
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400
What are you doing?

221
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,680
She saved me.

222
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,520
The government is handling a case.

223
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,080
Sir.

224
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,760
What brings you here?

225
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,400
Sorry to disturb you.

226
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,640
Have you seen a young man in red?

227
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,680
Of course.

228
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,280
What?

229
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Where is he?

230
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,840
Sir.

231
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm most afraid of those villains.

232
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,640
You must catch him.

233
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,120
I saw him running west just now.

234
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,400
Don't worry.

235
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,840
I do this.

236
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,640
So seven years ago,

237
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,720
she didn't guide Li

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,280
but protecting you.

239
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,280
So...

240
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,080
you have to repay me.

241
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,200
I have nothing

242
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,920
I have nothing.

243
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,680
But I'm capable.

244
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,000
At least,

245
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,720
I can protect her.

246
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,720
You knew something happened to her,

247
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,680
so you've been protecting her in the vase.

248
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,920
I was guarding the lotus on the wall.

249
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,480
That night,

250
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,720
I saw a monster dumping the body.

251
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,240
Stop! Stop!

252
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,040
Li only saw you.

253
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,960
So he treated you as the murderer.

254
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,960
I know that monster is powerful.

255
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,360
I heard the lotus is going to dance.

256
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,640
I'm afraid she might be in danger.

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,120
You want to take her away

258
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,240
and avoid the monster hiding in the dark.

259
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,480
Why did you buy sea viburnum smoke?

260
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,640
We got the wrong direction.

261
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,200
You want to be good to Yeon-hwa,

262
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,000
but you don't know how to treat her well.

263
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,640
So I thought of this incense.

264
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,600
I...

265
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,840
I've been saving money for a long time.

266
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
to buy the incense.

267
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,600
for her.

268
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,560
But why did the lotus

269
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
testify that you killed her at the tile?

270
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,280
That night,

271
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,160
I went to see the lotus in the vase.

272
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,320
The wanderer seven years ago...

273
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,680
It was you.

274
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,240
I will never forget

275
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,440
I dare not forget.

276
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,240
You're welcome.

277
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,800
From that day on,

278
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,200
I've hidden my real name.

279
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,560
and stayed in the capital.

280
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,440
to repay you.

281
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,400
You are in danger now.

282
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
I will protect you.

283
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,960
Even if

284
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,560
even if it costs my life.

285
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,160
to risk my life.

286
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,480
Do you really want to repay me?

287
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,400
No regrets.

288
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,160
Miss Lotus.

289
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,280
Lady Lotus.

290
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,280
What do you mean?

291
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,480
Take it.

292
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,240
I'm not doing this

293
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,800
not for money.

294
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,640
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,360
Run! Don't come back!

296
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,960
Miss Lotus!

297
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,720
Help!

298
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,280
Cat Zhan is here to rob me.

299
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,080
Help!

300
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Zhan Mao'er is here to kidnap me.

301
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,480
Help!

302
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,960
Help!

303
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,240
Help!

304
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,120
Help!

305
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,760
Help!

306
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,120
Zhan Cat is here to kidnap me.

307
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,880
Help!

308
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,880
Officer!

309
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,560
Officer, help me!

310
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,240
Zhan Mao'er

311
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
The mandrill ran that way

312
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,520
Go

313
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,360
Go

314
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,800
Lotus said you were a mandrill

315
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,400
What is her purpose

316
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,280
I don't understand.

317
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,840
Thank you for coming with me to the temple.

318
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,760
Do you know

319
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
why I'm here?

320
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
I found that

321
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,920
Hongyun and Ziyan went missing and came here to burn incense.

322
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,760
These two lucky bags

323
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,360
for you.

324
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,440
They are young.

325
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
They may not understand your efforts.

326
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,160
but I really think of you as my sister.

327
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,160
Yeon-hwa.

328
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,680
The injustice

329
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,880
Is it true?

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,480
You handled the case.

331
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,840
Why are you asking me?

332
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,480
Hongyun and Ziyan

333
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,160
are like sisters to you.

334
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,960
You risked your life to catch the murderer.

335
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,160
Zhan Mao'er is innocent.

336
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,880
You know that.

337
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,160
But you framed him.

338
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,520
When did your conflict start?

339
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
to protect someone?

340
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,160
All the things that happened yesterday...

341
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,320
Like yesterday

342
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
Although you haven't found the mandrill's body

343
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,040
the capital will be peaceful

344
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,760
There's no need to look into it.

345
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,520
You must let that monster go.

346
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,160
A monster is not born but a monster.

347
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,599
Officer Shen.

348
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,760
You don't have to remind me.

349
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,400
No one knows this better than me.

350
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,680
I once

351
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,160
to be a monster.

352
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,560
Since you know,

353
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,160
why don't you give it another chance

354
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,839
to make that monster human again?

355
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,560
You wanted to give that monster a chance.

356
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,600
But she didn't know

357
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,480
Monsters never give themselves a chance.

358
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,840
Magnolic Parasis

359
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,080
It consumes human nature.

360
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,800
Once humans are weak,

361
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
will be completely corroded by it.

362
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,920
Miss.

363
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,720
He has no chance.

364
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
If you want to give him a chance,

365
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,080
you should think about

366
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,040
Hongyun, Ziyan, Li,

367
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,320
They can no longer breathe.

368
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,640
[Their cold bodies were buried under the soil.]

369
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,840
their families cried every day.

370
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,680
but they can only look at each other in the next life.

371
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,160
They have no chance.

372
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,120
I know it.

373
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,560
You know who that monster is?

374
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,040
If it's not that monster who helped you,

375
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,440
or you love that monster,

376
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,560
so she tried to frame Zhan Mao

377
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,760
to protect him.

378
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,000
All the things that happened yesterday...

379
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,520
For example, I died yesterday.

380
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,920
Maybe you have let it go,

381
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,800
but I can't.

382
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Remember,

383
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,160
as long as the monster is alive,

384
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,160
he won't stop hurting people.

385
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,800
When the time comes,

386
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
how will you face

387
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,640
the innocent lives he killed?

388
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,600
Look at these two pouches.

389
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,240
Think about how many people in the world

390
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,040
with their blessings

391
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,800
like Hongyun and Ziyan.

392
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,920
died because of your concealment.

393
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,640
Chengyuan.

394
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,800
Long time no see.

395
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,960
When you brought me home,

396
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,800
I thought we would never be apart.

397
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,280
But I didn't expect

398
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,480
my parents sold me to the capital

399
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,680
because they couldn't feed me.

400
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,640
We made such a promise back then.

401
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,520
But Master Stone didn't open his eyes.

402
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,840
and separated us.

403
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,160
Rong Er.

404
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,920
I was weak back then.

405
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,360
I couldn't keep you.

406
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,720
So I studied hard

407
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,520
to get a tribute.

408
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,800
But when I returned to the city,

409
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,520
you refused to go with me.

410
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,000
and marry me.

411
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,360
Listen to

412
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,040
What kind of joke is this?

413
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,440
Rong Er.

414
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,680
I don't mind you being in the hook.

415
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,320
You'll get dirty.

416
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,040
I just want...

417
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,240
Who is your Rong Er?

418
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,680
Who cares about your marriage?

419
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,440
Look at the satin on me.

420
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,360
and see what you're wearing.

421
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,480
Hongyun.

422
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Bring me the silk.

423
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,520
It's from the son of Minister of Revenue.

424
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,640
It's yours.

425
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,720
Don't come here again.

426
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,280
I won't see you again.

427
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,680
You don't mind me being in the hook,

428
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,640
I also despise your feet of mud

429
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,160
because you stepped on my threshold.

430
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,760
Rong Er.

431
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,520
Hongyun.

432
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,480
Ziyan.

433
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,040
Get rid of this wild dog.

434
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,600
Yes.

435
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,560
Rong Er!

436
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,280
Get out!

437
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,920
Get out!

438
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,200
Let's go.

439
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,600
Rong Er.

440
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,000
Let's go.

441
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,000
Rong Er.

442
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,440
Rong Er.

443
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,480
I won't go with you.

444
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,240
I have my reason to leave.

445
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,960
There is a place where people eat.

446
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,160
My scar

447
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,960
was burned in that hell.

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,840
How can I

449
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,720
deserve Chengyuan?

450
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,840
Rong Er.

451
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Now that you're here,

452
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,920
Could it be...

453
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,640
change your mind?

454
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,680
I blamed myself.

455
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,120
First,

456
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,680
my parents sold me down there.

457
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,720
Second,

458
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,240
blame yourself for being worthless

459
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,320
I don't deserve Chengyuan.

460
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,800
But

461
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,520
since I knew the mandrill was from Stone Bridge

462
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,760
I thought of Chengyuan

463
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,200
Then you sent me this old thing.

464
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,920
I knew Chengyuan loved me.

465
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,280
He never hated me.

466
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,080
You're a monster now.

467
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,080
You're a monster.

468
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm a prostitute.

469
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,720
We can finally be together.

470
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Rong Er.

471
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,400
Are you really willing to...

472
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,400
Yes.

473
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,480
But...

474
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,000
the monster on you...

475
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,640
Rong Er.

476
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,760
Trust me.

477
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,880
It will never hurt you.

478
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,960
But it killed so many people.

479
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,040
Chengyuan.

480
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,280
Chengyuan.

481
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,680
Hongyun.

482
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,920
and Ziyan.

483
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,400
They are despicable.

484
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,160
Darn it.

485
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,000
And that Lee.

486
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,880
like a mad dog.

487
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,840
like a crazy dog.

488
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,520
Darn it.

489
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,560
Chengyuan.

490
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,200
And Shen Song

491
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,160
is a monster.

492
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,440
but he came to me.

493
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
Ridiculous.

494
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,680
They deserve to die.

495
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,960
Seung-won.

496
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,840
Don't do this. I'm scared.

497
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,320
Pretty.

498
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,560
Don't be afraid.

499
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,360
What are you afraid of?

500
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,040
What are you afraid of?

501
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,840
This loser.

502
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,120
Let me tell you.

503
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,760
He

504
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,640
can't take you away.

505
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
I can't take you away.

506
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,800
Follow me.

507
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,480
I'll take you away.

508
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,360
I'll take you to a place no one can find.

509
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,280
Okay?

510
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,440
Let her go.

511
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,160
Lotus!

512
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,560
Officer Shen.

513
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,800
The suspect confessed

514
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,560
killed Hongyun, Ziyan and Constable Li.

515
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,880
all of them?

516
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,840
Note it down.

517
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Bitch!

518
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,040
You betrayed me!

519
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,920
Stay back!

520
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,960
If you come any closer,

521
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,720
I'll strangle her to death.

522
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,240
Yeon-hwa!

523
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,880
Let her go!

524
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,840
Let her go!

525
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Mr. Gongsun.

526
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,920
I will never repay

527
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,760
I can't repay you in this life.

528
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,480
Lord Shen,

529
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,680
Please clear my sisters' name.

530
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,240
Yeon-hwa, come here.

531
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,480
Chef.

532
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,440
The neck is injured.

533
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,360
Luo Chengyuan.

534
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,160
You're not such a villain.

535
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,760
He's no longer Luo Chengyuan.

536
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,240
Back then,

537
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,800
after you rejected Luo Chengyuan,

538
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,920
he accepted the Parasyte Jutsu.

539
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,160
There was a monster

540
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,840
[And then, a monster appeared.]

541
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,640
Under the manipulation of that monster,

542
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,960
he returned to the capital to steal official silver from the Ministry of Revenue

543
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,400
and framed the wanderer.

544
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,120
Luo Chengyuan is still here.

545
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,000
He took care of

546
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
and took care of the Oiran.

547
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,760
to make your life better.

548
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,560
But in recent years,

549
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,280
under the eclipse of that monster,

550
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,040
he hates you more and more.

551
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,800
He can't control himself.

552
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,120
He killed Hongyun and Ziyan for revenge.

553
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,040
He has two thoughts.

554
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,480
Kindness and evil dissipate each other's strengths.

555
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,920
The more evil the monster is,

556
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,880
the weaker Luo Chengyuan is.

557
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,040
He can no longer control that monster.

558
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,480
but was controlled by that monster.

559
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,760
and killed Li to silence him.

560
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,920
Lotus.

561
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,960
If I’m right,

562
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
your Chengyuan

563
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,160
Yeon-hwa.

564
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,280
Tell me.

565
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,600
who used the malenic parasite spell.

566
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,000
Where is she now?

567
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,480
This girl's illusion

568
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,240
is interesting.

569
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,320
But Officer Shen,

570
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,040
do you know

571
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,080
If you care,

572
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,680
can be poisoned.

573
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
But since you already know,

574
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm not Luo Chengyuan.

575
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,520
You should know

576
