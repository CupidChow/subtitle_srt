1
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,080
Please don't kill me!

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,960
Don't come over!

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,320
There are so many ghost police.

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,280
and the king of hell.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,200
Grandpa Zhan, help me!

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,159
I don't want to put oil in the pot.

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,960
I don't want to swallow the needle.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,840
I beg you.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,240
Save me, Grandpa Zhan.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,240
You...

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,040
What's wrong?

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,360
You called me here in the middle of the night

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,760
just to see him go crazy?

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,720
No, no.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,280
No.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,800
Help me.

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,160
Let's go.

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,480
Grandpa Zhan is angry.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Wait for us.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,320
Look at me.

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,320
I didn't drink today.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,920
Why don't you go to the temple

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,200
How about eating alone?

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,400
It's bad luck.

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,880
Give it to me.

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,600
The Eastern Lord is so strong.

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,640
There are many fruits in the temple.

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,480
Let's go.

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,360
Go and say goodbye.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,080
What is it?

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,120
Ghost.

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,440
Ghost! Ghost!

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,720
Sir, this man has

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,960
there is no other wound

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,400
there are no other wounds.

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,520
Only hundreds of embroidery needles

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,400
in his heart and lungs.

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,880
But there are no wounds.

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,320
How did this needle get into your body?

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,040
This...

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,360
Lord Dong, Queen Mother.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,400
Buddha.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,199
Dear deities,

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,640
Bless me to get rid of bad luck.

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,880
Don't pester me.

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,600
What are you doing?

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,720
A circle.

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,440
What's the smell?

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,680
Talk nicely.

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,560
Stop making up stories.

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,920
I...

52
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,320
The market is not good these days.

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm really hungry.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,360
So Su gave me some advice

56
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,520
to get some supplies from the Yin Temple.

57
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,480
I saw the King of Hell

58
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,040
the King of Hell was investigating.

59
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,080
Criminal.

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,760
In front of Yeomra.

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,600
Are you still leaving?

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,080
Please spare my life.

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,440
Jiang He.

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,560
This is the Yin Department Government.

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,720
Liu Qiao Qiao, the embroiderer, complained.

66
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,920
You're talking nonsense

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,320
and forced an innocent woman to die.

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,560
Do you plead guilty?

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
I didn't.

70
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,079
Jiang He.

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
I am the Hell Hell.

72
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
I specialize in solving unbreakable crimes in the mortal world.

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,040
You're up to no good.

74
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,720
and killed Liu Qiaqiao.

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,120
He should be executed by acupuncture.

76
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,640
It's none of my business.

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,840
That bitch

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,079
herself.

79
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,560
The sinner doesn't admit it.

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,040
The oil pot tried to lie.

81
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,640
It's none of my business.

82
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,560
It's none of my business.

83
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,800
It has nothing to do with me.

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,160
If you're really innocent,

85
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,680
it's no different.

86
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,320
Put the pot in the pot.

87
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,920
It's none of my business.

88
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,080
No.

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm innocent.

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,519
I'm innocent.

91
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,240
I am innocent.

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
and punish me.

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,360
Swallow it.

94
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,760
Swallow it.

95
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,040
I was so scared.

96
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,760
I ran back in a hurry.

97
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,600
I don't know if I'm unconscious or asleep.

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,880
I thought it was a dream.

99
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,760
I never thought

100
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,640
it's true.

101
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
But I'm scared.

102
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,600
No blood.

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
nor burn marks.

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,640
Looks like it was cleaned.

105
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
If there was a fire,

106
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,200
the traces won't be removed.

107
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,120
Am I right?

108
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,880
Is it here?

109
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
I remember it right.

110
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,920
The judge has a pen.

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,880
Look at that cow and horse noodles.

112
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,760
Their laughter

113
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,960
scared me to death.

114
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,600
And that King of Hell.

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
That statue

116
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,880
seems to speak.

117
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,960
He shouts

118
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,880
The sky is shaking.

119
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,760
Come here.

120
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,120
Master Zhan.

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,600
Come here.

122
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,240
Please spare me.

123
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,240
Master Zhan.

124
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,920
In broad daylight,

125
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,640
Could it be...

126
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,680
Could it be?

127
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,120
Open the door of hell!

128
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,040
Please forgive me.

129
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Was there any incense on the altar?

130
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,920
Ghost.

131
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,120
Li is still alive.

132
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,080
Li.

133
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
My mother has calculated it for me.

134
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,760
I'll live a long life.

135
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,960
70 years of wealth.

136
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,720
Li.

137
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,120
My surname is Han.

138
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,120
A living person.

139
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,280
So where did you get the soul back?

140
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,880
Han...

141
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,120
Where are you from, Mr. Han?

142
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,440
From Yunzhou.

143
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,160
Yunzhou.

144
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,360
The chicken from Nanshan in Yunzhou...

145
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,200
is the most famous.

146
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
No chicken from Nanshan.

147
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,960
It has to be from Jiangkou.

148
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,680
Chicken from Jiangkou.

149
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,680
grew up feeding the grains.

150
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,159
The meat is the tenderest.

151
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,040
I got it wrong.

152
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,480
Indeed, the five-grain chicken at Yunzhou River

153
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,640
in Yunzhou River.

154
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,520
He looks so much like Li.

155
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,480
I can't say that.

156
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
This is exactly the same.

157
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,160
People are similar.

158
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,680
This is not similar.

159
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,480
This is so similar.

160
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
Please forgive my abruptness.

161
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,200
If you didn't have a piece of brown on your cheek,

162
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,560
even I would feel

163
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,680
my old friend is still alive.

164
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
Please forgive me.

165
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,120
It doesn't matter.

166
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
I searched everywhere just now.

167
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,280
I didn't find anything.

168
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,680
About Jiang He swallowing the needle,

169
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
He was bitten to death.

170
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,840
He saw it with his own eyes.

171
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,760
Get up.

172
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,320
The soul is back.

173
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,120
Li is back!

174
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,760
He's back!

175
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,559
Li is dead.

176
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,799
I'll take this loser back.

177
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,520
I'll wait for you in the kitchen.

178
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,120
Go ahead. I'm here.

179
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,800
Grandpa Zhan.

180
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Revival.

181
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,160
If he swallows the needle, he'll be able to explain it to you. He'll be fine. He'll be fine.

182
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,840
it can explain why Jiang He

183
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,200
why there is no needle on his back.

184
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,120
But if you swallow a needle,

185
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,120
the needle will enter the stomach along the esophagus.

186
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
Why is it pricked in the lungs?

187
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
Swallow the needle.

188
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,120
Can you swallow it?

189
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,960
What are you doing?

190
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,120
Qin.

191
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,800
Needle.

192
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
About this long.

193
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,680
Entering esophagus

194
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,040
it's inevitable that the wall is connected.

195
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
At this time,

196
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,240
when the external force press it,

197
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,680
it will pierce through esophagus

198
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,520
into the heart and lungs.

199
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,840
So go back.

200
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,720
See if there's any needle mark

201
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,360
on the esophagus.

202
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,760
You know how to identify corpses.

203
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
You see more dead people than living people.

204
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,200
It's hard not to know them well.

205
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,800
Virtuous Village in the north of the city.

206
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,760
I'm the butler of the morgue.

207
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,840
I made some homeless corpses

208
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,640
and worship the dead in the ghost temple.

209
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,280
Selling paper and scattering treasures

210
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,840
is my business.

211
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,360
So the villagers

212
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
Since we know each other today,

213
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,960
in the future,

214
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,200
please

215
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
take care of my business.

216
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,400
Goodbye.

217
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,360
This is our first meeting.

218
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
he asked us to take care of his business.

219
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,840
What a bad luck.

220
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,640
As long as it's human,

221
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,960
sooner or later.

222
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,360
Look.

223
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,040
A mouse lied.

224
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
The tongue pierced through the stomach and the mouth was torn into the sky.

225
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,960
Two rats stole the poisonous food

226
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,760
to seal this temple.

227
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,760
Without evidence,

228
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,440
without evidence.

229
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
The wine gourd said

230
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,640
The Yin Bureau

231
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
sentenced this person to commit a crime of lying.

232
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,520
Why don't we start from here?

233
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,560
Because of that brown,

234
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,400
Looking closely,

235
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,040
he looks exactly like him.

236
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,600
My lord.

237
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,960
This man has

238
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,880
in his esophagus.

239
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,080
It's really stinging

240
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,640
Chef Chef

241
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,480
I found it.

242
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,920
Jiang He really has a case.

243
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,880
What crime did Jiang He commit?

244
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,720
Murder.

245
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,520
The dead embroiderer Liu Qiaqiao

246
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,920
Murder is a serious crime.

247
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,720
Any punishment?

248
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,920
Insufficient evidence.

249
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,320
He was flogged and released.

250
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,600
I have a motive.

251
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,040
Defendant.

252
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,800
Liu Guanglong.

253
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,880
Liu Qiao Qiao's brother.

254
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,040
Send him in.

255
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,320
Send him in.

256
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,960
My lord.

257
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,920
My sister is beautiful.

258
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,480
She has a pair of skilful hands.

259
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,400
in the capital.

260
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Jiang He, that bastard.

261
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,120
saw her beautiful,

262
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
he came to propose.

263
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,680
He's a rascal.

264
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,640
How could my sister like him?

265
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,440
Jiang He couldn't get along with him,

266
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,800
So I stole her handkerchief

267
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,640
and spread rumours everywhere.

268
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,880
It was a coincidence

269
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,240
I lost my chastity

270
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
to him.

271
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,080
How could he humiliate a woman like this?

272
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,760
What a beast!

273
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,320
Jiang He made a great story.

274
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,720
and spread it everywhere.

275
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,080
and ruined Qiao's reputation.

276
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,800
She's clever and arrogant.

277
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,240
I can't stand humiliation.

278
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
That night,

279
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
he hung himself.

280
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,040
to kill people.

281
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,960
Lord Shen.

282
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,840
I know

283
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,720
you hate evil like hatred.

284
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
Please make an announcement.

285
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
The crime of Jiang He

286
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,360
to clear my sister's name.

287
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,800
Liu Qiaqiao is innocent.

288
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,280
But Jiang He's crime

289
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,800
there is no such rule

290
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,720
in our current law.

291
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,320
Liu Guanglang,

292
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,440
Let me ask you.

293
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,400
Where were you last night?

294
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,920
My lord.

295
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,040
I entered the city

296
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,760
I entered the city this morning.

297
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,480
There is a way to prove it.

298
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,600
There's no chance to kill Jiang He.

299
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,160
I know why you called me here.

300
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,880
Jiang He was interrogated by Yeomra last night.

301
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,680
and died with a needle.

302
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,520
My lord.

303
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,480
Do you know

304
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,920
he cursed before he died?

305
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,440
The curse

306
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,760
was Jiang He who died with a needle.

307
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,520
Liu Guanglang is not the murderer.

308
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,760
The Liu family is cold.

309
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,480
I don't care about the murderer.

310
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
to avenge Liu Qiao Qiao.

311
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,800
It can't be that Yamen

312
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,920
really meddle in the civil affairs?

313
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,920
You don't believe this.

314
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,680
That's why it's strange.

315
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,520
The person involved is not the murderer.

316
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,080
How do people

317
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,280
know so much?

318
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,920
Anyway,

319
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,120
Jiang He didn't die unjustly.

320
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,320
Princess is so unlucky.

321
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,200
What's wrong with it?

322
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,040
I heard a rumor on the street

323
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,760
that the princess was killed by Gu Luan Sha.

324
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,520
What?

325
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,120
You were taken away from the marriage proposal.

326
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,600
and proposed to Chen Xiuqian.

327
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,440
Chen Xiuqian just disappeared.

328
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,840
But now,

329
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,160
no one in the capital dares to marry her.

330
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,960
What does it have to do with her?

331
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
It's all my fault.

332
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,480
Come at me if you dare.

333
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Many people are talking about you.

334
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,440
But these rumors

335
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,360
are more mean to women.

336
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,280
Just like Liu Qiaqiao.

337
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,480
Right?

338
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm going home.

339
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,960
Son.

340
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,240
You can be a loser,

341
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,120
but you can't be shameless.

342
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,920
Give it back to him.

343
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
It's from Rong Hua.

344
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,920
The one from Rong Hua should be returned to him.

345
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,680
Prince Rui is such a fool.

346
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,040
He doesn't care about anything.

347
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,160
Just treat his daughter as an eye.

348
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,440
You cheated him once.

349
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
He hated me for years.

350
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,720
If you bully his daughter again,

351
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,200
he won't forgive you.

352
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,800
Father.

353
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,880
I picked it up.

354
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
I was thinking why I picked up

355
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,960
Why did you let me pick it up?

356
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,880
We discussed marriage before.

357
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,400
Isn't this fate?

358
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,440
What do you mean?

359
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,480
Go on.

360
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,280
I want to see how shameless you are.

361
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,840
Father.

362
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,320
Rong Hua's marriage

363
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,040
I'm the one to blame.

364
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,120
She is such a good girl.

365
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,120
I feel guilty

366
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,880
I feel bad.

367
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,960
Besides,

368
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,240
has to get married.

369
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
Your son's marriage is still hanging.

370
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,560
You feel uneasy too.

371
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,920
Rong Hua...

372
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,760
Right?

373
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,880
Then we...

374
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,880
Ridiculous.

375
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,240
Is marriage a joke?

376
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,960
Father.

377
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,760
You don't even like Rong Hua.

378
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,440
You have high standards.

379
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,720
Do we look down on them?

380
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,560
They look down on us.

381
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,240
Does he like us?

382
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,400
we have to give it a try.

383
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,440
If you really like her,

384
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,240
you can be responsible for her.

385
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,920
I will

386
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,600
for you.

387
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,320
I can try it for you.

388
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,880
But look.

389
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,760
What are you thinking?

390
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,320
How do you know I treat her badly?

391
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,840
Look at her outside.

392
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm saving her.

393
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,680
It's because she's evil.

394
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,440
What do you mean?

395
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,079
How long can you

396
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,520
how long will you last?

397
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,800
If you are ready to do your best,

398
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,480
then you can shamelessly

399
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,920
to propose to her.

400
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,240
But you

401
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,040
just because you want to be a hero,

402
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,640
to be a hero.

403
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,440
You don't deserve it.

404
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,720
I don't expect you to bring glory to our family.

405
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,560
But as a man,

406
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,720
you have to be confident

407
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,040
and responsible.

408
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,520
Think carefully.

409
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,320
You are

410
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,360
are loyal to Rong Hua

411
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,200
or the love of being together forever?

412
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,520
No wonder my father said

413
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,080
your father is a fool,

414
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,360
but it's good inside.

415
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
I'm always shallow.

416
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,840
You broke off my engagement.

417
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,040
I thought no one would talk about you.

418
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,480
but now you're so full of yourself.

419
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,520
I think

420
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,360
help you.

421
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,680
My father is right.

422
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,120
One must be upright.

423
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,920
That's why I'm here today

424
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,040
to apologize to you.

425
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,600
So petty.

426
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,920
I'm not afraid of marriage.

427
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,520
I don't care what others say.

428
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,560
If one day,

429
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,600
as you said,

430
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,800
I met someone

431
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,160
to spend the rest of my life with.

432
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
he wouldn't be afraid of my rumors.

433
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,480
If he doesn't have such a generosity,

434
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,320
he wouldn't be the person I want.

435
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,120
I was narrow-minded.

436
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,400
Thank you.

437
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,680
I stole it.

438
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
If you really feel sorry,

439
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
I heard that the Yin Bureau

440
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,400
is killing people.

441
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,640
Do you have any news?

442
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,120
Tell me.

443
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,040
You can't hide yourself.

444
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,440
The news?

445
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,840
Not really.

446
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,880
But Liu Qiaqiao

447
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,640
Someone died.

448
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,200
Someone died again.

449
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Who is this?

450
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,880
So scary.

451
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,280
So scary.

452
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,240
Exactly.

453
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,760
This is the use of slaughters' blood.

454
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,200
The blood is dried.

455
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,680
When was the time of death?

456
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
Last night.

457
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,160
Who found it?

458
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,080
My lord.

459
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,160
I made an appointment with Li Si

460
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,320
to pick up the meat this morning.

461
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,480
I'll come as promised.

462
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Fourth Brother Li.

463
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,400
Fourth Brother Li.

464
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,080
Fourth Brother Li, are you there?

465
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,400
You mean

466
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,520
the door was locked from inside?

467
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,760
My men got the message

468
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,760
and broke the window.

469
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,240
The window is also locked.

470
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,200
The calcium inside.

471
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,720
You may leave.

472
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,600
Yes.

473
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,440
We've searched everywhere.

474
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,400
There's no back door.

475
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
In other words,

476
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
when the victim died,

477
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,600
he could only be alone in the room.

478
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
Qin, Zhan Mao'er.

479
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,240
You follow the coroner

480
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,360
with the coroner.

481
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,480
Gongsun Li, stay here.

482
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,240
Follow me to check if there is a mechanism.

483
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,880
can be closed from outside.

484
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,800
Did you find anything?

485
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,080
It is indeed a secret room.

486
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,080
Unless the victim committed suicide

487
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,040
before she died.

488
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,440
No.

489
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,680
Let's release the blood first.

490
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,680
Even if a person is determined to die,

491
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,520
you can't torture yourself like this.

492
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,440
Who can be so cruel to himself?

493
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,160
as a suicide?

494
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,960
Was there a fight before?

495
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,960
Other than the knife wound from the throat,

496
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,160
and bruises caused by the fall,

497
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,600
There are no other wounds.

498
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,880
There's a bruise on the cliff.

499
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,720
It means that people are alive

500
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,640
he was alive.

501
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,360
and he died from bleeding.

502
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,600
It should be fine.

503
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,200
He didn't struggle to protect himself.

504
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,480
Did he lose consciousness before he died?

505
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,880
I can't feel the pain.

506
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,640
Have you taken sleeping pills?

507
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,920
No medicine was found.

508
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,640
or drink.

509
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,920
It seems that the victim was conscious

510
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,440
he was conscious.

511
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,960
A sober man was killed.

512
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,120
If it wasn't suicide,

513
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,400
why didn’t he fight back?

514
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
Moreover, the door and windows are closed.

515
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,840
there was no trace of anyone else there.

516
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
I know you don't like it.

517
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,440
But if there really is a murderer,

518
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,520
it's not human.

519
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,960
It doesn't seem to be done by manpower.

520
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,200
Are you suspecting me?

521
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
I mean,

522
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,040
there must be a reason.

523
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,080
If I hadn't known you,

524
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
I wouldn't believe

525
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,520
by ringing a bell.

526
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,080
If we still can't identify the body,

527
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,200
it must be that we haven't seen enough.

528
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,720
You know how to identify corpses.

529
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,040
You see more dead people than living people.

530
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
It's hard not to know them well.

531
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,720
What the hell is this?

532
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,200
What the hell?

533
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,720
Mr. Han, right?

534
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,160
Give me a hand if you know him.

535
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,680
I got a big job at the Yin Temple.

536
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,600
I have to go now.

537
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,480
Just say it.

538
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,080
We met at the Yin Temple before.

539
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,720
I know.

540
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,480
My chef wants to see you.

541
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,840
Someone died so soon in the chef's house.

542
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,480
Can you talk?

543
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,120
Then why did he come to me?

544
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,240
We can't destroy the body.

545
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,200
Are you going to let me see it or not?

546
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Sir, please have a look.

547
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,640
You have a good taste.

548
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,680
Learn from me.

549
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,360
Here.

550
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,200
Here.

551
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,440
The meat in the brothel

552
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,240
It's not a pig or lamb

553
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,440
It doesn't matter if the meat is good or not.

554
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,760
Is meat good?

555
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,400
with the meat.

556
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,280
This person is hanging upside down.

557
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,040
Yes.

558
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
So you can't find

559
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,320
any trace of murder.

560
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,360
But I think

561
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,760
he committed suicide.

562
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,240
Exactly.

563
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,320
Even if it's impossible,

564
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
he committed suicide.

565
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,520
He's different from you.

566
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,720
You're spoiled.

567
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,600
They are used to heavy work.

568
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,680
and strong.

569
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
But no matter how strong a person is,

570
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,400
he can't lift himself up.

571
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,880
Right? But think about it.

572
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,520
If he uses heavy objects

573
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,200
he can do it.

574
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,840
The wound on the tiger's mouth.

575
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,240
This is caused by

576
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,480
that carries heavy objects.

577
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,600
Plus,

578
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,080
I saw him

579
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,920
his waist was also torn.

580
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,880
This is a steel hook in the air.

581
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,200
and cut off the rope.

582
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,880
and caused it.

583
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,560
Found it!

584
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,560
Come and help!

585
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,360
What did I say?

586
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,520
Suicide.

587
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,520
Have you seen

588
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,640
who committed suicide?

589
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,320
I saw

590
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,040
after their death.

591
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,120
Besides,

592
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,200
I'm not a coroner

593
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,880
or a detective.

594
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,600
What does it have to do with me?

595
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,600
If there's nothing else,

596
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,840
just send me away.

597
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,160
This dead pork is like dead meat.

598
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,240
It stinks.

599
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,400
Please, sir.

600
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,720
What did you say?

601
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,040
I said he looks like Li.

602
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,640
but Li isn't that weird.

603
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
and annoying.

604
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,080
Yes.

605
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,440
So he's definitely not Lee.

606
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,960
A mouse lied.

607
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,040
The tongue pierced through the stomach and the mouth was torn into the sky.

608
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,080
Two rats stole poisonous food.

609
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,440
Bloody and dried meat, Day B.

610
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,640
One, two, three.

611
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,400
Sir.

612
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,440
Sir.

613
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,720
What did you just sing?

614
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,240
A mouse lied.

615
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,560
The tongue pierced through the stomach and the mouth was torn into the sky.

616
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,800
Two rats stole poisonous food.

617
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,800
The day of the day when the flesh is drained,

618
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,640
One, two, three.

619
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,600
That's the word.

620
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,120
Just some children's songs.

621
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
What is it?

622
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
When does it start?

623
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,840
Where does it start

624
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,040
I don't know.

625
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Everyone is singing.

626
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,920
A mouse lied.

627
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,200
The tongue pierced through the stomach and the mouth was torn into the sky.

628
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,400
Two rats stole poisonous food.

629
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,400
[The day of the day when the blood was drained,]

630
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,400
Three rats resent each other.

631
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
Bloody blood flows in the afternoon.

632
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,040
Four rats and women

633
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,800
[They practiced for nothing.]

634
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,440
Five rats eat ink.

635
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
One life, one day.

636
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,040
My tongue pierced through my stomach.

637
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
Jia Yin Tian.

638
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,680
The day Jiang He died with a needle

639
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,120
was the day of Jiayin.

640
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,920
Yesterday, on the day of Yi Mao,

641
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,600
Li Si died in the meat stall.

642
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,120
He's dead meat.

643
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,600
It seems

644
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,400
this song is

645
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,480
These two cases...

646
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,920
In this song,

647
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,360
in this song.

648
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,760
and time of death.

649
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,280
We've investigated Jiang He's case.

650
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,800
Jiang He did lie to kill people.

651
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,640
If the second rat

652
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,280
is talking about Li Si,

653
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,120
Stealing food

654
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,480
is his crime.

655
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,800
If we can verify it,

656
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,440
our guess is right.

657
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,960
The two cases are the same person

658
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,040
or the same gang.

659
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,120
What are we waiting for?

660
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,480
If Li Si really has a case,

661
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,040
the government must have records.

662
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,960
Aren't you afraid that you might see something wrong?

663
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,720
Did you find anything?

664
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,080
No one has ever

665
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
against Li Si.

666
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,560
Are you mistaken?

667
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,040
The case of Li Si and Jiang He

668
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,880
are just suitable for the song.

669
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,680
But it was not done by one person.

670
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,920
Therefore, the case can't be merged.

671
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
No one reported Li Si.

672
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,800
A meat stall where someone said goodbye.

673
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,880
Another butcher shop.

674
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,600
is also outside Phoenix’s door.

675
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,040
One more.

676
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,280
This is also a butcher shop.

677
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,480
It's still outside Phoenix's gate.

678
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,720
It's not far from Li Si's butcher shop.

679
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,520
That's strange.

680
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,520
These two meat stall

681
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,280
opened earlier than Li Si's meat stall.

682
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,520
Everything has been fine.

683
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,440
But last year,

684
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,280
he ate the dead first.

685
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,160
were sued by the family of the deceased.

686
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
The meat was poisoned.

687
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,680
In the end, they all went bankrupt.

688
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I can't open it anymore.

689
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
I see.

690
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,520
Last year,

691
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,120
there were three meat stall outside Phoenix’s gate.

692
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,160
Three shops on one street.

693
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,840
The competition is fierce.

694
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,280
But on our way here,

695
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,760
we only saw Fourth Li's family.

696
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,200
were sued

697
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,440
the other two families were sued

698
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
were forced to close.

699
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,960
Are you saying that in the past year,

700
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,880
in the past year

701
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,320
can only buy meat from Fourth Li's family.

702
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,280
He'll earn

703
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,360
a full bowl.

704
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,040
Two lawsuits.

705
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,880
seems to have nothing to do with Li Si.

706
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,960
But Li Si is the only beneficiary.

707
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,480
You mean

708
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
if the two meat stalls are fine,

709
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,600
they were poisoned by Li Si

710
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,040
That's why he was wronged.

711
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,640
Then,

712
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,360
we can fight against two rats and steal the poisonous food.

713
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,200
Li Si used poison

714
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,680
with poison.

715
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
If that's the case,

716
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,440
Li Si is so vicious.

717
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,520
He argued with others

718
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,800
he poisoned the people.

719
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,640
He deserves to die.

720
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,320
They all match.

721
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,200
The so-called Yin Bureau

722
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,920
is really related to Hell Music.

723
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,840
They're killing according to the songs.

724
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,640
Murder with songs.

725
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,520
But the chef...

726
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,360
I still feel a little strange.

727
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,880
If it's a murder,

728
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,200
Liu Qiao Qiao's case

729
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,960
or the meat stall poisoning case,

730
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,160
Although the victim died tragically,

731
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,520
the details of the case

732
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,600
the details of the case.

733
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,680
There are

734
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,120
in the capital.

735
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,520
Such civil affairs

736
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,920
how could the murderer know the truth?

737
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
Since the song is matched,

738
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,240
we will combine the case.

739
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,720
We will find out the reason.

740
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,280
It's early in the morning.

741
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,040
Who is it? So noisy.

742
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,560
Princess.

743
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,680
Where are they?

744
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
Stinky stray cat, stop arguing.

745
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,960
Sister Qin, it's very lively outside.

746
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,080
Let's take a look.

747
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,520
Folks,

748
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,840
I have a great news.

749
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,880
Let me tell you.

750
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,600
What good news do you have?

751
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,240
It's a great thing.

752
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,680
The King of Hell has opened his eyes.

753
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,120
to punish the evil.

754
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,440
Finally, I feel relieved.

755
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,600
Little girl,

756
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,960
From now on,

757
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,760
the Yin Bureau is in charge.

758
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,520
the people of the capital

759
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
will get better.

760
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,200
Sister.

761
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,160
You mean the case of Li Si yesterday?

762
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,040
Yes.

763
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,720
My home was outside the Vermilion Bird Gate.

764
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,880
outside the Phoenix Gate.

765
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,400
That bastard, Li Si,

766
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,320
He framed my father and brother for murder.

767
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,280
Fortunately,

768
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,840
he was killed by the King of Hell.

769
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Happy.

770
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,760
How do you know

771
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,720
the King of Hell saved you?

772
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,360
What else could it be?

773
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,360
I'll report him to the Yin Temple.

774
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,960
The Yin Temple is so magical.

775
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,480
It's not the government's business.

776
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,720
The Yin Department.

777
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,480
Yin temple again?

778
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,160
Why are you looking for me?

779
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,120
Is it illegal to set off firecrackers?

780
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,640
You have no idea.

781
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,920
This is the Imperial Envoy, Shen Song.

782
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,080
But Lord Shen has a few questions for you.

783
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,200
Answer me honestly.

784
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,840
Miss Zhao.

785
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,320
The case of Zhao's butcher shop last year.

786
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,120
The meat in our pawnshop

787
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,960
in our pawnshop.

788
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,240
If the government wants to punish us,

789
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
we won't accept it.

790
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,480
We all do business.

791
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
We can't deny it.

792
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,640
In two days,

793
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,280
the same thing happened

794
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,320
the same thing happened.

795
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,800
we thought

796
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,880
this is strange.

797
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,880
I knew it was Li Si.

798
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,920
But we have no evidence.

799
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,080
Peng will not file a case.

800
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,160
The government failed to sue him.

801
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,280
So you went to the temple later?

802
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,240
That's right.

803
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,720
Father and brother are here.

804
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,760
I was flogged in the government office.

805
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,320
and the butcher shop was closed.

806
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,200
I was just angry.

807
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,560
I went to the Yin Temple to curse him.

808
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,760
I didn't expect it to work.

809
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,200
Lord Yeomra.

810
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,160
Wang Wu is a bad businessman.

811
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,640
Please have a look.

812
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,840
Let him be punished.

813
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,320
Go away.

814
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,240
You are all here

815
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,200
What are you doing here?

816
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,520
I don't want to live anymore.

817
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,560
Let's go home.

818
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,720
Let's go home.

819
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,680
How dare you tell on me?

820
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,120
Do you still respect me?

821
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
I want to sue you again.

822
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,240
Peng doesn't care about his malpractice.

823
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,400
What are you talking about?

824
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,840
Take it.

825
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,960
Let's go.

826
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,920
Let's go.

827
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,440
Let's go home.

828
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,360
Let's get out of here.

829
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,240
Let's go.

830
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,160
My lord.

831
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,040
Does it really work?

832
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,320
Done.

833
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,200
A mouse lied.

834
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,400
The tongue pierced through the stomach and the mouth was torn into the sky.

835
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,760
Two rats stole poisonous food.

836
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,719
[The day of the day when the blood was drained,]

837
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,679
Three rats resent each other.

838
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,719
Bloody blood flows in the afternoon.

839
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,040
Four rats and women

840
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,280
[They practiced for nothing.]

841
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,480
Five rats eat ink.

842
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,560
One life, one life, one day.

843
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,360
The first two cases

844
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,040
are facing the first two lines of the song.

845
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,400
The first mouse lied.

846
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,159
was talking about Jiang He's rumor.

847
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,400
and killed Liu Qiaqiao.

848
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,040
So she was punished by acupuncture.

849
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,239
and his tongue is rotten.

850
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,360
The second rat poisoning.

851
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,600
It means that Li Si framed his peers

852
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,360
and killed the people who bought meat.

853
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,080
and ended up being exposed by blood.

854
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,239
The time is right.

855
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,920
That's right.

856
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,040
As I expected.

857
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,960
The so-called Yin Bureau

858
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,320
is a forewarned murder

859
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,560
It's a forewarned murder.

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:02,760
