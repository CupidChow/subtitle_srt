1
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,120
Look!

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,880
What is this?

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,360
What is this

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,800
It's everywhere

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,200
What is this

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,280
What's going on?

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,439
Duke of Security.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,720
You really came.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,920
The man behind Wang Ping

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Push him out to plead guilty

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
to put an end to this as soon as possible.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,040
But the Duke of Security borrowed the mother and son's bodies

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,680
to make a big deal out of it

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,640
to dig up the old case.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,480
Guess

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,720
he's willing to end it hastily?

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,240
Guess again.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,400
The mother and son in the Earth Temple.

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,720
He used the chance to spread rumors

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,400
The Imperial Envoy abandoned the city and beheaded him.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,440
Everyone in the capital wants to see it.

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,320
To him,

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,480
isn't that

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,520
when you fall asleep?

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,239
So,

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,200
he will make a move.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,200
Are you crazy?

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,280
You're crazy too.

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,840
There's no security in this world.

30
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,120
How many lives do you have?

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,960
Are you gambling like this?

32
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,840
Since I met you,

33
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,440
since I met you.

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,280
You're right.

35
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,560
What if he really

36
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,440
he won't come?

37
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,200
Then kill me.

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,080
and establish the dignity of the magistrate of Kaifeng.

39
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,039
How dare you!

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,440
You dare?

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,360
I dare not.

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,400
I dare not.

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,080
Don't worry.

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,640
My head

45
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
can't fall off.

46
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,640
Didn't you say

47
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,039
Duke of Security inherited Mr. Guan's will.

48
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,280
Grain lost and virtuous.

49
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,960
You're so ungrateful.

50
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,400
Break white into black.

51
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,960
You can't tell right from wrong.

52
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Duke of Security.

53
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,200
was written by Duke of Security.

54
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,720
Now he's making a big fuss.

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,320
This is the spirit of the Duke of Security.

56
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
Wang Ping, the dead in prison,

57
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,480
is a disguise.

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,120
Not only did he disturb the investigation,

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,600
but also framed the Imperial Envoy Shen Song.

60
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,039
He is not a witness.

61
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,360
He is a sinner.

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
Imperial Envoy Shen Song

63
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,079
is innocent.

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,760
Innocent.

65
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,200
What are you waiting for?

66
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,360
Untie him.

67
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,720
Let him go. You can't frame a good person.

68
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,600
Great!

69
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,960
Great.

70
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,400
I didn't see anyone suspicious.

71
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,880
This rope...

72
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,200
Yes.

73
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,920
Tie a knot

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,600
Tie grains on the knot

75
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,360
Pigeon pecks grains.

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,240
Break the knot.

77
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,240
and spilled it.

78
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,960
Keep the change.

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,840
Since he planned this,

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,440
he won't find it.

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,640
Swordsman.

82
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,120
With a big knife,

83
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,560
At that critical moment

84
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,760
And then?

85
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Go on.

86
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,560
The Duke of Security is here.

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,200
What does the Marquis look like?

88
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Did you see it?

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,720
The Duke of Security is a ghost.

90
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,440
How can you show your real body in the daytime?

91
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,400
It's only a matter of time

92
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,480
Words spread all over the sky

93
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,560
It's like snowing in June.

94
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,720
The Duke of Security is telling the world

95
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,320
Shen Song.

96
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,079
I’m wronged.

97
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,360
After the order of the Security Marquis,

98
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,079
Shen Song is innocent.

99
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,840
His decree has been abolished.

100
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,680
Your Grace is wise.

101
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,120
Peng Xiaoyu didn't even dare to fart.

102
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,800
and gave it to Lord Shen.

103
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,079
to Lord Shen.

104
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
My father trapped me.

105
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,560
I didn't get to see it.

106
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,920
We lost our grain.

107
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,280
Grain loss and virtue.

108
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,040
How did the Duke of Security know

109
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,360
about Fengdeku?

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,480
Is it because of the leak?

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
Our people are all cooked.

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,760
without anyone knowing.

113
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,320
Unconsciously?

114
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,840
Yes.

115
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,959
Only ghosts know.

116
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,160
Ghost!

117
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
There's really a ghost.

118
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
We lost our grain.

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Fengdeku

120
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,159
It's an official warehouse.

121
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
I remember

122
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,080
it was a warehouse.

123
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
It's an important clue.

124
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,760
We should start from the granary.

125
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
Fengdeku?

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,440
Qin...

127
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
Aren't you going to take a look?

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,520
Qin.

129
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,280
Qin.

130
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,800
As you know,

131
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
I don't want to get involved in the power struggle of the imperial court.

132
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,720
I became the Imperial Envoy

133
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,800
to prove

134
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,120
for the Shen family one day.

135
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,040
I thought

136
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Duke of Security was a despicable man.

137
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,200
But later I found out

138
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,800
what he did

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,920
is the way of doing good.

140
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,160
Qin.

141
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,160
At this point,

142
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,240
I still don't want to get involved in the court.

143
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,760
But if I help him,

144
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
it's hard not to go deep.

145
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,880
Your master...

146
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,360
I don't know his position.

147
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,200
So I had to...

148
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,680
So you won't die this time.

149
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,720
Gong Sun Li and Zhan Mao Er know it.

150
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,440
Even Peng Xiaoyu knows it.

151
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
You kept it from me

152
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,760
because I was afraid that my master would let me stop you.

153
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,200
Qin.

154
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
I dare not believe you.

155
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,680
Are you afraid to believe

156
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,400
or not?

157
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,400
You don't have to trust me.

158
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I don't care.

159
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
But from now on,

160
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,040
let's pretend we never met.

161
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,960
Qin, where are you going?

162
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,640
Qin, don't go.

163
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,480
Qin.

164
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,280
Why are you doing this?

165
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,159
It's a good thing.

166
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
From now on,

167
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,360
we will

168
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,560
know each other well.

169
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,960
When you're in a good mood,

170
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,440
What a ugly smile.

171
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,240
Just now at the door,

172
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,800
I was bewitched by a bell.

173
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,240
After climbing up,

174
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,200
I saw the golden house

175
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,360
and Yan Ruyu.

176
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
It must be your bell.

177
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,600
Don't.

178
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,840
The kitchen is small.

179
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,159
can't tolerate you.

180
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,919
I'm a man.

181
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,120
It's inconvenient for men and women.

182
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,560
This

183
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,080
is my specialty.

184
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Kyoko, bad goose.

185
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,720
Look how loyal he is.

186
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,480
Don't provoke me.

187
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
When you die,

188
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,040
if I give you any money for your funeral,

189
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,400
I lose.

190
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,560
When I was sick,

191
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
I heard your voices in my ears.

192
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,080
I know you want me to wake up.

193
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,760
But I shouldn't wake up.

194
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm a monster.

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
I got kicked out!

196
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,760
A long tongue.

197
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,400
It's none of your business.

198
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,640
I told you

199
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
you'll be unlucky if you care about a man.

200
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,200
Isn't this...

201
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,960
Am I right again?

202
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,400
The master has ordered us to do it.

203
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,640
What?

204
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,240
I can't come to you without your order?

205
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,120
If this is all you want to say,

206
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,800
I'll cut off your tongue.

207
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,560
I'll take it back and cook some snacks for the cook.

208
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,760
Are you really tempted?

209
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,400
A piece doesn't have a heart.

210
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,200
How to move?

211
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
Master ordered you to follow Shen Song.

212
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
If you leave like this,

213
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,240
What will you do now?

214
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,520
I told you to study more.

215
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
It's called a dead end.

216
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,320
I want to leave him first.

217
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,840
and let him know that he should trust me.

218
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,480
It'll be easier later.

219
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,440
He fell into the well.

220
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,280
It's all because of a stubborn mouth.

221
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,080
with a bare mouth.

222
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,440
You...

223
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,600
This is the grain delivery record of last month.

224
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,840
This is the record of folk funds.

225
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,320
Bong Deku.

226
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,520
13,700 dans.

227
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,880
Samtong Storage

228
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,120
6,475 dan.

229
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Is there any problem?

230
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,120
Since the disaster in Ludong,

231
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
there are 100,000 dan of grains from the treasury.

232
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,840
Including the food donated by the rich monks,

233
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
over 163,000 dan in total.

234
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,400
Half of them

235
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,960
to Ludong for disaster relief.

236
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,880
The other half stays in the capital to help the refugees.

237
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,240
In other words,

238
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,920
there are more than 80,000 dan of grain circulation in the capital.

239
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Not only that,

240
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
but also private soup kitchen.

241
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,400
daily porridge.

242
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,400
in total,

243
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,280
more than 100,000 dan.

244
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,520
But the people are still hungry.

245
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,840
100,000 dan of grains

246
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,960
can't feed refugees for a month.

247
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,400
It doesn't make sense anywhere.

248
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,280
There's a problem with the distribution of food.

249
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,080
Someone opened up

250
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,800
to steal the people’s food.

251
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,640
In order to collect the money,

252
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,840
and mixed sand into it.

253
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
So the porridge in the soup kitchen

254
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,800
There's sand.

255
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,440
All relief grains in the capital

256
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,040
were scattered in Fengdeku.

257
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
And Duke of Security pointed at Fengdeku.

258
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,400
I think he knows what's going on.

259
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,840
We should go to the Bondeku.

260
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,280
This is...

261
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,040
Princess Rong Hua sent a volunteer donation.

262
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,120
Since it's a reward from the palace,

263
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,200
we can't punish it casually.

264
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,160
Or did you ask His Majesty for permission?

265
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,080
and get permission.

266
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,200
We can only put it in storage after checking.

267
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,800
Excuse me.

268
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,320
see you off.

269
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,760
I have work to do.

270
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,320
Let's go.

271
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,840
Mr. Gongsun.

272
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,360
This belongs to my friend.

273
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,120
Just think of it as a ransom.

274
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,440
A lot.

275
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,480
Consider it a charity donation from Prince Rui's Residence.

276
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,880
Head Tian Deng of Fengde Warehouse.

277
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,080
Greetings, Tian Dian.

278
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,080
You're welcome.

279
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,680
Thank you.

280
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,800
Mr. Tian

281
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,080
was also a warehouse

282
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,160
How do you know the difference?

283
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,400
Shoulders lower right and left high

284
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,200
It's caused by the weight on your right shoulder

285
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,920
Mr. Tian is more obvious

286
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,800
He's always capable

287
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
From the warehouse,

288
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
The world is different.

289
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
The world is tough.

290
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,600
It's not easy to have a job.

291
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,040
I can still get the attention

292
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,240
It's a blessing

293
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,920
to promote a manager.

294
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,040
I can only remind myself

295
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,480
to work harder.

296
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,120
This is...

297
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,640
Not everyone in Bondeku knows how to read.

298
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,840
They only know the names of the vault.

299
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,800
The disaster relief is urgent.

300
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,520
I couldn't wait to do the accounts.

301
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,960
So I came up with this idea.

302
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,360
If there is any grain,

303
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,120
we'll keep the signature as a note.

304
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
100 dans as a square.

305
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,240
On the contrary,

306
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
to transport 100 dans,

307
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,520
will be cut off.

308
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,520
Good idea

309
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Mr. Tian is capable.

310
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,960
I heard that Duke of Security

311
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,360
is suing us

312
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,840
to sue us

313
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,600
for losing food.

314
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
I've checked

315
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,680
I've checked

316
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
in and out.

317
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,240
Nothing is wrong.

318
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,560
Please take a look.

319
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,240
and clear our name.

320
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,840
There's something wrong with the Bondeku.

321
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,040
There's something wrong with Bong Deku.

322
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,320
Didn't you say

323
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,240
this account is right?

324
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,440
The accounts are right.

325
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,440
It proves that they are familiar with this.

326
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,960
We couldn't find anything.

327
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,320
But the chef has to check the attendance record.

328
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,440
That's why they didn't expect it.

329
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Those who stole grain know they will check the accounts sooner or later,

330
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,560
they will make it even.

331
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,920
But other details will be ignored.

332
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
But someone was careless

333
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,240
and didn't go to work.

334
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Let the rat who stole grain

335
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,480
to transport food.

336
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,680
The records were seamless.

337
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,680
Everyone's name is written clearly.

338
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,120
No one is absent.

339
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,840
What's the problem?

340
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,360
The storekeeper said the storekeepers were illiterate

341
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,360
Even grain carving counts

342
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,200
But why does it have to be at dawn?

343
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,040
at dawn?

344
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,880
You mean

345
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,880
the whole attendance record is fake?

346
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
Not all the storekeepers

347
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
to steal grain.

348
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,640
How do we investigate this?

349
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,600
The thief changed the attendance record

350
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,600
to hide the wood in the forest

351
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,040
to make everyone a suspect.

352
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,120
But at least we know one thing.

353
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,120
The food thief

354
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,640
is in the warehouse of Fengdeku.

355
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,080
That's right.

356
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,840
So we just need to keep an eye on Bong Deku.

357
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,880
and see how the grains get out.

358
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,600
But Bong Deku is heavily guarded.

359
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,960
What do we think?

360
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,040
I have no choice.

361
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,960
But you have.

362
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,200
I...

363
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,120
You need to beg someone.

364
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,680
Who is it?

365
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,320
I said

366
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,080
these are mixed with grain.

367
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,360
Don't you believe me?

368
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,400
I dare not.

369
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
But...

370
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,920
What?

371
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,080
Prince Rui's Residence won't lie to you.

372
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,960
It's good that I didn't get even with you.

373
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,880
We don't need these grains.

374
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,760
It looks diaphragmatic.

375
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,240
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

376
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,280
Go.

377
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,599
Change grain for the royal mansion.

378
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Check carefully.

379
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,079
You have to do it well.

380
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,720
Yes.

381
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
No need.

382
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,520
We're short of food.

383
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,079
Take these as relief for the victims.

384
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,400
Yes.

385
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,400
Move.

386
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,400
Yes.

387
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,040
Slowly.

388
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,800
Are you done?

389
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,840
Thank you, guys.

390
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,400
Let's go.

391
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,160
I'll buy you a drink.

392
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,760
Okay.

393
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,040
Let's go home.

394
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,320
Let's go.

395
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,080
Let's go.

396
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,520
Are you sure

397
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,520
they will come to transport food at night?

398
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm not sure.

399
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,480
If they don't come,

400
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,080
we'll starve to death here.

401
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,920
Not bad.

402
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,520
You're well prepared.

403
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,920
Just eat

404
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,720
Is it a bit choking?

405
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,320
Catch.

406
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,960
Not bad.

407
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680
You're so thoughtful.

408
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,560
Do you want wine?

409
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,040
No way.

410
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,040
Are you going to live here?

411
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,520
Chef

412
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,480
It's so boring

413
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,600
What are you waiting for?

414
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,160
Not even a poem?

415
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,520
Come on.

416
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,400
Ten pots of Qibao raise thousands of households.

417
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,080
but he taught him to fight.

418
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,720
Green Pearl House.

419
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,480
Are you mocking me?

420
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,920
Hush.

421
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,600
Did they catch up?

422
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,160
No.

423
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,160
Hurry up.

424
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,120
It'll be hard

425
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,880
it'll be hard.

426
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,640
Yes.

427
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,520
Hurry.

428
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,360
Hurry up. Be careful.

429
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm not familiar with it

430
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,320
I don't think he's a storekeeper.

431
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,280
Yes

432
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,800
This way and you're still spraying.

433
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,560
Don't push me.

434
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
Hurry up. Hurry up.

435
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,160
What's that sound?

436
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
What's going on?

437
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,880
I heard something just now.

438
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,800
Did you hear that?

439
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,680
I heard it too.

440
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,040
Hya!

441
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,240
Hya!

442
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,240
Hya!

443
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,320
Hya!

444
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,600
Something's wrong. What's wrong?

445
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,640
I thought they'd be safe

446
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,800
I thought they'd be quiet for a while.

447
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,240
and ambush at Bondeku.

448
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,040
to try my luck.

449
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,800
But on the night they were exposed,

450
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,320
why did they commit the crime?

451
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,320
I checked the rooms.

452
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
No one is on duty.

453
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,120
and stole it.

454
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,680
It should be cooked.

455
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,640
How about

456
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
find Peng Xiaoyu?

457
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,600
and ask the government to help.

458
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,320
The capital is huge.

459
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,280
If we don't seize this opportunity,

460
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,720
and find the rat hole,

461
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,160
If they stop,

462
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,280
I'm afraid the government

463
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,800
it'll be hard to find another chance.

464
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,040
Even if I think it's wrong,

465
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,400
I have no choice.

466
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,560
Chef

467
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,520
Why is no one here

468
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,280
Where are they?

469
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,600
What's that smell?

470
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,040
Oh no.

471
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,840
It's smoke.

472
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,080
Maze.

473
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Gong Sun Li.

474
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,800
Chef.

475
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,400
Chef.

476
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,600
I finally caught you.

477
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,800
The master said you'll follow closely

478
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,600
you'll follow him.

479
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
They really followed us.

480
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,760
Throw it into the clam room

481
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,640
Chef

482
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,480
Chef

483
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,280
Where are you

484
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,840
Chef, say something.

485
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,680
Chef

486
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,440
Chef

487
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,440
Chef

488
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,480
Is the chef you?

489
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,960
You're useless.

490
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,120
Forget it.

491
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,600
He's always like this.

492
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,520
Why is there no door in this room?

493
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,640
Could it be...

494
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,480
we're underground?

495
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,800
Lord Shen, Lord Gongsun.

496
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,560
Our master said

497
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,280
your dignity

498
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,680
in this clam room.

499
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,520
I'm starving.

500
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,080
What a pity.

501
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,720
Try this ribbon.

502
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,880
What ribbon?

503
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,200
Snake powder.

504
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,120
Chef, come on. Come on.

505
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,200
I had a dream just now.

506
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,800
I dreamed of a skull.

507
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,880
It's so scary.

508
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Snake.

509
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,040
Zhan Mao'er.

510
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,400
Master.

511
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,440
Have you found it?

512
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,440
Did you go to Feng Le Restaurant?

513
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,760
I asked him myself.

514
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,720
He said Lord Shen was not here.

515
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,560
The people in the kitchen didn't come back last night.

516
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,880
They must have gone somewhere and caused trouble.

517
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,840
Everyone else is taking care of their children for their old age.

518
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,360
Why is it my turn

519
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,040
become a retirement guard?

520
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,680
It's not as good as our feet.

521
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,600
The young master is older than us.

522
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
he has his own idea.

523
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,240
Don't worry too much.

524
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,960
The young master has been close to Lord Shen recently.

525
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,480
Although he made some noise,

526
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,440
But

527
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
your reputation has improved a lot.

528
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,400
A matchmaker has come to visit us recently.

529
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,040
Matchmakers?

530
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,120
Please treat him well.

531
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,640
With his reputation,

532
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,080
we don't expect him to be a good match for us.

533
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,920
There's only one thing.

534
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,400
The other party wants the innocence.

535
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,520
If this woman is powerful,

536
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,120
she must be able to control him.

537
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,840
You can't be weak.

538
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
Don't be fooled

539
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,200
by his mouth.

540
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,360
Only in this way

541
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,440
can I be at ease.

542
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,600
You're right.

543
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,600
Right, Chiyu?

544
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,520
Princess.

545
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,640
Bad news!

546
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,440
Princess.

547
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,680
It's all your fault.

548
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
I was going to roast it.

549
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,880
My princess.

550
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,240
There's nothing in this mansion.

551
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,040
Why do you have to eat that?

552
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,920
Why are you in such a hurry?

553
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,760
What's wrong?

554
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,160
Oh, right.

555
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,160
Gongsun Li.

556
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,400
Gongsun is gone.

557
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
The servant of the Gongsun family

558
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,640
I'm asking around.

559
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,240
He said

560
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,080
with Chef Shen.

561
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,240
It's really gone.

562
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,200
Great.

563
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,520
The chef said

564
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,440
if we don't come back by noon tomorrow,

565
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,280
please go to Fengdeku

566
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,160
to make a scene.

567
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,840
How?

568
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,760
In the name of the royal mansion,

569
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,080
in the name of the royal mansion.

570
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,720
Scared the rat out.

571
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:04,800
Make a scene.

572
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,400
Don't let a rat out.

573
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,040
If we can't find him today,

574
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,480
we won't go back.

575
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,320
Yes.

576
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Your Highness.

577
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,320
It's been half a day.

578
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,520
You saw it too.

579
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,080
The person you're looking for isn't in our Bong Deku.

580
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,440
None.

581
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,080
We've checked the warehouse.

582
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,760
He's not here.

583
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,280
But there are no signs of fighting.

584
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,440
He probably left.

585
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,280
It's almost done.

586
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,280
Keep a few people here

587
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,040
Mr. Tian.

588
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,880
You can ask around.

589
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,480
about Prince Rui's mansion.

590
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,240
My father lost a walnut last month.

591
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,800
The housekeeper is still searching the backyard.

592
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,560
You must find

593
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
even if you have to search the whole capital.

594
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,800
If you see my people,

595
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,160
Call me. Okay.

596
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,440
Yes.

597
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,440

598
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:06,920
Let's go.

599
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,520
Take care, Princess.

600
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,280
Let's go.

601
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,840
Don't move.

602
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,240
Stand up slowly

603
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,440
Chef

604
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Look who he is.

605
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,240
You thief!

606
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,160
Stop!

607
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,480
Stop!

608
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,240
Stop!

609
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,040
Over there.

610
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,400
I'll go after him.

611
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,280
This...

612
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,120
Rice.

613
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,480
Rice

614
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,560
It's rice

615
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,520
Chef.

616
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,640
We finally found it.

617
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,680
Chef.

618
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
They're all here

619
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,840
How can I live?

620
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,320
Give us some food.

621
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,440
Save us.

622
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,360
Save my baby.

623
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,400
Baby.

624
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,200
Is it good?

625
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,800
I can have a good sleep after eating.

626
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,280
It's delicious.

627
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,440
Mother.

628
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,280
It hurts.

629
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,120
We've gone so far.

630
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,160
but still failed.

631
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,840
There are so many caves inside.

632
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,960
It's full of food.

633
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,400
We can't catch up.

634
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,080
Why are you so clumsy?

635
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,080
If Qin was here...

636
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
What are you talking about?

637
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,920
The food here is so moldy.

638
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,440
but the people outside died of hunger.

639
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,400
Duke of Security.

640
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,640
I saw it.

641
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,800
Now,

642
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,600
the people in the capital

643
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,200
can be saved.

644
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,040
Today, I know

645
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,360
what the way of college is.

646
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,400
In this field,

647
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,520
the security guard may go further than us.

648
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,480
Chef.

649
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,160
Are you still catching him?

650
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,960
I'm not arresting him.

651
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,040
I want to see him.

680
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,120
He said he studied with his master for a few years.

681
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,640
Later, he became homeless.

682
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,880

I worked in the pawnshop for half a year.

684
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,880
