1
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,800
Morning, Shen.

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,800
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,760
I came today

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,120
to ask you something.

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,600
Stop washing.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,760
Talk to me.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,720
Don't touch me.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,600
About that parasite,

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,840
I checked it when I went back.

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,760
But I didn't find any useful information.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,240
Qin'er's master also knows

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,520
the origin of your eyes.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,320
Why don't you pretend to be his enemy?

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,120
Do you believe that there are free things in the world?

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,800
they would send it here.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
There must be a big hole waiting ahead.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,680
That's right.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,360
I don't ask for a blessing.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,640
I don't want to get anything for no reason.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,560
Let's talk about your eyes.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,120
seems to be a vote.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,760
In fact, every time I use it,

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,920
you'll lose half of your life.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,920
It works well.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,039
No.

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,320
You came to me early in the morning to show me your affection.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,039
Tell me.

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,039
What is it?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Of course.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,600
I found a good place

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,240
to reward our chef.

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,520
Let's go.

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,720
Mr. Gongsun.

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,440
What are you up to now?

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,560
Don't spoil the cook.

36
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,479
How capable am I?

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,800
to lead him astray?

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,640
Let's go.

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,039
Where are we going?

40
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,320
That place is full of rough people.

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,240
Girls will never like it.

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,960
Why did you bring me here so early in the morning?

43
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,840
Just say it.

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,560
The kitchen is waiting for me.

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,080
Who are you lying to?

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,080
Who doesn't know there's a chef commissioner in Feng Le Pavilion?

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,520
The shopkeeper gave you a job earlier.

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,440
Let me tell you.

49
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
The Oiran I met today

50
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,160
is the most elegant woman.

51
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,880
Wonderful man.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,400
When chefs enter the court,

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,840
you need to know some elegant things.

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,199
Since you're here,

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,280
Let's go.

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,840
Lu'er.

57
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Send your lady in.

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
I brought an important guest.

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Forget it. I'll tell her myself.

60
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,480
You came at the wrong time.

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,840
The box of silk from Mr. Sui

62
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,960
I was careless and encountered a bug.

63
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,800
You said the dress and the hairpin

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,120
to see you.

65
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,920
It's just a ribbon.

66
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,960
Take it.

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,320
Buy some for now.

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll get someone to deliver a box next month.

69
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,760
Thank you.

70
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Greetings, Young Master.

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,800
Chef.

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,840
This is the lotus flower I told you about.

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,840
Miss Lotus.

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,880
This is the famous chef, Imperial Envoy.

75
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Shen Shaoshan.

76
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,520
Greetings, Lord Shen.

77
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,000
Chef.

78
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,440
The lotus girl

79
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,000
played a great pipa.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
It's good if anyone has heard it.

81
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,240
I'm lucky.

82
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,960
It rains all night.

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,880
The pipa is broken too.

84
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,920
If I knew you would bring a distinguished guest here,

85
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,200
I would have pawned this hairpin

86
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,160
I'll buy the jade pendant from Yang Liu Fang.

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,840
Pawn what?

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,440
Just now,

89
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,440
I heard a pipa just now.

90
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,200
Why did it suddenly break down?

91
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,640
The wind and clouds are coming

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
It's going to be bad.

93
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,160
I have no choice.

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,920
It's easy to repair.

95
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,120
Do you need my help?

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,560
Fix what?

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,360
Let's buy a new one.

98
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,040
Sir.

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,560
Lord Shen is so interesting.

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,040
You're indeed a wonderful person.

101
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,720
You didn't prepare any gifts when you came out.

102
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,000
How about I give you a painting?

103
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
Amazing.

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,760
Your calligraphy

105
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,360
What do you know?

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,400
Hurry up

107
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,920
Thank you, Officer Shen.

108
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,280
Gongsun's money bag has been dissatisfied.

109
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,640
So the hole is with you.

110
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,360
What?

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,839
You tricked me.

112
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,440
Others can't.

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
calligraphy and painting

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,160
is about

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,640
It's not easy to shape.

116
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,080
Why am I serving you today?

117
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,280
Where are Hongyun and Ziyan?

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,200
They ran away.

119
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,320
Run away?

120
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,120
Whose clothes are floating over?

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,640
What's going on?

122
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
Why is he a person?

123
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,400
I see people like you every day.

124
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,640
Who doesn't have a dream?

125
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,600
They both want to find a good future for themselves.

126
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,800
Did you report it to the government?

127
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
A slave woman is having an affair with someone.

128
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,080
This is nothing new.

129
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,400
Here.

130
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,360
If you and I come often,

131
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,240
it wouldn't be so rare.

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,280
That's weird.

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
This dish is a bit bitter.

134
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,080
You're really amazing

135
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,600
It's a little burnt

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,560
I think the chef is not familiar with the stove

137
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
Exactly

138
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,240
Chef Sun took a leave before.

139
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,920
He said he ran into a demon last night

140
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,520
and saw the mandrill eating people

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
I'm afraid he's scared

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,920
The mandrill

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,800
My lord

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
You scholars know a lot

145
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,560
Is there really a mandrill in this world

146
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,040
You've asked the right person

147
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,720
In Classic of Mountains and Seas

148
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
The mandrill

149
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,320
Style

150
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,520
Turn around.

151
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,600
What do you mean?

152
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,480
That's the joint

153
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
On the opposite

154
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,520
There's no mandrill

155
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,600
People always use experiences

156
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,920
by experiences.

157
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,720
When the ancients saw something unusual,

158
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,880
as monsters.

159
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
That's what supernatural gods do

160
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,520
The mandrill eats people

161
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,600
Someone must have done evil

162
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,520
You scared me.

163
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,960
You can stay here to calm me down.

164
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,040
No problem.

165
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
You lost your maid

166
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
There's a mandrill outside

167
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,920
But you are not worried at all

168
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,400
Ignore him.

169
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,600
He's too sensitive.

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,720
Chef.

171
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,800
Bad news

172
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,520
Excuse me.

173
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,480
Your Excellency,

174
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,680
It's not that I don't want to blend in with you.

175
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,960
It's mainly because no one called.

176
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,080
because a female corpse was found by the river.

177
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,280
Do you want to take a look?

178
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,080
Make way for the Imperial Envoy.

179
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,720
Make way for the Imperial Envoy.

180
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,159
Come on

181
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,360
There's a mandrill in the city

182
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,480
Take a look

183
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,840
Is that monster harming people?

184
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,520
Folks,

185
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,040
let's not watch.

186
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
Let's go home and advise your ladies.

187
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,320
Don't go out

188
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,960
don't go out if you can.

189
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,200
Thank you.

190
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,160
Normal vegetarian.

191
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,400
So scary.

192
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,000
My eyes are gone.

193
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,159
Ziyan.

194
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,640
Are you sure?

195
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,159
It's the purple smoke beside Lotus.

196
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,560
It can't be wrong.

197
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,040
Wait.

198
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,680
Yeon-hwa.

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,080
Stop looking.

200
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,440
Cover it for me.

201
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,280
My lord.

202
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,320
Since we've found Zi Yan,

203
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,640
let me take her back to bury her.

204
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,039
to avoid being humiliated.

205
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,080
Before she died, she was abused by an inhumane person.

206
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,159
you were not surprised.

207
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,280
There are many men in the world.

208
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,280
What kind of vulgar fetish is she?

209
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,680
It's her fault.

210
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,360
she met a bad guy.

211
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,040
Don't you want to know

212
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,720
who killed her?

213
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,520
The dead is dead.

214
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,960
The body is in the coroner's room.

215
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,840
he'll be stripped off.

216
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,760
Ziyan is gone.

217
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,280
I have to tear her face off.

218
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,320
to step on her?

219
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,320
I have the indenture.

220
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,520
I am the victim.

221
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,640
I want to take Zi Yan away.

222
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,600
You can't stop me.

223
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,840
What a coincidence.

224
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
But today,

225
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,040
you can't take me away.

226
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,120
Li.

227
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,120
Send Zi Yan's body back to the coroner.

228
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,640
I want to check it carefully.

229
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,360
Yes.

230
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,360
Wait.

231
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,440
If you are not convinced,

232
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
you can report it to the government.

233
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,040
Please go back to the tile.

234
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,080
If you have any questions,

235
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,320
I will find out

236
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,840
and investigate it.

237
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,160
you misunderstood Lotus.

238
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,960
There's nothing between her and Ziyan.

239
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,400
I think you're the one who lost your mind.

240
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,920
She's not a simple person.

241
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,640
How long have you known her?

242
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,840
When I knew her,

243
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,240
her name was Lotus.

244
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,600
She is extremely strong.

245
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,240
but his little finger is above.

246
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,920
My index finger

247
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,120
I made a mistake with a normal person

248
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
The mandrill goes in the opposite direction

249
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,480
Is there really a mandrill in the world

250
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,240
Turn her over

251
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,240
Chef.

252
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,640
What's wrong?

253
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,040
Have you seen this string pattern?

254
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,280
It's quite common

255
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,640
is quite common.

256
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,040
According to the records of the previous dynasty,

257
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,920
there were many murders.

258
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,120
Every time they kill,

259
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,240
every time he killed someone.

260
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,120
as a souvenir.

261
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
You mean

262
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,680
this monster has been killing people?

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,040
I told you.

264
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,480
no monster in the world

265
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,640
The evil

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is always human.

267
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,240
Now Hongyun is missing.

268
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,600
We have to send someone to guard the tile.

269
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,560
Watch out for the lotus.

270
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,120
You really suspect Lotus?

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,320
Why can't you let her go?

272
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
Ask Li to go to Chef Sun's house

273
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,160
Ask him when he saw the mandrill

274
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,280
When and where

275
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:31,840
Also,

276
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,520
the embroidery workmanship of the body.

277
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,800
Let Qin find out where it came from.

278
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,320
The water is fast but not filling.

279
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,240
It can travel 50 miles a day.

280
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,840
The body is found at dawn.

281
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,360
From the extent of the body, it can be pushed

282
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,080
into the water.

283
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,280
About four hours.

284
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,280
The dumping site should be

285
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,960
Let's go. Let's go.

286
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,080
Let's go.

287
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,400
Is this the crime scene?

288
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
We can't find anything except the junk.

289
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,560
Shirayans.

290
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,600
is the same as the victim's plain clothes.

291
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,880
All women have plain clothes.

292
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,400
It's just someone

293
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,040
accidentally hung it up.

294
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
What's the big deal?

295
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
This gauze is for women.

296
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,080
How tall is she?

297
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,320
The dress can be hung on the tree.

298
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,080
Have you seen this embroidery cloth?

299
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,040
The embroidery of this flower

300
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Ten days ago,

301
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,440
to Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce.

302
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,840
only to Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce.

303
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,680
It can't be wrong.

304
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,200
This place is half a mile away from Bianhe.

305
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,880
So it can be launched

306
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,320
The so-called mandrill

307
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,000
is a tall man

308
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,040
and strong.

309
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,360
He knows some kung fu.

310
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,800
After the murderer killed someone,

311
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,440
he won't throw the body too far away.

312
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,560
So,

313
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,680
the murder place is nearby.

314
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,920
Right?

315
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,800
Blood.

316
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,160
I'll go find Li.

317
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
and ask him to bring a dog.

318
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,920
You can do it too.

319
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,480
If your nose doesn't work well,

320
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,640
you can't be a good cook.

321
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,880
Good dog.

322
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,720
Bloody smell.

323
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,840
There's nothing.

324
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,680
Witness.

325
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,440
Evidence.

326
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,360
is here.

327
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,440
What are you trying to say?

328
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,920
It's not human blood.

329
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,280
Goose.

330
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,960
Stewed goose in an iron pot.

331
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Is it illegal?

332
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,760
I got the wrong person.

334
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,080
We need to check the owner of this courtyard.

335
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,640
What's wrong?

336
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
I can't even eat

337
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,000
I can't take it anymore.

338
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,840
This place is remote.

339
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,160
The guards will not come.

340
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,120
It's perfect for killing.

341
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,200
Goose blood.

342
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,640
Maybe it's to cover up the smell of human blood.

343
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,880
You think too much.

344
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,360
The chef is overthinking.

345
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,040
It's not the first time you know it.

346
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,880
Leave it to me.

347
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,920
I'll look into it.

348
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
Didn't you check the satin?

349
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,800
I found it.

350
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,520
Guess where the silk was sold?

351
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,280
Where?

352
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,720
It's just a wall.

353
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,520
What a coincidence.

354
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,200
Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce.

355
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,680
Chairman Luo.

356
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,640
We're here for a case.

357
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,440
Look.

358
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,760
Do you recognize this?

359
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
This satin

360
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,920
was bought by the Chamber of Commerce

361
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,680
a few days ago.

362
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,280
What is it for?

363
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,360
The fabric

364
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,240
for the Oiran.

365
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,840
A few days ago,

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,400
have been sent over.

367
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,880
It's for Yeon-hwa.

368
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,480
You two

369
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,120
you may not know.

370
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,160
The Chamber of Commerce cooperated with the government

371
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,920
took over all the places

372
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,600
and built a rouge alley.

373
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,720
and helped the women who were abducted

374
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,560
in the mud.

375
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,240
Now that I think about it,

376
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,280
for more than ten years.

377
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,640
As usual,

378
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,000
the daily needs of the Oiran.

379
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,720
I just hope other women can understand

380
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,640
even in Rouge Alley,

381
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,800
in Rouge Alley.

382
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,480
Don't give up.

383
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,400
Young Master Luo

384
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,880
is a great merit.

385
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,200
This

386
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,080
It's really for Yeon-hwa.

387
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,440
I can't be wrong.

388
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,280
I've never opened this box of silk.

389
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,000
Why is there one piece missing?

390
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,920
That one

391
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,200
turned into Zi Yan's corpse wrapping cloth.

392
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
And this satin

393
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,760
is specially for you.

394
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,000
The three of you are women.

395
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,240
You must have

396
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,800
in this brothel.

397
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,080
Do you think I killed them because of jealousy?

398
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,960
Although they are not as beautiful as you,

399
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,960
How old are they?

400
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,960
Chef.

401
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,800
What do you mean?

402
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,280
I've known Lotus for years.

403
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,400
I know

404
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,600
what kind of person she is.

405
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,800
I asked her why you were so anxious.

406
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,160
Lotus.

407
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,720
I heard that you never allow them to receive outsiders.

408
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,880
Why?

409
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,440
Gongsun Li.

410
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,000
Where do you think this is?

411
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,840
You can come to see me even if it's dirty or stinky?

412
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,680
Let's go.

413
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,440
The brocade was placed by the Chamber of Commerce.

414
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,000
No one else has handled it.

415
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,280
Why bother hurting her?

416
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,079
I'm not as anxious as you.

417
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,720
Don't worry.

418
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,280
I don't want to know

419
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:16,960
Except the case,

420
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,880
except the case.

421
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,480
What did you say?

422
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,560
I didn't hit him.

423
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Is it your turn?

424
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
You?

425
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
Where did you get

426
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,160
Where did you get it?

427
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,280
From the Ministry of Revenue.

428
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,120
Tobe?

429
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,400
Is it illegal to steal files?

430
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,240
Don't worry.

431
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,080
No one saw it.

432
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,040
Why?

433
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I'm not human.

434
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,640
Tobe!

435
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,720
Tobe

436
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,680
It's the Ministry of Revenue again.

437
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,520
Do you really think the Ministry of Revenue is your backyard?

438
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,800
Fine.

439
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,720
I'll kill you.

440
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,280
Then no one will know

441
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
Lotus.

442
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,880
See for yourself.

443
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,920
Do you still think she's innocent?

444
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,400
Chef Shen.

445
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,000
You...

446
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,280
If you disturb the cook again,

447
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,560
I'll burn down the accountant of the Ministry of Revenue.

448
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,160
Even if your father had lost his beard,

449
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,760
he won't be able to make up for the accounts.

450
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,160
Bad woman.

451
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,640
Evil.

452
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,600
I found a suspicious yard

453
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,200
outside Donghua Gate.

454
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,720
It is very likely to be the place where Zi Yan is suffering.

455
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,600
So I asked someone to investigate it.

456
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,800
Guess what I found.

457
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,520
The yard has changed its owner for seven years.

458
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,640
Seven years ago, it was originally below.

459
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,160
and raised a girl in the inner circle.

460
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,120
and entertain people.

461
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,160
As long as we have enough money,

462
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,880
if we have enough money and money.

463
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,520
One of them

464
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,080
named Lotus.

465
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,480
Let me guess.

466
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,560
Lotus comes from a humble family.

467
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,960
and became a spy.

468
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,760
and was bullied in that courtyard every day.

469
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,280
Soon,

470
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,160
the Chamber of Commerce started to control the tiles.

471
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,040
to forge a letter for the prostitute.

472
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,120
This is a way

473
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,440
a way to survive.

474
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,720
So she became Lotus

475
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,960
She became

476
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
she became the Oiran.

477
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,480
But she was tortured day and night.

478
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,280
hurt her body,

479
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,880
but also her mind.

480
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,440
She looked at her maid.

481
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,480
Hongyun, Ziyan.

482
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,640
and naive.

483
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,400
I'll think of my past.

484
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,200
I was jealous.

485
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,840
You're so thoughtful.

486
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
why don't you write a dialogue novel?

487
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
She hates fate,

488
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,240
but she couldn't turn back.

489
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,720
Only by rolling away

490
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,560
on others.

491
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,240
It's only fair

492
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,600
to feel at ease.

493
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,920
So she bought the yard

494
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,880
to buy the yard

495
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,600
and killed his maid in the yard.

496
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,640
and dumped her body in Bianhe.

497
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,960
and frightened Chef Sun of Wafang.

498
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,200
So he mistook the mandrill

499
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
and spread the legend of the mandrill

500
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,480
But she never thought

501
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,760
she never thought that

502
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,920
I wouldn't rest in peace.

503
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,080
floating on the river

504
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,800
to seek justice for myself.

505
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
The satin is from your place.

506
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,160
The courtyard is also related to you.

507
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,240
When it comes to purple smoke's body,

508
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,960
Lotus.

509
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,920
Why don't you confess that the embroidery was stolen? The embroidery was stolen by someone.

510
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,800
Someone stole the satin.

511
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,960
The courtyard was just where I used to live.

512
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,720
I don't cry for you.

513
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,480
because seven years ago,

514
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,440
my tears have dried down there.

515
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,320
Just because I'm a prostitute,

516
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,000
you have to speculate

517
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,160
and step on it?

518
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
What a coincidence.

519
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,800
But I'm not Gongsun Li.

520
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,320
Yu Xuan Ji of the previous dynasty

521
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,480
[once killed someone out of jealousy.]

522
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Miss Lotus.

523
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,760
She is a beauty.

524
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,440
But being a thief

525
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,160
It's not your fault to be a thief

526
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,040
You're degrading yourself

527
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,760
But it's really hateful.

528
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,880
Where is the chef?

529
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,600
Why is it taking so long to investigate Chef Sun?

530
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,720
Don't mention it.

531
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
Chef Sun is crazy.

532
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,080
He refused to acknowledge his family.

533
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,960
He even beat me.

534
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,800
I didn't get anything.

535
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,360
This is great.

536
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,360
The clue is gone.

537
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,520
Chef Shen will catch the lotus again.

538
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,000
What's the matter with the lotus?

539
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,960
The chef is interrogating.

540
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,360
They are inside.

541
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,080
You two...

542
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,000
outside.

543
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,640
What kind of relationship is this?

544
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,720
Chef.

545
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,120
Another dead body.

546
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,320
Yeon-hwa.

547
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,480
My eyes were dug out again.

548
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,080
Li

549
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,400
Get him!

550
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't go, thief!

551
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,760
Qin.

552
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,640
You guard the lotus flower.

553
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,400
Gongsun Li.

554
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,280
Call the coroner.

555
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,920
My lord.

556
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,760
The victim was tortured to death.

557
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,680
More than 100 whipping wounds.

558
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,280
Her eyes were dug.

559
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,560
At the nape,

560
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,440
the same string pattern

561
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,720
as the previous body.

562
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,320
The same string pattern.

563
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:04,920
Yes.

564
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,200
I told you.

565
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,840
When the body was found,

566
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,240
you were with Yeon-hwa.

567
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,960
the murderer is not Lotus.

568
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,120
Thank you, sir.

569
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,080
I'll take my leave.

570
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,800
As soon as Hongyun's body was found,

571
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,240
she was cleared of the suspicion of Lotus.

572
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
What a coincidence.

573
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,080
Could it be...

574
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
she has an accomplice?

575
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,040
Why can't you let go of Lotus?

576
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,200
You're the one who can't let go of the lotus.

577
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,040
You don't know

578
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,560
about many things.

579
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,040
How would I know if you don't tell me?

580
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,040
Tell me.

581
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,520
Don't force me.

582
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,160
I force you?

583
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,760
The murderer is forcing us.

584
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,480
It's a matter of life and death.

585
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
If anyone dies by the murderer again,

586
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,360
it's all your fault

587
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,720
and didn't say anything.

588
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,600
Lotus

589
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,920
from the bitter sea.

590
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,160
Come here.

591
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,200
Go.

592
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,520
Come here.

593
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,440
Your mother took five taels of silver from grandpa

594
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,200
and sold you to grandpa.

595
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,640
Young Master.

596
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,680
Please give me one month.

597
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,360
I will pay you back.

598
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,200
Please.

599
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,040
Keep fighting.

600
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,760
Okay.

601
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,720
Let her run along the carriage.

602
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,880
It's just a thing.

603
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,880
Take him away.

604
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:57,960
Go.

605
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,720
Get up.

606
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,680
Please let me go.

607
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,080
Go!

608
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,880
Let go of me!

609
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,120
Mr. Zhou.

610
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,360
When I first met Lotus,

611
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,520
she was still the lowest woman.

612
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,520
How could she not show her mercy?

613
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,200
You hit me so hard.

614
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,400
If this continues,

615
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,360
she will die.

616
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,640
What?

617
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,840
You hit me in broad daylight.

618
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,080
A dog follows its owner.

619
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,480
Isn't this the young master of the Gongsun family?

620
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
I spent five taels to buy her here

621
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,280
to hear a scream.

622
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,720
Aren't you

623
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,040
with Prince Rui's princess

624
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,320
with Princess Rui?

625
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,840
I think

626
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,880
I think you should stay out of it.

627
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,720
Sir.

628
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,080
I beg you.

629
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,560
Please save me.

630
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,560
Please, Young Master.

631
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,800
Please save me.

632
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Okay.

633
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,880
I can save you.

634
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,400
From here to my Gongsun Mansion, there are four miles.

635
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,800
If you kowtow to the front of my house,

636
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,680
I'll give you a future.

637
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,840
What do you think?

638
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Mr. Zhou.

639
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
If she can do it,

640
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,680
go to my mansion and pay 500 taels.

641
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,240
500 taels?

642
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,680
This girl

643
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,160
this girl.

644
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,560
Thank you.

645
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,680
The path of bloodshed

646
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,880
Let everyone in the capital know

647
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,240
there is a strong beauty down there.

648
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,040
When the Oiran was selected,

649
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,160
the lotus won the first place.

650
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,640
And because of the four miles,

651
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,120
because of these four miles.

652
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,920
and broke off the engagement.

653
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,520
Gongsun Li.

654
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,840
You are really a rare bastard.

655
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,720
Luckily, Yeon-hwa is a smart person.

656
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,560
She knew it was a mutual help.

657
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,600
So I wanted to thank her for helping me.

658
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,720
Inside,

659
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,440
I often support her

660
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,160
so that she can be bothered.

661
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,880
When I was outside,

662
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,840
I'll admit that I'm her only guest.

663
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,800
so that she doesn't have to show others her body.

664
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,040
Why is she so strict

665
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,520
with Hongyu and Ziyan?

666
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
The lotus heart

667
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,600
has been grinded as hard as iron.

668
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,240
But she only treats them well.

669
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,360
If she becomes a good person,

670
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,440
no matter who her husband is,

671
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,880
when I see her scars,

672
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,800
How could I not remember her past?

673
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,920
I'm sure she won't kill Hongyun and Ziyan.

674
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,560
because she disciplined them

675
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,680
because she doesn't want them

676
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,800
like her.

677
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,840
Sister Lotus.

678
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,760
The steward said that I'm gone.

679
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,560
I'll serve her from now on.

680
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,960
But in this way,

681
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,280
we'll be in trouble.

682
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,360
Although that monster tried to kill Hongyun and Ziyan,

683
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
he came for the lotus.

684
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,040
All the clues point to Lotus.

685
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,120
She wanted to frame Lotus.

686
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,160
The murderer killed a pair of maids.

687
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
The satin was also set up.

688
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,480
The monster hiding in the dark

689
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,080
tortured the two daughters of purple red.

690
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,160
The humiliation that Lotus suffered in the past

691
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,480
will repeat on the two daughters.

692
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,520
His resentment towards Lotus

693
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
in his heart.

694
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,240
Therefore,

695
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,320
her next target

696
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,880
is Green.

697
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,960
It's you!

698
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,120
Stop! Stop!

699
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,720
Stop there!

700
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,000
It's really you.

701
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,200
Seven years ago,

702
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,640
I remember clearly

703
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,320
I clearly remember

704
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
the ranger I chased

705
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,000
was Zhan.

706
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,200
He ran into an alley.

707
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,280
I was still in the strong class.

708
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,200
I followed my men to wipe out the warriors.

709
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,040
Everyone in the capital is fighting and killing.

710
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,800
Let's go.

711
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,360
Those wanderers claim to be chivalrous.

712
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,760
rob the rich and help the poor.

713
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,640
They all work in the streets.

714
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,800
Do you want to die? Loyalty.

715
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,160
Watch out.

716
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,680
When I went after him, I asked about a sedan chair.

717
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,680
and asked about Zhan's whereabouts.

718
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,360
Now that I think about it,

719
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,840
the person on the sedan was Lotus.

720
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,520
She pointed the direction to me.

721
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,080
If that's the case,

722
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,960
it makes sense.

723
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,800
Zhan Mao was hiding in the dark

724
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,120
and saw the lotus guiding you.

725
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,360
So he hid in Kyoto

726
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
to take revenge.

727
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,240
No.

728
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,040
It doesn't make sense.

729
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,320
How reckless he was

730
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,600
for Dong Zhaodong.

731
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,400
Why would he plan for such a small grudge?

732
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,720
for seven years.

733
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,760
But Li saw Zhan Mao running, right?

734
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,480
Right, Li?

735
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,360
How could it be wrong?

736
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,920
In my opinion,

737
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,920
I don't want it to be him.

738
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,040
But seven years ago,

739
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,760
I saw the string pattern.

740
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,800
Do you know

741
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,200
why he wanted to eliminate the wanderers seven years ago?

742
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,040
How can I forget that?

743
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
A wanderer?

744
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,920
How dare you call yourself a wanderer?

745
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,360
Seven years ago,

746
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,520
they ganged up

747
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,720
to steal the vault of the Ministry of Revenue.

748
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,200
The vault was stolen.

749
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,880
over 9,000 taels were lost.

750
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,720
I thought the string pattern looked familiar.

751
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I just remembered it.

752
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,640
On the wall of the vault,

753
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,200
on the wall of the vault.

754
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,520
In the end,

755
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,440
and found out about these hooligans.

756
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,760
They roam on the streets all day.

757
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,160
They claimed to be chivalrous.

758
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,960
In the end, these people fell into Peng Xiaoyu's hands.

759
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,560
At that time,

760
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,320
There was a secret report.

761
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,280
A secret report.

762
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,720
saying that the string pattern has something to do with Swordsman.

763
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,560
Lord Peng ordered us to capture

764
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,840
The ranger we caught

765
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,160
Chop the head

766
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,440
The flow

767
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,800
Since then, no warrior in the capital

768
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,440
Peng Xiaoyu became the magistrate.

769
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I was promoted as a constable at that time.

770
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,560
But

771
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,400
the money was gone.

772
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,040
In that case,

773
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,360
this string

774
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,720
is most likely the mark they left after the crime.

775
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,760
Then Cat Zhan was Zhan at that time.

776
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,280
There's one more thing we need to check.

777
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
What are you doing?

778
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,400
Cover me to silence me.

779
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,560
Hongyun used incense before she died.

780
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,160
Tea fragrance.

781
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,040
It looks like a wooden one.

782
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,880
It's rare.

783
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,120
That's not right.

784
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,000
Before she died,

785
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,360
before she died.

786
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,240
So this incense

787
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,840
must be used by the murderer.

788
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,680
Since you think it's rare,

789
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,440
it's not hard to investigate.

790
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,480
Li,

791
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,680
I have two things to tell you.

792
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,680
Go to the Beggar Alley tomorrow

793
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,920
if Cat Zhan entered the beggar alley seven years ago.

794
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,440
Take this corner

795
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,960
to the incense store.

796
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,720
This is He Xiang.

797
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,360
Okay.

798
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,400
Who bought it?

799
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,280
There's something more important

800
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,400
It has to be you.

801
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,880
Tell me.

802
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,040
The murderer tried to kill the people around Yeon-hwa.

803
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,680
The next one who is in danger

804
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,840
might be you.

805
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:31,960
So you have to...

806
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,760
I understand.

807
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,160
So I won't go out

808
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,160
so they can't find me.

809
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,880
No.

810
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,200
You have to

811
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,000
you have to play with Li.

812
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,240
You must be arrogant enough.

813
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,680
Let the murderer know you're investigating him.

814
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,160
it's best to make him itchy.

815
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,320
He can't wait to come out.

816
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,320
I'll kill you.

817
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,040
You need to know where the cold arrow is released.

818
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,640
We need to set a target.

819
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,000
This is the smell.

820
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,840
This fragrance is called Sea Qiong Cigarette.

821
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,840
Every summer comes with the sea.

822
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,560
Only I, Wen Xiang Pavilion in Kaifeng has this way.

823
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,320
Unfortunately, even guests can't afford it.

824
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,040
What do you mean?

825
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,520
Who are you looking down on?

826
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,639
What do you mean?

827
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,920
Who are you looking down on?

828
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,159
Sir.

829
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:33,719
Sir.

830
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
We are businessmen.

831
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,760
How can we drive them away?

832
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,719
HaiQiong Cigarette was burned

833
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,120
after she won the championship.

834
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,920
No matter how precious the smoke is,

835
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,840
Zhonger has it every year, right?

836
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,000
Famous prostitute doesn't have it every year.

837
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,280
What do you mean?

838
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,960
You can't sell it today, right?

839
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,920
As soon as the smoke of Chinese viburnum arrives,

840
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,600
the customers will buy them all.

841
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,320
I think

842
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,160
are all the wealthy guests of the Oiran.

843
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,960
I miss you.

844
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,480
This is just a sample.

845
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,520
Do you remember the appearance of the person?

846
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,600
What a coincidence.

847
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,160
The servants always come to pick it up.

848
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,320
They hide themselves.

849
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,600
[This time, he's showing his face.]

850
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,080
Who is it?

851
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,440
Yes.

852
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,360
Say something.

853
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,400
Who is it? Let me ask you.

854
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,160
Who is he?

855
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,800
He doesn't seem to be able to afford it.

856
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,840
but he paid.

857
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,880
He was a young man.

858
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,960
in red.

859
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,000
On my back

860
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,080
on his back.

861
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,880
It's really him.

862
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:40,840
