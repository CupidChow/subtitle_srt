1
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,000
That night,

2
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
Mr. Guan was here.

3
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,120
The green grass is buried with the loyal bone.

4
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,000
The blood that night

5
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,920
over the threshold.

6
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,440
The people are gone.

7
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,880
Hao.

8
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,960
Lift your feet.

9
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
I smell blood.

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,840
It's new blood.

11
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,840
It's all dust. How can we investigate it?

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,200
We can only

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Have a look.

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,800
Chef

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,720
Don't use heavy eyes.

16
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,120
Who are you?

17
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,600
Chef.

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,720
I was just dizzy before.

19
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,120
but now he vomited blood.

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,240
This is a sign of early death.

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,240
Chef, can you use the heavy pupils again?

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,200
If we can't find out,

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
you'll die.

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't let you die.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,160
You can't use your eyes anymore.

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,840
If you don't want to die in my hands,

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,440
don't use those eyes.

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,720
This is

29
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,079
is indeed the crime scene.

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,440
Are you used to it?

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,120
This is great.

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,120
Ping’an has never slept here.

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,600
Such a soft bed

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
I've never had such delicious cakes.

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,840
Eat more if you like it.

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,200
Here.

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,840
Okay.

38
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,400
Eat mine.

39
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,680
And mine.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,680
All right.

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,760
Don't let him eat so much.

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,280
He hasn't eaten enough for days.

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,080
If he keeps eating like this,

44
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,120
If you eat too much, your stomach will swell.

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,760
If you eat too much,

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,680
if I eat too much?

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,920
It's okay.

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,480
Don't cry.

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,280
Take the medicine.

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,240
Thanks.

51
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
The mother and son

52
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,040
died in the mansion.

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,640
The Duke of Security moved his body to the ground temple

54
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
and created chaos.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,079
The house is vacant.

56
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,360
It's normal if the refugees

57
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,360
it's normal.

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,000
But the security guard showed up at the crime scene.

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
I'm afraid

60
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,640
he's really involved with the butler's gang.

61
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,800
But the housekeeper

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,680
is gone.

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
Mr. Guan taught you before.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,480
What do you mean?

65
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
You suspect me?

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,640
Qin, be the judge.

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,960
I will be with him someday.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,120
I mean

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
if there is you,

70
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,920
there might be someone else.

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,760
Sister Qin.

72
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,080
Take care of her for me.

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,720
Isn't that the girl from the street?

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Yes.

75
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,560
His name is Ping’an.

76
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,040
I brought him to the mansion.

77
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,440
I thought

78
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
he's a refugee and wandering around.

79
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,000
he might know something about that kid from the Earth Temple.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,320
I knew it.

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,520
He said his name is Little Four.

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,560
is his friend.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,080
I was lucky that day

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
I got a bunch of Buddha beans on the street.

85
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,159
Little Four found it.

86
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,400
I want to eat too.

87
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,680
He's been hungry for a few days.

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,640
I gave him half.

89
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,280
We are good friends.

90
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
We share happiness.

91
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,520
What is this?

92
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,040
You haven't eaten this before?

93
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,720
This is Buddha Bean.

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,159
Is it good?

95
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,200
After eating,

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,640
I can sleep well.

97
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,800
It's delicious.

98
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,400
You saw him eating it.

99
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,520
After he ate a few,

100
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
he couldn't bear to eat anymore.

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,040
He said he wanted to bring it back

102
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,360
for his mother.

103
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,080
But I killed him.

104
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
Shen Song, say something.

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,200
It has nothing to do with safety.

106
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,000
right?

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,920
I don't know.

108
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,280
Ping’an is like this.

109
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
Can't you say something to reassure him?

110
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
The chef said

111
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,000
lies

112
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,560
to the dead.

113
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,680
Gongsun Li.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's go to the coroner's room.

115
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,159
Be good.

116
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,080
It's okay.

117
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,680
Sir.

118
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,720
[The cause of death]

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,240
the cause of death.

120
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,520
Any questions?

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
Inner bleeding.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,800
His pupils are dilated.

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,120
He did die of suffocation.

124
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
I pressed his stomach just now.

125
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,520
He has no indigestion.

126
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,800
Even if I ate too much Buddha beans,

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,880
I have vomited all of them.

128
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,680
He didn't die from swelling.

129
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,200
Let’s go back and tell Ping’an.

130
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
He must be crying.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,320
Let's go.

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,560
Wait.

133
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,159
Fo Bean.

134
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
Vomit.

135
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,320
The handkerchief.

136
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,920
It's the residue of the Buddha beans.

137
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,200
When I first saw the body,

138
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,560
I thought it was caused by

139
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,960
because the child was killed.

140
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,200
But now it seems

141
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,320
he was forced to vomit.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,040
That's why

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,840
to save his son.

144
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,080
Even if someone forces me, I won't.

145
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,480
Maybe...

146
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,920
the mother tried so hard

147
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,360
to save the child.

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
I failed.

149
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,240
No.

150
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,080
It's Buddha Bean.

151
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,400
Gongsun Li.

152
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,080
Do you know Buddha Beans?

153
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,360
Buddha bean?

154
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
What is Buddha Bean?

155
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,720
It really hurt Little Four.

156
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,559
Lower your voice.

157
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,159
Ping’an cried and fell asleep.

158
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,799
According to the Book of Four Saints,

159
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
Buddha bean is a disease of father and son.

160
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,760
When a patient eats Buddha beans,

161
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,840
the stomach will swell

162
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,480
and die of severe pain.

163
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
His abdomen was dry after he died.

164
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,680
just like dying of hunger.

165
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,600
Therefore,

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,160
the coroner and I didn't find out.

167
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,560
But before he died,

168
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,920
before he died.

169
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
It smells fishy.

170
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,040
Fortunately, we don't have to eat it.

171
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,120
Normal patients

172
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
is not a big problem.

173
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,040
Little Four was hungry.

174
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,480
So I asked Ping’an for the tofu.

175
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,960
I didn't expect Ping'an was kind,

176
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
but caused Little Four's illness.

177
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,880
Mother is urging her to vomit.

178
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,160
It's too late.

179
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,320
Kid.

180
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,480
The tofu tofu seizures.

181
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,280
Little Four is in pain.

182
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,360
Mother.

183
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,520
It hurts.

184
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,720
The ants are biting my stomach.

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,960
Silly boy.

186
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Mother, I don't want to hurt anymore.

187
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,520
This disease is extremely vicious.

188
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,200
Once the gas tract is blocked,

189
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,240
you can only breathe in, not vent out.

190
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
until she died of exhaustion.

191
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,840
The desperate mother couldn't do anything.

192
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,600
[She could only watch her child struggling.]

193
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,120
Mom, it hurts.

194
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,920
Help me.

195
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,160
Please, Mother.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
Silly boy.

197
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,600
It doesn't hurt if you don't breathe.

198
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,360
Okay?

199
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,520
Buddha beans are incurable.

200
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,440
How could a mother watch her child

201
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,480
for two or three hours.

202
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,080
For a mother who is hungry,

203
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,720
death

204
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,000
[At that moment, it became salvation.]

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,960
She made up her mind

206
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,600
to end Little Four's pain.

207
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,960
Mother killed her son with despair.

208
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,400
She was rational.

209
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,680
I couldn't bear to see

210
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,920
But there was no one by the bridge.

211
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
So he followed him.

212
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,280
If we didn't tell the Buddha Bean,

213
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,720
we couldn't find out

214
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,600
the real cause of Little Four's death.

215
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,320
Princess.

216
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,880
Tell Ping’an.

217
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,080
He can't take care of himself.

218
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,760
but still chose to help his friends.

219
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,640
A kind heart.

220
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,200
What's wrong?

221
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,880
After he wakes up,

222
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,040
take him home.

223
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,400
and comfort him.

224
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,200
Chef.

225
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,640
I was right.

226
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,640
The Duke of Security is a good man.

227
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
You're right.

228
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,280
He's a good man.

229
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,720
If he's not safe,

230
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,040
we almost misunderstood the security.

231
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,640
I don't believe in ghosts.

232
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,120
But I believe the Duke of Security

233
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,120
is Mr. Guan's spirit.

234
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
If Mr. Guan were here,

235
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
what would he do?

236
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,640
He will help the weak

237
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,120
like Duke Security.

238
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,080
Please help the people.

239
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
A ghost

240
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,840
can't bear to see the people wander.

241
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,280
We should go to the street.

242
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,040
Here.

243
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,320
Thank you.

244
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,680
The kid has food.

245
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,360
Here.

246
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,280
Kid.

247
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,560
Give me some food.

248
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,800
Save him.

249
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,120
Please save us.

250
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,200
Child,

251
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,280
there will be a great plague after the disaster.

252
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,120
If it's a plague,

253
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,960
Gongsun Li.

254
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,720
The capital

255
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,520
will be doomed forever.

256
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,360
Now,

257
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,960
the clinic refuses to accept refugees.

258
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,120
Li,

259
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,400
please take the doctor along the street for free treatment.

260
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,360
Don't let the plague endanger the people.

261
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,480
Everyone,

262
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
please follow me.

263
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,080
Okay.

264
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,320
Be careful.

265
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,560
Chef.

266
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,800
Do you know what I thought of?

267
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,640
Here.

268
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,960
Eat something.

269
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,840
If the steward is still here,

270
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,120
it would be the same.

271
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,880
to save the people.

272
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,000
Brother Chen.

273
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
We'll help you too.

274
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,480
Be careful.

275
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,360
The rewards in the palace are really different.

276
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,280
Except Princess,

277
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,200
other than Princess?

278
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,520
It shows that His Majesty loves you so much.

279
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,160
All right.

280
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,760
Take these to the Ministry of Revenue.

281
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm going to donate.

282
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,480
to help the refugees.

283
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,960
Princess, we have donated money.

284
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,520
Don't be so stingy.

285
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,560
What are you waiting for?

286
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,200
Move it away!

287
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,400
Yes.

288
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,640
Good boy.

289
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,320
We'll have food soon.

290
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,880
Thank you.

291
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:52,960
Here.

292
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,080
Are you okay?

293
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,240
Yes.

294
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,320
Thank you.

295
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,840
We'll have food soon.

296
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
Soon.

297
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,560
Thank you, sir.

298
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,080
Here.

299
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Take this medicine back.

300
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,720
Take it on time.

301
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,120
Kid.

302
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,800
Here.

303
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,720
Here.

304
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,320
This medicine can cure indigestion and digestion.

305
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,280
You need to take it every day.

306
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,320
If you don't feel well,

307
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,360
you can come to me.

308
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,120
Thank you.

309
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Guanyin Earth.

310
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,520
Remember.

311
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,040
Stop eating.

312
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Or you'll have a stomachache.

313
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Sir,

314
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,440
We really don't have anything to eat.

315
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,080
Eating alocasy

316
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,360
It's better than starvation.

317
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,280
Let's hang in there.

318
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,320
It'll be ready soon.

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,560
Brother Chen.

320
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
What is Bodhisattva Earth?

321
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,040
It's the muddy soil behind Guanyin Temple in the suburb.

322
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,880
Clay?

323
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,880
How can you eat this?

324
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,520
When the refugees see it’s delicate and soft,

325
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,920
and hungry,

326
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,200
I eat it.

327
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
There's no plague.

328
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,320
He ate the soil.

329
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,640
and drank water.

330
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,040
and had a stomachache.

331
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,920
It's so swollen.

332
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,800
They called the Earth Guanyin.

333
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,960
They thought they were Guanyin.

334
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,360
to show mercy

335
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,200
to relieve their hunger.

336
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,400
However,

337
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,079
because of that.

338
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,359
Chef.

339
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,440
Mr. Guan taught me

340
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,000
The way of college is to help the people.

341
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
But the suffering in the mortal world

342
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,800
I never thought about it.

343
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,079
Brother Chen.

344
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,960
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,200
The long breath can cover the tears.

346
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,120
My life is hard.

347
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,520
For the past ten years,

348
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,480
for nothing.

349
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,960
Only by standing between the refugees

350
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,680
to understand what suffering is.

351
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,360
I'm ashamed.

352
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,760
As the saying goes,

353
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,480
is to help the people.

354
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,920
If I don't get close to the people,

355
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,280
and become a part of the people,

356
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,280
how can you suffer the suffering of the people?

357
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,680
The disease of the people.

358
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,920
Gongsun,

359
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,600
There's a long way ahead.

360
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,160
We scholars

361
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,920
need to be punished?

362
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,120
Brother Chen.

363
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,080
Thank you.

364
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,880
Can you take it?

365
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,880
No.

366
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,880
But the people can't.

367
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,600
Turn around.

368
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,440
It means

369
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,480
Come here.

370
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,680
Meaning.

371
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,360
Let me tell you.

372
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,000
when we grow up,

373
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,440
we should be good people.

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,960
I know.

375
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,480
Mother said you can't be like me.

376
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,280
Yi, come here.

377
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,400
Look.

378
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,920
The Nine Series are hard to solve.

379
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,600
But no matter how hard it is,

380
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,360
we can't force it.

381
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,160
Look.

382
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Dad is amazing.

383
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:16,840
Come.

384
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,760
Mei.

385
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,160
Take her to the yard.

386
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:19,920
Yes.

387
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,800
Go.

388
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,720
Slow down.

389
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,960
You mean

390
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,800
you want to help that cook?

391
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,720
The case of the steward

392
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000
in a series.

393
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,560
Chef Shen

394
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
has just shown himself.

395
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,840
Do you know

396
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,480
how many eyes are staring at him?

397
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,840
I'm pressing his head.

398
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,960
in case he gets himself into trouble.

399
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,000
A man like Kim Ok

400
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,360
Don't let him touch the stone.

401
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,840
My lord.

402
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,520
Sir!

403
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,120
There's a lunatic in front of the government office.

404
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,880
He claims to be a security guard.

405
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,840
What?

406
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,520
Chef, come here.

407
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,800
Take it

408
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,840
Take it on time.

409
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480
I just talked to them.

410
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,600
These refugees

411
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,480
are most likely from the fields.

412
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,080
Tato!

413
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,000
Rudong was attacked by tsunami every year.

414
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
The victims were fishermen along the coast.

415
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,560
Why did the farmers

416
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,120
was Tado?

417
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,480
Could it be...

418
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,800
the Duke of Security is telling the truth?

419
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
Did the Duke of Security

420
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,040
not just to reverse the case for Guan,

421
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,120
Do you really want to

422
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,400
for the people of Ludong?

423
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,080
Duke of Security.

424
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
I can't figure out

425
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,840
your purpose.

426
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,720
what is

427
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,600
[your kindness?]

428
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,560
Where are you going, Chef?

429
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,320
Find the security guard.

430
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,920
Chef Shen.

431
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,000
Where are you going?

432
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,640
The murder case of the Earth Temple has been solved.

433
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,080
The Duke of Security is disguised as a refugee.

434
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,120
We have arrested him.

435
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,680
He will be interrogated.

436
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Pretending?

437
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,640
The case of the Earth Temple has been solved.

438
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,360
The Duke of Security is disguised as a refugee.

439
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,800
We have arrested him.

440
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,480
We'll wait for the trial.

441
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,800
You mean someone claimed to be the Duke of Security?

442
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,040
Yes.

443
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Peng doesn't care

444
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,200
Peng Buwei just arrived at the gate of the government office.

445
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,040
the man rushed in.

446
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,480
My lord. My lord.

447
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,320
Peng Hyo-ok.

448
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,080
My wife and son died tragically.

449
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,760
You despicable officials

450
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,120
can eat and sleep.

451
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,800
Take him away.

452
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,360
Slow down.

453
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,040
Take your clothes away.

454
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,600
Take it away.

455
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,480
Take it away.

456
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,400
Come on.

457
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,760
Are you here to close the case

458
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
just to close the case?

459
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,120
Yes.

460
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,920
I'll do it.

461
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,480
It's just two refugees.

462
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,680
What's the big case?

463
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,200
to blame myself?

464
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,320
If you want to find someone, come to me.

465
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,920
Don't you suspect it?

466
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,720
About what?

467
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,800
I suspect someone is pretending

468
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,000
pretending to be a ghost.

469
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,560
Who would be so stupid?

470
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,120
Officer Shen.

471
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,840
He is in prison now.

472
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,000
If you don't believe me,

473
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,280
you can interrogate him yourself.

474
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,480
My lord.

475
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,840
Who are you?

476
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,000
Farmer of Ludong.

477
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:07,920
Wang Ping.

478
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,480
Why did you go to the capital?

479
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,240
You know the answer.

480
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,960
Of course I can't eat enough.

481
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,800
and flee from famine.

482
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,880
You and the Earth Temple...

483
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,040
What do you have to do

484
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,560
of the Earth Temple?

485
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Don't lie to me.

486
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,800
My son is Little Four.

487
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,400
Why did you use the bodies of Little Four and his son?

488
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,400
to disrupt the audition

489
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,680
when he conferred Duke of Security.

490
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,680
Let's go to Beijing.

491
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,400
to eat well.

492
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,000
But the government didn't provide relief.

493
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,240
and starved my wife and children to death.

494
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,840
Little Four is my only child.

495
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,840
If I don't look for Peng Xiaoyu,

496
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,600
Who else?

497
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,920
I just hate that I can't kill him.

498
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,480
Your son didn't starve to death.

499
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,640
He accidentally ate Buddha beans

500
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,880
because I was hungry.

501
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,840
You answered it fluently.

502
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,760
I think it's prepared in advance.

503
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,000
I think something is wrong.

504
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,160
Wang Ping,

505
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,320
Do you know you are not flawless?

506
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
The refugees are safe and familiar with Little Four.

507
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,440
All he knows is that the two of them...

508
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,360
I've never seen Little Four have a father like you.

509
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,440
We were just separated for a while.

510
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,120
But do you know

511
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,720
the refugees are safe.

512
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,120
You can call that child Little Four.

513
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,520
but you can't.

514
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Because you said...

515
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,840
Little Four is your only son.

516
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,640
How can you say that?

517
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,640
The name Little Four

518
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
is just Ping'an and the kids are having fun.

519
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,760
and rehearsed the sequence.

520
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,840
That's why it's called that.

521
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,480
You've been separated from his mother and son for a long time.

522
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,200
How did you know?

523
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,360
My son is called Little Four.

524
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,640
Who asked you to pretend to be Little Four's father?

525
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,480
and acknowledge the case of Marquis of Security?

526
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,600
Confess now!

527
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,120
Buddha beans are inherited by the father.

528
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,440
If you are really Little Four's father,

529
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,360
there must be Buddha Beans.

530
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,840
No.

531
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,840
Fine.

532
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,560
If you weren't bribed and disturbed the case,

533
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,560
then eat the Buddha Bean

534
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,640
and prove your identity.

535
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,880
Die!

536
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,880
The Imperial Envoy is forcing me to death.

537
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,400
Stop!

538
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,480
Cat Zhan

539
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,160
Spit it out.

540
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,560
Spit it out!

541
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,680
It's poison.

542
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,400
Chef.

543
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,680
They knew you wanted to use the Buddha Bean to test him.

544
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,560
so they put a poison bag in his mouth.

545
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,280
Their target is you.

546
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,440
Where is Chef Shen?

547
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,760
Look.

548
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,600
I didn't look at you for a while.

549
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,480
and you're making a big mistake.

550
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,440
You...

551
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,400
My goodness.

552
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,600
How dare you kill the witness in my prison!

553
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
Lord Peng.

554
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,520
This is a frame-up!

555
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,120
Frame me!

556
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,800
The person we sent did it.

557
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
They want to review the case three years ago.

558
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,080
I won't let them have their way.

559
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,880
Duke of Security.

560
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,400
So what if you're a ghost?

561
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,240
I'll give you another life to accompany you.

562
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,680
Three years ago,

563
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,920
he was no match for the Pang family.

564
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,840
If you're a human, I'll make you die.

565
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,800
You're a ghost.

566
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,080
I'll turn you into ashes.

567
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,360
Lord Peng.

568
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,440
Wang Ping wasn't forced to confess

569
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,760
by Shen Song.

570
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,360
He died of poisoning.

571
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,320
The coroner will find out.

572
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,840
Why won't you investigate it?

573
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,880
That's not how you solve a case.

574
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,400
You let him test him?

575
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,520
If he dies,

576
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,080
it's not Buddha Bean.

577
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,360
He can also say you poisoned him.

578
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,160
The dead can't prove it.

579
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,560
How can you explain it?

580
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,520
Shen Song just wants him to tell us who’s behind it.

581
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,120
That’s all.

582
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,200
Try it.

583
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,200
He tried it.

584
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,600
but he died.

585
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,680
According to you,

586
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,440
it was him who killed him.

587
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,960
The Little Four and his son

588
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,760
in front of Lord Chen,

589
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,080
Was it the Elder?

590
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,560
That's different.

591
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,400
How is it different?

592
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,360
Mr. Gongsun,

593
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,040
Don't mess around.

594
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,200
I'm being unreasonable?

595
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,960
My lord saw me.

596
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,160
Qin.

597
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,120
Zhan Mao'er.

598
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,040
Gongsun Li.

599
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,960
Don't make things difficult for Lord Peng.

600
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:56,840
I...

601
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,040
Lord Peng is right.

602
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,480
Wang Ping died because of me.

603
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,560
Lord Peng, please execute me

604
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,600
to behead me

605
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,880
as a warning to others.

606
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,000
Chef.

607
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,840
Shen Song.

608
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,080
What do you mean?

609
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,760
I just want to scare you.

610
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,240
There's always a way.

611
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,520
No need.

612
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,560
Really?

613
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,360
Lord Peng, please execute me

614
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,560
and behead me.

615
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,840
Chef Shen.

616
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,360
Are you crazy?

617
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,080
Get up.

618
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,840
Yes.

619
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,480
You did a good job

620
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,720
You did a good job.

621
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,640
Since I was young,

622
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,240
I was educated by you.

623
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,720
I've long understood the principle of borrowing power to weave.

624
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,720
There are things

625
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,960
you just need to give him a name.

626
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,560
and give him a name,

627
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,200
no one cares about the truth.

628
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,560
You gave Peng Xiaoyu a name.

629
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,040
Shen Song

630
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,920
is over.

631
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,320
However,

632
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,960
Duke of Security,

633
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,000
Three years ago,

634
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,040
After the butler killed his family,

635
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,200
no one would mention fields again.

636
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,200
Today,

637
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
forced the government to kill Shen Song

638
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,640
to let the Duke of Security know

639
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,520
What's the use of reviving the soul?

640
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
Ghosts return to the mortal world

641
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,280
is just a souvenir.

642
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,720
So I asked someone to replace him

643
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,280
and cut off his thoughts.

644
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,720
is my son.

645
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,160
This morning,

646
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,360
His Majesty wants to release me.

647
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,640
to Jiangnan.

648
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,440
to patrol the administration.

649
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,280
I won't be in the capital these days.

650
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,880
You can deal with

651
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,000
the affairs in the capital.

652
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,960
Father, don’t worry.

653
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,880
I, Shen Song,

654
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,560
forced a murder witness

655
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,120
interfering with the investigation.

656
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,160
is unforgivable.

657
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,600
My lord.

658
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,920
Here is the decree.

659
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,560
to the execution ground.

660
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,520
and execute him.

661
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,160
Father.

662
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,640
You're a grown girl.

663
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,200
Why are you still sticking to me?

664
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,800
Father.

665
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,720
Save Shen Song.

666
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,000
Shen Song misjudged the case of the Earth Temple.

667
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and forced the witness to die.

668
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,920
Peng Xiaoyu was ordered to kill him.

669
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,280
I slipped my hand.

670
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,440
I'm sorry.

671
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,440
Behead!

672
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,680
Who dares?

673
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,360
You want to break into the execution ground?

674
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,480
Stop!

675
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,360
How dare you!

676
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,160
Do you know

677
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,720
breaking into the execution ground

678
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
is a capital crime.

679
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,320
Qin.

680
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,360
You are here.

681
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,560
I need to urge the illusion to take the cook away.

682
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,360
You take care of me.

683
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,920
No.

684
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,600
What are you talking about?

685
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,640
How does the cook treat you?

686
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,680
Now that he's in trouble,

687
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,960
and you're just going to stand by?

688
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,040
I was wrong about you.

689
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,400
Not only do I have to stand by,

690
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,320
I won't allow you to act rashly.

691
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,920
How about

692
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,880
enter the palace again?

693
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,280
Qi.

694
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:15,960
Qi.

695
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,680
Get the car ready.

696
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
No.

697
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,080
Lock her up in the embroidery house.

698
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,280
Before Shen Song is beheaded,

699
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,440
before Shen Song is beheaded.

700
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,160
Let go of me!

701
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,320
Go away!

702
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,360
Zhan Mao'er.

703
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,800
Even you want to stop me?

704
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,320
Qin.

705
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,720
Be good.

706
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Time is up.

707
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Execute!

708
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,520
Chef.

709
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,600
Look.

710
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,320
What is that?

711
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,920
What is that?

712
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,240
This...

713
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,160
This is...

714
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,920

715
