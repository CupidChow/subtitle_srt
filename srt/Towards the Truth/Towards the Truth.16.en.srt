1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,360
Old man.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,760
Pang Yu, you have to give it to me no matter what.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,720
We can just break in.

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,000
Don't you want to kill me?

5
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,840
Kill me! Kill me!

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,840
I'm guilty!

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,920
I'm guilty.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm guilty.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,840
Aunt.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,480
I'm guilty.

11
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,080
Minister, bad news.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,760
Minister, Young Master...

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,680
Tell me.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,280
He killed himself with a white ribbon.

15
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,120
Suicide?

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,600
Four rats.

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
for nothing.

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,280
Pang Yu has returned to Pang Residence.

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,640
Why did he commit suicide?

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,600
If that's the case,

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,400
he must have been hit by a ghost girl.

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,560
Qin, Zhan Mao'er.

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,440
Take care of the funeral here.

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll tell the chef.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,120
the song killing

26
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,039
[Continue.]

27
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,800
Yu.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,760
It's time to wake up.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,120
Wake up.

30
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,960
Father chased them away.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,800
Are you cold?

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,079
Bring me the heater.

33
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,920
Yes.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,720
Wook, how old are you?

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,920
Why are you still as naughty as before?

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,120
I told you to study.

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,520
you pretended to be sick.

38
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,640
You're afraid of getting beaten.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,960
You pretended to be sick too.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,560
Yu.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,600
You're my only son.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
You'll have to

43
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,480
of the Pang family.

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,440
I thought

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,960
I won't teach you.

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
You're useless.

47
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,040
That's why

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,960
too harsh on you.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,280
Fine.

50
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,520
From now on,

51
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,720
I won't force you anymore.

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,440
Okay?

53
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
Why are you still so cold?

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,920
Where are these idiots?

55
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,960
Wook.

56
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,000
My baby.

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,160
It's karma.

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,760
Why

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,880
the karma on me?

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
No.

61
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,280
No.

62
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,320
You didn’t commit suicide

63
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,640
you didn’t commit suicide.

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,120
You didn't commit suicide in the prison.

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,200
Is it poison or poison?

66
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,240
It's the northwest camp.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,200
Wu Dinghe.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
It must be a ghost girl.

69
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
Yu.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,000
They lied to me.

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,760
They lied to me.

72
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,560
Chef.

73
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,760
Pang Yu also fits

74
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,120
the fourth person in the previous song.

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,440
We got it wrong.

76
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,520
Chef.

77
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
Five rats eat ink.

78
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,880
and died at the Gaxu day.

79
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,400
The one who killed my whole clan

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,720
was Mr. Han.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
He gave me this heavy pupil.

82
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
His target

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,280
is me.

84
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,560
Oh no.

85
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,280
Chef!

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
Let go of me!

87
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,440
Let go of me!

88
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,920
Let go of me!

89
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,600
Let go of me!

90
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Let go of me!

91
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,840
I know.

92
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,600
you care about your friends.

93
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,720
and eager to know the truth,

94
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,600
he will come by himself.

95
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,800
128 people in Shen Village

96
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,080
are all farmers.

97
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Even traveling merchants have never had

98
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,080
He doesn't have enemies with outsiders.

99
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,200
I'm here

100
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,760
to ask you

101
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,640
what did they do wrong

102
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,120
causing a catastrophe?

103
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,320
Know Buyan.

104
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,040
Get out!

105
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,520
Get out!

106
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,640
Why is the chef so nice to you?

107
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,320
but you still want to sing a song?

108
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,680
Why did you lure him away with a letter?

109
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,520
What are you up to?

110
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,920
Hand him over!

111
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,760
What did you say?

112
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,920
Five rats eat ink.

113
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,760
One life will be in danger.

114
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,720
I understand now.

115
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
Today is Jia Xu day.

116
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,560
You deliberately revealed it to the chef.

117
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,080
That Han

118
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
is his enemy.

119
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,760
so that he can be furious.

120
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,600
and abused his personal torture.

121
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,040
and finally become

122
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,160
in this song.

123
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,840
You're a jerk.

124
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,120
Officer Shen is alone.

125
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,159
You’re brave, Shen Shaodwen.

126
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,880
You know it’s a dangerous place,

127
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,880
you can still go alone.

128
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,520
You are a sinner.

129
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,720
Of course I have to interrogate you.

130
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
You committed a serious crime 13 years ago.

131
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,200
I want to know the reason.

132
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,440
Why did the youngest

133
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,760
died?

134
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,280
128 lives

135
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,320
are heaven to you.

136
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,440
To some people, you're just an ant.

137
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,120
I was the bandit leader of Xiling Mountain.

138
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
I've been taught by an expert since I was young.

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,160
and learned some medical skills.

140
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,360
Soldiers wiped out Beiguan.

141
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,760
How can our small fortress

142
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,040
can't resist it.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,640
Surrender soon.

144
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,880
I thought it would be over.

145
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,040
But when we were killed,

146
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,760
my life was saved by an official.

147
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,600
That was Grand Preceptor Pang.

148
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
He asked me to do something

149
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,600
to kill 128 people in Shen Village.

150
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,400
It's not that simple.

151
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,040
But killing 128 people of your family

152
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,960
is my pledge of loyalty.

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,800
So,

154
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,640
what kind of secret does Shen Village have?

155
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,720
to make Pang Ji do this?

156
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Pang Yu is dead.

157
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,280
He's dead.

158
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,840
Dead.

159
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,760
Yuan Kan is dead.

160
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,200
Yuan Kan is dead.

161
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,040
Wuniang.

162
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,720
I've forgotten everything.

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,960
It's been seven years

164
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
for seven years.

165
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,760
Yuan Kan.

166
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,320
Mr. Gongsun.

167
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,280
As you can see,

168
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,240
Wuniang is a relative of my comrade.

169
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,800
She's not good.

170
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,320
Let alone the purpose of Wuding Pavilion,

171
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,680
is the Pang family.

172
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,440
Even if I wanted to kill people with music,

173
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,320
the most important thing now

174
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,160
is Wuniang.

175
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,040
Wait.

176
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,320
Young Master.

177
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,760
It was me

178
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,520
who took Lord Shen away.

179
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,400
If it weren't for you,

180
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,160
it must be that Han.

181
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,120
You seduced me

182
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,440
is just a lie that I dare not violate the law.

183
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,040
But...

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,160
If I dare to come,

185
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,520
I can get out alive.

186
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,760
Give me a heavy pupil.

187
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll use my eyes...

188
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,040
to take you.

189
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,440
Bastard!

190
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,400
You use

191
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,160
is still good for you.

192
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,360
Since you've confessed,

193
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,240
I will put you in jail.

194
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,640
Father.

195
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,840
Mother.

196
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,280
Qiao.

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,040
I will clear

198
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
I want to clear my name.

199
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,720
Do you know why I killed so many people

200
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,720
Why did I leave you alone?

201
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,880
You let me live

202
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,280
and let me live in hell.

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,280
You just don't know

204
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,640
I climbed out of hell

205
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,840
to seek revenge.

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,640
Wrong.

207
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,080
It's your eyes.

208
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,240
are full of hatred and regret.

209
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,040
This is the Parasition Jutsu.

210
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,800
The best soil.

211
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,360
[It's the best soil.] [It's the best soil.]

212
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,640
Bastard!

213
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,920
Bastard!

214
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,080
Where is the chef now?

215
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,560
Is Han

216
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,040
hide his identity?

217
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,160
The chef has heavy pupils.

218
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,600
He knew he didn't take the ghost girl.

219
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,320
But how can he be sure

220
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,200
Chef Shen won't kill him?

221
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,280
Yuan Kan.

222
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,160
Yuan Kan.

223
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,000
Wuniang didn't forget Feng's death.

224
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,760
Now that I think about it,

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,640
I feel so painful.

226
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,720
Forget

227
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,800
I remember

228
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,840
I feel so painful.

229
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,440
No.

230
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
There must be something else

231
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
The cook doesn't remember anything.

232
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,400
The forgotten memory

233
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,400
is the life of a cook.

234
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,320
The murder in Shen Village

235
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,880
You made the first contribution.

236
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,600
You call yourself

237
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,280
who only cares about the truth.

238
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,800
who only cares about the truth.

239
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,400
lived on lies.

240
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,320
Think about it.

241
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
We met

242
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
The first time we met.

243
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,280
[the first time we met?]

244
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,680
Is it in Shen Village?

245
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,680
Kid.

246
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,200
Do you know how to get to Shen Village?

247
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,280
What a coincidence. I'm from the Shen Village.

248
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,600
Thank you for bringing me here.

249
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,160
Return the favor.

250
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,680
Let me help you win the hide-and-seek, okay?

251
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,680
No.

252
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,440
Pretty.

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,560
She can't hear you anymore.

254
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,360
Pretty,

255
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,640
You should thank me.

256
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,120
Qiao,

257
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,160
It's my fault.

258
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,960
It's my fault.

259
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,280
It's my fault.

260
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,920
It's my fault.

261
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,720
Of course it's your fault.

262
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,840
If you didn't bring me into the Shen Village,

263
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,760
your family wouldn't have died.

264
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,280
None.

265
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,640
Yes.

266
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,520
I was wrong.

267
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm guilty.

268
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,880
Do you know what is heavy pupil?

269
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,120
It needs to absorb your energy

270
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
to grow.

271
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,600
That's why you're getting weaker.

272
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,440
You can give me back my Eyes.

273
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,240
I forgot to tell you.

274
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,320
You were hit by a ghost girl as soon as you came in.

275
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,840
You must feel guilty.

276
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,200
The guilt that Ms. Ghost put in your heart

277
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,920
Let guilt become a demon.

278
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,720
Pain.

279
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,280
Can you be more painful than me?

280
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,640
Hya!

281
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,840
Hya!

282
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,560
Hya!

283
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,520
It really moved.

284
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,160
Cat Zhan, you go first.

285
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,760
What about you?

286
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,040
There are many of them.

287
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,080
If they really fight,

288
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,240
we won't be able to win.

289
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,720
I'll find a way.

290
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,280
The target you were looking for

291
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,360
were provided by Han, right?

292
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,720
After he was guarding the underground temple,

293
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,280
he became the butler of the morgue.

294
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,800
and come to the temple often.

295
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,040
to learn about the people.

296
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Except the morgue,

297
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,880
this is the only place he can stay.

298
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,440
Keep looking.

299
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,600
I could have killed you and stole the token.

300
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,280
But I didn't want to do it.

301
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,880
so I came to discuss with you.

302
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,440
Back in Nanke Building,

303
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,200
you kept saying that chess pieces have no heart.

304
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,520
Now you're nagging and sentimental.

305
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,160
What did Chef Shen poison you?

306
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,080
to make you help him?

307
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,360
I have a friend. I don't want to be a pawn anymore.

308
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,319
Since Master has been hiding for years,

309
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,880
you want me to accompany you to ruin his plan.

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,119
You know I'm your last comrade.

311
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,280
You tricked me.

312
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,960
You're forcing me.

313
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,839
Wait.

314
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,560
That's right.

315
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,960
There's nothing.

316
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,120
But you're wrong.

317
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,680
I don't believe in ghosts.

318
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,000
But the chef is in trouble now.

319
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,720
If the Yin Department really opened his eyes,

320
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,160
tell me where he is.

321
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,880
A chef is an honest man.

322
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,200
and never owes anyone.

323
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,040
I will end well.

324
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,880
I'm guilty.

325
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
I deserve to die.

326
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
I deserve to die.

327
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,440
I deserve to die.

328
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm guilty.

329
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
I deserve to die.

330
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,080
I'm guilty.

331
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
I deserve to die.

332
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,240
Drink.

333
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,400
This tea

334
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,960
can relieve pain.

335
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,400
After an hour,

336
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,160
in an hour.

337
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,880
Only then

338
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,800
won't be distorted.

339
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,440
Change your face before ironing the post.

340
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,600
A bunch of wood.

341
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,240
Clay?

342
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,440
Why would I believe that?

343
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,800
Wind.

344
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,240
Why is there wind?

345
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,880
It's really windy.

346
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,800
Hurry!

347
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,840
Set off fireworks.

348
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,960
Ask Qin to show the cat.

349
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,760
Listen to me.

350
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,080
Don't let anyone escape.

351
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,800
will be buried with my son.

352
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,080
Yes.

353
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,240
Why are you here so soon?

354
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Mr. Gongsun.

355
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,200
It's better to ask for help than yourself.

356
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,520
If you find Lord Shen,

357
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,400
don't leave any regrets.

358
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,440
Don't be a deserter.

359
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,680
Please.

360
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
Zhi Buyan.

361
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,880
You were lucky to win the tea house.

362
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm not convinced.

363
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,240
Today, only the two of us

364
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,920
Let's see who killed more.

365
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,200
After the Wuhe Camp fell,

366
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,320
there was no more fun battle.

367
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,840
Whoever approaches the Yin Temple

368
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
will be killed.

369
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,680
Kill them all!

370
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,400
Kill!

371
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,440
Kill!

372
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,880
It's almost time.

373
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,560
Your friends are here to pick you up.

374
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,880
The Pang family is here too.

375
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,800
Grand Preceptor Pang killed

376
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,960
all my brothers

377
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,680
only spared my life.

378
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,920
just to let me do

379
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,160
dirty things for him,

380
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,880
including killing you.

381
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,400
I killed his son.

382
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,640
The Pang family won't let me off.

383
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,760
You took so many evidence from their family,

384
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,320
they won't let you go.

385
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,520
But your friends won't let him go.

386
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Once he dies,

387
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,520
no one will know who I am.

388
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,760
I'll give you a heavy pupil

389
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,440
to help you solve the case.

390
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,000
I've been waiting for today.

391
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,880
I want your face.

392
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,240
By then,

393
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,280
I won’t be sneaky anymore.

394
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,120
Hanya.

395
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,120
I am

396
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,320
Shen Shaodwen.

397
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,160
Order the pawns.

398
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,240
Kill the Pang Party.

399
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,080
Yes.

400
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
I told you.

401
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,040
You're tough.

402
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,320
Be careful.

403
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,480
Don't say what you know.

404
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,640
[Don't say what you know.]

405
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,120
Zhi Xiang.

406
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,920
He was shot in the heart. It really hurts.

407
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,360
Zhi Xiang, don't sleep on Zhi Xiang.

408
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,760
Zhi Xiang.

409
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,800
Brother.

410
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,760
Pang abandoned us.

411
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,840
Brother.

412
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,440
Please take care of Wuniang.

413
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,280
Let me die in peace.

414
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,720
Zhi Xiang.

415
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,120
[Don't sleep.]

416
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Don't sleep, I don't know what to say.

417
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,560
I...

418
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
who I want,

419
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,120
he will be charged with some crimes.

420
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,320
By then,

421
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,240
even if I want to be an emperor.

422
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,440
I...

423
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,720
It's not impossible

424
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,560
Chef

425
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,360
Chef

426
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Give up

427
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,160
Everyone here today

428
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,200
will die with my son.

429
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,880
Pang Ji, your son is dead.

430
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
But don't forget,

431
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,080
500 soldiers of Wu Dinghe Camp

432
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,280
are also other people's sons.

433
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,440
They are not surnamed Pang after all.

434
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Your Chef Shen.

435
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,680
Gongsun Li.

436
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,640
Cat Zhan.

437
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,600
All your friends

438
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,680
will die here.

439
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,320
Bastard!

440
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,360
You deserve to be Shen Shaoshan?

441
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,120
Bah!

442
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,000
Do you think

443
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
I can be your good friend.

444
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,480
Since you're here,

445
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,920
leave your face.

446
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Shen Shaodwen,

447
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,440
I know you give up on yourself

448
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,760
because you're guilty.

449
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,440
But forgetting is not a sin.

450
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,880
Forgetting is not a sin.

451
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,680
Shen Shaodwen,

452
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,360
You are innocent. You are innocent.

453
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,960
He's innocent.

454
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,600
Does it stink?

455
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,960
A dead person's face.

456
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
It stinks.

457
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,680
So this face

458
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,520
I want to peel it alive.

459
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,720
Shen Shaodwen.

460
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,040
Shen Shaodwen.

461
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,320
Have you forgotten what you promised me?

462
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,280
Shut up!

463
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,800
Why are you lying here?

464
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,520
and let others slaughter you?

465
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,880
Who do you think you are?

466
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,320
The lantern gate case.

467
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,880
You cleared the grievance for 66 corpses.

468
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,480
Even if Long Yan Nian is guilty,

469
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,160
you never let him be wronged.

470
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,040
Even if Long Yan Nian is involved in this,

471
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,280
is not the only criminal.

472
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,440
The case is unclear.

473
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,760
We can't close the case.

474
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,000
No

475
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,000
The mandrill murder

476
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
You can't protect yourself

477
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,840
but you want to clear Zhan Mao'er's name.

478
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,720
Peng Xiaoyu.

479
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,280
The robbery case seven years ago

480
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,040
The mandrill monster has confessed

481
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,120
It wasn't done by a ranger

482
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,600
Now Zhan Mao is still alive.

483
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,560
Please calm him down.

484
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,000
Shoot!

485
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,280
Shut up!

486
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Shen Shaodwen,

487
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,200
The steward has been wronged for three years.

488
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,520
It was you who stirred up the sky

489
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,640
and reveal the truth.

490
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,560
Duke of Security.

491
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,880
You really came.

492
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,520
I don't know what you did wrong.

493
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,320
What did you do wrong?

494
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
13 years ago,

495
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,840
you were just a child.

496
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,560
What's wrong with that?

497
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,320
You're innocent.

498
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,960
Wake up.

499
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,800
Kill me.

500
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,000
Kill me.

501
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,360
I brought disaster.

502
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,160
Father!

503
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,320
Mother.

504
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,160
Pretty.

505
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,120
Pretty

506
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,080
Pretty.

507
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,720
Kill me.

508
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,560
Kill me.

509
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,200
The future you

510
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,960
saved a lot of people.

511
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,920
I was one of them.

512
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,040
You not only saved my life,

513
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,600
but also gave me a way.

514
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,720
You pulled me out

515
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,680
from depravity.

516
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,480
You want me to walk this thorny path with you.

517
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,640
If you want me to chase you,

518
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,600
I will.

519
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
So I came here.

520
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,760
Shen Shaodwen,

521
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,000
Did I chase you closely?

522
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,520
It was you

523
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,880
It was you

524
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,760
from this hopeless life.

525
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,520
Now,

526
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,240
let me help you.

527
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,480
Chef.

528
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,240
You said

529
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,640
investigating cases is to speak for the dead.

530
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,480
You told me

531
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
if you die now,

532
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
If you die,

533
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,040
I'll have one more mouth

534
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,960
to speak up for him.

535
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,360
I'm not lying.

536
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,880
We used to be the same.

537
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,880
In this world,

538
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,440
can pull out people's tongue,

539
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,480
but it can't destroy one's mind.

540
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,680
Justice.

541
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,920
Law?

542
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,200
is nothing to you.

543
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,680
What am I to you?

544
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,120
Shen Shaodwen.

545
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,800
Shen Shaodwen!

546
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,960
Let me go.

547
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,200
Since you are not afraid of me,

548
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,960
I won't be afraid of me.

549
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,320
If we miss it once,

550
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,040
but we won’t make another mistake.

551
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,000
Shen Shaodwen,

552
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,800
Why did you commit suicide?

553
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,160
What did I do to you?

554
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,920
you can tell me.

555
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,960
Say it.

556
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
You said there are no nobleness on the thorns.

557
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,720
it's nothing but the descendants.

558
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,120
We are determined to speak for the bitter master.

559
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,280
I promise you.

560
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,080
I'll be with you.

561
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,680
Now,

562
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,040
break your promise again.

563
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,080
Wake up.

564
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,640
Chef!

565
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,240
Chef

566
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,880
Don't use heavy pupils.

567
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,800
It will backfire.

568
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,560
Chef.

569
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,080
That's impossible.

570
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,000
No! No!

571
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,640
Shen Shaodwen

572
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,840
Shen Shaodwen.

573
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,960
You were backfired by the heavy pupil.

574
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
If you kill me,

575
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,160
You...

576
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,280
You're guilty too.

577
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,960
Chef.

578
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,960
You can't be a mouse

579
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,360
Or we can't go back.

580
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,680
Pangji.

581
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,920
Your claws and teeth have been taken care of by my men.

582
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,560
I am the Imperial Preceptor.

583
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,040
How dare you kill me?

584
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,000
You're just a minister.

585
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,880
Do you think I dare to kill him?

586
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,080
Who are you?

587
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,160
I'm Yeomra who will kill you.

588
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,440
More fire.

589
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,800
More.

590
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,720
Doesn't Chef Shen ask for justice?

591
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,040
Then send him to the underworld

592
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,200
to the Yin Bureau.

593
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,080
Why ask the Yin Department?

594
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,760
The government in the mortal world has their own opinions.

595
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,160
The private troops of the Pang family have been eliminated.

596
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,360
Minister.

597
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,200
Accept your fate.

598
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,960
Peng Xiaoyu.

599
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,200
How dare you!

600
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,880
Take the Minister.

601
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,480
Yes.

602
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,120
You...

603
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,480
You! Let go of me!

604
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,920
Let go of me!

605
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,000
Peng Hyo-ok.

606
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,000
You can't save anyone.

607
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,639
Chef Shen will die with me.

608
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,800
Shen Shaodwen.

609
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,440
No! No!

610
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,120
I told you to use kindness to lead evil.

611
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,320
Kindness never changes.

612
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,239
The evil eye you gave me

613
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,800
will be used by me.

614
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,840
Chef.

615
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,320
You’re back.

616
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,360
You’ve finally become Shen Shaoswen.

617
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,000
I knew it.

618
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,960
this junk is quite useful.

619
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,520
Doesn’t it hurt?

620
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,040
Shen Shaodwen.

621
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,640
Shen Shaodwen is Shen Shaodwen.

622
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,640
I promised you

623
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,640
to be Shen Shaodwen forever.

624
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,920
Gongsun Li.

625
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,960
Thank you.

626
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,040
Help me.

627
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,000
Help me! Help me!

628
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,440
Let's go.

629
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,200
Give me your face.

630
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:38,960
Let's go.

631
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,360
Give it to me.

632
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,080
Let's go.

633
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,120
What did you spill?

634
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,160
The ghost girl he prescribed for you.

635
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,680
This is the only thing I can cure him.

636
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,480
I'm guilty.

637
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,160
I killed the innocent.

638
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,840
and changed his face.

639
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,240
and colluded with the treacherous officials.

640
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Five rats eat ink.

641
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,960
I deserve to die.

642
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,960
I'll die.

643
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,160
The day of Jiaxu.

644
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,040
Fire! Run!

645
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,000
Hurry!

646
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,120
Put out the fire!

647
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,600
Hurry!

648
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,080
My dear Shen Qingtian.

649
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,840
Chef.

650
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,880
Stay alive.

651
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,840
I’m your destiny.

652
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,720
Shen Shaodwen,

653
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,720
It’s great

654
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,560
to be alive.

655
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,840
What a pity.

656
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,520
we can never

657
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,680
again.

658
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,960
Chef.

659
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,280
Cat Zhan

660
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,280
Cat Zhan.

661
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,080
Chef.

662
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,000
Are you okay

663
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,600
I'm fine.

664
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,160
Unfortunately, that monster

665
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,520
died in his hands.

666
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,640
Where is Qin?

667
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,560
Qin.

668
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,800
She was just here.

669
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,040
Qin.

670
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,600
Li Qin didn't kill me.

671
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,480
I killed Li Qin.

672
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,760
I'll reward you

673
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,760
I will reward you.

674
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,560
May I ask

675
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,480
I would like to ask His Majesty

676
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,080
from His Majesty.

677
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,960
Ready.

678
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,280
From now on,

679
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,320
I will appoint Shen Song as Minister of Justice.

680
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

681
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I have another request.

682
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,800
Go ahead.

683
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,200
Your Majesty,

684
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,720
in Wuding Pavilion,

685
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,080
are people who have committed

686
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,720
who have committed an innocent crime.

687
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,800
They were supposed to behave and be kind.

688
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,720
innocent people.

689
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,760
because of our suspicion.

690
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,280
In order to survive,

691
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,280
they had to give up everything they had.

692
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
and live in hiding

693
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,160
like a rat.

694
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,760
It’s understandable

695
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,080
it's understandable.

696
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,360
Those who were punished

697
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,200
are guilty but escaped.

698
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,720
I request Your Majesty

699
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,960
to take care of it.

700
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
and give them justice.

701
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,560
Draw up a decree.

702
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,280
Review the files of all the people in Wuding Pavilion.

703
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,120
Miss Liu.

704
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,200
Thank you, my lord.

705
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,160
to clear the name of Wu Dinghe Camp.

706
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,000
His Majesty is considerate of the widow of Wu Dinghe.

707
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,600
and comforted us.

708
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,480
Yuan Kan also suffered from grief.

709
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,520
He even hired a physician to treat me.

710
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,480
Chef.

711
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,840
Warrior Zhan.

712
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,960
Okay.

713
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,360
When I'm not good,

714
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,480
when I'm bad.

715
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
I'm fine.

716
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,120
I'm glad you're fine.

717
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,680
Zhiyan

718
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
thought so too.

719
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,240
If you don't tell me, die for me.

720
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,040
Sorry.

721
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,160
When I recovered,

722
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,760
His name is Meng Handao.

723
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,600
He's the sworn brother

724
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,360
in Yuan Kan's letter.

725
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,680
Since Yuan Kan and Brother Meng

726
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,800
want me to live,

727
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,120
Then I will live well.

728
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,960
I'm relieved

729
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,040
I'm relieved.

730
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,320
If you need help in the future,

731
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,720
it's our duty.

732
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,800
I need your help

733
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
I need your help.

734
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,440
This is a gift

735
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,160
and a responsibility.

736
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,760
This is the name list of the buildings.

737
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,760
My lord has cleared the injustice for the people of Wuding Building.

738
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,520
But they can't

739
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,560
live a normal life.

740
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,640
Fortunately, Mr. Meng

741
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,160
taught us a lot.

742
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,680
Unfixed buildings

743
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,120
is good at collecting information.

744
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
He can read and collect things about the people.

745
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
and courageous.

746
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,600
Please accept me.

747
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,680
Mr. Meng is no longer here.

748
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,200
Lord Meng, please help Boss.

749
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,160
and all the pavilions.

750
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,880
I'm willing to follow your lead.

751
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,560
Please rise.

752
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
I was determined to cultivate.

753
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,840
I wished the world

754
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,680
will no longer be injustice due to the law.

755
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,760
from now on,

756
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,600
from now on.

757
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,080
I’m at your command.

758
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,240
Wuding Pavilion

759
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
to assist the government in the investigation.

760
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,960
If you succeed,

761
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,440
you'll get paid.

762
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,720
Ms Liu is thoughtful.

763
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,440
Mother,

764
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,280
You've been protecting Pang Ji.

765
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
What did he

766
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,600
on me?

767
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,240
What are you afraid of?

768
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,880
What’s the truth?

769
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,560
You and Shen Song

770
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,960
will find out, right?

771
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,880
Bring the criminal Pang Ji to the court.

772
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,160
Bad news!

773
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,560
Something happened.

774
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,440
Shen Song.

775

Officer Shen.

776
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,360
Chef.

777
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
Maybe someone doesn't want you to find Shen Village.

778
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,600
It's the branch pattern again.

779
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,760
The past is wrong.

780
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,680
Cause and effect flow

781
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,880
The secret hasn't been revealed yet.

782
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,680
He killed a Grand Preceptor in the prison.

783
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,440
I don't know how deep the water is.

784
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,000
However,

785
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,440
no matter what, we have to

786
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,640
keep investigating.

787
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,440
If a piece has a heart,

788
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,000
he doesn't deserve to be a pawn anymore.

789
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,240
I ruined your game.

790
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,640
I've let you down.

791
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,080

792
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,920
No.

793
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,080
This game

794
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,120
hasn’t finished yet.

795
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,480

796
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,680

797
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,960
I want the truth he sees.

798
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,640
Li Qin.

799
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,200
I heard

800
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,840
Pang Ji was shocked

801
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,360
when he saw your token.

802
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,760
I want to know

803
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,760
whether your master is me

804
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,960
or Chef Shen?

805
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
Or

806
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,480
someone else?

807
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,560
My name is Li Qin.

808
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,920
My master

809
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,480
is myself.

810
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,800
Okay.

811
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,640
Well said.

812
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,040
You're brave.

813
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,440
I like it.

814
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,160
Then I'll give you a bowl of Soul Leaving Soup

815
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,360
so that you can forget the past

816
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,240
and work for me.

817
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,320
What do you think?

818
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,920
If I can survive,

819
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,720
I still have a chance to see him.

820
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,760
Father.

821
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,880

823

824
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,160
It's time to let you know

825
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,760
