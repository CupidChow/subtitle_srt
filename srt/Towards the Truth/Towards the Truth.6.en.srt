1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,560
What about Yeon-hwa?

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,240
She fell asleep at midnight.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,360
Wait.

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:27,960
Try it.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,480
Be generous.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,960
Don't let that bad guy

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,560
see our intention at first sight.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,360
Didn't the chef say

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,760
Qin will protect us in secret?

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,920
Where is she?

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Secret protection.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,360
That's...

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,840
You're protecting me in secret, aren't you?

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,040
Wait for me.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,040
This is my specialty.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
[Kyoko, bad goose.]

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,040
Try it.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,240
Is Li and the money bag okay?

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,960
Don't worry.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,480
The money bag is quite messy these days. It's fine. It's fine.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
in the money bag these days.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,600
Let him go out to vent his anger.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,320
Where's Zhan Mao'er?

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,400
Let him out

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,479
Zhan Mao'er.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
The Oiran of Wafang.

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,759
A confidant of Lotus.

28
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,600
Damn you!

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,160
Gongsun has left.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,920
Come out!

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,160
Isn't this the government's dog?

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,400
Come to our beggar alley.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,360
to show off.

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,800
Take advantage of Chef Shen

35
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,360
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,440
We're fighting for Qin.

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,040
We're just asking about something.

38
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,080
Cat Zhan.

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,320
Warrior Zhan.

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,960
When did he come to the beggar alley?

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,600
Do you remember?

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,160
Don't see me off.

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,360
Okay.

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,120
Wait here.

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,720
I'll get someone to teach you a lesson.

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,360
Don't see me off.

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,480
Come again.

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,000
Sir.

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,360
I'll pull out all your hair next time.

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,920
Let's go.

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Don't hit me in the face.

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,640
Forget it.

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,760
I got beaten up.

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
and the money was stolen.

55
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,520
Zhan Mao'er.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,760
You scoundrel!

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,480
I'll teach you a lesson.

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,240
You're fine now.

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,280
You want something to happen to me?

60
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,560
Help me get the rice.

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,160
How dare you!

62
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,280
You've been working hard.

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,120
It's understandable that you're angry.

64
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,040
Come on.

65
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,440
Sit down and talk.

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,280
If you take me as your target,

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,120
I'll put up with it.

68
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,280
But what's wrong with Qin?

69
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,960
He didn't even leave the kitchen.

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,880
Shen Shaodwen,

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,040
You are so cruel.

72
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
Do you know I almost died outside?

73
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
I said you were fine.

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,600
but you're fine.

75
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Just two dishes?

76
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,720
I didn't get anything from the beggar alley.

77
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,880
But I got it from the alley stall.

78
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
Zhan Mao

79
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,040
came to the beggar alley six or seven years ago.

80
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,880
We also got the incense.

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,079
The boss said

82
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,040
Hongyi.

83
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,079
Big Sword.

84
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,480
Chef, it's not wrong this time.

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,440
Now we have witnesses and evidence.

86
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
We just need to ask Peng Hyo-yu for an arrest document.

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,200
No hurry.

88
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,800
You are not.

89
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,640
Zhan Mao'er's next target is not you.

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,400
It's me.

91
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,160
He saved you.

92
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,480
No wonder.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,600
No wonder you asked me to make a scene.

94
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,600
There is no nobleness on the thorns.

95
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,720
But we are not close.

96
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Shen Shaodwen,

97
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,839
You are so loyal.

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,520
Gongsun Li.

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,320
Don't talk when eating or sleeping.

100
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,440
Eat well.

101
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,920
Am I right?

102
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,640
You knew Zhan Mao'er was the murderer,

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
You still want me to make a scene?

104
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,040
You're not using me as your target.

105
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
You used me as a messenger.

106
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,080
You used me to send him letters.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,960
You also asked me and Li

108
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,520
to investigate some trivial things.

109
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,640
It's okay.

110
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,920
I've figured it out.

111
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,360
You want me to buy time, right?

112
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,680
You let Zhan Mao Er know his whereabouts are exposed.

113
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,200
Give him time to escape.

114
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,880
To repay him for saving his life,

115
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,840
Shen Shaodwen,

116
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,200
You even abandoned me.

117
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,640
Don't forget.

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,560
In terms of saving my life,

119
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
I saved you too.

120
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,840
That's why it's true.

121
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,440
Justice and law.

122
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,720
What does it mean to you?

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,360
What am I to you?

124
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,000
You want to keep Zhan Mao'er?

125
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,520
Fine.

126
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,040
I'll go to the government office to find Peng Xiaoyu.

127
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,880
Gongsun Li,

128
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,600
I really don't want to show my cat to the government.

129
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,280
You admit it?

130
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
I don't want him to see the officials.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,080
because of the string pattern

132
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,000
The mandrill case

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,080
and the silver robbery case seven years ago

134
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,640
the same person.

135
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,680
If it was Zhan Mao'er,

136
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,880
If it weren't for him,

137
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,200
it means Peng Xiaoyu wronged the wanderer seven years ago.

138
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
So many lives were killed by Peng Xiaoyu.

139
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,280
Peng Xiaoyu wouldn't dare to reverse the case.

140
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,240
I want you to investigate.

141
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
I really want you to be sure

142
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,360
The mandrill is Zhan Mao

143
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,080
So you're afraid

144
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,960
that Peng Xiaoyu

145
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,840
Peng Hyo-yu will kill the cat.

146
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,640
If so,

147
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,720
the real murderer will be free.

148
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,880
You are still in danger.

149
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,000
So...

150
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,560
I misunderstood you.

151
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,120
You are...

152
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,040
For my own good?

153
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,560
You think too much.

154
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,040
Here.

155
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,200
Let's eat first.

156
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,280
We'll report to the government after dinner.

157
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
No matter how big the world is,

158
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,640
eating is the most important.

159
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,200
You're angry.

160
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,760
to calm down.

161
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,040
Isn't it good?

162
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
Eat more if you like it.

163
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:10,920
Here.

164
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,000
Can you be gentle?

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,920
Okay.

166
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,800
Grandpa Zhan.

167
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,600
The officials have been here.

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,840
They were sent away.

169
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,240
Don't worry.

170
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,000
We won't betray you

171
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,360
The mandrill made the whole city

172
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
in the city

173
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,480
Is he a human or a ghost?

174
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,000
If he is a human,

175
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,640
he's really not a person.

176
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,640
Bastard!

177
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,520
You tortured those two girls.

178
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,720
Alright.

179
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,560
I have something to do later.

180
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,360
Get lost.

181
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,360
Okay.

182
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
Rest early, Grandpa Zhan.

183
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,960
I'm so full.

184
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,920
Do you have tea?

185
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,320
Gongsun Li.

186
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
You're so ugly.

187
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,960
I've lived for 20 years.

188
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,320
No one has ever said I'm ugly.

189
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,000
Take a look if you don't believe me.

190
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,320
What's wrong with my face?

191
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,000
When did it grow?

192
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,159
I don't know

193
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,400
Give me a helmet.

194
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,400
There's no such thing.

195
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,000
Give me your hat.

196
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm not covering my face.

197
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,159
You have a neck too.

198
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,159
It's on the neck too

199
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,799
I can't face anyone.

200
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,840
Look at your body.

201
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,280
Don't go.

202
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,560
We have to find Peng Hyo-ok.

203
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,760
Go by yourselves.

204
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,360
Is the money bag okay?

205
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,560
But I'm going to make him

206
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,960
to trigger the wind.

207
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,640
He cherishes his looks.

208
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,520
he wouldn't dare to go out.

209
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
He just scolded you.

210
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,360
You're so mean.

211
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,120
I told you

212
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,080
the next target of the mandrill is probably him

213
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,320
Can we really let him run around

214
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,960
How many eyes do I have

215
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,800
to take care of him.

216
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,240
You know that?

217
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,400
Just leave him

218
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,960
with me on the street.

219
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,560
What?

220
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
Did I offend you too?

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,520
The murderer killed people around Lotus

222
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,600
just to frame him.

223
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,480
As long as he doesn't touch the lotus,

224
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,080
the murderer can't frame Lotus with his death.

225
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,040
If he cares about it, it will be chaotic.

226
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,080
He didn't see this level.

227
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,000
So you asked him to investigate the case with me

228
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
to make him unable to

229
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,560
so he can't go to the vase.

230
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,640
Not only that,

231
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,080
I want to starve the murderer.

232
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,440
Starve the murderer?

233
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,640
Three days after Hongyun and Ziyan went missing,

234
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,160
after they went missing.

235
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
On the night when her body was found,

236
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
the body of Hongyun appeared.

237
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,880
So we can infer that

238
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,160
the murderer committed another crime

239
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,120
after seven years.

240
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,840
It's as if a long drought brings joy.

241
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,040
Once you see blood,

242
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,600
it becomes more and more unstoppable.

243
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,440
The more he wants to hurt Gongsun Li,

244
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,920
the more we want him to leave.

245
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,480
to show up.

246
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,840
But he had no chance to do it.

247
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,880
The murderer

248
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,600
must be starving.

249
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,960
A person who is starving

250
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,440
give him a good meal.

251
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,120
Guess what he will do.

252
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,120
He's going to kill himself.

253
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,800
What I want

254
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,120
is that he risked his life

255
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,320
to lure the snake out of its hole.

256
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
So you still don't believe

257
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,680
Zhan Mao is a mandrill

258
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
The lotus

259
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,560
made me understand

260
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
there are two skin in front and back.

261
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,000
Whether it's good or evil,

262
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,080
you may not be able to read one or two sides.

263
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,800
As for us,

264
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,160
set the cage to catch snakes first.

265
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,840
Whether it's true or not,

266
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,160
we'll know when the snake comes out.

267
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,520
But there must be a bait to lure the snake out of the hole.

268
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Could it be...

269
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm sure she'll cooperate with me. I'm sure she won't.

270
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,640
she will cooperate.

271
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,720
If I knew there was such a beauty in the world,

272
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,040
we wouldn't have to break the trap again.

273
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,920
Lotus,

274
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
Thank you for taking the risk.

275
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,720
Now you know what to say.

276
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,640
You didn't come up with the idea.

277
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,560
Forget it.

278
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,240
A worthless body.

279
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,760
If we can catch the murderer,

280
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,040
if we can catch the murderer.

281
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,840
Why haven't you recovered yet?

282
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,600
It's just the wind.

283
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,560
Li,

284
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
Don't worry.

285
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,320
Father.

286
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,840
Father.

287
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,320
Don't you think I'm ugly?

288
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,600
Is he your biological father?

289
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,080
Didn't I ask you to send it to them?

290
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,600
The kitchen is empty.

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
I brought the medicine back.

292
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,240
No one is here.

293
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,600
They must be chasing Zhan Mao'er.

294
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,080
Unfortunately, I can't help.

295
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,200
Did you post the poster all over the street?

296
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,040
No.

297
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,920
The street is peaceful.

298
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,560
Just two dishes?

299
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,280
You're angry.

300
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,680
Here.

301
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,640
Calm down.

302
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,080
That dish

303
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,080
the dish.

304
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,960
They don’t want me to report to the government.

305
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,640
Shen Song.

306
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,120
I hate you.

307
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,920
You did this

308
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,080
to prevent me from reporting to the government.

309
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,720
I must report this official.

310
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,240
Hello?

311
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,200
You're dismissed so early.

312
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,520
It's not dismissed.

313
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,560
I went to watch the fun.

314
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
Miss,

315
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,920
have we met before?

316
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,280
What happened

317
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,880
with your face?

318
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,080
Don't scare her.

319
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,920
I'm fine.

320
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
A good man is not afraid of ugly looks.

321
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,000
I told you.

322
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,560
I'm not ugly.

323
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,560
It doesn't matter.

324
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,800
There are always handsome heroes.

325
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,920
Pretty doesn't necessarily mean anything good.

326
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,960
Don't give up.

327
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,760
I told you.

328
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,840
Forget it.

329
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,640
Fine.

330
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,320
You just said

331
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,000
everyone in the government went to watch the fun.

332
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,200
What fun?

333
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
I went to the tile.

334
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,200
Vase?

335
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,320
Don't you know?

336
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Rumor has it that

337
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,360
The Oiran will perform tonight.

338
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,560
I won't accept any money.

339
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,680
This chef

340
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,960
is crazy.

341
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,040
I heard that lotus girl is beautiful.

342
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,400
What do you want to complain about?

343
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,240
Why don't you put it aside

344
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,440
Let's pick up a loophole together.

345
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,960
It was leaked. Slow down.

346
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,120
Let me tell you.

347
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,040
There are many people here.

348
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,720
If you cause trouble later,

349
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,480
I won't be able to take care of you.

350
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,720
Okay, okay.

351
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,160
You should be careful too.

352
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,240
Let's see what we can do.

353
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,880
Are you listening to me?

354
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,000
Stay here.

355
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,520
I'll be right back. Don't move.

356
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,560
Men are so troublesome.

357
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
This guy is so strange

358
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,320
Chef.

359
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,840
You use lotus as bait.

360
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,440
I can protect her.

361
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,640
She also agrees.

362
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,080
Yeon-hwa is my friend.

363
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,600
Let me tell you about her past.

364
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,880
not to be used by you.

365
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:08,960
Let's go.

366
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,840
Hongyun, Ziyan.

367
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,920
I'll avenge you.

368
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,520
Oh no.

369
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,240
Qin.

370
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,400
Qin.

371
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,520
We've known each other.

372
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,040
You hurt me too.

373
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,280
Qin, you can't catch me.

374
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,560
I told you, I don't trust the officials.

375
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,200
I didn't expect it was Zhan Mao'er.

376
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,520
I told you it was him.

377
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,560
but you didn't believe me.

378
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,800
I know you have a personal relationship.

379
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,920
But in life,

380
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,240
it's inevitable to misjudge people.

381
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,640
But now that the truth is revealed,

382
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,000
we can just take him down.

383
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,520
Qin can't win

384
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,040
to win against him.

385
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,880
Since he's not wronged,

386
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,120
let's ask Peng to arrest him tomorrow.

387
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,240
No matter who the monster is,

388
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,840
we must do our best to get rid of the evil.

389
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,600
The monster must die.

390
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,760
Yeon-hwa.

391
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,760
It's worth risking your life.

392
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,320
The chef finally found the murderer.

393
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,560
Hongyun and Ziyan.

394
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,120
can finally rest in peace.

395
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,480
The thing you worshiped just now was strange.

396
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,400
I've never seen it before.

397
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,480
It's my tradition to worship Lord Stone.

398
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,600
Bow to them when they have hope.

399
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,200
for peace of mind.

400
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,480
Who?

401
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,720
You've worked hard too.

402
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,400
Rest early.

403
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,960
You said people have two skin.

404
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,760
good or evil.

405
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,120
he may not be able to read one or two sides.

406
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,120
We treated Zhan Mao'er as a good man.

407
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,320
But he fell into the trap and refused to arrest.

408
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,120
Is it good or evil?

409
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,880
Did you read it?

410
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,720
Chef.

411
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,080
Let me ask you.

412
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,720
If he is one of good and evil,

413
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,240
all on the skin,

414
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,360
what should we do?

415
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Evil prevails justice.

416
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,640
Become evil with kindness.

417
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,840
Someone from the government came just now.

418
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,080
Why isn't Li here?

419
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,440
I thought

420
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,600
if it wasn't Zhan Mao'er,

421
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,360
we found the yard earlier.

422
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,240
there might be a change.

423
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,560
I asked him to keep watch.

424
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,960
Who are you?

425
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,840
What a good kung fu!

426
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,080
Help me.

427
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,440
Don't worry.

428
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,920
With my iron ruler,

429
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,280
no one can touch you.

430
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,480
Where is he?

431
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Where is she?

432
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,120
Miss,

433
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,080
I’m Lord Li, the official of the government office.

434
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,480
I was ordered by the chef

435
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
to investigate the case.

436
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,960
the chef.

437
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
Bring me to your lord.

438
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,720
What a coincidence.

439
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,320
We can't stay here for long.

440
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,280
Let's go.

441
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,360
Come in.

442
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,040
Thank you.

443
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,560
You came back empty-handed

444
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,160
I brought a new friend.

445
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,960
What are you doing here?

446
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,680
A thief.

447
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,920
You're here too.

448
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,160
How many times have I told you?

449
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,120
I'm not a robber.

450
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,720
I'm with this chef.

451
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,560
I went to see you at the vase.

452
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,320
I couldn't find you. I'm sorry.

453
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,920
You know each other?

454
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,160
More than that.

455
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,480
Miss Heroine,

456
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,040
I gave up my poverty

457
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,840
Only light tea

458
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,120
Good tea.

459
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,360
You only know good tea without drinking it.

460
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
It's obvious

461
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,080
Where did you get the dragon ball

462
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,680
The good tea in the kitchen will cost money

463
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,840
What are you mumbling about

464
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,160
What tea?

465
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,440
Let me introduce.

466
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,640
This is

467
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,080
is also an expert in searching.

468
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,880
We met once.

469
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,760
I just don't know

470
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,240
Just call me Rong Hua.

471
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,520
Nice name.

472
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,800
She's pretty too.

473
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,240
I feel like we've met somewhere before.

474
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,360
Are you the chef?

475
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,320
Shen Shaodwen?

476
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:18,960
Yes.

477
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,040
It's your plan to lure the snake out of the hole.

478
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,280
It's risky,

479
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,800
we managed to lure out the real culprit.

480
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,720
Wrong.

481
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,400
You have no idea.

482
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,400
Zhan Mao'er was indeed lured out.

483
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,120
You did lure out the swordsman in red

484
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,640
But the mandrill

485
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,040
Not him

486
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,920
Not him.

487
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,120
I found a suspicious man

488
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,440
I found a suspicious person.

489
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,080
who followed him all the way.

490
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,560
When I fought him,

491
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,640
I saw his eyes.

492
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,240
No pupils.

493
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,920
No pupils.

494
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,760
There's another strange thing.

495
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,920
His joint twist

496
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,080
is different from ordinary people.

497
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,360
If I don't meet him in person,

498
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,040
I won't believe it.

499
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,280
In the world

500
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,840
in the world

501
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,600
You must be mistaken

502
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,480
You don't believe that I picked this loophole?

503
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,640
Yes.

504
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,000
Why don't you stay and guard?

505
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,000
I can't defeat him.

506
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,000
If it weren't for you,

507
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,600
we would have let the monster go wrongly.

508
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,560
We wronged someone.

509
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,280
Then, Imperial Envoy,

510
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,520
how will you thank me?

511
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,960
I have nothing.

512
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,240
The Imperial Envoy won't just thank me

513
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,280
for nothing?

514
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,840
If you ask for more,

515
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,600
I won't accept it.

516
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,680
Even if

517
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,240
even if you sell them all,

518
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,520
I don't care.

519
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,440
Actually,

520
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,360
I don't want much.

521
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,280
If you have anything new,

522
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,400
take me with you.

523
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,400
No problem.

524
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,320
You should have told me earlier.

525
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,400
I'd love to.

526
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,840
You can't be alone at night.

527
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,360
and make her family worry.

528
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,520
It's okay. I'll see her off.

529
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,320
Li.

530
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,120
Let's go to the yard now.

531
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,760
Go ahead.

532
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,840
Ask Miss Rong Hua.

533
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,600
Send her home.

534
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,360
You're a girl.

535
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,200
I hate people who break the bridge after crossing the river.

536
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,480
What a pity.

537
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,440
What are you looking at?

538
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,040
Wait for me.

539
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,960
You mean he disappeared here?

540
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,160
We saw it for real.

541
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,040
That person

542
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,600
suddenly disappeared.

543
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,920
Is that really a monster?

544
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,080
I checked.

545
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,360
I couldn't find any trace.

546
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,720
The smell of blood is strong.

547
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Is someone dead again?

548
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,880
Maybe the boy guarding the yard

549
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,880
You found his lair.

550
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,680
he won't let him go.

551
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,160
Don't worry.

552
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,440
I, Gongsun Li, will protect you.

553
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,920
You will be fine.

554
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,840
Gongsun Li.

555
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,920
Imperial Secretariat's Residence?

556
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,720
That's right.

557
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,200
I am the son of Minister of Revenue.

558
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,120
Gongsun Li.

559
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,720
Are you Gongsun Li?

560
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,000
I've heard a lot about you.

561
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Miss,

562
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,400
Have you heard of me?

563
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,120
More than that.

564
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
He's a playboy.

565
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,120
He has a sharp tongue.

566
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,440
There are empty bricks.

567
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,520
Are you looking for traces

568
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,480
when opening the secret door.

569
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,200
Smart.

570
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,160
Come here.
