1
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,119
Look at him.

2
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,520
Stop it.

3
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,560
What are you doing?

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,760
The three rats resent each other.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,720
and blood flows in the afternoon.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,840
Are you...

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,720
to find the third victim in advance?

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,200
the third victim

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,520
to stop the Yamen Office.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,280
Today is the day of Ding Si.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,280
Gengwu.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
In three days,

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,960
in three days.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,200
Hatred doll?

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,040
Is it about marriage?

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,800
It seems so.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,120
In other words,

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,760
among the newlyweds of Gengwu,

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,480
will be the third target

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,560
the third target.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,960
Check it out first.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,960
how many marriages

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
How many marriages are there?

24
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,200
to copy their posts.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,240
That's easy.

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,280
The bride will hand the marriage letter

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,600
before getting married.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,400
Let's go to the case vault.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,240
The wedding letter

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,800
will be returned

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,800
It's all in the gear.

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,160
Just disperse in these shelves.

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,240
Let's split up.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,120
Lord Peng.

35
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,560
Don't idle around.

36
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,759
It's fine if we find it.

37
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,600
If we can't,

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
I'm afraid none of them can get married.

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,360
Why?

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,320
The third song is made of grievance.

41
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,400
If we don't get married, we can't be enemies.

42
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,039
As long as we delay the day of Gengwu,

43
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,960
you'll be fine.

44
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,160
You don't know.

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,120
This Geng afternoon

46
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,840
is Dayi's wedding.

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
Many couples

48
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,520
will get married at this time.

49
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
for good luck.

50
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,520
and live happily ever after.

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,280
The next auspicious day

52
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,520
for half a year.

53
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,400
Half a year late is better than losing your life.

54
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,720
You're all single.

55
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,240
can afford it.

56
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Do you know that every moment of the night is precious?

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
If the Yin Department gets it,

58
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,440
we'll be humiliated.

59
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,320
That's easy for you to say.

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,520
Do you want me

61
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,640
to make a scene in the wedding hall?

62
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,800
It's not difficult.

63
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,560
Let me teach you a way.

64
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,440
You're immoral.

65
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,640
The weather was abnormal the day before yesterday.

66
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
Hong Luan made the moon rise.

67
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
The main marriage is unlucky.

68
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,840
I have an extraordinary man to look around.

69
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,640
It should be on the day of Gengwu.

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
a bloodshed disaster.

71
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
It's an ominous sign.

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,160
So anyone who gets married

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,760
the wedding date

74
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,520
must discuss the wedding date again.

75
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,160
Don't be successful.

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,520
This is...

77
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,400
What?

78
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,720
This is...

79
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,680
Hong Luan is making the moon.

80
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,440
Why haven't I heard of it?

81
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,840
Don't ignore it.

82
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,800
It's none of your business.

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
It's just Peng.

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,040
The people in the capital

85
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,600
is more powerful than the stick.

86
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
In the afternoon of Geng,

87
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,640
there are 68 new couples in the city.

88
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,600
136 in total.

89
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,120
None of them

90
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
are all officials.

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
He's so innocent that he can't be cleared anymore.

92
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,320
No one has ever stolen chicken and duck.

93
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,800
Even his hands

94
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
are dirty.

95
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,040
But Yeomra punished

96
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,560
criminals.

97
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,200
These people are so innocent.

98
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,400
can we really find the third rat?

99
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,760
If the target wasn't them,

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,560
I can't think of

101
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,840
I can't think of anything else.

102
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,560
If Peng Xiaoyu

103
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,360
manage the wedding of Gengwu,

104
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,360
I don't think the Yin Bureau

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,440
to be punished.

106
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
This move

107
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,360
was made by Chef Shen,

108
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
but it was done by you.

109
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,680
It shows that the people are looking forward to it.

110
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,720
If this goes on,

111
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,520
when I become an official,

112
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,440
I'll have to

113
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,280
get an umbrella from the capital.

114
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,720
and return home in glory,

115
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,200
will be known as a virtuous person.

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
Of course.

117
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,840
Don't go.

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,880
Next month.

119
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,800
I'll pay you back next month.

120
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,200
No, I have to return the money today.

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,920
Refund!

122
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,480
I'll pay you back.

123
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,800
If not, I won't get the refund.

124
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:20,920
Refund!

125
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,240
No.

126
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,400
You're being disrespectful in public.

127
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,920
Go!

128
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,640
All right.

129
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't fight.

130
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,760
Let go.

131
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,160
There's gunpowder in the box.

132
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,360
The magistrate is here.

133
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,040
If there's any trouble,

134
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,080
if there is any trouble.

135
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,880
Understand?

136
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,040
Mind your own business.

137
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,720
Refund!

138
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,560
You scoundrel!

139
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,040
Do you have any respect for me?

140
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,040
Take him back.

141
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,400
Guess what?

142
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,880
Peng doesn't care about the case.

143
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,040
I don't care about it.

144
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,200
At this moment,

145
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
he'll do everything himself.

146
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,120
That's right.

147
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,400
Peng doesn't care about Peng.

148
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,720
He's the only one

149
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,640
only he can do it.

150
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,440
Chinese viburnum puppet play.

151
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,720
You're bullying guests.

152
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,320
If Mr Su didn't

153
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,280
hurt his hand last year,

154
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,480
Who cares to find him?

155
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Our Wang family's money

156
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
isn't from the wind.

157
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,320
How can it be blown away by the wind?

158
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Sir,

159
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,680
My lord also said

160
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,560
we shouldn't withdraw legally.

161
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,360
Besides,

162
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,040
I really can't afford it.

163
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,240
It's just five taels.

164
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,640
You...

165
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
Not to mention five taels,

166
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,600
even five coins.

167
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Chef.

168
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,520
The law clearly states that

169
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,960
A deal.

170
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,480
Anyone who pays a certain amount

171
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,840
If it wasn't the seller's fault,

172
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,920
and the business failed,

173
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
It's not appropriate to return the deposit.

174
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,360
The law is the law.

175
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,400
A favor is a favor.

176
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,720
The wedding is cancelled.

177
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,040
Our wedding business

178
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,880
in Fengle Pavilion.

179
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
But we returned the money

180
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,960
for the wedding.

181
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,480
Yes.

182
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,960
That's how business should be.

183
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
I remember.

184
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
you're from the Wang family's brewing house, right?

185
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,560
Yes, my lord.

186
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,480
The wine in Feng Le Restaurant

187
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,040
are provided by our family.

188
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,520
We know each other well.

189
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,320
The kitchen of Fengle Restaurant

190
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,920
at Feng Le Restaurant last month.

191
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,400
for the wedding.

192
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,440
If we can't make the wedding,

193
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,880
we have to return the wine order.

194
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,440
I just calculated

195
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,120
The deposit is about 80 taels and 15 coins.

196
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,800
Go back and talk to your master.

197
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,760
We'll get it later.

198
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,360
How can this be?

199
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,680
According to the law,

200
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,760
a contract deal

201
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,920
Those who pay a certain amount

202
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,240
If it wasn't the seller's fault,

203
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,280
and the business failed,

204
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,640
It's not appropriate to return the deposit.

205
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,280
But as you said,

206
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,280
this is how business should be.

207
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,040
I...

208
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,080
What did I say?

209
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
You won't get a refund if you pay the deposit.

210
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,560
Are you still going to sue me?

211
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,640
No.

212
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,800
If there's nothing else,

213
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,560
You may leave.

214
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,080
Yes.

215
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,840
I'll take my leave.

216
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,880
Lord Peng.

217
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,560
You're the one who should be the defense.

218
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,120
Thank you.

219
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,600
Mr. Zhang.

220
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,960
You did nothing wrong.

221
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,040
Please leave.

222
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
Wait

223
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,080
Mr. Zhang.

224
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,760
I was listening outside

225
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,440
you are the only one

226
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,480
in the city.

227
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,120
for one show.

228
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,640
Five taels only for the money.

229
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,600
Even if you change clothes,

230
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,760
you won't be unable to pay five taels of silver.

231
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
The deposit...

232
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,520
next month.

233
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,600
next month.

234
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,600
It's just that as long as it takes.

235
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,600
Just wait for the Wang family to forget about it.

236
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,880
I shouldn't have returned it.

237
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
After hearing your name,

238
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I feel familiar.

239
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,160
I just remembered

240
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,800
I saw a complaint.

241
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,040
A woman named Su sued Zhang Qi

242
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,920
hurt her father Su Jin’s hand.

243
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,480
Zhang Qi and Su Jin were master and disciple.

244
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,360
Chinese viburnum costume is a skill.

245
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,560
If you hurt your hand,

246
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,120
there’s no one to eat.

247
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,600
Su Jin lost her way.

248
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,159
The business in the capital

249
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
fell into the hands of my disciple Zhang Qi.

250
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,400
Miss Su has no evidence.

251
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,080
That's why the case wasn't prosecuted.

252
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,360
When I saw you act,

253
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,680
I realized

254
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,440
I went the wrong way.

255
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,040
This grievance doll...

256
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,360
is not about marriage.

257
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,040
but your viburnum doll.

258
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,760
I used the trick

259
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,040
I went to the Yin Temple to offer fruits.

260
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,720
Did you eat well there?

261
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,080
Don't mention it.

262
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,640
There are a lot of fruits.

263
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,160
But this temple

264
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,080
is very evil.

265
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,280
I ran into a ghost.

266
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,240
Tell me.

267
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,120
What happened?

268
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
Have you heard of

269
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,440
the songs of the five rats?

270
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,200
The Yin Bureau is in the Yin Temple.

271
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,040
The case

272
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,320
is the case of these five rats.

273
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,480
As long as the victim goes to the temple to curse,

274
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,160
can't escape.

275
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,440
Do you know

276
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,840
what the third case is?

277
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,080
What is it?

278
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,080
Hatred.

279
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,799
Ji...

280
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,840
Okay. Okay.

281
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,159
Next,

282
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,919
you don't know which living person

283
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,039
to fry it.

284
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,280
Who is it?

285
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,520
Get out of my way.

286
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
You must be Su.

287
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,720
The Imperial Envoy is here.

288
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
I was wrong.

289
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,080
Hate Ji-sung.

290
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
I hate Ji-sung.

291
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Be careful.

292
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,600
There's no fire.

293
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,280
It's okay.

294
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,560
The Chinese viburnum puppet play.

295
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
to trigger the doll with gunpowder.

296
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,480
I read the file.

297
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,440
Mr Su has been taking gunpowder for Mr Su.

298
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,640
Why did something suddenly happen a year ago?

299
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,800
The gunpowder is ruthless.

300
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,280
The Chinese viburnum puppet play

301
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,320
is rare.

302
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,680
If Master Su's hand injury

303
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,640
Master Su's hand injury

304
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
on me.

305
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,240
It's not fair.

306
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,240
Music killings kill people.

307
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,320
If you don't admit your mistake,

308
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
I'm afraid you'll regret it in the future.

309
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm not guilty even if I say it ten thousand times.

310
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,800
Master Su's hand injury

311
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,440
is his fate.

312
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,680
It's too late

313
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,200
It's too late to admit it.

314
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,640
Zhang Qi.

315
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,840
In front of your master,

316
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,800
in front of your master?

317
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
Zhang Qi.

318
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,760
At this time,

319
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,040
You still don't admit it?

320
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,680
The night before the performance,

321
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,880
the master said we should wait.

322
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,320
But later,

323
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,880
I got the bomb point.

324
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,160
Look at Master.

325
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,040
Mr Su.

326
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,840
Have you been to the Yin Temple?

327
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,720
I did go there when I was angry.

328
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,560
This lady said

329
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,200
in the Yin Temple.

330
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,800
the King of Hell will be interrogated.

331
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,120
Others may not know what you did.

332
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,320
The King of Hell is watching.

333
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
Who can you hide it from?

334
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,520
Actually,

335
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,080
I don't blame you anymore.

336
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,240
If it's because...

337
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,520
I went to the Yin Bureau,

338
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,680
you lost your life.

339
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,800
I can't bear it.

340
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,360
Kid,

341
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
Look back.

342
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,520
Master.

343
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,040
I was wrong.

344
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,600
Good child, get up.

345
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,200
It's good that you know your mistake.

346
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,680
The adults are trying to save you.

347
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,760
Don't worry. After today,

348
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,560
this matter

349
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,560
tell anyone about this.

350
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,760
I didn't expect Mr Su

351
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,200
is so generous.

352
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,560
He's a responsible man.

353
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,160
This man is stubborn and cruel.

354
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,640
Even teachers who have been educated for years are willing to do it.

355
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,720
I'm afraid Mr Su

356
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,360
he won't let Mr Su go.

357
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,840
He was just afraid of the Yin Bureau

358
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,160
because I was afraid of the Yamen.

359
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,280
After today,

360
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,760
after today.

361
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,920
Princess.

362
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,520
Why don't I send someone to see you off?

363
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,600
and go back to rest?

364
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,360
He's right.

365
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
It's not safe tonight.

366
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
If you don't go back,

367
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440
His Highness will be worried.

368
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,680
I can't go back to the mansion.

369
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,320
If my father finds out,

370
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,200
I'll be sent to the nunnery immediately.

371
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,520
Besides,

372
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,080
both of you don't know martial arts.

373
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,280
Can I be absent?

374
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,320
Anyway, two hours later,

375
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,480
today will be over.

376
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,520
Maybe Yeomra

377
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,240
wants us to be crowded,

378
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
I dare not come.

379
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
You're right.

380
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
I've transferred

381
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,720
in Gongsun Mansion.

382
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,120
I don't think anything will happen.

383
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,200
Not necessarily.

384
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,080
The Yin Bureau has been planning for a long time.

385
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,600
He must be well prepared.

386
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,920
and is determined to win.

387
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,200
The next round of prey

388
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,040
They won't give up so easily.

389
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,200
Who is it?

390
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,960
Let's go upstairs.

391
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,440
Yes.

392
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,800
What's going on?

393
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,400
You guys, follow me.

394
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,280
Go over there.

395
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:30,800
Hurry!

396
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,880
What's wrong?

397
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,520
Nothing.

398
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,760
It's a stray cat.

399
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,160
A cat.

400
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,240
This isn't a cat, is it?

401
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm guilty.

402
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,360
Zhang.

403
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,920
Zhang Qi.

404
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,800
Watch out.

405
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm guilty.

406
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,240
Criminal Zhang Qi.

407
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,080
deceiving his master and destroying his ancestors.

408
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,880
I wanted to kill my teacher.

409
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,760
Go get the fire memo over there.

410
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,440
Although he never took his life,

411
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,440
but took away his skills.

412
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,760
When we meet again,

413
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,800
I still have evil intentions.

414
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,880
to kill him in the future.

415
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
and never repent.

416
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,360
I'll be tortured by a doll.

417
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,280
What's wrong?

418
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,600
Zhang Qi.

419
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,200
I...

420
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,400
will be punished.

421
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,280
Yeomra, please sentence me to death.

422
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,720
I'm guilty.

423
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,680
I'm guilty.

424
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,360
I'm guilty.

425
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,960
Zhang Qi.

426
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,760
Wake up.

427
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,720
I'm guilty.

428
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,760
I'm guilty.

429
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,160
Zhang Qi.

430
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,080
He's really dead.

431
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,920
Really dead.

432
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,560
Shen Song.

433
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,560
Well,

434
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,800
How did Zhang Qi

435
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,040
How did he die?

436
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,840
It hasn't been identified yet.

437
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,280
The rumor has already spread.

438
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,520
that the Yin Bureau

439
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,560
in the Yin Bureau.

440
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,120
Shen Song,

441
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,360
failed to protect Zhang Qi.

442
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,760
Look at Zhang Qi.

443
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,640
He deserves to die.

444
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,760
But now his death

445
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,040
has affected us.

446
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,960
People say

447
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
we're trying to clear his name.

448
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,200
So,

449
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,640
the fourth mouse

450
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,040
can't be taken away by them.

451
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,080
The fourth mouse.

452
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
Four rats are lustful.

453
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,160
[They practiced for nothing.]

454
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,680
One day

455
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,560
Then...

456
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,840
Isn't that today?

457
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,360
A woman

458
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
someone will come to sue you.

459
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,200
You didn't do anything again, did you?

460
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,960
Let me tell you.

461
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,800
There really is one person.

462
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,200
But I didn't let him go.

463
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,520
He is now in the prison.

464
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,240
He's right next to the one from Pang family.

465
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
Mr. Pang, have a bite.

466
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,360
The meat is too fat today.

467
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,040
Next time.

468
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,120
Peng.

469
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,560
My father's money is ready.

470
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,520
I want you to let me out.

471
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,600
But...

472
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,040
Don't talk nonsense.

473
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Speaking of saving you,

474
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,160
the Imperial Envoy

475
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,760
is here to save you.

476
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,040
He's living such a comfortable life in prison.

477
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,560
You don't know who his father is.

478
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,560
Lord Lu of the Ministry of Justice.

479
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,560
Awesome.

480
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,680
Yo.

481
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,600
Mr. Gongsun is here too.

482
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,400
I thought

483
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,480
I thought you were just like me.

484
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,960
I didn't expect

485
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
you're a dirty cook.

486
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,720
with a dirty chef.

487
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
Mr. Lu,

488
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,480
How can I compare with you?

489
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,720
It's been three days.

490
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,160
You've already eaten the food from the government.

491
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,600
Impressive.

492
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,960
It's just a few days here.

493
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,360
Peng Xiaoyu.

494
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,440
Did you really

495
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,720
just because

496
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,440
and you dare to behead me?

497
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Behave yourself!

498
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
You bastard!

499
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,720
Lord Peng.

500
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,480
The hell song said

501
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,640
that Mr. Lu would die today.

502
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,440
I'm afraid

503
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,720
the trap to kill him is in the dungeon.

504
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,720
If my father knows you treat me like this...

505
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,600
Be gentle.

506
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,600
Don't move.

507
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,160
Grandpa is helping you.

508
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,040
Zhang Qi killed himself by breaking the wall.

509
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,720
I have to prevent you from biting your tongue.

510
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,120
The soap team is here.

511
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,040
I'm keeping watch.

512
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,160
It's up to you.

513
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,600
to guard the prison

514
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,640
in the imperial prison.

515
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,480
Now our government

516
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,040
is like an iron bucket.

517
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,560
like that iron bucket.

518
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,119
But I feel something is wrong.

519
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,319
Don't worry.

520
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,800
The list has been published.

521
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,079
The people in the capital

522
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,599
are watching.

523
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,520
As long as he doesn't die today,

524
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,280
What hell?

525
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,400
or the Yin Bureau,

526
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,680
have no shame.

527
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,720
Fight for the market with Peng.

528
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,680
Bah!

529
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,400
My lord, I've been up all night

530
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,240
to stop the Yin Bureau from killing people.

531
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,160
The Yin office was like a chicken and a dog overnight.

532
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,480
They dare not fight.

533
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,480
Dismiss.

534
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,600
Wait.

535
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,560
Officer Shen,

536
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,080
it's really peaceful outside.

537
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,320
Nothing happened overnight.

538
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,840
Hey.

539
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,200
Don't worry too much.

540
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,920
I think those people are scared.

541
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,040
In the future,

542
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,240
no one in the capital will believe them.

543
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,920
My lord.

544
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,960
My Lord!

545
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,800
Sir

546
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,520
What's the matter?

547
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,760
I'm working today.

548
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,120
I found my colleagues in the prison

549
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,240
were all drugged.

550
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,200
Pang Yu...

551
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,800
What's wrong with Pang Yu?

552
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,720
No.

553
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,360
It's gone.

554
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,320
I fell for it.

555
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,560
The lock is intact.

556
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,040
It's opened with a key.

557
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,680
Chef

558
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,760
Chef

559
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,320
Chef, what's wrong?

560
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,680
Officer Shen.

561
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,960
We failed to guard the place.

562
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,800
and let the criminal escape.

563
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Please punish me.

564
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,720
Please punish me.

565
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,360
It's not your fault.

566
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,800
Not you.

567
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,640
It's my fault.

568
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,440
is me.

569
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,600
You can't say that.

570
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,800
They used that song as bait.

571
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,920
I just bite them.

572
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,760
and be led by them.

573
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,680
To save that bastard Lu,

574
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,560
I lost my duty

575
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,920
I lost my duty in the imperial prison.

576
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,440
and Pang Yu.

577
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,480
I'm too arrogant, Gongsun Li.

578
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,520
Chef, you didn't.

579
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,680
Do you think I deserve to die?

580
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,280
No.

581
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,520
Do you think I deserve to die?

582
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,120
Chef.

583
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,200
I deserve to die.

584
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,840
Chef

585
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,760
Look at my cook

586
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,280
I deserve to die.

587
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,960
Gongsun Li.

588
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,280
Gongsun Li.

589
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,480
Gongsun Li.

590
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,160
Are you okay?

591
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,400
Chef.

592
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,200
Your heavy pupils seem to be getting stronger.

593
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,240
Your strength

594
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,400
seems to have invaded your mind.

595
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,600
You can't use it anymore.

596
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,040
I'm sorry.

597
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,480
Pang Yu took off the hook.

598
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,320
The most likely thing is the Pang family.

599
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,480
Search the mansion.

600
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,560
Yes.

601
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,320
How dare you!

602
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,400
What do you think this is?

603
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,680
How could I not know?

604
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,680
This is the Imperial Preceptor's residence

605
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,600
hidden prisoners.

606
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,360
Zhan Mao'er.

607
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,440
Officer Shen.

608
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,040
Please.

609
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,600
Officer Shen,

610
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,360
Think carefully.

611
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
If you can't find Yu'er

612
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,200
in my mansion,

613
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,440
I will seek justice

614
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,720
and Mother.

615
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,320
As you wish.

616
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,920
Have you checked everywhere?

617
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,960
Sorry to bother you.

618
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,760
Lord Shen wronged me this time.

619
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,960
Are you leaving now?

620
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,040
I was wrong.

621
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,680
Please forgive me.

622
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,920
Shen Song.

623
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,480
Wait for me.

624
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,840
Let me finish.

625
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,040
Who are you to apologize to him?

626
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,080
What kind of person are you?

627
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,160
You bow to him.

628
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,960
What kind of person am I?

629
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I was wrong.

630
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,680
Not necessarily.

631
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,960
The Pang family has many properties.

632
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,640
What if

633
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,520
he's somewhere.

634
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,840
Pang Ji doesn't know.

635
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,640
How do you know?

636
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,600
When we first came here,

637
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
I found that there were few servants in the Pang family.

638
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,760
In the main hall,

639
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,520
I found that the incense burner

640
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,560
is the smell of the incense burner.

641
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,600
It shows that no one has changed it.

642
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,840
The tea is cold too.

643
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,960
If the Pang family doesn't change,

644
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,840
how could the servants be so indifferent?

645
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,880
It shows that the Pang family

646
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
went out to look for Pang Yu.

647
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,280
That's even worse.

648
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,520
If he's not in the Pang Mansion,

649
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,960
it's likely that

650
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,480
in the Yin Bureau.

651
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,320
Pang Yu committed many crimes.

652
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,840
It's not a shame

653
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,920
in the Yin Bureau.

654
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,200
But if that's the case,

655
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Pang Ji

656
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,520
will be like a mad dog

657
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,480
like a crazy dog.

658
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,600
So we can only find

659
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,200
Even if it's a haystack, we have to find it.

660
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,920
No.

661
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,600
Have you seen this person?

662
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,840
Have you seen this person?

663
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,120
No.

664
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,080
Let's go.

665
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,880
Have you seen this person?

666
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,760
Take a good look.

667
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,440
Have you seen it?

668
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,760
Have you?

669
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,680
No.

670
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,320
Have you seen him this tall?

671
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,320
Find out if you've seen him.

672
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,200
Did you find him?

673
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,280
No.

674
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,360
Let's go.

675
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,280
Yes.

676
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,120
Chef.

677
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,720
I found it.

678
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Have some.

679
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,480
Don't be too busy.

680
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,800
It's not worth it.

681
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,720
Chef.

682
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,680
Here.

683
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,760
Have some first.

684
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Have some.

685
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,320
Have some.

686
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,840
Gongsun Li.

687
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,800
This night,

688
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,680
I was afraid

689
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,800
I was afraid

690
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,280
to find the body of Pang Yu hanging the beam.

691
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,400
I'm more afraid.

692
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,760
I'm even more afraid that it didn't respond to the song.

693
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,960
If Pang Yu was killed,

694
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,840
That's true.

695
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,360
the hell song of the Yin Department.

696
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,440
If he's gone,

697
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,240
it will be a complete fraud.

698
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,920
Music killing

699
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,040
is a fraud.

700
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,480
They didn't want to show off at first.

701
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
At first,

702
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,720
was to take Pang Yu away.

703
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,880
They used three cases

704
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,040
and three lives.

705
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,280
made us unconsciously

706
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,480
believe this song.

707
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,080
Finally, he lured us away.

708
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,840
and let us loosen the prison.

709
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,320
so that they can take Pang Yu away.

710
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,920
We suspect the Minister

711
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,520
wasted time again.

712
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,320
Gongsun is far away from me.

713
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,280
and conceited and smart.

714
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
That's why he fell for it.

715
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,080
Now Pang Yu is missing.

716
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,800
and the Yin Bureau won't take action.

717
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,600
We don't know

718
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,320
We have no idea.

719
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,920
Chef.

720
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,880
Yes

721
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,280
We missed each other once,

722
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,160
But we will never

723
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,200
make another mistake.

724
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,920
We have

725
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,600
in our hands.

726
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,960
Have some.

727
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,360
Eat more.

728
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,320
Slow down.

729
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,120
We still can't find him.

730
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,960
People are everywhere.

731
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,640
Still no news.

732
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,640
Keep looking.

733
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,880
Yes.

734
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
Please enlighten me.

735
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,080
What poison is this?

736
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,200
Didn't you lose someone in front of the government office?

737
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,600
Why are you here instead of staying there?

738
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,960
Why are you here?

739
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,440
I invited Mr. Han here.

740
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,160
From Jiang He,

741
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,040
all three bodies died in a strange way.

742
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,320
I think something is wrong.

743
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,720
Did you find anything?

744
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,800
I fed three chickens

745
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,640
to these three chickens.

746
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,440
Three sick chickens.

747
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,040
Do you know

748
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,440
this beast

749
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,840
usually listen to God

750
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,560
it always depends on fate.

751
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,480
and stay still.

752
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,040
But after I fed

753
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,240
to the chicken,

754
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,760
I'm all awake.

755
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,920
The house was crashing,

756
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,800
and die.

757
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,720
Sir.

758
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,840
You suspected the victim was poisoned.

759
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,080
It seems to be.

760
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,640
But this poison is unusual.

761
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,760
It can't be found on the body.

762
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,480
Mr. Han, in your opinion,

763
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,240
what is the effect of this poison?

764
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,680
Illusion.

765
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,200
The deceased must have seen

766
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,240
saw a horrifying scene.

767
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,400
and was charged with self-harm.

768
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,320
Maybe

769
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,200
I saw the victims.

770
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,520
and the rumor of the song.

771
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
They must have heard of it.

772
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,760
So they committed suicide

773
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,160
and committed suicide according to the song.

774
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,760
That should be it.

775
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,760
I know.

776
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,520
I'll find out the origin of this poison.

777
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,920
Illusion?

778
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,920
The deceased must have seen

779
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,360
saw a horrifying scene.

780
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,480
He was charged with self-harm.

781
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880
This is salt, not flour.

782
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,240
Who do you want to salty?

783
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,440
I was just thinking about that poison.

784
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,240
I thought

785
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,720
only my genjutsu

786
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,920
can show people a certain scene.

787
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,520
Could it be poison?

788
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,600
The world is vast.

789
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
in the world.

790
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,880
I just hope Gongsun Li can find

791
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,640
heartbreak grass.

792
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,760
A hook.

793
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,040
Heartbreak grass, hook.

794
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,640
What are you doing?

795
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,760
Why are you so jealous?

796
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,880
Are you trying to poison us?

797
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,600
Father, you are knowledgeable.

798
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,280
Is there a poison

799
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,280
can trigger horror hallucinations?

800
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,120
There's no poison.

801
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,880
But I heard that

802
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,320
Kunzhou in the south of Golden Ox Road.

803
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,080
Some mushrooms

804
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,480
can show people some western scenery.

805
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,920
I've checked all those.

806
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,320
Those illusions are good or bad.

807
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,840
there are still people who can see gold and silver.

808
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,400
That's all.

809
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,800
Am I right, Chiyu?

810
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,960
Bianzhou.

811
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,520
There is no one in the Central Plain.

812
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,960
there are many strange things

813
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,720
are most strange.

814
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,360
I'll check.

815
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,080
Meow.

816
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,200
You're like a dog.

817
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,320
We can find something

818
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,680
We'll find something.

819
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,080
and starve.

820
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,800
The murderer won't come out by himself.

821
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,720
Poison.

822
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,160
Poison.

823
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,960
Poison.

824
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,840
Poison.

825
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,600
Tea.

826
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,400
I found it.

827
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,760
I found it.

828
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,120
Food, rice.

829
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,920
I didn't find anything.

830
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,800
but my father.

831
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,760
My father mentioned Kui State.

832
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,200
and reminded me.

833
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,280
I followed the books

834
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,320
in the border

835
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,840
I've been reading it.

836
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,800
Guess what?

837
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,280
The poison of Miss Ghost came from Beiguan.

838
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,680
It's used by the barbarians.

839
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
It can bewitch people.

840
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,080
The poisoned is in a trance.

841
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,680
It seems that he can see the world.

842
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,560
Many people hurt themselves.

843
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,240
Northern Pass barbarian.

844
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,320
When we fought with the Northern Pass Gang,

845
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,760
a general was poisoned

846
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
for a long time in the army.

847
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,400
The last thing we found is

848
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,480
this poison was found in the wine.

849
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,720
It's the poison of the barbarian.

850
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,120
to call a ghost girl.

851
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,880
There was indeed a war in the North Pass.

852
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,760
But seven years ago,

853
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,400
with the barbarians seven years ago.

854
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,960
and closed Hegu Pass.

855
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,840
The poison of the ghost girl

856
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,920
didn't enter the Central Plain.

857
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,560
So the only one who touches this kind of poison

858
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,200
can only be soldiers from Beiguan.

859
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,200
What's the connection between Beiguan and Pang Ji?

860
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,760
You're asking the right person.

861
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,040
In the sixth year of Heavenly Sage,

862
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,880
Pang Ji was appointed as Deputy Minister of War.

863
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,840
During the battle in the North Pass,

864
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,640
Wu Dinghe Camp rebelled.

865
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,880
The army is in turmoil.

866
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,600
Pang Jili wants peace.

867
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,480
The adjutants in the court

868
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,560
has improved.

869
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,560
So Mr. Guan said

870
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,520
I would draw inferences.

871
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,560
and interact with each other.

872
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,360
Chef.

873
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,520
I'll help you if you meet me.

874
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,639
You're lucky.

875
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,520
Pang Ji was in the Ministry of War.

876
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,880
He was the one who suggested peace.

877
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,080
He even got promoted after the negotiation.

878
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,600
That war lasted for six years.

879
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,600
Why did the peace negotiation suddenly occur seven years ago?

880
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,560
Wu Dinghe Camp rebelled.

881
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,920
The army is dispersed.

882
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
Wuding River.

883
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,639
Do you remember anything?

884
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,760
Chen Xiuqian.

885
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,880
Chen Xian

886
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,159
The letter mentioned Wuding Building.

887
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,080
Wuding Building is guilty. Wash your heart.

888
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,720
The innocence has changed.

889
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,040
He is not reincarnated.

890
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,400
Wu Dinghe Camp rebelled

891
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,400
and became Pangji's Qingyun Road.

892
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,120
And Wuding Pavilion appeared in the capital

893
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,200
to help Chen Xiuqian.

894
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,160
Pang Ji's rival

895
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,840
has appeared again.

896
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,880
only soldiers from the North Pass

897
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,560
can touch.

898
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,760
Wuding River Camp.

899
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,320
Wuding Building.

900
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,240
Pang Ji.

901
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,840
What is the connection?

902
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,800
Anyway,

903
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,880
if your guess is right,

904
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,400
after the rebellion of Wu Dinghe Camp,

905
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
after the rebellion.

906
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,680
Judging from their actions,

907
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,880
they must hate Pang Ji.

908
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,600
Let me plead guilty.

909
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,520
These martial artists

910
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,240
forced me

911
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,760
with my son.

912
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,480
Chef.

913
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,400
As you said,

914
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,840
I hid in the Pang family for three days.

915
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,840
I finally found this clue.

916
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,200
You're right.

917
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,280
It's because Wu Ding Pavilion wants Pang Ji to plead guilty.

918
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,800
I’m afraid they

919
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,920
the Wuhe Camp.

920
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,720
By the way,

921
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,640
Pang Ji also mentioned

922
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,080
the threats in the army.

923
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,240
I guess

924
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,560
there must be resentment between them.

925
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,960
Regardless of the grudges

926
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,520
and Pang Ji,

927
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,240
Pang Yu must not be exiled.

928
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,560
As long as we find them,

929
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,680
we can find Pang Yu.

930
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,640
Now we split up into two groups.

931
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,120
Military rebellion.

932
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
The list has been recorded

933
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,280
of the government.

934
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,880
These people have martial arts.

935
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,200
Only by hiding in the world

936
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,160
and wait for the opportunity.

937
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,040
Qin, Zhan Mao'er,

938
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,040
You have martial arts skills.

939
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,160
Let's split up.

940
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,160
OK. What about me?

941
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,800
I want the case of the Ministry of War in Dinghe Camp.

942
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,120
I'll try my best.

943
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,360
Chef

944
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,360
Chef.

945
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,840
I tricked my father

946
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,640
from the Ministry of War.

947
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Seven years ago, Wu Dinghe Camp rebelled.

948
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,080
The war in the North Pass went straight.

949
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,040
Soldiers of Dunghe Camp

950
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,960
are all one in a hundred.

951
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,240
Look here.

952
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,960
500 soldiers in the Dunghe Camp.

953
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
They will annihilate more than 3,000 enemies in each battle.

954
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,280
On the battlefield of Beiguan,

955
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,120
there are fewer people in Dinghe Camp,

956
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,320
but they are the backbone.

957
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,760
Wu Dinghe Camp rebelled.

958
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,360
The army is in chaos.

959
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,800
Even the court

960
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,520
believe that we can win this battle.

961
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,040
Pang Ji

962
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,080
The war forces advocate peace.

963
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,320
After the war, he became the Minister of War.

964
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,160
According to the existing clues,

965
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Wuding Building

966
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,360
is probably the Wuhe Camp.

967
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,680
They have done

968
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,080
the case of the Yin Bureau.

969
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,200
using Pang Yu to force Pang Ji to plead guilty.

970
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,280
Guess.

971
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,320
what crime

972
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,680
to Pang Ji?

973
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,320
Back then,

974
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,280
Did they really run away?

975
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,840
Thank you.

976
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,760

977
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
please inform the beggar alley.

978
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Excuse me.

979
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,400
Boss.

980
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,880
What Wuhe Camp?

981
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,480
Bah!

982
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,360
My Yuan Kan is in the Northern Pass without Dinghe Camp.

983
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,240
to protect the country.

984
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,840
How could you say that?

985
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,960
Let me tell you.

986
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,080
just a group of deserters.

987
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,760
Nonsense!

988
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,160
Yuan Kan won't run away.

989
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,880
Yuan Kan wrote to me that

990
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,320
he and his brothers

991
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,840
went to DaHeishan to attack the barbarian.

992
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,360
The North Pass is snowing heavily.

993
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,360
The imperial court didn't even send a new cold dress.

994
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,920
I'm going to buy

995
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,160
for the soldiers.

996
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,320
How could you say that to him?

997
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,120
I see.

998
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,920
Another young man

999
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,160
who can't wait.

1000
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Stop waiting.

1001
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,520
Wu Dinghe Camp is long gone.

1002
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,760
Maybe

1003
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
your husband

1004
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,280
has already found a barbarian beauty

1005
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,360
to live a good life.

1006
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,040
Nonsense!

1007
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,560
I'll rip your mouth.

1008
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,760
What are you doing?

1009
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,360
Help!

1010
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,800
It's a spring girl's dream again.

1011
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,280
After the rebellion of Wu Dinghe Camp,

1012
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,160
after the rebellion of Wu Dinghe Camp.

1013
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,320
What are you doing?

1014
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,960
Are you blind?

1015
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,480
Crazy.

1016
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,840
Why are you bullying a girl?

1017
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,480
She started it.

1018
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,160
She's unconscious.

1019
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,760
You should at least give her some mercy.

1020
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,320
Why did you stab her with a stick?

1021
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,120
Get lost!

1022
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,680
