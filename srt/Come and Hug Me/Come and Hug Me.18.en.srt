1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,560
Are you even concerned about Namu?
[Episode 18]

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,680
What's wrong with you?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,800
Did spending time with him make you go insane?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,360
Why are you doing this?

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,240
I'm going to call the police.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,810
I'm going to tell them to come and arrest you.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,180
It was for Father.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,900
What?

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,870
It's not over yet.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,090
You said he made it.

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,980
He's got a good lifeline.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,050
If I get arrested again, I'll rot in jail.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,930
But I'll prove myself for real this time.

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,930
You are really insane.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,400
Don't tell anyone that you saw me.

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,830
If you do, you're not safe either.

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,260
Brother Hyeonmu!

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,780
Don't do this.

19
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,680
I'm begging you.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,680
Stop, please?

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,650
You saw Hyeonmu?

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,450
Did he hurt you?

23
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,560
He didn't touch me.

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,820
So where did he go?

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,330
I don't know.

26
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,770
I couldn't stop him.

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,930
But he asked me how Namu was doing.

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,600
What?

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,000
[Clean and fresh, Cheonghwasu]

30
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,360
[Clean and fresh, Cheonghwasu]

31
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,160
Twelve years and no see,

32
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,830
but you're still very pretty.

33
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,670
Must be tough to run the restaurant

34
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,640
and raise kids without me.

35
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,070
Who are you calling your kids?

36
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,480
You don't have that right.

37
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,750
Do you know what Hyeonmu did...

38
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,250
because of you?

39
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,650
I suppose...

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,280
he hurt Namu or something.

41
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,760
That boy.

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,930
He's finally behaving like the big brother he is.

43
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,140
What did you say?

44
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,080
He made you...

45
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,200
come see me after twelve years.

46
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,250
You...

47
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,090
put your two sons...

48
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,020
into the same hellfire you came out of,

49
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,020
and can still smile now?

50
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,280
Hyeonmu...

51
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,800
was so desperate to be loved by his father.

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,260
So he became a cruel criminall who stabs his own sibling.

53
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,990
Namu...

54
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,130
My son...

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,550
He's paying instead for the crimes you committed.

56
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,950
His entire life is of repentance.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
He's never smiled comfortably.

58
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,680
You still don't feel sorry?

59
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,080
You don't feel guilty towards your children?

60
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,460
From now on,

61
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,720
they're not your children, they're mine.

62
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,200
Don't you ever

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,730
touch my children again.

64
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,170
Crazy devil bastard.

65
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,510
Sweetheart.

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,850
You came by the dog farm, didn't you?

67
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,650
I'm talking about twelve years ago.

68
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,950
The day before you ran away.

69
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,560
You came by and saw everything.

70
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,760
You saw...

71
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,720
how I got rid of that woman.

72
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,930
She was so kind.

73
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,510
So good at telling me the directions.

74
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,310
But...

75
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,520
she didn't do what I said.

76
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,830
If you reported me instead of running away,

77
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,720
you would have saved three lives.

78
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,320
That girl named Gil Nakwon who Namu liked...

79
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,930
her parents included.

80
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,910
Isn't that why my kids are alive and well?

81
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,270
Right?

82
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,150
So you can get forgiveness...

83
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,150
for my sins...

84
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,050
and your sins.

85
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,460
Okhee.

86
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,650
That's why we're a family.

87
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,730
We're on the same boat, sharing one fate.

88
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,830
Shut your mouth. You're crazy.

89
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,890
I've been talking to a nun these days.

90
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,130
Sin, repentance, and salvation.

91
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,850
They're not that far away.

92
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,820
It's actually really easy.

93
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,580
It's simple.

94
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,850
Even if you sin again,

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,790
you can simply ask for forgiveness...

96
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,370
and be saved again.

97
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,810
Watch yourself.

98
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,120
Chae Okhee,

99
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,450
you're my woman.

100
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,460
Do you know why...

101
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,420
I didn't kill you?

102
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,040
Because I liked...

103
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,500
how your skin smelled.

104
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,590
So don't you dare...

105
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,920
ever be in the arms...

106
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,960
of another man.

107
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,880
Just because I'm in here...

108
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,250
doesn't mean I can't do anything.

109
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,860
You should come and see me more often.

110
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,370
Bring our little princess.

111
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,430
I also miss...

112
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,880
Namu.

113
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,810
Do you believe...

114
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,050
that you're protecting your children?

115
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,310
You're wrong.

116
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,650
You're the one who broke our family.

117
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,550
The life you lived,

118
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,200
the things you have said...

119
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,700
are all wrong.

120
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,160
That's why you're in here.

121
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,240
Namu...

122
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,570
is already no longer your child.

123
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,170
He grew up by himself.

124
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,070
So don't get it twisted.

125
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,620
Stop tricking yourself...

126
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,180
Stop deluding yourself...

127
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,720
that you're his father!

128
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,400
I hope...

129
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,720
you rot to death here...

130
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,360
for thousands of years.

131
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
for thousands of years.

132
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,730
If you touch my babies again,

133
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,640
I will...

134
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,300
crawl back in here...

135
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,900
to rip your limbs into pieces...

136
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,950
and chew on every bone

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,220
to kill you.

138
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,380
Okay.

139
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,410
You need to be that feisty to be my wife.

140
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,030
This side of you is why I fell for you.

141
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,150
Yes, I remember now.

142
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,890
See you again soon, honey.

143
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,500
If you reported me instead of running away,

144
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,400
you would have saved three lives.

145
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,000
That girl named Gil Nakwon who Namu liked...

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,620
her parents included.

147
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,850
Police.

148
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,830
Let's go.

149
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,020
Go ahead, please.

150
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,160
Hello? Hello?

151
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,180
You are so good-looking, my dear.

152
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,920
You look just like me.

153
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,230
Namu.

154
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,920
Yes?

155
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,040
I'm...

156
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,070
really sorry.

157
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,970
I never...

158
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,350
really took care of you, and I'm sorry about that.

159
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,750
Hyeonmu...

160
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,720
That one...

161
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,360
will be my responsibility now.

162
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,050
That won't be your business anymore.

163
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,230
That burden...

164
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,270
I'll carry it from now on.

165
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,540
Mom.

166
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,410
Don't do that.

167
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,040
To you,

168
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm a burden too.

169
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,150
All your life.

170
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,700
You're not a burden. You're a gift.

171
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,620
You are the greatest gift...

172
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,490
of my entire life.

173
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,780
Han Jaeyee was the victim of a brutal attack

174
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,810

00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,040
You'll die from smoking soon anyway.

339
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,240
Right?

340
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,210
Namu,

341
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,390
where did we go so wrong?

342
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,460
We've been through so many things.

343
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,300
We were only 16.

344
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,140
Our only sin was to care about each other.

345
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,830
That was the only thing.

346
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,240
But just for that,

347
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,820
we're still being punished.

348
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,690
You know what?

349
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,190
I want to be happier than before.

350
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,530
Even just a tiny bit.

351
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,760
I want to be happier.

352
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,540
Listen, Namu.

353
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,950
Let's take a little break.

354
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,990
No matter what others say,

355
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,610
let's stop being sorry to each other.

356
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,150
Let's pretend like we're okay.

357
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,570
Let's just take a little break.

358
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,640
Can we?

359
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,250
Is that...

360
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,250
Is that not in our cards, ever?
