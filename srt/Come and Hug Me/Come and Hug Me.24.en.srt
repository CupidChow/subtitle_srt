2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,510
- Good night.
- Bye.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,990
Cut! Let's move to the next scene.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,720
She's very good.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,740
Isn't she too good for this role?

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,830
- She brought it upon herself.
- What...

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,430
It's too extreme, even for a scandal.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,010
I consider myself more extreme.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,380
Move aside, I'm coming through.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,580
Hello.

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,650
You should've come alone.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,700
Why did you bring Yoonsung with you?

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,330
He begged to tag along with me.

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,970
It's not like I can tie him to a chair.

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,520
Hey, you.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,940
What was up with your acting, back there?

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,230
You should've acted more desperate and cling on.

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,930
Watch me, I'll show you how.

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,280
- That's okay, Senior.
- I said I'll teach you.

20
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,350
Who are you? Let me go.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,790
- Namu.
- Detective, why are you here?

22
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,050
What's going on today?

23
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,980
I said, who are you, punk?

24
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,950
Me?

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,960
He's my boyfriend.

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,620
So he's the guy in your rumors?

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,570
Yoonsung, watch what you say from this point.

28
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,280
Sure, well...

29
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,240
You're pretty handsome for a police detective.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,270
You're not that handsome...

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,370
for an actor.

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,440
What? What did you say?

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,820
Are you blind?

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,210
Look at my face! I'm unbelievably handsome.

35
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,010
Anyhow, I could care less.

36
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,690
Why are you hitting on her?

37
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,880
She already rejected you.

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,960
This is not the place to shoot a Love & War drama.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,370
Shall we all get going, now?

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,960
I mean...

41
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,160
Other people might misunderstand you,

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,100
and the other person could get offended, too.

43
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,440
You have no manners and it's rude.

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,050
Is your boyfriend always this chatty?

45
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,070
Nope.

46
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,420
You should take a session for sexual harassment prevention,

47
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,410
and be more careful from now on.

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Okay, Sir?

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,510
"Sir. Sir?"

50
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,260
Punk, I just turned 30.

51
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,920
You and I are about the same age.

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,650
He totally looks my age!

53
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,710
- Is Mr. Pyo gone?
- Yes.

54
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,810
He looked really upset.

55
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,870
He already gave me an earful in the car.

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,540
He did?

57
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,750
It was my first time seeing you get so angry.

58
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,520
Do you always talk so well? Or do you only get speechless around me?

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,550
Is it because you're a detective?

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,060
I wasn't that angry.

61
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,660
Liar.

62
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,190
You were already a little upset when Yoonsung and I

63
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,910
were shooting "Romance Village," right?

64
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,040
At this rate, you'll go crazy if I shoot a love scene.

65
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,580
It's not like that.

66
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,390
I'm so happy.

67
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,130
We're just like any ordinary couple.

68
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,790
Let's show jealousy,

69
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,270
get mad at each other, and even have arguments.

70
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,370
We couldn't do so many things because we felt sorry or grateful.

71
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,960
Let's now do all of them, one by one.

72
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,110
We'll be like everybody else.

73
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,470
We'll become more ordinary, day by day.

74
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,150
Okay?

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,800
Then...

76
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,970
can I...

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,330
do more of this?

78
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,410
What?

79
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,450
Sohjin.

80
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,560
Who are...

81
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,230
Father asked me to pass on this present

82
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,760
to our youngest princess.

83
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,570
You must take his present.

84
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,890
Hyeonmu.

85
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,720
Oh, gosh...

86
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,330
That's enough.

87
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,370
You'll be smashed into pieces, too.

88
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,510
- What?
- If you touch my sister,

89
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,760
I'll kill you.

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,520
What's the matter, Big Brother?

91
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,180
You better not act up.

92
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,590
We need to teach her a lesson.

93
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,120
Who are you to teach her a lesson?

94
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,890
Over here! Is anyone out there?

95
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,370
Please help us! Hello?

96
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,910
Hyeonmu...

97
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,440
No, you bastard!

98
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,710
Hyeonmu.

99
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,470
Hyeonmu, are you okay?

100
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,750
Quit that job.

101
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,680
If you're going home this late every night, just quit!

102
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,790
It must hurt a lot.

103
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,910
Let's get you to a hospital, first.

104
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,820
No way...

105
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,990
I'll be arrested on the spot.

106
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,520
Then I'll be blamed for everything.

107
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,790
Mom and I both know it wasn't you.

108
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,110
Just turn yourself in.

109
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,940
Anyway.

110
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,810
That jerk is insane.

111
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,380
Both you and the old lady should be careful.

112
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,690
Namu, too.

113
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,730
How do you know a crazy guy like him?

114
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,530
What did he mean when he mentioned father?

115
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,360
Nakwon's older brother came to our restaurant.

116
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,740
He showed us pictures of who you're going around with.

117
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,680
Isn't that him?

118
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,380
That's none of your business.

119
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,610
You just be careful.

120
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,860
Is your brother still MIA?

121
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,080
Yes.

122
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,180
I'm thinking of visiting his place.

123
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,370
Maybe something happened to him.

124
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,920
I'm going to tell Mother, too.

125
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,220
I should pay her a visit soon.

126
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,290
Don't do anything difficult.

127
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,560
She'll understand.

128
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,060
It's not difficult at all.

129
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,330
I met her at the hospital...

130
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,770
Your mom.

131
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,760
I really, really like her.

132
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
She raised you and loves you.

133
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,870
I'm really thankful for that.

Are you all right?

140
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,970
The bastard's face...

141
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,040
You didn't see it?

142
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,550
I was so scared that I don't remember.

143
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,460
What about Hyeonmu?

144
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,530
Was he badly hurt?

145
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,860
Yes, instead of me.

146
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,130
He warned you and Mom to be careful, too.

147
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,430
You must catch Hyeonmu first.

148
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,330
I'm afraid something terrible may happen to him.

149
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,770
The typhoon will head towards the east coast

150
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,850
and as it weakens, around tomorrow morning

151
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,880
it will no longer affect any part of Korea.

152
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,990
A typhoon watch was issued along the south coast.

153
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,420
Waves will reach 6 to 8 meters in height.

154
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,660
People living close to the coasts are showing great concern.

155
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,970
A prosecutor was accused of assaulting

156
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,630
serial killer Yoon Huijae during interrogation.

157
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,000
In a visiting room at Euigang Prison,

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,030
Yoon was questioned about his assault

159
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,130
on reporter Park Heeyoung.

160
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,470
In the process, he verbally challenged the prosecutor.

161
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,850
Then the enraged prosecutor

162
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,550
assaulted Yoon in that room.

163
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,140
The prosecutor had a personal vendetta against Yoon.

164
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,150
You,

165
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,290
have you killed someone?

166
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,320
Whatever else you do in the future,

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,140
the prosecutor's assault have caused a huge uproar.

172
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,960
Moowon.

173
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,730
Are you very ill?

174
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,720
Why didn't you call me?

175
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,800

Don't see him.

00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,050
- Moowon.
- Whatever he is now,

179
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,050
he's still Yoon Huijae's son.

180
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,420
He's related to that lunatic.

181
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,250
He's the son of...

182
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,690
our parent's murderer.

183
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,930
Namu and that man...

184
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,320
are different people.

185
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,490
You tell yourself that now,

186
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,960
but things will change.

187
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,830
Every time you see his face,

188
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,210
you'll have no choice but to recall Yoon Huijae's face.

189
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,440
And then...

190
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,820
your guilt...

191
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,620
will remind you of mom and dad.

192
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,050
Even so,

193
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,310
it wasn't Namu's fault.

194
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,060
I'm not talking about whose fault it was.

I'm talking about what happened.

196
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,700
In the end, Nakwon,

197
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,170
the weight of this will crush you.

198

You aren't even blood-related to Nakwon.

My name is Gil Moowon.

207

That's the name my parents gave me.

208
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,900
Will anyone here cut me out of

209
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,330
the family registry and adopt Nakwon?

210
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,710
The inheritance was put into a fund.

211
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,230
You'll never get a cent of it.

212
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,210

without spending my parents' money.

215
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,520
When I become an adult, I'll pay back everything.

216

Yesterday afternoon,

271
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,980
serial killer Yoon Huijae was on his way to be investigated by the authorities.

272
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,080
But he ran away from the police.

273
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,150
It's shocking as this came out later.

274
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,220
The police have yet to find

275
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,990
his accurate whereabouts.
