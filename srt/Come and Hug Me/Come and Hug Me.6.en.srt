Yoon Huijae released an autobiography

175
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,510
which could become scandalous.

176
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,990
Reporter Han Jinseok has the story.

177
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,490
Serial killer Yoon Huijae

178
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,760
is currently on death row.

179
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,200
He released an autobiography that describes

180
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,120
the crimes he committed

181
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,740
from 2004 to 2006 and how he felt at the time.

182
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,970
It's causing huge controversy.

183
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,160
The book is titled

184
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,340
"I Am Not Unlike You,"

185
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,030
and describes details of all 12 victims

186
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,480
including the last two, famed actress Ji Hyewon

187
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,270
and her husband.

188
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,020
Yoon also wrote about how much he regrets his actions.

189
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,150
There are concerns that some will idolize him and his crimes,

190
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,820
and families of his victims are voicing strong opposition.

191
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,690
The book is at the center of attention right after its release.

192
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,390
Sales of the book

193

- I'm sorry. Are you okay?

194

Yes. It's okay, my mistake.

- Sorry.
- I'll clean it up.

Sohjin, why are you calling so late?

208

Nope.

I miss you and that's my only problem.

211

Then, where should we meet?

You want me to say good night?

You turned into a baby since we last met.

219

Okay, I'll say it.

She's a real actress.

Don't you watch TV? She works with Cheon Segyeong...

337
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,950
She's in the "Secret Love in Seoul" drama, too.

Look her up on the internet and...

339
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,280
let me just show you.

Darn it. My phone's in the car.

No, let me talk.

Hello, I'm Han Jaeyee, a newbie actress.

You don't know me, right?

344
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,370
You might remember my commercial,

345
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,050
so I'd like to reenact it for you if it's okay with you?

346
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,510
Which one?

347
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,980
Do you really not know your crime?

348
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,990
How dare you put those precious pearls

349
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,350
all over your skin?

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,750
Wow, that was amazing.

354
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,580
You don't know this famous commercial?

355
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,280
Come on.

356
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,210
How can you not know this famous fluttering hand action?

You two, you can't take pictures!

367
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,000
Hi, are you Han Jaeyee?

368
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,560
Well... yes, I am.

369
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,860
I love you in your drama. I'm Han Jiho from Lady Focus.

But you're dressed like...

Oh, Mr. Producer, just a moment.

373
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,920
I'll let you all chat.

374
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,810
Please write a nice article.

375
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,760
When she passed out the coffees later,

376
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,820
snap a photo of her with Cheon Segyeong.

377
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,050
Yes, we're on the set.

378
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,560
Can you grant us an interview?

379
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,990
Yes, of course.

380
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,240
Are you here today because of the coffee van?

381
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,680
Yes. Our drama's ratings went over 20 percent,

382
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,800
so I'm carrying out what I pledged to do,

383
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,840
and support Senior Segyeong in the process.

384
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,270
There's no other reason?

385
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,280
Is this your first time here?

386
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,610
Yes, it is.

387
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,460
Are you not here because...

388
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,550
your old friend's here, too?

389
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,350
A friend?

390
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,260
I don't have any friends here.

391
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,160
So you really don't know.

392
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,560
Jaeyee, do you...

393
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,290
by any chance remember Yoon Huijae?

394
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,510
Your real name is Gil Nakwon, correct?

395
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,540
Actress Ji Hyewon was your mother.

396
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,070
You must've asked people to keep quiet...

397
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,720
if anyone came asking about you.

398
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,080
No matter how hard you try,

399
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,540
someone in the industry will always talk.

400
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,360
It's no use.

401
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,160
My goodness, Jaeyee is here!

402
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,290
Thank you so much for making the long trip over here.

403
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,560
I said you didn't have to bother.

404
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,600
This is why I just adore Jaeyee.

405

Jaeyee, what's wrong?

408
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,490
Are you feeling ill?

409
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,890
- No, I just need to...
- What?

410
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,860
I need to go. I'm sorry.

Say something to your drama fans.

Are you very close to Cheon Segyeong?

415
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,900
Can you look over here?

416
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,450
What do you think about Yoon Huijae's autobiography?

417
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,040
As the family of a victim,

418
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,810
you must be in shock that this was published.

419

I'm not trying to push you. Just state how you feel.

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,560
You must have a huge grudge towards Yoon Huijae.

I'll help you tell it.
