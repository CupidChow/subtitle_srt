- Stop right there.
- ...the progeny of a demon?

7
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,250

[Episode 27]

10
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,590
I can't ask you to do errands anymore. Are you unable to read Korean?

11
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,520
Even when I assist you, you whine about it.

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,500
Man, I'm starving. I want some rice.

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,230
The food is ready.

14
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,500
I thought you didn't want my food, but you still gobble it up.

15

Do I have a choice? There's nothing else.

Ouch, you wench.

17
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,780
Why boss Mom around to get you things?

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,670
You fetch your own food. You have limbs.

19

Don't be so cheap.

No, it's fine.

They weren't done before.

- Yes, eat more.

What brings you all the way here?

69
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,580
You shouldn't go around. It's risky.

70
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,850
I was told that he resembled being a dad to Namu.

71
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,420
I really wanted to see him off.

72
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,730
If you'd only told on me instead of leaving,

73
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,130
three lives would have been saved.

74
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,540

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,200
You can speak informally with me.

If Han Jaeyee becomes your daughter-in-law,

78
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,130

79
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,990
Darn.

80
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,810
I'm going to go ahead.

81
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,630
You'll stay here, right?

82
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,280
His relatives haven't arrived.

83
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,780
I ought to remain.

84
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,850
We'll start our investigation on Yeom Jihong tomorrow.

85
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,040
It's not as if he'll confess.

86
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,320
He's completely brainwashed by Yoon Huijae.

87
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,460
That doesn't mean we should do absolutely nothing.

88
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,760
Regarding Dojin,

89
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,550
I believe he went to meet with Yeom Jihong.

90
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,170
He better not cause a stir.

91
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,990
Hey.

92
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,360

Do you have a minute?

95
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,380
What are you trying to do? My colleagues were there.

96
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,050
Do you want everyone to know we're familiar with each other?

97
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,720
Yeom Jihong...

98
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,650
is involved with Yoon Huijae's escape, right?

99
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,390
Did he assist in the escape?

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,930
- How should I know?
- If that's the case...

101
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,660
if we had released the recording,

102
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,110
you would have been able to nab Yeom Jihong by listening to his voice.

103
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,030
You could have put a stop to Yoon Huijae's escape.

104
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,380
- Then Senior Inspector Go...
- Stop it.

105
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,850
Are you serious?

106
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,870
Hey, Han Jiho.

107
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,780
Are you joking?

108
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
As a result, you got an exclusive.

109
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,660
You feigned ignorance. Why are you saying this now?

110
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,480
You should've reported me...

111
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,520
claimed that a cop had pocketed evidence.

112
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,170
Also, how am I to blame?

113
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,990
He was nosing around too much.

114
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,760
No one told him to get involved with such unlucky people.

115
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,610
- What did you say?
- Do you know why people...

116
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,370
inquire about your parents' jobs when you first encounter them?

117
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,980
Because you can't lie about the blood that runs through your veins.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,050
Yoon Namu is a murderer's child.

119
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,650
He was born with bad fortune.

120
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,510
Some say he might be more evil than his father.

121
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,980
He's the son of that monster Yoon Huijae.

122
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,890
Where is Yoon Huijae?

123
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,360
I have no idea.

124
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,750
Tell me where that lunatic is.

125
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,250
I said, I have no clue.

126
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,110
You don't?

127
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,220
That hammer...

128
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,520
Did you use this hand...

129
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,520
just like Yoon Huijae did?

130
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,320
Should I break your fingers, one by one?

131
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,100
You're a psycho.

132
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,590
I've only just begun.

133
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,800
You still have four fingers left.

134
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,550
You should be treated just the same. Got that?

135
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,050
Woman.

136
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,150
There was a woman.

137
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,080
Father has a female assisting him aside from me.

138
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,150
What kind of woman?

139
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,220
I have no idea.

140
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,390
I heard that when he was in prison, she frequently wrote to him.

141
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,590
What's her name?

142
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,920
I have no idea.

143
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,290
I only saw her face.

144
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,810
She's over forty.

145
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,880
I don't know what she does.

146
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,680
Are they together at this moment?

147
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,410
Yes, but I haven't a clue where.

148
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,140
I mean it.

149
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,880
Lieutenant, this may result in disciplinary dismissal for you.

150
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,620
Sue me.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,600
Are you all right?

152
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,300
What was meeting Namu like?

153
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,130
I would like to request some extra protection...

154
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,380
for those in protective custody against Yoon Huijae.

155
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,200
I also require security footage of the area...

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,750
when Senior Inspector Go was killed.

157
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,070
The killers were probably in a car.

158
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,570
There were at least a couple of people.

159
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,520
Look out for cars with a female driver in her 40s.

160
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,090
Inform Senior Violent Crimes 3 that this is of utmost importance.

161
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,740
Namu's room is fine.

162
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,550
It's quite nice.

163
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,100
Regarding Sohjin's room,

164
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,620
I only remember it when she was a kid.

165
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,400
It's quite odd to have it...

166
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,470
smells like cosmetics.

167
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,760
I also recall our old home.

168
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,380
You were fond of it.

169
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,110
The boards creaked a lot, which you found homey.

170
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,120
Why aren't you saying anything?

171
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,450
I didn't cover your mouth...

172
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,450
so why not speak?

173
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,150
Are you shocked because I suddenly appeared?

174
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,890
Was it you?

175
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,660
Did you murder him as well?

that taints my son.

180
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,390
I was gone for a dozen years,

181
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,690
which prevented me from carrying out my fatherly duties.

182
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,080
If others heard you,

183
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,650
they'd view you as a great dad.

184
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,420
I'm aware of all that occurred...

185
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,220
that evening.

186
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,000

188
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,430
will never become like you.

Why are you so certain?

190
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,710
You haven't a clue about how I'm going to off you.

191
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,650
After seeing that man named Go Yeeseok tip over,

192
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,490
Namu was quite shaken.

193
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,820
If you die,

194
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,270
he'll be even more upset.

195
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,700
Don't you think I'm right?

196
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,710
How devastated would he be?

197
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,400
While he's at it, he should shatter to pieces.

198
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,020
That way, I can piece him back together. Isn't that true?

199
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,210
Don't dare lay a finger on Namu.

200
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,150
It's my goal to make him my son once more.

340
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,000
Then...

341
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,730
what...

342
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,140
what am I to you?

343
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,660
Say something.

344
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,500
What did I...

345
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,500
not do for you?

346
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,140
Tell me.

347
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,170
I pleaded with you.

348
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,980
I implored for you to look at me.

349
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,020
Why didn't you?

350
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,320
Why, even once, didn't you look?

351
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,300
Tell me the reason.

352
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,830
She's not a blood relation,

353
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,910
but she's the closest one to me.

354
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,230
She's more like my parent.

355
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,780
Why?

356
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,350
That's the reason Namu sided with her.

357
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,740
You know what?

358
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,890
Father has never shielded us from harm.

359
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,080
You know, don't you?

360
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,650
Father.

361
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,990
You've never...

362
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,960
protected Namu nor me.

363
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,770
She isn't like you.

364
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,210
She's been our caregiver.

365
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,510
For a dozen years,

366
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,450
she worried about us.

367
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,220
She waited for us.

368
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,150
She got mad and wept for us. She did everything.

369
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,800
You were the world to me.

370
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,160
You were everything to me.

371
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,780
Is it really the case?

372
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,000
Is it really true?

373
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,280
Did I mean nothing to you?

374
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,820
Tell me.

375
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,150
Hyeonmu.

376
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,690
You don't deserve to be my son.

377
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,560
I'll send the two of you away.

378
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,190
When you reach the other side,

379
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,060
be well as mother and son.

380
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,230
Mom.

381
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,510
Hyeonmu.

382
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,360
You murdered someone again.

383
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,970
If something happens to Hyeonmu...

384
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,430
we'll know you're the culprit.

385
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,640
You already murdered...

386
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,150
four people.

387
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,620
What?

388
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,410
Stop being ridiculous.

389
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,550
Fine.

390
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,660
If you die...

391
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,630
it will devastate Namu.

392
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,910
Come out, Huijae.

393
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,980
The police are coming.

394
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,420
Leave through the back.

395
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,640
Hyeonmu, wake up.

396
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,980
Hyeonmu, wake up.

397
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,170
Don't cry.

398
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,990
It's not like we were close.
