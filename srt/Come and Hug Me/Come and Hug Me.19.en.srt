169
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,600
was attacked by the criminal in an alley.

170
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,140
The third victim is also...

171
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,000
What about the Gangnam Residential Area Case?

172
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,300
Was that you too?

173
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,110
Yes.

174
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,720
It's a dirty world we live in.

175
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,620
I'm going to destroy everything that's in front of me...

176
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,710
just like Father.

177
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,450
According to the police, the criminal used...

178
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,990
a hammer as a weapon again, for his crime.

179
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,800
The police gathered information through CCTVs and dashcams...

180
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,220
as they continue with the investigation.

181
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,690
- I think this is him.
- However,

182
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,000
- this is already the third victim.
- Isn't this him?

183
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,690
The police are being criticized

184
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,770
for being complacent.

185
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,010
The citizens' fear is getting worse day by day...

186
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,970
It's a blessing, my son's getting better so soon.

187
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,980
What else do you want to eat?

188
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,440
What do you want?

189
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,740
Mother,

190
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,680
I...

191
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,690
It'll pass again.

192
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,170
It must...

193
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,180
For you and her.

194
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,410
That's how it should be.

195
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,110
Right?

196
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,640
So,

197
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,460
please.

198
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,050
Just a little.

199
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,000
Okay, Namu?

200
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,090
Did I kill her on purpose?

201
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,240
She wanted to leave me, first. It was an accident...

202
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,510
while confronting her. What was I supposed to do?

203
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,200
Keep it down.

204
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,510
You've murdered a person. You don't deserve to speak up.

205
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,270
Jang Joonho,

206
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,610
everything you just said will be used at court.

207
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,750
Go ahead!

208
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,310
I'm a murderer already! So what?!

209
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,180
Keep your voice down...

210
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,000
Stop acting like a little sissy.

[Kim Sangcheol]

212

No, sir. It's a worthless rumor.

213
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,610
I'm going to take strong legal actions.

214
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,350
Brother.

215
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,270
How have you been?

216
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,390
You met Auntie yesterday.

217
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,080
Why didn't you tell me?

218
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,960
You know, what she's going to say.

219
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,620
You don't have to hear her all over again.

220
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,320
Don't answer any calls from our relatives for a while.

221
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,300
They're all just shocked from the news.

222
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,310
How come you don't ask me anything?

223
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,540
I don't want to say anything negative to you.

224
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,850
So, I'm just going to wait.

225
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,780
Just like how...

226
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,310
Mom and Dad did for me.

227
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,130
I'll handle what's going on outside.

228

You just come back to us where you belong.

- I was so slow.
- You did really well.

230
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,170
- I did?
- Yes.

231
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,710
Only you go that way, right?

232
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,830
- Yes.
- Take care.

233
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,370
- Bye.
- See you.

234
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,770
See you tomorrow.

[One month later]

239
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,510
It's been a while. It was frustrating not being able to meet you.

240
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,720
Only a month in the punishment room means they went easy on you.

241
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,210
So, you're back in your quarters now?

242
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,510
You stayed calm for 12 years.

243
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,830
Why the sudden outrage? It got me curious.

244
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,160
- Did something happen?
- Ms. Park.

245
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,500
The police exaggerated the facts...

246
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,090
to make me a picture-perfect monster?

247
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,100
I guess you thought...

248
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,630
I'm just a fraud like that?

249
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,650
You must've seen the news? Sorry, if I offended you.

250
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,280
But you talking me into helping you publish your autobiography,

251
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,790
brainwashing your wallflower of a son...

252
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,650
and making him stab his own brother.

253
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,680
These are all facts.

254
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,320
You must think...

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,050
I'm a laughing stock.

258

I created you, Yoon Huijae. The definition of evil.

259
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,480
You're not just a garbage killer anymore. You're a celebrity now.

260
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,320
I made you what you are.

261
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,450
You should know your place,

262
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,360
because I'm the one who created you.

263
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,420
You were a nobody who printed gossip for a living.

264
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,950
I made you into a journalist.

265
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,900
The chief prosecutor and even the warden...

266
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,790
didn't dare speak to me face-to-face.

267
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,810
You should be bowing down before me with gratefulness.

268
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,680
But you dare to screw me over?

269

The whole world knows you're just a butcher.

273
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,790
Your son Yoon Hyeonmu is a loser copycat,

274
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,890
who can't even commit a murder. That much is clear.

Even I can't understand him.

I've been looking into him for over a month and still nothing.

Even though he shares your blood,

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,140
he's unbelievably a normal human being.

280
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,910
What did your son do to you that night, Yoon Huijae?

281
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,510
Did you have a physical fight with the little boy?

282
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,120
There was no weapon other than your hammer at the scene.

283
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,830
Then, the reason you're hiding the fact is...

284
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,930
Is it to protect your loser son you love so determinedly?

285
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,830
Then really...

286

Even a beast, no, a monster like you...

287
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,100
has paternal emotions, too? If so, then admit it!

That will...

289
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,300

I haven't felt like this in a long while.

Let go!

302
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,970
Let her go right now!

303
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,540
Darn it.

304
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,310
My gosh. You lunatic.

305
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,860
You're still a dog on a leash in here.

00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,150
Okay, then.

307
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,840
I think I can let you see the outside.

308
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,490
I will sue you.
