Hyeonmu, I'm sorry.

174
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,740
If I've made you angry,

175

to the tragedy which occurred a dozen years ago,

193
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,170
people have started to do online searches on Ji Hyewon...

194
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,500
and are leaving commemorative comments and stories on online message boards.

- The late Ji...
- Jaeyee.

You met Kim Jiyeong's sister, didn't you?

209

If you write about us,

219
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,440

Yoon Huijae brainwashed me.

I can't recall the exact details.

229
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,720
Park Heeyoung's hidden camera caught it all.

230
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,450
You were completely conscious and sane.

231
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,710
The judge won't accept that you were insane.

232
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,990

The worst is on the horizon.

Not at all. Every day is like a dream.

245
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,260
Jihong couldn't restrain himself and went too far.

254
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,470
I should have offed Gil Nakwon at least.

What?

256
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,420
My dad stopped me.

I wonder why.

He's like this...

261
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,150
because you go overboard whenever someone brings up Gil Nakwon.

262
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,190
He wants to end it himself.

263

To complete his autobiography on his own.

264

When did I start to go down the wrong path?

265
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,040
I always wondered.

266

As a result,

This is the moment...

343
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,190
when I must do battle with the monster that created me.

344
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,410
This is...

345
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,310
for my beloved Nakwon.
