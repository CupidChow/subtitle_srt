You're ignoring me, right?

3
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,420
You haven't looked at me at all today.

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,940
You only answer my questions.

5
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,510
I'm not ignoring you.

6
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,340
Of course, you are.

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,810
It's okay. I expected you to.

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,160
Let me see your hand.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,180
How is it? Did my mom do an okay job?

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,320
Our classmates will see us.

11
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,520
So what? Can't friends hold hands?

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,160
- Still.
- Come on, now.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,360
You're actually very conservative.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,060
You don't look it, though.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,470
I'll just check if it's still bleeding, okay?

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,640
I told you, no.

17
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,610
Hey. This is awkward for me to say,

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,380
but you're playing so hard to get.

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,470
I just wanted to check on your hand.

20
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,610
I'll just look at it. I won't do anything else.

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,460
- I'll only look.
- Hey, new girl.

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,850
You're Gil Nakwon, correct?

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,230
Your mom was in the same drama as Ji Min oppa, right?

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,800
Could you perhaps get me his autograph?

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,430
Sure, just tell me your name.

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,100
But it could take a while.

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,100
This is awesome!

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,100
Could you get me Ji Min oppa's phone number?

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,800
Mom won't give me that.

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Then just take her phone.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,850
You can't even do that?

32
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,540
No, I can't.

33
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,720
What's this? Did you just get all serious?

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,020
She's acting all high and mighty.

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
So conceited.

36
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,100
Hey, are you all right? Why did you drink so fast?

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,870
Spit it out, spit it out.

38
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,570
Were you thirsty?

39
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,200
Choonho's parents were in the principal's office earlier.

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,880
They threw a huge fit!

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,020
I heard that Hyeonmu didn't show up at school today.

42
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,250
What's that punk planning on doing?

43
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,520
Hey, Choonho received emergency surgery yesterday.

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,320
Hyeonmu will get locked up for sure, this time.

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,790
He beat up the wrong kid. Why him?

46
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,660
Even our principal was begging for forgiveness.

47
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,320
Choonho's dad is doing everything he can

48

But these days, he's smiling even more.

- Okay.

Don't give us too much.

You're not the owner. You'll run low on the side dishes.

You're not the owner either. Why do you care?

Nope.

I'll raise him to be a judge or a prosecutor.

Your husband.

The man you treat like a king.

I guess his behavior is like his good looks.

91
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,610
I saw him with a woman half my size

He wouldn't dare.

100
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,890
All he says is "My Okhee, my Okhee."

101
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,940
Do you know how much he asks for me?

102
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,010
Because he wants to eat.

103
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,510
He knows you're a hard worker, so he wants to leech off of you.

104
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,980
He's a leech.

Why isn't he picking up, again?

126
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,940
Why is it so hard to reach him? How is this normal?

127
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,650
- Is that her?
- She's been acting snooty.

128
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,890
She's showing off because her mom's a celeb.

129
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,630
- She wants attention.
- She acts all innocent.

You know, it's all a show.

153
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,410
He has no money stashed away.

154
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,200

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,280
What's this?

156
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,060
Are you the student

158

Yoon Hyeonmu assault your classmate?

159
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,040
Yes, I am.

160
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,210
However, I didn't witness the assault.

161
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,510
I'm sure other students saw it, though.

162
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,140
The thing is, nobody wants to testify.

163

When I called 119,

164
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,680
I think they recorded what Hyeonmu said beside me.

165
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,710
Perhaps that can be used as evidence.
