Whether it's 1 hour or 2, I don't know a thing.

173
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,950
You must know something.

174
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,920
Yoon Huijae mentioned you by your name...

175
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,930
and said you were the only woman he ever loved.

176
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,040
Did you hear about this book on TV yesterday and today?

177
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,610
It was such a hot topic even before it got released.

178
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,380
This man sure knows how to use the media

179
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,800
and make money.

180
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Even the title is great.

181
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,970
Provocative and shameless. You want to read it.

182
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,990
No other serial killer...

183
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,850
would dare share his story.

184
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,650
It was such a dramatic case

185
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,010
and very infamous.

186
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,050
A famous actress was one of his victims

187
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,650
and he was caught

188
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,960
because his own son turned him in.

189
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,500
Which is why I want to ask you about the son.

190
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,770
He's about to graduate, correct?

191
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,830
Won't he visit you before he graduates?

192
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,010
Why would he visit me?

193
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,250
- Wait, wait.
- Ma'am, please wait!

194
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,870
- Just hear me out while I...
- We're...

195
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,640
Okay, okay, geez!

196
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,290
If you ever mention my son's name

197
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,680
or even his initials in your magazine,

198
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,150
I will track you down

199
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,050
and pull out every single hair on your body!

200
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,080
Then I'll sue you, all.

201
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,030
Do you understand?

202
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,230
Does living with a killer affect you like that?

203
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,890
She's truly tough.

204
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,740
Hello.

205
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,740
Really?

206
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,450
Of course, we should get that story first.

207
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,910
That sounds like a better scoop than this.

208
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,950
Okay, thanks.

209
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,750
What is it now?

210
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,420
We're going to Gyeonggi Province, Yongin next week.

211
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,550
- Pack your bags in advance.
- Where? Yongin?

212
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,760
Why Yongin?

213
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,660
This man wrote high praise about his son

214
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,890
and I thought it was made-up.

215
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,420
But it looks like he had one good son.

216
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,670
He's set to graduate

217
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,430
Summa Cum Laude from the police academy.

218
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,490
Seriously?

219
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,240
But that son

220
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,270
never visited his dad, not once.

221
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,530
Don't you smell it right away?

222
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,570
This sounds fun.

223
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,750
He's also handsome enough to be an idol singer.

224
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,170
It's such a pretty looking story, already.

Did you have to do that

00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,610
- in front of everyone?
- I'm exhausted.

Hey.

232
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,660
Why did you have to

233
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,600
suddenly be so chivalrous

234
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,130
and end up receiving punishment with me?

235
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,870
That was awful.

Were you super worried your Jonghyeon would get hurt?

Sir, I'll get going.

341
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,460
Ready.

342
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,830
Action!

343
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,170
Cut! Okay.

344
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,800
- Let's do the alleyway scene now.
- The alleyway scene!

345
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,640
Let's move.

346
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,290
Ready, action!

347
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,960
Why are you still here?

348
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,690
What if they capture you?

349
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,210
I couldn't at the thought of leaving you.

350
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,370
This was more urgent...

351
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,110
than our country's independence.

352
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,010
Young Master.

353
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,780
My Lady.

354
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,190
Cut. Okay!

355
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,400
Segyeong, that was great acting. You're the best!

356
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,010
I'm News Report's Lee Sangrok.

357
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,770
I'd like to interview you about Yoon Huijae's autobiography.

358
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,490
I'm Cho Joowon from MBS.

359
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,410
If a phone interview is difficult, how about a written interview?

360
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,550
Dojin, have you been well? This is Park Heeyeong.

361
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,250
I'm paying a visit to your father this week.

362
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,390
Even I've been getting interview requests about your father's autobiography.

363
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,770
Can we please meet this time?

364
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,280
I haven't seen your handsome face since you've grown up.

365
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,110
Do me this favor.

366
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,080
