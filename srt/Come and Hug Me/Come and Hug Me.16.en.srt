00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,500
He's on duty.

337
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,230
On duty? Stop joking.

338
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,000
It's so late.

339
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,640
Come with us. Get in the car.

340
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,270
Sorry?

341
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,480
But I...

342
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,950
You came here to watch her anyway.

343
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,610
Why are you out here? Watch her inside the house.

344
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,790
The name is Spring.

345
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:23,060
He reminded me of Lucky at the shelter, so I adopted him.

346
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,890
It's nice to know.

347
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,720
Other than me,

348
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,890
you have someone else who worries about you.

349
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,460
It's him, isn't he?

350
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,730
You liked each other, right?

351
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,730
Yes.

352
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,150
Twelve years ago.

353
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,810
Since twelve years ago,

354
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,780
have your feelings changed?

355
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,040
I don't think so.

356
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,480
Jaeyee,

357
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,750
you became an actress to be happy. Right?

358
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,920
You should keep getting happier, then.

359
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,230
Right.

360
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,860
Detective Chae.

361
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,680
Can you take me home?

362
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,770
If not,

363
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:56,170
she'll insist on taking me home.

364
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
Other than Jaeyee...

365
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,540
No, other than Nakwon,

366
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,910
you've never dated other women. Right?

367
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,530
- What?
- It's obvious.

368
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,750
You've never even held a girl's hand.

369
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,750
In this world...

370
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,310
there's no such thing as, a relationship that won't hurt you.

371
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,710
You know that, right?

372
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,190
Yes.

373
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,360
It hurts.

374
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,320
It hurts for all of us.

375
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,060
How have you been, Namu?

376
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,500
Not bad.

377
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,600
- Brother.
- You haven't changed.

378
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,750
How unfortunate.

379
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,610
Call Nakwon now.

380
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,850
I told you.

381
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,550
I'll destroy people in your life first.

382
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,180
You're next.

383
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,250
Once their hands and feet are tied, humans have no way out.

384
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,700
But there is one solution.

385
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,470
If your hands and feet are tied, bite with your teeth.

386
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,340
That's...

387
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,920
what makes us beasts.
