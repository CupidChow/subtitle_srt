[Episode 3]

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,520
What were you staring at?

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,020
Well...

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,970
I lost my dog.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,430
I found...

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,130
his name tag in front of your door.

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,140
You lost your dog?

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,750
Yes.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,210
You're a bad child.

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,460
You should not sneak into

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,020
other people's homes

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,920
to peek inside just for that.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Dad, she's my friend.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,370
She's the first friend I made at school.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,340
She's my friend.

16
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,570
Nakwon.

17
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,940
Is this your dog?

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,010
Lucky.

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,620
Lucky, look at me. Lucky!

20
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,320
Are you okay? Lucky, what's wrong?

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,420
Lucky.

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,370
Lucky, are you okay?

23
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,330
Lucky.

24
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,820
Are you okay, Lucky?

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,390
Lucky, are you all right?

26
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,610
Poor thing.

27
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,890
Hey, your hand.

28
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,540
So you're Namu's friend.

29
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,340
I had no idea.

30
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,770
I shouldn't have said what I did.

31
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,820
Hello, sir.

32
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,080
I brought the dog home to find its owner.

33
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,370
The sun had set, and his name tag was missing.

34
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,190
It kept raining...

35
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,560
I felt bad for the dog.

36
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,270
I've never seen him around before,

37
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,640
so I thought someone abandoned him.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,740
Why did you keep him in a cage?

39
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,740
I saw a cut around his mouth.

40
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,210
He bit me.

41
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,960
Dogs shouldn't bite people.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,630
He was too violent.

43
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,060
I kept him in the cage until he calmed down.

44
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,130
Otherwise, he would keep biting me.

45
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,160
By the way,

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,770
is he vaccinated?

47
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,440
Yes, he got his vaccinations.

48
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,010
Lucky doesn't usually attack people.

49
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,540
That's what dog owners say about their dogs.

50
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,490
I've raised many dogs.

51
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,420
I also sold many cute dogs.

52
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,630
I'm sorry. I'll let my parents know.

53
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,820
This has never happened before.

54
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,360
It's okay. Things can happen.

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,840
By the way...

56
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,140
Do you live nearby?

57
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,310
Yes, we moved here yesterday.

58
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,930
That's probably why Lucky lost his way.

59
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,730
I had no idea that my son has such a cute girlfriend.

60
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,890
I was not aware.

61
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,960
I'll walk my...

62
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,840
my friend home.

63
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,280
I know where she lives.

64
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,970
Really?

65
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,880
Then you should.

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,580
It's raining and dark.

67
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,120
See you again, pretty friend.

68
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,360
Nakwon, let's go.

69
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,910
Okay.

70
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,240
Good night, sir.

71
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,340
Hey, hey!

72
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,770
- Yoon Hyeonmu is at it again.
- Really?

73
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,700
- I warned you, didn't I?
- What?

74
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,380
Why are you acting up again?

75
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,510
Why? Why are you acting up again?

76
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,510
Don't you dare cross me again.

77
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,980
I'll really kill you next time..

78
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,650
You got it?

79
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,710
He should just drop out. He's not planning on going to college anyway.

80
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,420
Careful or he'll beat us too.

81
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,760
Look at his eyes. He'll kill someone.

82
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,930
What are you looking at, punks?

83
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,960
- What's with that guy?
- Let's go.

84
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,510
I don't get him at all.

85
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,200
Do you guys want a beating, too?

86
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,210
You little...

87
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,060
Are you all right? Can you get up?

88
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,620
Please help me...

89
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,630
It hurts a lot.

90
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,490
Give me your phone.

91
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,990
Thank you.

92
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,600
Hello, is this 119?

93
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,590
This is Gowon High School.

94
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,910
We have an emergency. He's a high school student.

95
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,030
Hey, punk.

96
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,070
What do you think you're doing?

97
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,620
I think he was hit in the abdomen.

98
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,880
Was it your abdomen?

99
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,450
Please come ASAP. We're in the 2nd-floor hallway.

100
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,020
Yes, thank you.

101
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,560
I said, what are you doing, punk?

102
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
Hey.

103
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,880
Do you want to die?

104
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,850
Was it you?

105
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,230
Are you the one who beat him?

106
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,000
What if I am?

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,570
- What are you going to do about it?
- What about you?

108
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,340
What else are you going to do?

109
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,240
If something happens to him,

110
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
what do you think will happen to you?

111
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,740
- What?
- If there's an internal rupture,

112
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,710
delaying things may kill him.

113
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,050
So what?

114
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,680
I don't care if he dies or not.

115
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,520
I don't care about my future.

116
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,220
Shall I...

117
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,690
ruin your life, too?

118
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,060
You.

119
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,040
Have you killed someone before?

120
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,580
- What?
- Do you know what it means...

121
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,480
for you to cause someone's death?

122
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,140
No matter what you do with your life from that point,

123
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,380
there's nothing more disgusting than that.

124
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,460
Muwon,

125
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,830
did you get Nakwon's text?

126
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,120
Nakwon won't pick up her phone.

127
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,570
Hey...

128
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,580
Hey, Namu?

129
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,470
Yoon Namu.

130
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,380
What are you thinking?

131
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,780
Are you angry because I barged into your home without permission?

132
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,780
No.

133
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,080
Then,

134
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,630
is it because I was startled...

135
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,630
after seeing your dad earlier?

136
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,860
Hey, wait.

137
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,590
Come here for a sec.

138
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,540
Are you okay? I totally forgot about this.

139
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,820
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

140
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,960
No, I'm okay.

141
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,620
No, you're not.

142
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,490
Are you really that stupid?

143
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,660
How is this okay? How?

144
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,470
You had a hard time this morning because of me.

145
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,100
Now you're hurt.

146
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,800
But you won't say a thing.

147
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,310
Now you say you're okay and pull your hand away.

148
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,610
- Well,
- If you have an umbrella, use it.

149
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,450
You got all wet while holding it for me.

150
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,380
Who are you? The giving tree?

151
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,250
If you're hurt, then say so.

152
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,410
if you're in pain, then admit it hurts.

153
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,090
Why're you enduring it by yourself?

154
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,830
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,540
I'm the one...

156
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,140
who's sorry.

157
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,070
That's why.

158
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,690
I'm sorry I got mad at you for being sorry.

159
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,520
I'm also sorry for going inside your house without permission.

160
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,060
I'm also sorry for being so startled...

161
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,590
when I saw your dad.

162
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,090
I got scared for nothing.

163
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,830
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,850
I really don't know why I did that earlier.

165
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,820
- Nakwon.
- Yes?

166
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,800
Don't ever...

167
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,330
come to my house again.

168
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,390
Why not?

169
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,660
Also, forget everything

170
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,700
that happened today.

171
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,740
All of it.

172
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,630
Also,

173
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,440
pretend that you don't know me from now on.

174
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,150
I mean it.

175
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,850
Why?

176
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,320
Why should I have to do that?

177
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,440
No one's allowed in my basement. Got it?

178
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,230
Tell me. Why should I have to do that?

179
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,400
Because...

180
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,020
you...

181
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,810
might be in danger.

182
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,880
Nope.

183
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,910
If that's what you want,

184
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,580
fine.

185
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,540
I'll forget about everything from tonight.

186
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,410
I won't ever go to your house again, either.

187
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,510
But you...

188
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,650
I don't want to.

189
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,400
I won't forget about you.

190
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,930
Because... I like you.

191
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,080
Aren't you going to ask me why?

192
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,040
I just met you today, so how can I like you?

193
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,380
Yoon Namu. I mean...

194
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,920
Namu.

195
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,340
I feel like you're...

196
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,120
a genuine tree, just like your name.

197
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,630
That's why I like you.

198
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,600
Because you're like a real tree.

199
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,610
I'm probably not making any sense.

200
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,010
I know, but that's how I feel.

201
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,180
So even if you don't like me,

202
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,110
I'll keep on liking you.

203
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,280
Do you have any complaints...

204
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,880
about me liking...

205
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,460
you?

206
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,880
Whoa.

207
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,030
It was that one touch.

208
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,200
You didn't say that you dislike it,

209
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,290
so I'll continue liking you the way I want...

210
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,430
and act like we're close. Okay?

211
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,530
Let's go. The rain stopped.

212
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,010
The moment we touched,

213
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,880
it was as if the world turned glorious.

214
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,430
Let's go.

215
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,000
The times before I met her...

216
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,830
were no longer part of my memory.

Okay, be right there.

- Hey.

225
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,950
I'm sorry.

226
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,560
Hi, Mom.

227
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,690
Nakwon won't answer...

228
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,960
Muwon, Nakwon just got home.

229
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,260
Muwon,

230
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,630
are you okay?

231
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,360
Yes.

232
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,570
Is she all right?

233
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,540
Of course.

234
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,910
But the thing is,

235
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,740
she brought over a friend.

236
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,750
He seems to be very shy.

237
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,890
So don't worry and come home safely.

238
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,650
Bye.

239
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,560
Namu, where are you?

240
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,530
You left me all alone.

241
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,210
- Let's go.
- Let's go drink some more.

242
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,710
- Silly, I should pay.
- Don't.

243
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,370
Come over to my place.

244
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,640
Okay, let's drink some more.

245
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,350
Oh my goodness!

246
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,780
What's with that look?

247
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,610
What do you think you're doing?

248
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,850
Are you all right? Are you sure?

249
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,730
Where do you think you're going this late at night?

250
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,830
I'm going to mom's restaurant.

251
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,500
What?

252
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,400
Why would you go there by yourself, now?

253
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,700
Why would you care?

254
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
Let's drink until we drop.

255
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,470
- I feel very good.
- Let's go.

256
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,510
Come along.

257
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,640
Yoon Hyeonmu, call me right now.

258
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Don't make things worse.

259
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,800
- I'll pay this time.
- You?

260
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,040
How will you live?

261
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,450
I won't.

262
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,320
- Come over to my house.
- Let's go, then.

263
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,250
Why're you following me?

264
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,350
Never mind me and you go on your way.

265
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,730
Little punk.

266
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,260
Are you sure you're not following me?

267
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,240
You think I'm crazy?

268
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,150
You took in our Lucky thinking...

269
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,170
he was a lost dog?

270
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,850
Did you hurt your hand...

271
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,910
because of Lucky?

272
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,810
No, I did it myself.

273
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,090
Lucky is a sweet dog.

274
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,300
Drink this. It'll warm you up.

275
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,430
You live nearby, correct?

276
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,940
I'll drive you home later.

277
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,800
Is your mom home right now?

278
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,710
My mom's at the restaurant, now.

279
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,680
She works late, I see.

280
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,810
When will she be home?

281
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,930
I don't want her to worry.

282
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,030
All right.

283
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,990
But things like this

284
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,160
will upset her more if she finds out later.

285
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,410
I first met her two years ago.

286
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,040
From then until now,

287
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,850
she's been very worried about me and my brother.

288
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,780
That is why.

289
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,960
When I was eight years old,

290
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,060
my birth mother died.

291
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,920
I see.

292
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,770
I'm very sorry.

293
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,530
I think she's always with me.

294
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,570
She told me that

295
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,870
she'll always be with me.

296
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,290
Please don't tell my stepmom what happened.

297
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,660
Everything tonight was my fault.

298
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,550
If you need to scold someone, please scold me.

299
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,520
Nakwon didn't do anything wrong.

300
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,230
You said...

301
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,460
your name is Namu?

302
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,570
It's a very lovely name.

303
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,740
Come over often, Namu.

304
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,950
And be good friends with Nakwon.

305
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,360
She's strong-willed and does things without thinking.

306
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,630
She's a bit dangerous.

307
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,250
Like a ticking bomb.

308
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,100
I'd like you to look after her for me.

309
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,360
Could you do that?

310
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,530
Yes.

311
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,110
Geez, it's freezing cold.

312
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,510
Mom, I really want some hot chocolate, too.

313
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,150
You're making him uncomfortable.

314
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,400
Why don't you give him some space?

315
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,260
Nope. We're best friends, now.

316
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,570
I announced that I'll continue to like him.

317
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,240
Didn't I?

318
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,940
My daughter is so straightforward.

319
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,480
You never play games...

320
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,110
nor play hard-to-get, right?

321
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,640
What's that? Are you eating?

322
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,820
I guess you could think so.

323
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,620
My face...

324
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,870
could be intimidating for some.

325
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,010
Mom, I want hot chocolate too. No, I'll make my own.

326
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,830
I have my arms and legs.

327
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,510
Where's my piggy?

328
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,850
That troublemaker got into more...

329
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,190
How can you call your

330
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,420
teenange daughter, "piggy"?

331
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,760
Hello, sir.

332
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,600
Oh, hello.

333
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,700
Have a good night.

334
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,310
Thank you

335
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,810
for these.

336
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,140
Sure.

337
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,290
I'll make you more when you finish.

338
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,510
Bring your sister next time.

339
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,420
Namu, it's cold. Wear this.

340
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,060
You could catch a cold.

341
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,040
There you go.

342
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,040
All right, get home safe.

343
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,210
And be good friends with... no.

344
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,150
Keep a good distance but still be good friends.

345
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,510
You know it's wrong to bully others, right?

346
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,030
Even though our Nakwon's slightly odd,

347
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,930
try to understand, like Jesus or Buddha.

348
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,790
Stop it, really!

349
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,690
Are you really my dad?

350
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,560
Bye, Namu. See you tomorrow.

351
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,800
Those are my clothes.

352
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,530
Were you at my house?

353
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,790
Hello.

354
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,860
I suppose...

355
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,310
Nakwon was with you.

356
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,810
My apologies.

357
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,380
She's my one and only sister.

358
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,920
I don't care if you spend time with her.

359
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,050
But don't make me worry like today,

360
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,290
ever again.

361
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,520
I'm asking you a favor, and

362
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,390
also giving a warning.

363
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:53,690
Hello? Sohjin is here.

364
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,890
Your brother—

365
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,530
Hyeonmu brought her here.

366
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,360
Okay.

367
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,560
Geez, what's going on?

368
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,410
Hey, Hyeonmu.

369
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,930
What is that?

370
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,510
Are those blood stains?

371
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,070
Did you fight again?

372
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,270
- Did you get hurt?
- Of course, not.

373
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,980
No one can beat me.

374
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,110
Then, this is someone else's blood?

375
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,220
My god, what's wrong with you?

376
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,260
How will you make up for what you've done?

377
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,130
It's not your concern.

378
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,520
You don't care much about me anyhow.

379
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
What did you say?

380
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,760
Namu kisses up to you and calls you mother.

381
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,410
You only care about him.

382
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,060
He's smart and he listens to you.

383
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,770
As for me?

384
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,380
Nobody cares about me.

385
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,570
It's all right.

386
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,320
You're not the first.

387
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,890
The other women were also like that.

388
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,190
How can you say such a thing?

389
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,050
Even if I couldn't treat you like my own son for the past two years,

390
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,850
I still cooked and washed your clothes.

391
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,660
I even gave you an allowance.

392
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,400
How can you speak to me that way?

393
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,960
Let's get going, now.

394
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,040
My clothes will smell.

395
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,480
Why didn't you tell Dad before leaving?

396
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,220
You said that he was home at the time.

397
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,920
Why did you leave without saying anything?

398
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,710
It's because...

399
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,630
Why? Did he scold you?

400
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,580
Mommy.

401
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,200
To be honest...

402
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,970
What did you say?

403
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,660
Did you walk your cute friend home?

404
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,730
Yes.

405
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,980
Namu,

406
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,780
do you remember what I told you on the hill?

407
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,600
Of course, you do. You're smart.

408
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,020
You usually don't forget what you see and hear.

409
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,260
- Yes.
- What did I tell you?

410
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,890
Tell me my exact words.

411
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,610
People like us...

412
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,830
and the dog I saved earlier.

413
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,170
What's the difference?

414
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,920
Nothing.

415
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,620
We're the same.

416
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,610
We're both animals.

417
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,530
Yeah, that's right.

418
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,280
Humans are animals...

419
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,150
who prey on each other.

420
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,530
This world's a huge cage where the humans are locked up in.

421
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,790
The weak won't last.

422
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,000
Only the strong survive.

423
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,670
In this cage-like world,

424
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,550
that's the only way to survive.

425
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,000
Did you see that?

426
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,740
Only merciless strength is what makes you strong.

427
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,170
Sympathy or affection...

428
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:08,270
only makes humans weak and pathetic.

429
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,280
Those have no value in our lives.

430
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,480
You must become strong like me.

431
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,070
You know what?

432
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,860
I only trust my children.

433
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,190
It's only my children...

434
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,730
who will not stab me in the back.

435
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,100
That's right.

436
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,400
That's my boy.

437
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,540
That's my blood, indeed.

438
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,570
From now on,

439
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,910
don't do anything dangerous like that.

440
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,410
Don't go into my basement workshop without my permission.

441
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,490
Don't ever disobey me again.

442
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,920
Or I'll get furious.

443
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,600
Do you understand?

444
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,490
Yes.

445
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,010
Okay.

446
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,100
You should get some sleep for school, tomorrow.

447
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,970
You excel at everything.

448
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,910
You are the only son that I'm proud of.

449
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,720
You're different from Hyeonmu.

450
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,760
You've never disappointed me, not once.

451
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,130
Good night, my son.

452
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,460
You're my precious.

453
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,170
You're my treasure.

454
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,920
If you can't get rid of it,

455
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,970
I'll do it for you.

456
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,290
Every useless thing...

457
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,990
that puts you in any danger.

458
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,860
Nothing can exist...

459
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,580
for humans to become strong.

460
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,960
So get rid of it.

461
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,320
Get rid of all the obstacles.

462
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,870
No.

463
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,210
I won't forget you.

464
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,620
Because I like you.

465
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,210
Namu, wear this.

466
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,060
You could catch a cold.

467
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,690
You're like a genuine tree, just like your name.

468
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,250
That's why I like you.

469
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,960
You're just like a real tree.

470
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,070
I'll protect you from everything that makes you...

471
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,780
weak and pathetic.
