Can you slowly repeat that?

I'll watch and listen carefully.

Hello.

21
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,130
It's hard to keep my eyes open.

22
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,890
Your outfit is bright on top of your amazing looks.

23
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,360
You're so bright, so it's difficult to look at you.

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,670
It's due to the light being focused directly on me.

25
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,560
It's also because of my pricey outfit.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
In your movie,

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,870
you meet your childhood crush after you become a college student.

28
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,810
Then the two of you separate once again.

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,280
It was so sad.

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,450
Jaeyee, do you have a similar experience?

31
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,680
Yes.

32
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,170
I never attended high school.

33
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,140
so I wasn't a student for very long.

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,670
But at that age, we all have crushes.

35
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,040
While we're at it,

36
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,380
can you tell us your ideal type?

37
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,060
Just...

38
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,860
Someone that brings up emotions when I lay my eyes upon him.

39
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,230
Hey,

40
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,800
being hungry is not an excuse.

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,010
You can't keep swallowing your snot...

42

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,950
Does it taste good?

44
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,110
Hey, I have to eat, you know.

45
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,770
I had a couple of egg whites...

46
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,280
and only half an apple all day.

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,250
That may be, but...

48
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,860
Jaeyee, hang in there.

49
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,730
I'll allow you to eat...

50
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,320
all types of meat after the award ceremony today.

51
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,970
- Do you really mean it?
- Of course.

52
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,490
So stop eating your snot or you will get too full.

53
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,490

As the back of their heads were struck,

125
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,900
the weapon was probably a blunt object...

126
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,230
like a hammer.

127
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,800
Yet, there is a 0.5cm difference in the scars' sizes.

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,630
The culprit may have used a different hammer,

129
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,040
or it may indicate that someone else committed the crime.

130

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,420
so she held onto her head and crouched.

133
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,960
Park Suchan was beaten over and over,

134
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,810
so he fainted before he could fight back.

135

It was rainy when the second incident occurred.

136
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,590
This man in a raincoat...

137
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,350

just before and after the two incidents.

147
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,750
After that, we considered the assumed physical traits...

148
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,360
of the suspect, which the NFS provided,

149
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,000
to narrow down the number of these individuals.

150
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,460
First, Namgil and Dojin, get ready for a stakeout.

00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,020
I asked you to stop following me around.

169
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,150
I plan to be around you always.

170
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,250
Are you guys hungry? I'll bring a small snack.

171
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,270
I saw that you were nominated for the award for the best new actress.

172
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,910
Yes. I'm lucky.

173
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,900
Don't get your hopes up.

174
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,700
Oh Suyeon is going to win.

175
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,380
Just get ready to applaud...

176
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,350
when the other nominees are seen on screen.

177
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,340
You're still a novice.

178
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,060
You can't conceal your feelings.

179
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,760
I'm no longer like that.

180
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,660
I have a poker face.

181
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,260
What a joke.

182
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,200
No, it's true.

183
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,240
Gosh, it's Cheon Segyeong.

184
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,700
Where is this?

185
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,200
"Chugae Island, Bokja's Hair Salon"?

186
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,410
That was when I lived on an island.

187
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,620
That was when I lived on an island.

188
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,180
It was a hair salon that focused on perms.

189
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,920
I had a part-time job there.

190
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,500
Was the owner's name Bokja?

191
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,960
Yes... But I shampooed...

192
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,500
the hair of all the old ladies who lived there.

193
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,330
I massaged their heads...

194
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,460
and dyed their grey hair.

195
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,040
Whenever the old ladies were going to a party or a show,

196
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
I would roll their hair up...

197
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,770
and dry it with great care.

198
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,810
I had...

199
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,310
a lot of detailed experience...

200
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,920
and practice.

201
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,530
This place...

202
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,730
is frequented by celebrities.

203
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,290
You're not here to volunteer at a senior home.

204
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,970
My mom ran a restaurant for a long time there.

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,960
I've had a lot of customer service.

206
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,330
If you choose me,

207
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,280
I'll give it my all. Wish me luck.

208
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,240
- Sir.
- Are you done?

209
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,970
You're leaving? Goodbye.

210
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,470
- Bye.
- See you again.

211
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,610
Goodbye.

212
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,850
Gosh.

213
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,490
What?

214
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,700
Wasn't that Han Jaeyee?

215
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,620
I can't believe I actually saw her.

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,700
Everyone's talking about how delicious your food is.

217
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,740
We will promote your business

218
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,600
with a storefront sign.

219
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,450
I said I'm not interested.

220
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,170
I don't care for fame.

221
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,380
Don't be that way. Come on.

222
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,820
Hello.

223
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,150
- Your letter was returned.
- Thanks.

224
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,900
What's this? I haven't seen a handwritten letter in forever.

225
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,030
Get lost!

226
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,760
[To Yoon Hyeonmu, Letter to be returned]

227
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,440
Yes, that's right.

228
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,180
I never received a reply,

229
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,120
but this is the first time my letter came back to me.

230
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:22,560
I was worried something happened to him.

231
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,590
What?

232
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,920
Yoon Hyeonmu was paroled on the last day of last month.

233
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,230
Then, you haven't a clue where he went?

234
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,800
I don't.

235
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,550
Random attacks against unsuspecting civilians...

236
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,050
for no apparent reason are on the rise.

237
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,660
Here you go. Enjoy your meal.

238
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,950
The recent attacks...

239
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,920
I hadn't smelled the stench of pork in a long time.

240
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,300
The victims suffered from blows to the head with a blunt object...

241
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,800
I can't believe such crazies exist.

242
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,870
How could someone commit such an act toward another human being?

243
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,770
That's so vicious. They're targeting just anyone.

244
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,700
Darn it.

245
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,670
I can't eat due to the noisiness.

246
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,150
Anyone may become a target anywhere...

247
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,350
Shush, mister.

248
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,310
You're killing my appetite.

249
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,420
They were beaten up beyond recognition.

250
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,550
At 12:30 a.m...

251
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,820
in Yangju Tunnel on the Yeongdong Highway to Gangneung,

252
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,180
the car of 27-year-old...

253
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,620
Yuck, the food is gross.

254
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,330
Do you think you can compete?

255
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,440
That lady over there makes fantastic pork soup.

256
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,860
Can't you make a greater effort?

257
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,800
Don't be lazy just because you're not young.

258
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,550
His blood alcohol level was 0.176 percent,

259
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,400
and he was driving in the wrong direction.

260
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,850
[Pork Soup]

261
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,930
[Pork Soup]

262
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,500
Come on, we should get another drink.

263
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,670
- Another round?
- Yes.

264
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,840
That sounds good.

265
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,850
It seems we will be staying up tonight, too.

266
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,650
It's so stuffy in here.

267
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,820
Geez. Hang on.

268
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,400
- I'll take a look.
- What?

269
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,270
Hey!

270
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,120
We love you. We love you!

271
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,550
- We love you!
- You're wonderful!

272
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,550
Over here!

273
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,220
Over here!

[We love you forever]

Cheon Segyeong!

276
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,630
Cheon Segyeong is definitely one of our best actresses.

277
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,670
Yes. She's very elegant.

278
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,470
Jaeyee, there are many more people than I imagined.

279
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,840
Will you be all right?

280
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,510
Yes, of course. I even stopped taking my medication.

281
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,800
I'm definitely fine.

282
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,700
Don't be too nervous.

283
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,420
I don't think you'll win anyway.

284
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,620
Who said she won't win?

285
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,050
Everyone I know says that the winner will be Oh Suyeon.

286
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,160
Although everyone you know says that Oh Suyeon will win,

287
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,350
you should not.

288
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,000
At least you should claim...

289
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,300
that Jaeyee will win.

290
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,830
You're one of us.

291
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,630
Leave it; it's fine.

292
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,090
Whoever is meant to win will win.

293
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,970
But your dress is so long.

294
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,900
Be careful so you don't trip on it.

295
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,080
Why should I try not to trip?

296
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,850
I should try to trip on something.

297
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,250
What?

298
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,080

You're pretty! You're so pretty!

305
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,600
Jaeyee is definitely in the running for the Best-dressed award.

306
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,020
She looks beautiful.

307
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,780
Yes, she's dazzling.

308
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,050
She sure is. The word "dazzling"...

309
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,960
Oh my, she just tripped on the steps.

310
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,320
- Didn't she look cute?
- She did.

311
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,990
People will call her "Trip Up Girl" from now on.

312
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,230
Probably.

313
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,430
I can just hear it now... people typing her name online.

314
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,030
Me too. It's nice to see her getting up by herself.

315
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,030
- She is truly a rising star.
- I agree.

316
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,140
Is it online?

317
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,010
She really is something.

318
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,370
She surely does what she claims she will do.

319
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,610
You should take pointers from her. She never wastes a chance.

320
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,480
That's a true professional.

- What do you think?

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,010

324
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,810
- His walk?
- Yes.

325
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,640
The man on the camera...

326
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,550
just had an average gait.

327
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,870
His is asymmetrical.

328
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,220
I'll go back to the car.

329
