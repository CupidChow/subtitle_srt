Do you think you caught me?

- What did you say?
- You didn't nab me.

12
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,610
It's my kid.

13
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,480
My child stabbed me in the back.

14
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,080
My kid was the predator.

If you can't destroy them,

Something like that occurred even outside...

37
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,490
I can't know what happens outside.

38
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,960
I stayed carefree.

At first glance, it might look righteous,

but you have to know is that the public is shallow.

I'll help you organize your side of the story...

171

and publish your words verbatim without any alterations.

172
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,460
You're only trying to cover a story...

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,410
for a famous victim's family.

- Two days ago, Nakwon fainted...

while doing an event at the police academy.

178
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,790
One student helped her then.

179
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,920
I don't think you have a clue about who that person was.

Should I send you a picture?

182

We didn't think you'd agree,

As agreed upon, we will block out your face.

[Ji Hye Won's daughter, Han Jaeyee, confesses her feelings]

190

To get right to the point,

191
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,690
my father's autobiography...

192
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,560
is all a lie.

193
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,540
There is not...

194
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,050
a single word of truth.

195
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,720
So if you're buying that book,

196
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,690
you're not buying an offender's atonement or repentance.

He just wants to be in the spotlight one more time

You'll be paying...

199

for a murderer's arrogant thoughts.

200
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,990
That book...

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,360
is merely a trophy for him.

202
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,300
My father...

203
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,740
isn't someone who would repent.

204
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,700
He doesn't have the capacity for emotions...

205
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,700
he is a psychopath.

206
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,220
Don't be fooled by that book.

You volunteered to interview. Are you okay at this moment?

I was afraid something like this might happen.

210
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,560
It's something you can't avoid as an actress,

211
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,260
but I didn't want my past as a victimized family...

212
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,070
to be revealed by someone else.

213
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,730
This is a type of violence.

214
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,270
However, those who used violence only became notorious.

215

His autobiography is selling even better now...

216
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,480
because people are curious.

my mother, and the other victims.

219
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,460
Which is why this is an opportunity to speak my mind.

both of you told me you're rooting for me.

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,660
As an actress, publicity of any sort is crucial.

I told you not to say their real names.

Also, you said that exposure was never mentioned.

227

Who cares if she did or not?

No, it's not good.

Don't give me your pity.

I don't want the attacker's pity.

I don't need your disgusting support.
