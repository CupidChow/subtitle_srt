So, do you think Jaeyee will be okay?

170
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,320
Yeonsil, is she the one causing trouble?

171
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,830
Thanks to her, all articles about the start of my film shoot didn't go viral.

172
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,280
The reporter made an odd statement earlier.

What do you mean?

174
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,440
It was concerning Yoon Huijae.

175

The serial killer. You don't know about this?

I heard that you say whatever you want to say when you talk to Yoonsung.

180

Why are you being so submissive in front of me?

Are you trying to test me?

182

No.

Don't play such a cheap trick.

It's true...

192
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,700
that you have been...

193

197
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,680
When you were starting out...

198
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,780
When you were filming your first drama,

199
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,030
you were in a situation...

200
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,060
where things were more difficult than my situation now.

201
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,230
Nevertheless, you showed bravery.

202
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,490
You were so diligent.

203
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,740
I hear that made you look beautiful.

204
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,050
I heard this from my mother.

205
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,970
What?

206
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,620
What do you mean?

207
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:47,320
That's why. I always wanted to surprise you,

208
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,050
with happiness inside me.

209
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,920
It would be my pleasure.

210

I really appreciated that you spoke to me.

211

That's my first time hearing about it.

Well, I have a lot to say,

but let's speak casually off the record. Next time...

There won't be a next time.

You were the two children at that scene, nine years ago.

If the story I write on Jaeyee is moving,

233
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,100
I believe that would be problematic. She's famous, after all.

- It's about your interview...
- The title is kind of bad.

246
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,090
Anyway, if you look at the article now,

247
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,390
it's pretty much a preview of the autobiography.

248
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,090
Have you read it? It's pretty interesting.

249

What do you mean?

250
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,480
Yoon Huijae never had a warm meal during his childhood.

251
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,900
If he was never loved, would he be able to love someone else?

252
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,400
Would it be possible if it's his son? That was the question.

253
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,900
I felt something like pity for a fellow human being.

254
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,750
We blame our environment when we're unhappy.

255
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,720
We blame our parents.

256
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,710
Don't you think that's why Yoon Huijae says he's not different from us?

257
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,650
Do you believe everything he wrote?

258
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,720
Of course I don't believe everything, but a lot of it is true.

259
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,900
His mother died in a car crash when he was in elementary school

260
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,860
and his father abused him.

261
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,430
He was a victim of domestic violence.

262
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:20,410
If there had been just one person who was able to help him...

263
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:26,510
That assumption cannot be applied to a criminal who committed murder.

264
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,810
The moment a person commits a crime which can't be taken back,

265
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:35,390
that person does not deserve pity or understanding.

For the reason that he had a bad childhood...

274
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,320
and maybe because he was a monster that society made,

275
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,620
should we offer him compassion and pity?

276

What I'm trying to say is even a criminal who committed the most heinous crime...

277

has rights as a human being.
