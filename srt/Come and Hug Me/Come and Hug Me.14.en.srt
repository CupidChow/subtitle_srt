Episode 14]

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,350
It's also been a long time since I've been here,

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,620
but he's your child.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,520
Those are strong words.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,830
You're not the same anymore, either.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,570
You probably know this. I've been busy due to my show.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,440
I came just yesterday,

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,500
but someone beat me to it.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,510
People do visit me now and then.

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,680
Are they from PWLY?

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,370
"People Who Love Yoon Huijae," right?

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,320
In 2007, they formed a club, right?

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,490
You even received love letters.

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,820
Who needs celebrities?

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,070
You're as attractive as they are.

18

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,930
They could be a celebrity or a criminal.

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,810
Three years ago, your youngest son was on television.

21
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,400
Were you aware of his popularity?

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,070
Surely you have some thoughts about this.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,760
I'm want to know why the two of you became estranged.

24
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,760
It's because of that, isn't it?

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,030
It's in Chapter 12 of your autobiography.

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,800
"That Night."

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,640
That night's incident destroyed your relationship.

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,740
I was going over that section again,

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,470
and it seemed a bit boring.

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,850
Your son appeared...

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,980
and defended his friend, so you stepped back.

32
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,020
It's reasonable...

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,460
but something that doesn't seem you'd do.

34
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,500
Is it because it's been some time?

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,120
You seem to be bringing up many insignificant details.

36
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,910
Haven't you read the article?

37
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,330
Dojin and Han Jaeyee...

38
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,910
No.

39
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,740
Yoon Namu and Gil Nakwon.

40
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,720
They are together again and clingy with each other.

41
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,080
It's not official yet,

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,320
but a weapon was sent to Nakwon in the mail.

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,880
What was it?

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,030
During her brief 28 years,

45
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,450
she was able to hold her own during hardships of all types...

46
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,470
but the moment she saw it, she fainted.

47
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,440
Then I looked at your autobiography again,

48
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,160
and one thing entered my mind so clearly.

49
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,880
A hammer.

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,550

52

Psychosis isn't something...

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,200
you can control or suppress.

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,470
I suppose your weakness...

55
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,500
still is...

56

57

58

59

60

I've put in some money for you.

61
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,660
Are you giving me alms?

62
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,160
Why don't we consider it as payment for doing this interview?

63
