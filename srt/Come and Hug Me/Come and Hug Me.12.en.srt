169
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,480
You'd have been devastated if the supermarket wasn't open.

170
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,550
You ought to slow down. You may fall ill.

171
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,940
I won't take your share.

172
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,910
- Moowon.
- What?

173
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,450
It's so yummy.

174
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,780
Want me to cook something more?

175
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,460
Anything you make tastes the best.

176
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,070
I'm sorry I don't come home more often.

177
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,970
No matter where you are, I just want you to be okay.

178
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,470
Now I can see you, am talking with you, and eating with you...

179
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,910
every once in a while will suffice for me.

180
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,670
Nakwon.

181
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,470
- Today...
- Moowon.

182
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,580
I'm not a 16-year-old now.

183
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,220
I can handle my problems.

184
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
Don't be so concerned.

185
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,850
I'm sorry I always act childish when you're around.

186
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,560
For struggling on my own.

187
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,200
Don't say that, Nakwon.

188
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,840
Don't say such things to me.

189
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,810
Let's eat.

190
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,740
Eat as much as you can. Here.

[To Nakwon]

196
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,510
Is it from Moowon?

197
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,390
Congratulations, Jaeyee!

198
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,260
Han Jaeyee, Han Jaeyee.

199
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,250
Han Jaeyee! Jaeyee, what's wrong?

200
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,950
Well, I'm unfamiliar with sign language.

201
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,470
What would you like to say?

202
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,450
Can you slowly repeat that?

203
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,860
I'll watch and listen carefully.

204
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,920
(I've always been fond of you.
So much that my heart might explode.)

205
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,820
(Come a bit closer.)

206
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,440
I'm sorry.

207
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,670
I told you to inform me if you were injured

208
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,640
I told you not to bear it alone.

209
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,590
You liar.

210
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,850
Mr. Yoon Huijae,

211
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,270
you're not the same as you were three years ago.

212
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,270
You realize this, right?

213
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,130
Yes.

214
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,720
It was too late when I realized that I had done wrong.

215
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,810
The rest of my life will be filled with regret.

216
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,800
It's a burden I must take on.

217
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,110
Right.

218
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,180
Everyone has regrets.

219
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,420
We should feel sorry for those who don't know about regret.

220
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,730
Knowing how to regret is also...

221
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,920
a way of redemption.

222
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,360
Is that true?

223
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,190
Of course.

224
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,460
Ma'am.

225
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,870
I heard that you've been here for more than two decades.

226
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,560
When you come across someone like me,

227
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,180
what comes to mind?

228
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm curious.

229
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,310
Here's what I see.

230
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,620
All I see is someone...

231
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,140
sitting in front of me.

232
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,910
Sitting like this...

233
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,060
is all I see.

234
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,030
I see.

235
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,030
By the way,

236
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,840
is redemption...

237
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,740
that simple?

238
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:19,160
[Han Jaeyee]

239
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,050
The family of the celebrity, Han Jaeyee,

240
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,200
was murdered in 2006 by a serial killer.

241
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,890
Han Jaeyee is the daughter of Ji Hyewon.

242
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,560
Two days ago, she fainted.

243
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,800
The cause was PTSD, not exhaustion.

244
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,210
The conclusion was...

245
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,300
that stress had caused her to faint.

246
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,440
The tragedy isn't over. She's a victim of a criminal.

247

[Who is the Man Han Jaeyee Met at the Hospital?]

248
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,060
Number 4846.

249
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,090
A visitor is here to see you.

250
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,210
I can't visit him?

251
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,180
Only one visitor is allowed to visit him each day.

252
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,550
Does that mean someone came to see him before me?

253
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,640
Yes, it seems so.

254
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,330
Is it someone famous?

255
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,800
You're here.

256
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,320
Isn't this you?

257
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,640
Someone saw you there.

258
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,930
Are you able to recognize me even if my face is concealed?

259
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,940
Didn't you realize that I'm a fan of hers?

260
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,480
My abdomen was slashed like this,

261
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,780
so I was rushed to the hospital.

262
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,310
I'm glad that I was attacked that day.

263
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,940
Excuse me?

264
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,980
Hello.

265
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,080
I'll be responsible for your case.

266
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
I'm Detective Chae Dojin.

267
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,890
I know.

268
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,850
Chae Dojin.

269
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,790
Detective.

270
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,940
I can read Korean, too.

271
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,200
That's why we may have to separate for a while,

272
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,450
but we will be reunited someday.
