00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,470
Hello, Namu.

3
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,140
Do you feel better now?

4
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,210
Yes.

5
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,060
Let's go.

6
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,050
I'll tell you the directions instead of the GPS.

7
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,890
Just listen to my directions, okay?

8
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,420
Where are we going?

9
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,070
We're going to three places, and they're commonplaces.

10
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,300
What?

11
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,190
We never got to do what everyone else does.

12
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,740
Turn left over there.

13
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,110
Keep going straight.

14

Listen.

15
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,360
Don't you think it's better to use the GPS?

16
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,120
We might get into an accident.

17
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,160
No, we can't use it.

18
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,060
Why? Is it uncomfortable?

19
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,370
It's...

20
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,590
It's hard to drive.

21
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,670
Why?

22
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,090
Namu, have you ever dated anyone?

23
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,260
What?

24
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,040
I was talking to Segyeong on the phone yesterday.

25
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,870
You really have never dated anyone other than me?

26
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,890
Nakwon, you should look straight.

27
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,070
No, I'm going to look at you as much as I want.

28
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,720
I need to cleanse my eyes.

29
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,600
I've seen too many bad things these days.

30
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,430
I want to see what I wanted to, but couldn't. I'm going to look at you all day.

31
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,770
This is great.

32

You are progressive, aren't you?

33
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,680
Why am I so hot?

34
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,860
- Are you hot?
- What? Yes.

35
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,330
Keep driving. Don't worry about me.

Aren't there many trees?

Yes.

39
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,460
You're right.

40
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,140
I came here alone sometimes when I missed you.

41
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,680
It's a place where trees are everywhere.
(Namu means "tree" in Korean)

42

They all reminded me of you.

You should have taken it when we offered a new TV.

You don't you feel bad now that time has passed?

What if she becomes your daughter-in-law?

63
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,220
That'd be too shocking.

actually scared of being caught.

155

He tried to strike his son with a hammer to kill him.

156
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,330
And, to survive, it seems like the son...

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,910
took away Yoon Huijae's hammer...

158

and struck his father as well.

159

If you look at the last page of his autobiography,

160

he even tried to murder his own son.

168
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,360
He was nothing but a heartless murderer.

December 24, 2016.

170
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,240
On Christmas Eve,

171
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,340
one happy family was brutally destroyed...

172
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,750
in a white house on a hill.

173
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,250
In the house, blood stains were everywhere,

174
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,420
and there was a serial killer...

175
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,850
who would kill his own child in order to get away,

176
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,780
as well as a 16-year-old son who tried...

177
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,920
to kill his own father in order to survive.

178
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
To kill their own blood,

179
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,540
only the murderous intent,

180
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,640
filled the house.

181
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,040
You don't know anything about your little brother.

182
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,950
That's why you've been failing as a big brother.

183
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,910
Hyeonmu,

184
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,160
you'll never be able to beat your brother.

Is the third place you wanted to visit...

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,340
- is it here?
- Yes.

It closes in an hour.

Most of the people left. Isn't it great?

192
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,790
That. Let's ride that.

193
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,370
It goes too high.

194
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,760
Why? Are you scared?

195
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,500
Then, what about that?

196
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,560
You can't ride that either?

197
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,460
What about that?

198
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,080
How do I look?

199
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
We look weird.

It suits us.

This is it.

- Can I take a photo?
- Go ahead.
