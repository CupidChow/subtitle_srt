You said that Jaeyee is home, right?

14
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,750
Yes, I just spoke to her on the phone.

15
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,760
I told her to take the day off because the shoot was canceled.

Her cell keeps blocking incoming calls.

That's a sign that her phone has been hacked. Correct?

Yes, that case...

Didn't you dig around more than enough?

There was one thing I couldn't figure out.

156
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,500
When Yoon Huijae was caught,

157
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,260
I remember he had a big injury over here.

158
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,430
Oh, that? That was quite mysterious for us, too.

159
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,660
He never told us about it until the end.

160
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,830
Some said that he hurt himself...

161
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,430
because he was scared that he'll get caught.

162

Some said that a truck...

163

pushed him over and he got hurt.

164
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,070

how that part was left out from the investigation.

166

Oh, jeez. He said he was fine.

167
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,390
It seems silly...

168
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,960
to investigate further on that case.

169
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,150
We don't have anything that wasn't cleared.

is more impossible, don't you agree?

173
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,510
How about your eldest son, Congressman Jang Cheolyoo?

174
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,940
I know he got into a bar fight.

175
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,300
Isn't he having a hard time?

176
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,470
I could do a special report on it.

177
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,740
Let's get things straight.

178
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,390
Let me clear any misunderstanding.

179
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,670
People have the right to know.

180
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,240
That's my duty as a public official.

181
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,890
Namu.

182
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

183
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,830
Namu,

184
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,210
why are you still sorry?

185
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,340
I told you that it's not your fault.

186
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,650
But you'll always be sorry.

187
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,390
Right?

188
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,230
Is this why...

189
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,760
you kept all of your promises?

190
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,660
It's what you told me.

191
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,910
You told me to keep them.

192
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,430
However...

193
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,420
Why didn't you come and find me?

194
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,110
Why was that the only promise you didn't keep?

195
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:40,200
[Police Academy]

196
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,910
I was sorry.

197
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,050
I was very sorry.

198
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,720
That's why I couldn't.

199
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,300
Nakwon,

200
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,590
whenever you want,

201
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,540
however you want,

202
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,370
whenever you need me,

203
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,640
use me.

204
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,420
If you get tired of me,

205
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,690
you can leave me.

206
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,350
Whoever I am,

207
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,700
whoever my father is...

208
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,630
If it's even a bit okay with you...

209
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,700
If anyone hears what I'm about to say,

210
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,650
they'll call me crazy.

211
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,120
Even if...

212
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,710
your brother was the one who did that today...

213
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,610
Namu,

214
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,430
it brought me to you.

215
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,730
So I'm...

216
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,730
I'm happy.

217
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,270
Ma'am.

218
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,800
You hurt your hand.

219
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,180
Is it because of Lucky?

220
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,210
Drink this.

221
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,540
You'll get warm.

222
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,420
Wear this, Namu. It's cold.

223
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,810
You're going to catch a cold in this weather.

224
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,940
Come over often from now on.

225
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,060
Be friendly with my Nakwon.

226
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,800
Sometimes she's in her own world.

227
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,640
She can be impulsive...

228
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,870
and that's dangerous.

229
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,370
She can be like a ticking bomb.

230
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,310
Stay with her and make sure she's safe.

231
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,410
Can you do that for me?

232
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,320
I'm sorry.
