This is real.

8
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:40,479
I think I fell asleep listening to you talk last night.

9
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,159
I just wanted to see you before I went to work.

10

I can't sleep well.

11
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,028
Because you're not there on the sofa.

Why did you do something so uncharacteristic of you?

You called him the son of a murderer and was biased.

Yoon Hyeonmu, the defendant...

169
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,740
is here today on four charges including...

170
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,250
special violence, violent robbery,

171
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,218
attempted murder, and criminal negligence.

172
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,389
His crimes are inhuman

173
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,590
and they cannot be forgiven.

174
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,890
On top of that,

175
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:30,659
there were crimes he committed while on parole.

176
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:33,490
Therefore, he will receive additional punishment.

177
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,200
However, the accused has admitted to his faults...

178
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,730
and deeply regrets it...

179
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,769
As a result,

Yoon Huijae, Yeom Jihong, and Jeon Yoora...

of special escape and aiding an escape.

00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:07,380
The trial had to be delayed because of a disturbance.

At first, Yeom stayed quiet...

until Yoon made a derogatory comment about Yeom.

233

Enraged by this, Yeom attempted to attack Yoon...

234
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:23,568
and caused chaos in court.

235
