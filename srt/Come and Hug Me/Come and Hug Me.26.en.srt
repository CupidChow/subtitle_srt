00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,870
I saw you with Han Jaeyee.

169
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,590
Would you mind doing an interview?

170
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,080
I won't ask questions about Han Jaeyee's personal life.

171
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,920
We have to arrest Yoon Huijae.

172
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,820
I promise to move...

173
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,460
the public opinion.

174
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,870
This way, we'll find him faster.

175
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,080
Gangnam Police Station's Violent Crimes 1, Lieutenant Chae Dojin,

176
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,090
we found the vehicle you were searching for.

177
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,320
The license plate number is 61N0164.

178
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,320
The current location is 59, Hyeonyi neighborhood, Gangnam district.

179
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,420
There's no one in the vehicle.

180
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,070
No.

181
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,360
Hi, Nakwon.

182
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,920
Remember me?

183
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,890
I rescued you on the film set.

184
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,800
What?

185
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,300
And inside this garage, Yoon Namu and you...

186
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,980
I could've murdered you both, but I allowed you both to leave.

187
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,180
But Yoon Namu dared to mock me.

188
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,520
So I'm going to make you cry again.

189
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,340
You dare lay a finger on her?

190
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,230
Shall I bash you with a hammer?

191
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,110
Or would it better to shred you to bits?

192
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,740
No.

193
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,490
I'll simply murder you.

194
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,220
Did you want a bloody hammer that bad?

195
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,370
That's what makes you weak.

196
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,900
Where's Yoon Huijae?

197
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,870
Where's Yoon Huijae? Tell me...

198
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,910
unless you no longer want to live.

199
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,660
You're fighting back.

200
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,390
Have you no fear?

201
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,190
Then I'll kill you.

202
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,430
Namu!

203
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,220
Give it to me. I can pass it on.

204
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,530
It weighs a ton. Let a strong man carry it for you.

205
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,670
You seem to be weaker than I am.

206
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,170
How could that be?

207
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,160
Do you want to test my strength?

208
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,010
Stop it. Let's go.

209
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,180
Why won't it go higher?

210
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,350
Namu.

211
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,850
Yes?

212
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,620
Is it true you're fine?

213
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,870
Don't you feel any pain?

214
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,400
It hurts.

215
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,970
Why did you do that?

216
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,280
Because of me?

217
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,200
It's not like that.

218
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,940
I just got...

219
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,750
carried away.

220
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,650
If I frightened you, I'm sorry.

221
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,450
I won't do it again.

222
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,060
Namu, I'm fine.

223
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,980
I said I'd never be hurt again.

224
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,220
I'm just fine, all right?

225
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,870
Will you really not go inside?

226
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,720
She doesn't want me in her sight.

227
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,910
How do you know that she doesn't want to see you?

228
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,460
I don't dare go inside.

229
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm leaving.

230
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,330
Wait.

231
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,500
Dojin, it's me.

232
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,630
I left the food your mom asked me to bring outside the gate.

233
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,100
Take it inside.

234
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,700
Okay, bye.

235
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,980
Okhee, I said I'd escort you.

236
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,050
Where is my mother?

237
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,750
Mr. Go?

238
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,430
Was your mother here?

239
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,900
Only for a bit.

240
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,730
She could have waited for me.

241
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,290
Her gait was so quick.

242
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,670
I need some help finding a place.

243
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,450
Is there a place called Mirae Supermarket?

244
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,610
Mirae Supermarket?

245
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,950
Who are you?

246
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,370
Yoon Huijae.

247
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,350
How dare someone like you lay a finger on my son?

248
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,710
- What?
- How dare you...

249
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,580
try to destroy my child?

250
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,590
You behave like this and pretend you care about his welfare?

251
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,390
You lunatic.

252
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,900
What parent gives a child such a thing?

253
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,670
Do you know to what degree...

254
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,010
Dojin suffered because of you?

255
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,410
Your voice is grating on me and your face annoys me.

256
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,250
Your hand as well.

257
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,650
I want to destroy it.

258
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,510
Mr. Go.

259
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,950
This is Gangnam district, Hyeony neighborhood 59.

260
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,990
His head is bleeding.

261
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,490
Please... Please arrive as soon as possible.

262
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,650
Yoon Huijae.

263
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,240
Yoon Huijae...

264
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,010
did this?

265
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
Namu.

266
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,600
You must never...

267
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,300
forget my words.

268
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,290
- Mr. Go.
- Yes.

269
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,610
You...

270
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,430
and he...

271
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,480
are not the same.

272
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,170
No.

273
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,210
Mr. Go.

274
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,460
Don't venture...

275
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,020
down the incorrect path because of me.

276
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,530
Okay?

277
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,160
Mr. Go.

278
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,790
Tell your mom...

279
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,640
not to shed so many tears.

280
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,500
Namu.

281
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,420
You too.

282
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,780
Mr. Go.

283
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,120
No, Mr. Go.

284
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,070
Mr. Go.

285
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,720
Mr. Go.

286
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,010
Mr. Go.

287
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,320
Please open your eyes.

288
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,880
I'll be by your side,

289
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,680
although I'm weak.

290
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,760
When you think of your kids,

291
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,450
you may feel exhausted and anxious.

292
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,320
Don't forget

293
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,000
that you have someone to lean on.

294
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,110
I'll always be by your side.

295
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,090
Yeom Jihong, that lowlife.

296
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,330
If we had apprehended him in the past...

297
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,470
along with Yoon Huijae...

298
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,810
If we had caught them,

299
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,330
this wouldn't have occurred.

300
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,540
Lieutenant...

301
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,500
Where is Yoon Huijae?

302
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,840
I haven't a clue.

303
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,430
Tell me where that lunatic is.

304
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,780
I said, I don't know.

305
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,500
You don't know?

306
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,250
You swung that hammer...

307
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,460
with this hand.

308
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,350
Just as Yoon Huijae did.

309
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,460
Shall I break your fingers one by one?

310
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,260
You psychotic jerk.

311
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,430
I've only just begun.

312
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,700
Four fingers still remain.

313
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,430
You're my woman.

314
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,790
Sweetie, how have you been?
