173
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,460
He didn't blink at all when a blade was being drawn.

174
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,759
That doesn't make sense.

175
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,660
Can you do that?

176
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,200
With an insane background like that...

177
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,700
Aren't psychotic symptoms genetic?

178
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:38,910
Would you get out of here...

179
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,680
before I arrest you for obstruction?

180
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,809
Come on. A 16-year-old middle school student...

181
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:47,620
tried to kill his serial killer father.

182
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,450
I find that quite astounding.

183
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:01,299
Why are you here already? I told you to take a break.

184
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,829
I'm okay.

185
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:08,569
Are you okay?

186
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:11,740
Of course, I am. How about you?

187
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:13,839
I'm fine.

188
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,180
You did well...

189
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,120
all on your own.

190
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,049
You did too.

191
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:33,160
Detective Chae, did you see Park Heeyeong's program?

192
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,329
Is it true?

193
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:37,029
If it's not, you should sue her.

194
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:38,329
Do I need to answer?

195
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:41,840
You denied that you were dating Han Jaeyee last time.

196
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,440
People are harassing her online,

197
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,940
calling her mentally ill.

198
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,379
Are you guys dating?

199
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,649
Jaeyee must know what happened that night.

200
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,419
You two are still close because of this fact.

201
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,849
I think Park Heeyeong understood that much.

202
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:03,059
What exactly happened that night?

203
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,389
I'm curious.

204
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:06,589
It's been three years since we met at the academy.

205
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:09,200
It seems that Hee Young has been bothering you ever since.

206
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,969
Let's try to work together.

207
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:15,670
You're not a young kid full of foolish ambition and justice anymore.

208
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,879
Are you reporters that bored?

209
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,050
It's like you were actually waiting for me.

210
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,889
Did you people...

211
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:36,560
even need a statement from me?

212
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,029
Write whatever you please.

213
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,200
If you're done, leave so we can get some work done, too.

214
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,869
Go on. Thanks a lot.

215
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:51,609
- Get out. Out.
- Let's go.

216
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:56,679
Han Jaeyee.

217
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,379
Are you okay with such a minor role?

218
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:01,419
You used to play the lead.

219
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,390
Yes. I like the script and the role.

220
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,719
If you cast me, I'll work hard.

221
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:09,390
Then how about you...

222
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,990
read a few more lines?

223
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,029
Do you have to make her...

224
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,500
Yes, I'll do it.

225
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,560
Give her the script.

226
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:34,950
"I'll bet everything I have on this.

227

I can't live without you, Mom.

228
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:45,989
Mom, does that mean I'm your daughter again?

229
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,699
I won't see Joonyoung again,

230
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,770
so don't be too harsh on me or kick me out.

231
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,140
Do you promise?"

232
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,100
That was pretty good.

233
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:06,109
- You nailed the emotions.
- Thank you.

234
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:09,150
I thought you wouldn't be able to do it.

235
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,719
- Excuse me?
- The character's parents...

236
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,329
don't approve of the guy she's dating, so I thought you wouldn't...

237
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:20,060
be able to depict someone like that.

238
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,730
- Right?
- Director.

239
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,470
Is that rumor true?

240
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,229
Your scandal is quite shocking.

241
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,270
- No.
- Right?

242
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,910
They went way too far. People can be vicious.

243
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,240
It's not...

244
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,010
a scandal.

245
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:43,479
- Pardon?
- Thanks a lot.

246
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,190
I'd like to leave now.

247
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,089
You're too lighthearted...

248
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:54,329
and way too honest.

249
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,669
You can't just reveal everything like that.

250
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,540
You can find pictures anywhere on the internet anyway.

251
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:07,079
We don't want to lie, and we really don't care.

252

253
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,710
That sounds so ideal.

254
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,680
Jaeyee, did you two end up doing something fun?

255
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:19,549
Fun? Like what? When was I ever not like this?

256
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:21,160
"Do Jin Gam Rae."

257
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,629
That's the phrase people made for your relationship.

258
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,459
Dojin? "Do Jin Gam Rae".

259
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,529
That's right.

260
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:33,669
Why are you so positive?

261
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,569
Was I ever not like this?

262
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,010
The hammer that we found in the garage,

263
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,420
had the first victim's blood and Yoon Hyeonmu's prints and DNA.

264
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,250
The hammer sent to Han Jaeyee,

265
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,690
had only the second victim's blood.

266
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,230
If the second hammer is Lee Seungwoo's,

267
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,600
he's much more careful and aggressive than Yoon Hyeonmu.

268
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,569
The wounds on the 2nd and 3rd victims are identical,

269
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:06,700
and signs of hesitation were absent.

270
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,369
On the lighting equipment or on Han Jaeyee's set,

271
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:11,570
we didn't find any prints.

272
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,210
Yoon Hyeonmu and Lee Seungwoo have different MOs,

273
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,009
and we asked around and found nothing in common.

274
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,950
Those two...

275
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,019
aren't working together.

276
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,950
To Nakwon... Was it really you?

277
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,919
- You don't see it?
- What about the song?

278
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,959
How did you hear it?

279
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,200
Then Lee Seungwoo...

280
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,000
will have heard about the carol from Yoon Huijae.

Okay.

286
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,079
His watch and belongings were expensive designer brands.

287
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,619
He's at least from a middle-class family and has lived in the area...

288
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:02,390
long enough to know the location of the security cameras.

289
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,289
Okay.

290
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,559
I'm sorry...

that I can't be there in person.

I wouldn't be able to talk to you again.

No. She usually doesn't ignore her calls.

I'll call her again.

- the assault of Park Heeseong.

Heeyoung talked about you on her show, right?

337
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,409
Answer my questions.

338
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,879
Ji Hyewon...

339
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,780
is your adoptive mother, right?

340
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:17,750
Gosh.

341
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:20,690
You turned out well.

342
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,760
Both your adoptive parents...

343
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
and your biological parents...

344
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:27,660
must be proud of you.

345
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,869
Parents' biggest happiness rests in their children's success.

346
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,339
Do you agree that you assaulted Park Heeyeong?

347
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:39,539
- If you do...
- You were quite lucky that day.

348
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,010
You came late.

349
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,950
Yoon Huijae, what do you want?

350
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,320
Your parents died in a violent crime.

351
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,859
You lost your adoptive parents because of me.

352
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,330
I felt horrible while watching the program.

353
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,599
It was very tragic.

354
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,700
How about yourself?

355
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,970
You were fooled while trying to kill your son.

356
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,180
Isn't that even more tragic?

357
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,950
Everything about that night is true.

358
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,179
Yoon Namu.

359
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:25,420
He's not like you.

360
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,920
He is definitely your son,

361
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,289
but he attempted to kill you.

362
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:35,200
He hates you.

363
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,029
You're invincible.

364
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:39,170
However,

365
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,000
you were fooled by your own 16-year-old son.

366
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:48,810
I feel bad for you.

367
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:56,080
Is it because you have no children?

368
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,890
You don't seem to realize.

369
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,060
What kind of parents and their children would do that?

370
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,660
You're a monster.

371
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,760
You're not a parent.

372
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,300
It's better than not having a parent at all.

373
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,299
You know what?

374
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,900
Wherever you were,

375
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,339
things were ruined.

376
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,669
What about the third time?

377
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:22,740
What other precious things do you have to lose?

378
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:26,479
You aren't afraid?

379
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,320
- What?
- Don't you love your sister?

380
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,090
Why did you let her near my son?

381
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,860
Does Namu hate me?

382
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,500
Not at all.

383
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:48,739
It's Namu.

384
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:51,040
He's the most similar to me.

385
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:54,979
I guess you don't care.

386
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,409
What my son...

387
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,820
will do to your sister?

388
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:05,619
- Shut up.
- Who will be the next person?

389
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,690
Will it be your pretty sister?

390
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,460
Gil Nakwon.

391
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,800
Yoon Huijae!

392
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:20,069
Stand up!

393
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:23,440
If you ever touch my sister, I'll kill you. Understand?

394
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,139
Please, Sir, let him go.

395
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:28,640
If you do anything to her, I'll kill you.

396
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,109
I'll also kill Yoon Namu!

397
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,290
Gil Moowon.

398
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,829
I don't think you should stay near her either.

399
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:56,899
Sir, last night Reporter Park Heeyeong was killed.

400
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:59,409
It's on the news.

401
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:15,119
