00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,879
[Episode 8]

2
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,099
How dare she mention your mom?

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:12,399
What gives her the right?

4
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:14,129
Don't worry, Jaeyee.

5
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:17,039
It if becomes a problem, we'll say it's all untrue.

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,829
Once I find that reporter, we'll take it to court.

7
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:22,139
I'll figure out a way no matter what.

8
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,839
For an actress, her image is of the utmost importance.

9
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,119
In order to conceal your identity, you went through hardships.

10
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:31,589
It's because of that crazy guy.

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,609
That you are getting hurt again.

12
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:40,519
[Is Han Jaeyee, Ji Hyewon's daughter?]

13
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:42,999
[She's the only one who made it]

14
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,069
[Is it really true?]

15
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,259
[Han Jaeyee is found...]

16
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:52,539
[It is discovered that Han Jaeyee is Ji Hyewon's daughter]

17
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,009
This is the moment inmates look forward to the most.

18
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,839
Exercise time.

19
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,889
It's when the inmates receive the most freedom.

20
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:09,219
In the event of an emergency,

21
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,229
guards are placed everywhere.

22
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:16,799
After the exercise,

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,999
we count the number of inmates.

24
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:20,199
The counting...

25
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:23,489
is not unlike how it's done in the military.

26
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,729
- Count.
- One, two, three, four,

27
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,199
five, six, present.

28
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,279
Count.

29
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:29,979
- One, two, three, four.

30
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,609
five, six, present.

31
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:33,979
- Count.
- One, two, three, four.

32
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,909
five, six, present.

33
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:39,249
A lot of inmate work during their time in jail..

34
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,619
Only death row inmates...

35
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,389
have a choice to participate or not.

36
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:57,039
Goodness.

37
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:59,609
Do it gently.

38
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:02,509
Clean this up.

39
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,869
Do it properly.

40
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:10,409
Let's move to the next.

41
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:15,589
Do it gently.

42
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:30,709
Number 2837, where are you going?

43
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,059
Come back to your place.

44
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,469
All right, all right.

45
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,969
Do we look like caged apes to them? Sheesh.

46
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,649
[I never sold my daughter's death]

47
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:52,179
Don't buy it!

48
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:55,429
Don't ever buy it!

49
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,799
[Yoon Huijae's family agrees to divide the profits...]

50
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,899
[Yoon Huijae's family agrees to divide the profits...]

51
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,459
Welcome!

52
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:08,979
What tastes good here?

53
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,299
- "What's good here?"
- Yes.

54
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:12,449
Is it your first time here?

55
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:13,579
Yes.

56
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:16,279
Everything is good here.

57
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,389
At approximately 3:00 p.m. today, Representative Kim Sangcheol...

58
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:22,009
for the victims' families of serial killer Yoon Huijae...

59
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,759
- What 's happening? Quick.
- ...applied for an injunction...

60
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,129
- Did you lose focus again?
- to block sales.

61
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:30,459
- Hey.
- About his autobiography...

62
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,099
Reporter Park...

63
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,359
acts as a substitute for Yoon's sales rights.

64
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,929
And she asserts the details of his sinister actions...

65
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:40,109
and his victims were already announced in public.

66
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,709
- That's a reporter?
- He didn't allow for the victims' opinions.

67
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,609
- Is she crazy?
- Also, Reporter Park...

68
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,509
still plans to distribute copies of his autobiography...

69
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,609
to the victims' families as well as to his own family.

70
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,779
She hasn't changed her plans yet.

71
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,109
Many people...

72
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,159
remain intrigued about Yoon's autobiography.

73
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,359
As he applied for an injunction to block sales,

74
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,889
- we anticipate a clash between...
- Hello.

75
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,659
...the publishing company and the victims' families.

76
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,059
This is Han Jiyoo from MBS News.

77
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:08,959
What's wrong? Who called?

78
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,929
It's nothing. It's a wrong number.

79
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:22,219
- Hello?
- Who do you think you are?

80
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,919
- She hung up on me? How dare she?
- Just hang up.

81
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,239
Who is this?

82
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,979
How dare you curse at us?

83
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,689
Are you Yoon Huijae's wife?

84
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,919
Are you earning money from that autobiography?

85
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,159
You piece of trash.

86
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,319
Is it great to receive income as his relative?

87
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,469
Are you happy...

88
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:40,159
that you make money off of the victims?

89
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,869
Chugae Island?

90
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:45,169
Did you think you could remain incognito on that island?

91
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:48,229
I'll find you on behalf of the victims' families.

92
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,799
I'll burn your house down.

93
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:52,549
- Fine, go ahead.
- What?

94
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:55,309
Neither my son nor I...

95
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:58,239
earned one cent from the book written by that psychotic man.

96
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,019
Go ahead and set this place on fire.

97
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:02,179
What the heck?

98
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,859
Stop cursing.

99
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:05,859
Who are you to speak to me this way?

100
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,899
Or curse at my children?

101
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,729
My kids committed no sins, you scumbag!

102
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:17,469
Mom.

103
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:19,599
Are you okay?

104
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,029
Sohjin.

105
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,839
Your brother.

106
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,939
Call Dojin right now.

107
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,109
If anyone sees him before he graduates,

108
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:33,779
he shouldn't see them.

109
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,229
Advise him not to answer calls from unfamiliar numbers.

110
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,359
Do you understand?

111
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:43,099
- Do it now.
- Okay.

112
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,069
Hey, is something wrong?

113
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:54,909
Your face looks pale.

114
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,899
Of course not.

115
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,299
There's nothing.

116
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:03,449
Why would my face look odd?

117
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,979
I'm completely fine.

118
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:09,559
No...

119
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:12,019
He's not picking up.

120
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,289
What do we do?

121
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,229
Today around 3:00 p.m,

122
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:24,499
Kim Sangcheol, the representative for the victims' families...

123
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:27,369
- of serial killer Yoon Huijae...
- He wrote an autobiography?

124
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:28,539
applied for an injunction...

125
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,039
to block the sales...

126
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,519
of Yoon Huijae's autobiography from being sold.

127
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,479
This autobiography contains...

128
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,649
specific information about his crimes against the victims,

129
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,019
so even prior to its publication, there was much controversy.

130
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,049
The victim families found...

131
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:46,119
the autobiography to be misusing...

132
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,419
the deaths of the victims,

133
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,519
and staged a protest against the book being sold.

134
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,859
Until the court reaches a verdict...

135
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,669
of the injunction,

136
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,879
the victim families claim they will go on with their protest.

137
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,779
The details of his crimes were modified to benefit him...

138
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,279
Yes, sir. I can't get through...

139
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,859
What about Nakwon?

140
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,659
I'll be there right away.

141
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:54,819
Dojin.

142
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:57,319
I didn't think you would show up.

143
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,209
You're early.

144
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,169
Let's go inside.

145
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,569
Wait.

146
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,719
Actually,

147
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,419
I'm not feeling well today.

148
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,429
Can we take a break today?

149
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:32,129
I'm sorry for asking you here.

150
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:34,999
Sure.

151
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,629
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,300
[Chae Dojin]

153
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,069
Don't die.

154
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,439
Stay alive.

155
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,739
You must stay alive...

156
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:33,189
no matter what.

157
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,629
It's not your fault.

158
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,599
So please don't die. Never.

159
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,529
If you die,

160
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:59,109
I won't ever forgive you.

161
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,169
So...

162
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:04,619
promise me.

163
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,009
Promise me.

164
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,579
Promise me...

165
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,859
that you will stay alive.

166
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:22,299
Tell me you will endure it...

167
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:27,109
just like your name.

168
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,249
Tell me...

169
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:41,659
that you will keep this promise.

170
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:46,649
Answer me, Namu.

171
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,649
The air in here...

172
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,019
for some reason, doesn't feel the same.

173
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,889
I guess we had a visitor?

174
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:39,639
Earlier in the day, there were some visitors.

175
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,069
I haven't seen a film like this in a while.

176
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:47,919
I miss my family more than ever today.

177
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:49,839
I'm not sure if I can say it's lucky,

178
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,079
but your oldest son is at least with you.

179
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,249
That kid is just like me.

180
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:00,919
It's easy for him to feel hot, so he never has on a jacket...

181
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,099
even in the winter.

182
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:05,469
However, my wife...

183
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,569
suffers from cold extremities. It's because she is always working.

184
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:11,659
My daughter...

185
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:15,599
won't eat breakfast if there isn't any hot soup.

186
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,379
Also,

187
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,109
my youngest...

188
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,119
My youngest...

189
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,289
My son Namu...

190
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:38,469
wouldn't sleep...

191
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:40,919
if I didn't come home..

192
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,929
Whenever I arrived home late, he was so concerned.

193
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:48,629
He would burn the midnight oil, studying and waiting for me.

194
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:52,769
Whenever he heard the gate open,

195
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:55,379
he would sneak over quietly...

196
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:58,949
so he didn't wake up the family...

197
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:02,189
He would tiptoe to the door...

198
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:04,659
while rubbing his eyes...

199
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,859
to welcome me home.

200
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,019
"Father."

201
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:12,759
"You're late."

202
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,629
That's what he would say.

203
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,129
I miss that sweet face.

204
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,249
Just because I wanted to see that face,

205
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,479
I would purposely go home late at times.

206
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:32,679
What do you think?

207
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,909
My youngest kid...

208
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,119
isn't he a great son?

209
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,739
Please stop.

210
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:51,129
Stop it!

211
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,789
I wonder if he eats regularly.

212
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,079
When he gets fixated,

213
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,149
he skips his meals.

214
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:16,449
Quit smoking. It's bad for you for your health.

215
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:19,289
You should live for a long long time.

Actress Ji Hyewon who was killed...

219
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:42,519
in 2006 by serial killer Yoon Huijae...

220
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,979
has been highly trending these past few hours.

221
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:49,689
That's because Yoon Huijae revealed that...

222
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:51,819
Ji Hyewon's daughter followed in her mother's footsteps...

223
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,769
to choose the acting profession, in an interview...

224
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:56,289
with a weekly tabloid magazine.

225
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,169
People want to know who she is...

226
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:01,799
- by searching online.
- It's too chilly for March.
