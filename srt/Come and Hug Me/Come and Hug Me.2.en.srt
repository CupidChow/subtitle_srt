Daddy's home.

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,669
- Dad.
- Son.

4
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:52,849
Why did you bring this heavy thing?

5
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,429
Honey, you're living with an actress.

6
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:58,129
Yeah, I know.

7
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:00,019
Dad!

8
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,159
- Yes.
- Let's hang our picture.

9
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,099
Come here.

10
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,669
Nakwon, please check. Is this okay?

11
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,909
- Here?
- More to the left?

12
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:13,079
That's perfect. Perfect.

13
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,839
- Muwon, see if this looks straight.
- Okay.

14
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,839
All right.

15
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:22,319
How is it?

16
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,379
Good.

17
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,559
- Good job, Nakwon.
- Nakwon did well.

18
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,069
Beautiful.

19
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,809
It was during Grandfather's memorial service.

20
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,969
I was on the first floor with my sister-in-law.

21
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,549
Eat slowly. You'll get sick.

22
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:47,819
It's okay.

23
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,789
I never heard of a pig getting sick by overeating.

24
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,959
Nakwon, drink some water.

25
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,819
You should be considerate of your brother too.

26
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,369
She only cares about herself.

27
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,569
Why do you two always pick on me?

28
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,129
Because you deserve it.

29
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,729
You're the only troublemaker in our family.

30
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:15,129
I'm really going to be a bad person.

31
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,909
I'll just...

32
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,249
Did you see me stuff it in?

33
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:25,009
You're really going to get sick if you keep that up.

34
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:28,189
- My goodness.
- I'm totally fine.

35
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:31,379
- Have some more, okay?
- I'm okay.

36
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:34,689
Good evening, everyone.

37

It's April 2, and you're watching MBS news.

38
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,439
My little princess, did you study well at school today?

39
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,829
You should answer me. You're not a baby anymore.

40
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,669
Yes.

41
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:54,309
Her homework was to draw our family.

42
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:57,089
Is that what you were hiding earlier?

43
00:03:57,089 --> 00:04:00,279
Bring it to me. Let me take a look.

44
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:03,689
It's not finished yet.

45
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,619
It's okay. Just bring it here.

46
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:08,289
I want to see how you drew me.

47
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:14,269
I think she's embarrassed. Please look at it later.

48
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:19,499
We lived together for over two years already.

49
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:21,669
Why are you still shy?

50
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,639
Let's eat.

51
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:27,639
- I'm home.
- Hello.

52
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,289
Go wash up, and eat. Get him some food.

Your brother's home. Why won't you say hello?

55
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,299
- Little punk.
- Today around 4:40 p.m...

56
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,959
- So rude.
- ...at a house in Gugeondong,

57
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,519
73-year-old Kim

58
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,829
and his 71-year-old wife Choo

59
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,669
were found dead after being struck by a weapon.

60
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,759
The crime scene had been set on fire.

61
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,009
Since the murder method was cruel and no valuables were taken,

62
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,839
the police believe it was revenge by an acquaintance,

63
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,009
and will focus the investigation in this light.

64
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,989
The police are taking into consideration

65
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:07,649
that the murder method is very similar

66
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,149
to the Wonikdong case last February,

67
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,189
where two married doctors were murdered.

68
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,359
- As for the dead bodies... 
- What are you watching?

69
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,519
...they will be sent to the NFS for...

70
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,519
- Wash up, then come eat.
- Okay.

71
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,939
They'll find out the exact circumstances of the crime.

72
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,069
We have yet to find the murder weapon,

73
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,369
and the suspect's identity is unknown for now.

74
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,699
To prevent any more murders,

75
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,549
the police ask those in the neighborhood

76
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,469
to be extra careful.

If you didn't buy your uniform yet,

you should've at least dressed more neat. What is this?

Why are you wearing a hoodie?

What are you looking at? You got a problem?

I said you got a problem?

And you're uncomfortable?
