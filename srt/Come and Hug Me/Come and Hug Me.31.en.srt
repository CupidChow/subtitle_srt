1
00:00:00,619 --> 00:00:02,679
Evil.

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:04,918
It cannot be developed.

[Episode 31]

4
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,378
You've come.

5
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:29,610
Namu.

6
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:32,950
Where's Nakwon?

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,520
It's been 12 years.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,989
I asked where Nakwon is.

9
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,849
Didn't I tell you that...

10
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:42,558
everything that makes you weak and pathetic,

11
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,489
I will get rid of myself.

12
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,328
In the cage we call our world,

13
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:52,630
only the strong and determined survive.

14
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,239
There's no space for pity or affection.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,010
Of course, our Namu.

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,718
You never let me down.

17
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:10,719
Shut up.

18
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,019
Tell me where Nakwon is.

19
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:16,220
I killed her.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,260
What?

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,229
That night 12 years ago.

22
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,000
I had to do finish what I didn't do then.

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,640
You're my son.

24
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,040
I will...

25
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,610
make you strong again.

26
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:46,950
I have waited 12 years...

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,290
to finish...

28
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,688
what I hadn't completed that night.

29
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,709
Hit me properly this time.

30
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,749
Your father...

31
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,118
doesn't care if he dies for you.

32
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,178
Namu!!

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,938
I'm okay, Namu.

34
00:02:36,938 --> 00:02:38,639
I told you, right?

35
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,910
I'll never ever get hurt.

36
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,358
No.

37
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,960
There's no way you did that to her.

38
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,000
If you really killed her,

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,629
then you would've made sure I watched...

40
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:07,730
so that you could see me...

41
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,040
go crazy like you.

42
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,638
Nakwon...

43
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:15,338
is alive for sure.

44
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,510
Where is she?

45
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,018
I said, where is she?

46
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:25,018
If you don't hit me,

47
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:27,448
then she'll die.

48
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:06,029
He's not you.

49
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:09,699
You spread nonsense for 16 years...

50
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,868
and he still didn't turn out like you.

51
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,179
You're too easy to kill,

52
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,848
so I'll kill you in front of Namu instead.

53
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:34,089
That would be your biggest punishment to have.

54
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,189
Untie me.

55
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:41,088
Just wait a little bit.

56
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:45,029
After Huijae is done talking with his son,

57
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:47,640
you'll be going there right away.

58
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,340
Namu.

59
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,639
You two should be punished for your wrongdoings.

60
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:55,980
"Punished"?

61
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,250
You and Huijae are the ones who deserve punishment.

62
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,189
Huijae...

63
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:07,560
gave up on everything for that son.

64
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,219
No.

65
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,130
It's a lie.

66
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,630
That autobiography is fake.

67
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,229
Of course, that woman Park Heeyoung

68
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,369
said that it was a lie on television.

69
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,769
Huijae said that too.

70
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,649
He decided to get caught because he felt so bad for his son.

71
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,020
Park Heeyoung died because she told the truth.

72
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,389
She told everyone...

73
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,059
how weak Huijae is.

74
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,960
I saw him...

75
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:48,400
run away like a coward after being hit by his son.

76
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:55,500
Yoon Huijae...

77
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,170
is nothing but a weak and scared monster.

78
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,509
Because you're helping him, you're a monster too.

79
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,320
You've done it before.

80
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,019
When you were 16,

81
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,059
you hit your father who was holding a hammer...

82
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:17,289
with a hammer in the same way.

83
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,379
You probably can do better now.

84
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,980
Right?

85
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,209
Shut up.

86
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,580
I was right.

87
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:46,550
I guess everything you want to protect...

88
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,020
must be broken.

89
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,600
Namu...

90
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,200
What if something bad happens to him and Nakwon?

91
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,509
Hyeonmu, that man is just so crazy.

92
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,980
Nothing is going to happen.

93
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,810
Don't worry.

94
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,570
Sohjin...

95
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,030
Sohjin.

96
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,770
Sohjin.

97
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,270
Ma'am.

98
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,338
I should've done something back then.

99
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,409
What?

100
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,479
I saw something...

101
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,179
at the dog farm.

102
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,289
But I just ran away.

103
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,230
This is why this is happening to my son.

104
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,569
What are you saying now?

105
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,570
That means Father...

106
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,409
That jerk just shouldn't have been born.

107
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,750
Don't think about such ridiculous things.

108
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,580
I'm saying,

109
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,009
you also think...

110
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,910
that you failed to protect your family.

111
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,178
[The 45th Judicial Apprentice Enrollment]

112
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:59,018
Nakwon.

113
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,318
They clung to you...

114
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:30,150
and made you a weakling.

115
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:34,660
If you ever touch them again,

116
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,389
I'm really going kill you.

117
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:40,190
Then hit me first.

118
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,060
You definitely saw what I did to your brother and that woman.

119
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,729
Don't you want to kill me for it?

120
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:49,669
Mom.

121
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,440
Hyeonmu.

122
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:58,848
Namu,

123
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,749
you can't forget...

124
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,990
what I said.

125
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,419
Mr. Go...

126
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,690
That man...

127
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,520
and you...

128
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,200
are different people.

129
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,930
This can't happen...

130
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,068
Mr. Go.

131
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:25,208
Don't wander from your path.

132
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,180
It's not my son.

133
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,810
To stop his dad's autobiography from being published,

134
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,610
he even went on TV.

135
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:37,420
He's trying so hard...

136
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,448
to live differently than his dad.

137
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,688
Thank you.

138
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:52,100
For staying strong even during difficult times.

139
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:58,269
That is the reason why my mom named me Namu. Did I tell you?

140
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:03,538
It was so I could bear everything and not get into trouble.

141
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,248
So I could become an adult.

142
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,020
I want you...

143
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,190
to make me like that.

144
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,430
And those hands that save lives.

145
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:27,169
They're pretty.

146
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,460
No.

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,829
If I really kill you,

148
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:01,939
too many people will suffer.

149
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:06,368
So I will end you...

150
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,080
my own way.

151
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,280
Do that then.

152
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,379
Right in front of your eyes,

153
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,980
I'll be terminated.

154
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,418
Even though you might deny it, you're my son.

155
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:22,519
I'm your father.

156
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,559
We are a family.

157
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,429
Family?

158
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,528
You said you're my father?

159
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,839
Dad's home.

160
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,970
- Dad.
- My son.

161
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,640
Wash your hands and come eat.

162
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,708
Get him some food.

163
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:46,410
Yes.

164
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,749
Hyeonmu and I were your sons at some point.

165
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,750
There was a time...

166
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,520
when you were human.

167
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,058
Why did you...

168
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,630
give up on being human?

169
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,028
Why are you my father?

170
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,740
Why is a monster like you my father?

171
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,609
Why?

172
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,078
You thought you were protecting me.

173
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,078
But Hyeonmu and I...

174
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:27,250
turned into monsters because of you.

175
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,558
My life has been ruined

176
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:32,689
because of you.

177
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,030
[Chae Dojin]

178
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:44,269
Candidate number 124, Chae Dojin.

179
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,680
Hey, you!

180
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,410
I became a cop to compensate for your sins.

181
00:13:56,178 --> 00:14:00,250
I wanted to end all the people I saw like you.

182
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,890
Even when I was suffering,

183
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,188
I couldn't say anything. I swallowed everything .

184
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,369
Others have suffered a thousand times' worth.

185
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:20,110
I didn't dare cry in front of them.

186
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,049
Asking what I did wrong...

187
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,050
was more than enough.

188
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,390
Just thinking about it...

189
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:35,660
made me feel guilty.

190
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,330
Because I was your son,

191
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,260
every day that I lived hurt me to death...

192
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,100
thinking about the victims that died.

193
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,770
There's nothing I did wrong...

194
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,269
but you made me like that.

195
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,610
You made me weak and pathetic.

196
00:14:58,178 --> 00:15:02,710
No one else but you.

197
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,720
So you're wrong.

198
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:09,919
I am walking evidence.

199
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,300
That's how the world is. When one feels fear,

200
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,468
they respect the person whom they fear.

201
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:21,669
Others fear and curse me,

202
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:26,139
but I control them.

203
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,780
That's why I say this world...

204
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:34,519
is a huge cage.

205
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,219
And?

206
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,058
Are you scared of me?

207
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:42,359
What?

208
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,658
That night, I struck you with a hammer.

209
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:50,660
You're straining to control me again but you can't.

210
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,268
That's what you're scared of.

211
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:56,640
You can portray yourself however you want,

212
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,308
but you're just trash that this world disposed of.

213
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,818
No.

214
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:12,420
We aren't monsters.

215
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,090
We were pushed to the edge by our circumstances.

216
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,890
If we don't become strong,

217
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,860
no one will take care of us.

218
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,699
We'll just be ignored.

219
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:30,240
No one would remember...

220
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,638
someone like me.

221
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:37,040
That's why.

222
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,910
Even after that,

223
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,078
you'll just be more miserable.

224
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:45,390
What?

225
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,359
You'll become forgotten monsters.

226
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:52,858
Right now, you're not even human.

227
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,298
Huijae will stay by my side.

228
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,738
Yoon Huijae...

229
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:07,568
has already betrayed you.

230
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,210
If he did value you,

231
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,879
he wouldn't put you through this.

232
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:40,369
You continue to be the one who gets me most excited.

233
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:43,040
What kind of strength do you want?

234
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,908
To kill everyone?

235
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:47,918
No.

236
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:50,980
That's not strength, that's weakness.

237
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:58,090
You grow fearful so you want to kill first.

238
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,458
Whatever you can.

239
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,830
There's no one you swung your hammer at...

240
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,540
that is weaker than you.

241
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,710
At least they stood with their own legs...

242
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,710
and lived in reality.

243
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,450
Yoon Namu.

244
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,590
Up until now, I thought I was just like you.

245
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,960
But facing you here made me realize.

246
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,860
I swung that hammer that night with your same face,

247
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:39,298
but I'm not a monster like you.

248
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:42,270
My veins may flow with your blood,

249
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,969
but that doesn't mean you're my father.

250
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:47,138
You're just...

251
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,410
a pathetic murderer.

252
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,520
Gil Nakwon.

253
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,160
The woman who brought you here.

254
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,058
She'll kill Nakwon, if I don't show up.

255
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,910
A child like you could never comprehend our pain.

256
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,719
Do you even know...

257
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:30,950
what true pain is?

258
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,490
You...

259
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,858
The supporting team arrived. We have two snipers in place.

260
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:17,069
Every five meters, the supporting force should surround the area.

261
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:19,970
Until the hostage's safety is confirmed, don't act rashly.

262
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,068
Yes, sir.

263
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,808
Block every possible escape route. Let's wait for now.

264
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:28,170
Just a second ago, the situation room got a call from Han Jaeyee.

265
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,710
- We don't have time. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

266
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,948
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

267
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,720
Stand up.

268
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,990
Didn't I say that I don't need any weaklings?

269
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:50,000
Stand up and take it.

270
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,898
Take it!

271
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,168
No.

272
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:02,408
I for sure will never become like you.

273
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,179
Fine.

274
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,648
When the end comes,

275
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:11,150
I'm going to break you into pieces.

276
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,419
You know what?

277
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:16,460
I'll make you strong again.

278
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,090
Namu!

279
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,429
Run. I said run away!

280
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,450
I called the police.

281
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,048
This time around,

282
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:43,380
they'll come in less than 10 minutes.

283
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,950
Die.

284
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,179
Darn it.

285
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,328
Please.

286
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:53,519
Freeze.

287
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,620
We'll shoot if you move.

288
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,638
Nakwon.

289
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:16,110
- Moowon.
- Are you all right?

290
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,910
Gosh.

291
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,250
Yoon Huijae.

292
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,390
For abduction, confinement,

293
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,428
and two murder cases, you're under arrest.

294
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,890
You have the right to an attorney.

295
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,430
You have the right to remain silent.

296
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,669
Yoon Huijae.

297
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,568
Everything is over now.

298
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:56,438
I want to kill you,

299
00:24:56,438 --> 00:25:00,950
but instead, you'll experience what I went through.

300
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,580
You'll also suffer.

301
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:39,348
Namu.

302
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,468
Stay alive.

303
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,508
Whatever happens.

304
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:01,140
You have to stay alive.

305
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,450
It's not your fault.

306
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,450
So don't die.

307
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,588
Never.

308
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,458
If you die,

309
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,928
I'll never forgive you.

310
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:30,098
So...

311
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,769
promise me.

312
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,110
Promise.

313
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,348
Promise.

314
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,918
Promise me that you'll stay alive.

315
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:06,070
Thank you for working so hard.

316
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:33,729
Get out of the way.

317
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:35,438
Get a car ready.

318
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:37,810
Move to the door.

319
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,390
Drop your weapon.

320
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,490
Darn it.

321
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,919
Yoon Namu.

322
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,468
Don't move!

323
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,790
In the end,

324
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:41,560
evil only eliminates itself.
