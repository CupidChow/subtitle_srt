171
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,340
Nakwon appeared to be crying when she left.

172
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,980
If you touch her again, you're dead.

173
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,450
You've changed a lot.

174
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,590
You used to tell me about how killing made you feel.

175
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,790
Your relatives I can't stand any of them.

176
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,870
You scumbag, I feel the same.

177
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,130
Because you tipped the police off, which resulted in my arrest.

178
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,040
I heard what Namu had done to my family while I was locked up.

179
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,980
So what?

180
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,450
Are you pointing the finger at me?

181
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,060
That's a trait that folks like you share.

182
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,180
You can't make it without pointing the finger at others.

183
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,020
Anything to lessen how crappy you feel.

184
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,830
The father you so admire?

185
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,800
He's just crazy.

186
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:30,710
You're pitiful garbage who got talked by him into stabbing your brother.

187
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,980
Yoon Namu, your brother, is just the same.

188
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,590
No.

189
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,020
Could he be more similar to Yoon Huijae?

190
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,220
Yes.

191
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,630
I stabbed Namu.

192
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,330
But him?

193
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,270
He held onto me tightly and didn't make a peep

194
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,510
to save the brother who had stabbed him.

195
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,270
How do you think he resembles my dad?

196
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,910
He sacrificed himself to take care of your younger sister.

197
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,630
He didn't apprehend me, but he wanted to take care of your sister.

198
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,350
So he sacrificed himself.

199
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,110
Gil Moowon,

200
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,020
you...

201
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,350
stabbed someone too, right?

202
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,090
Now it makes sense.

203
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,960
And you pretended not to be like me.

204
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,790
So,

205
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,540
how is it, having to always conceal this?

206
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,680
Just reveal your true self like me, you idiot.

207
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,100
Don't act like you're fine.

208
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,350
You must think you're that special.

209
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,820
Madmen who rant on when the weather sucks.

210
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,790
Aren't you just the same?

211
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,090
Soon,

212
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,490
you'll pay the price for all that, Yoon Hyeonmu.

213
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,210
You'll act righteously to the end?

214
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,790
It's all in there. You can check.

215
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,230
It's a video of...

216
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,700
Park Heeyoung's death.

217
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,060
- What?
- You're a prosecutor.

218
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,760
You wield more power than a detective...

219
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,100
and you're hot-tempered, so you won't mess with this.

220
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,780
Sort him out once and for all.

221
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,870
Wouldn't your sister benefit from that, right?

222
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,180
And contact the police.

223
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,990
If you saw someone like me,

224
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,310
you should call it in.

225
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,220
Yoon Hyeonmu.

226
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,780
Isn't it the same for you, too?

227
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,850
I lost my house while I was in jail.

228
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,890
You didn't die because didn't get home on time.

229
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,590
Don't you realize that...

230
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:12,230
you didn't succeed in defending both your family and home?

231
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,240
Your parents died twice.

232
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,580
It would devastate me if I lost my dad.

233
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,050
You want to take care of your sister while I want to abandon my brother.

234
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,620
You live that way all your life for killing someone.

235
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,450
I...

236
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,080
I live this way because I want to kill.

237
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,550
Come to think of it...

238
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,990
We're so alike, it's gross.

239
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,830
Don't you think that...

240
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,700
you didn't succeed in defending both your family and home?

241
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,440
[Gangnam Police Station]

242
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,100
It might be that Yoon Huijae came to Seoul.

243
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,850
Our team has assumed responsibility for the case.

244
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,180
The others should be ready to back us up if necessary.

245
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,140
- Yes, sir.
- They're here.

246
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,180
Detective Chae, how are you?

247
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,790
Where is your father? Did he get in touch with you?

248
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,190
Please answer us.

249
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,890
Please answer our questions.

250
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,890
Just record it.

251
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,240
What are they talking about? It's difficult to hear anything.

252
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,070
What if his father contacted him?

253
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,900
I don't think so. Let's first go to work.

254
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,000
Excuse me, please make some room for us too.

255
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,320
Do you remember that boy?

256
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,710
You mentioned seeing him at Dojin's mother's restaurant.

257
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,830
What struck you as odd about him?

258
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,380
Let's see.

259
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,190
I intuited it.

260
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,960
He had a bizarre look in his eyes.

261
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:38,560
A strong intuitive sense won't suffice to be a match for Park Heeyoung.

262
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,900
What's worrying you so much?

263
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,950
I wonder how different you are from Park Heeyoung.

264
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,050
If you mean personality and not competence,

265
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,950
it'd be easier looking for similar things.

266
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,860
Reporters can't afford to be too careful.

267
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,520
Others are busy running forward even when they trip.

268
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,800
By any chance,

269
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,500
is there anything you want to give me?

270
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,330
It's probable that Yoon Huijae is in Gyeonggi Province.

271
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,330
It's been quite a while that he lived here.

272
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,510
He knew the area like the back of his hand.

273
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,780
As for Yeom Jihong...

274
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,480
He must be associated somehow with the incident.

275
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,750
He used a hammer and even wore a raincoat.

276
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,960
He probably had something to do with the prison bus accident.

277
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,030
Was it a truck, not a sedan?

278
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,650
Someone must've been there prior to the bus getting into the accident.

279
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,760
Check all cars that were in the area prior to, during, and after the accident.

280
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,090
Will do, Dojin.

281
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,040
I'll particularly look for operational trucks.

282
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,080
I'll get together with Yeom Jihong's father one more time.

283
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,310
- Dojin.
- Dojin.

284
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,990
Remember to eat, my pal.

285
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,880
I also wanted to say that.

286
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,550
Eat your meals.

287
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,730
Everything's the same compared to three years ago.

288
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,950
The people's attention, I mean.

289
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,880
They haven't a clue about Dojin's life before.

290
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,450
In their eyes, he is merely a serial killer's son.

291
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,590
All remains the same.

292
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,030
You're right.

293
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,160
Nothing has changed since three years ago.

294
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,530
This is bad.

295
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,770
Lieutenant Chae Dojin.
