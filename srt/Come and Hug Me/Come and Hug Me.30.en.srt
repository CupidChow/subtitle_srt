[Episode 30]

2
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:08,460
I'm fine. There's not much to do.

3
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:11,390
It's for Hyeonmu?

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,660
Before he goes to jail, I want to make him lots of food.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,070
But this is a nice place to live, right?

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,210
I was unaware that prosecutors provided places to stay.

7
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:28,780
Who is it?

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,720
Until Yoo Huijae gets arrested, make yourself comfortable.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,650
Make sure to wear the smartwatch.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,449
I'm sorry for providing them so late.

11
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:42,320
Not a problem.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,189
I heard you asked for it when Dojin asked you.

13
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,130
Thank you for providing us with such a nice place.

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,650
Thank you so much.

15
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:07,448
It's been 11 days since the serial killer, Yoon Huijae, fled.

16
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:10,118
The police are looking for Yoon Huijae and his accomplice.

17
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:12,448
They're regulating an open search.

18
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,020
They have yet to find their location.

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,790
What's causing a bigger problem is that...

20
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,259
Yoon Huijae is continuing to commit crimes even after running away.

21
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,368
He's committed murder in the Hyeonyi Neighborhood of Gangnam.

22
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:27,468
In the Samjeon Neighborhood of Songpa...

23
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,859
This is Jeon Yoora.

24
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,560
I'm here to turn myself in.

25
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:04,340
Jeon Yoora called and said that she wants to turn herself in.

26
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,509
She says that she's been taken hostage.

27
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,579
It might be a trap.

28
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:12,078
Come to Yeonhwa Memorial Park.

29
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:14,078
I'm leaving now.

30
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,018
Hey, Nakwon.

31
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,790
It's okay. Take your time.

32
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,588
It probably isn't open yet.

33
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:24,728
Let's go in together.

34
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,690
Bye.

35
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,960
Is Mr. Chae coming late?

36
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,630
Yes.

37
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,570
Your parents will be happy that you're visiting them together.

38
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,038
I'm serious.

39
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:43,308
Since your happiness is what they most desire.

40
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,198
I've come.

41
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:07,738
From now on, I'll visit more often.

42
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:40,898
What's happening? Is that car broken?

43
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,980
Wait a second, Jaeyee.

44
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,648
Sir, there's a car in front of us.

45
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,070
Can I help you?

46
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,260
Jaeyee, run away! Hurry!

47
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,029
- Mr. Pyo! Mr. Pyo!
- Run away!

48
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,698
- Mr. Pyo!
- Go.

49
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,800
Do you know how hard it's been for Nakwon because of you?

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,929
You lunatic!

51
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:53,169
Yes, Nakwon.

56
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,800
What did you do to Nakwon?

57
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,670
Well...

58
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,170
She's doing well.

59
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:24,239
She grew up so well.

60
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,580
Her parents are here, too.

61
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,250
If you even touch a hair on her,

62
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,319
I'm going to kill you.

63
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,260
Come to see your father.

64
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,089

65
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,730
Quietly.

66
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,579
No matter what, I'm going to catch him.

67
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,949
I'll turn everything back to how it was.

68
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:13,860
I'll stop Yoon Huijae...

69
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,719
so he won't be able to do anything.

70
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,560
It's okay, Namu.

71

Didn't I tell you not to cry?

107

When you're dead, you can cry.

Because of what you did,

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,020
That's...

173
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,628
Yoon Huijae's...

174
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:46,630
blood.

175
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,700
Namu's definitely different.

176
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,369
Not for a second did I ever think he was like you.

177
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:02,809
Seeing you here now has made it so much clearer.

178
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,979
Namu's completely different from you.

179
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:10,550
You forgot that night.

180
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,418
That night,

181
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:16,319
he proved that he's just like me.

182
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:22,300
He deviated.

183
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:25,200
I can fix that.

184
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,400
The more hatred...

185
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,410
and anger he feels, the stronger he'll become.

186
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,609
And he'll finally see how weak what he tried to protect is.

187
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,050
I don't know what you saw that night.

188
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,550
But that night,

189
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,550
Namu was completely different from you.

190
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:54,330
Whatever he did,

191
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:57,899
he did it for me.

192
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:01,840
He's not you.

193
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:06,210
You spread nonsense for 16 years...

194
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,078
and he still didn't turn out like you.

195
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,670
Have the control center find this car...

196
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,229
and put it on the wanted list.

197
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,200
On the way, they could switch cars

198
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,868
- so search thoroughly.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,608
We have stations on major roads.

200
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:38,970
Look through the evidence again...

201
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,110
and check for any other hideouts.

202
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,150
I'll check the location where Yoon Huijae lived.

203
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,808
Okay. Check the names the properties are under.

204
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:48,220
It could be Yeom Jihong, Jeon Yoora,

205
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,118
or someone else linked to them.

206
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:53,190
Focus on the premises near Yeom Jihong's two villas and Jeon Yoora's home...

207
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,118
and check if they could've kept a hostage somewhere.

208
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,928
Yes, Sir.

209
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,770
Dojin...

210
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,438
will be okay, right?

211
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,608
Of course. You know what he's like.

212
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,250
He's sharp and tough.

213
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,348
For someone sharp and tough,

214
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:25,788
he's been playing the victim since school started.

215
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,060
Because of his father.

216
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,230
He was suspected to be the murderer, too.

217
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,000
"Do psychopaths feel paternal love?"

218
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,368
A monthly magazine published that article about him...

219
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,038
Dojin.

220
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:56,820
When Yoon Huijae's...

221
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,948
autobiography was released,

222
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:02,720
people left copies of it by his door.

223
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:05,730
Even then,

224
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,398
he never said anything to anyone.

225
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,868
He kept it all inside and held it in.

226
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:14,500
- Hey you!
- How could you?

227
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,268
Go on! Say something!

228
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,010
You...

229
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,488
Wasn't that too much?

230
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:37,828
The senior inspector who was like a dad to him,

231
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:40,958
then his mom, older brother, and Han Jaeyee, too?

232
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,198
Exactly, what does he want?

233
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:47,340
Why would he do this to his son?

234
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,768
Just because you seem human...

235
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,838
doesn't mean you are.

236
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,110
I'll take a look and make some calls.

237
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,519
Should we go check in person?

238
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,578
No, the time...

239
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,188
Where are you going?

240
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:15,500
To the bathroom.

241
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:24,740
Are you trying to cause rumors? Be careful.

242
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,178
Is it true that Han Jaeyee was captured?

243
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:31,278
Pyo Taek was discovered near the site of Ji Hyewon's remains.

244
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:33,108
As soon as he wakes up,

245
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,118
we'll make sure to question him.

246
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,520
Did Yoon Huijae really do it?

247
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,760
You could get hurt.

248
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,758
He's a lot more dangerous than you think.

249
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:48,600
Where's Detective Chae Dojin?

250
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,900
- We can't contact him.
- What?

251
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,769
What kind of a father goes that far around the bend?

252
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,078
You found someone hurt. Was it Han Jaeyee?

253
00:21:01,078 --> 00:21:03,180
The police were escorting her. How did they lose her?

254
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,110
Tell us.

255
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,318
So far, we have nothing.

256
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:10,990
Shouldn't we write an article about Han Jaeyee's death in advance?

257
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,460
Check your facts. That's the primary rule. Is it not?

258
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
Who died, huh?

259
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,729
Did you become a reporter to kill with your fingers?

260
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:21,158
Then leave and find a story.

261
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,378
You're going to see Yoon Hyeonmu, right?

262
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:42,550
I'm heading to the control room. Can I get a ride?

263
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,260
It's hard for you to drive like that.

264
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,458
We should try to find them quickly.

265
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,590
And Jaeyee and Dojin, too.

266
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,070
Get in. Let's leave.

267
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,140
What?

268
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,710
What are you saying?

269
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,650
We searched everywhere possible and found nothing.

270
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,318
You know Yoon Huijae well.

271
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,388
You can't think of a place?

272
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:20,619
I'll check my old house in Gowon.

273
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:23,018
We asked the neighbors, but to be sure.

274
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,860
Our old house.

275
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,260
There was a deep basement in the back.

276
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,898
Dad never allowed us to go inside.

277
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,769
It should still be there.

278
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:33,428
Okay.

279
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,298
The dog farm.

280
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:37,869
What?

281
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,508
Dad had a dog farm. Check that location, too.

282
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:45,750
He'd only go there with Namu.

283
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,078
I'll check. I know where it is.

284
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:49,718
Gil Moowon.

285
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,360
Your sister and my brother.

286
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,029
Bring both of them back. Okay?

287
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,508
Please go back inside.

288
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:29,620
Never forget you always have a place to return to.

289
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,830
Don't go too far away.

290
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:35,900
Okay?

291
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,900
You idiot.

292
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm locked up again...

293
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:45,770
and can't do anything.

294
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,538
Hyeonmu.

295
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,318
Hyeonmu, what's wrong?

296
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:57,619
Are you hurting anywhere?

297
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:01,360
Hyeonmu, what's going on?

298
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,388
Is something wrong?

299
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,869
Mom.

300
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:17,740
Dad...

301
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:28,750
Yoon Huijae was the owner of the dog farm until 2006.

302
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,348
Check Hong Sanghee's records.

303
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,788
You've come.

304
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,260
Namu.

305
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:19,898
Where's Nakwon?

306
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:22,198
It's been 12 years.

307
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:23,768
I asked where Nakwon is.

308
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:26,169
Didn't I tell you that...

309
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:30,010
everything that makes you weak and pathetic,

310
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,010
I will get rid of myself.

311
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,058
Hong Sanghee is Yeom Jihong's birth mother.

312
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:42,818
We never knew because she was divorced.

313
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:45,030
We'll leave right away.

314
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,700
[Gowon]

315
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:53,830
In this cage we call our world,

316
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,768
only the strong and determined survive.

317
00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:02,740
There's no space for pity or affection.

318
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,350
Yoon Huijae.

319
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,790
Of course our Namu.

320
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:19,828
You never let me down.

321
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,930
Shut up.

322
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,170
Tell me where Nakwon is.

323
00:26:25,598 --> 00:26:27,200
I killed her.

324
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:31,208
What?

325
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,040
That night 12 years ago.

326
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:36,640
I had to do finish what I didn't do then.

327
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,379
You're my son.

328
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:46,920
I will...

329
00:26:48,888 --> 00:26:51,428
make you strong again.
