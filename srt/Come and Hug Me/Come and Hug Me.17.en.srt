00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,770
Did you say...

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,260
you won't let me hurt her?

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,630
Then try it.

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,910
- Hyeonmu.
- Call her now.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,210
I'm going to make you see her die with your own eyes.

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,380
Then your life will be destroyed like mine.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,790
Hyeonmu, why are you doing this?

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,890
You did the same, you bastard.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,930
- What?
- I was in jail.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,760
You broke apart our family...

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,700
because of that girl Nakwon.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,390
Do you think Nakwon and her family are the only victims?

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,070
I'm a victim, too.

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,100
You and Nakwon hurt me.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,710
Her family trapped you and messed with our family.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,480
If they hadn't made Father angry,

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,670
none of this would have happened.

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,710
You tried to protect her.

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,190
If you didn't go telling on Father,

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,180
our family wouldn't be broken apart like this.

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,030
You need to feel what it's like to have your world fall apart.

23
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,570
Hyeonmu, please stop.

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,430
If I were going to stop, I wouldn't have called him.

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,410
Did you get my payback?

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,150
- Oh my god.
- Is he all right?

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,760
You and Ms. Chae sent me money.

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,890
That was my payback.

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,450
What? Are you disappointed?

30
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,100
You're wrong if you thought I wouldn't harm you.

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,700
So stop moving your mouth and call her right now.

32
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,160
It's really too bad that I couldn't finish her off yesterday.

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,440
So it was really you?

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,530
You attacked Nakwon?

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,870
Can't you see?

36
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,610
What about the song?

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,410
How did you hear it?

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,810
What happened in the neighborhood.

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,050
That was you, too?

40
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,760
Correct, bastard.

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,620
This world is miserable. I'm going to burn it all down.

42
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,470
Just like Father.

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,840
You're useless!

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,650
Damn it.

45
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,450
Fight back, you turd.

46
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,630
Get up, Hyeonmu

47
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,940
All I had was Father.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,820
Then one day, you took him from me.

49
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,640
Do you know what he meant to me?

50
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,240
Father?

51
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,860
He's a murderer.

52
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,050
Father...

53
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,200
is just a murderer.

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,470
So what?

55
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,390
He's still our father, isn't he?

56
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,530
So!

57
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,770
I can't forgive him.

58
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,280
He's our father.

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,250
That's why I can't understand him.

60
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,440
He killed people.

61
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,710
He killed so many people.

62
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,410
Father did that.

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,620
I ruined our family.

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
I'm so sorry.

66
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,010
However...

67
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,770
Father never protected us.

68

69

174
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,560
Who would buy that kind of product?

175
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,790
A prosecutor putting his hands on a reporter?

176
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,940
Go on, let me hear a comment.

177
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,070
Sure.

178
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,600
You are just like Yoon Huijae.

179
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,370
His weapon was a hammer and yours is a pen.

180
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,670
What's the difference?

181
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,120
I use my pen to sacrifice her...

182
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,620
and argue for compensation for his victims' families.

183
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,750
Isn't that a good thing? A positive use of the media.

184
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,960
I'm hurt that you would compare me to a psychopath.

185
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,170
You think you won.

186
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,530
No.

187
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,040
In the end, Yoon Huijae played you too.

188
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,870
You're just a toy he can play with from his cell.

189
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,670
You're going to make a documentary?

190
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,570
You know that...

191
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,820
that film will be just you picking up the garbage...

192
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,490
that Yoon Huijae defecated.

193
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,550
Doesn't that make you the same, Im Taekyeong?

194
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,300
How did it feel to stab a human being at that young age?

195
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,630
Stabbing someone at 12 years old?

196
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,240
Is that how you understand a criminal's mind so well?

197
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,990
You don't just understand the the weight of a crime,

198
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,350
you empathize, don't you?

199
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,960
Because really, you're the same kind.

200
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,290
Be honest with me. When you prosecute someone,

201
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,260
do you ever feel scared or turned on?

202
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,210
Yes.

203
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,440
You're right.

204
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,250
That's why beasts like you, Yoon Huijae, or me...

205
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,850
should not have been born.

206
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,250
Unlike you two, I've never killed anyone.

207
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,230
No, think carefully.

208
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,870
You've killed countless times.

Why?

I told you.

Everything that makes you...

It doesn't matter whether they're good or bad.

325

But it matters that they're a danger to you.

326
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,670
I already warned them and Namu.

327

328
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,190

Don't say things like that so lightly. You're a police officer.

He's Hyeonmu's brother.

337

What has he done for him as his brother?

338
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,000
All he did was go to jail and make a mess.

339
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,960
Why won't he leave Dojin alone?

340
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,260
What a family they are.

341
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,260
Dojin works so hard to repay for their sins.

342
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,200
He's suffered so much pain his whole life.

343
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,100
He's just trying to survive.

344
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,280
Hyeonmu.

345
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,850
Hyeonmu!

346
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,770
You're crazy!

347
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,830
You have lost your mind.

348
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,400
You've always bullied Namu.

349
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,800
You're going to kill him now?

350
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,010
How are you a human being?

351
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,840
You're not even human.

352
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,570
You really aren't.

353
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,170
Who are you?

354
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,810
How can you try to kill him?

355
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,220
You're the one who should die.

356
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,190
You should die instead of him.

357
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,680
If something goes wrong with Namu,

358
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,800
I will...

359
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,800
I'll curse you all my life.

360
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,260
So just go ahead and die yourself instead.

361
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,040
So...

362
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,700
Is he still alive?

363
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,780
That bastard.

364
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,020
He didn't die? He's alive?
