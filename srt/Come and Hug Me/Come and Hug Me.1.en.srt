My apologies for being late. I'm Lee Seokho, Number 128.

This is the reason why I applied.

These are my strengths.

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:19,769

Number 124, Chae Dojin.

15
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,069
Hello, the reason I applied to Police University is...

16
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,109
I was raised by a father who's a police officer.

17
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:14,179
I always had respect for the police force.

18
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:17,379
I love you.

19
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,729
Love you.

20
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,929
I love you, I love you.

21
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:24,299
I love you, Mister. I love you.

22
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,099
I love you, Mister. I love you, MIster.

23
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,699
- I love you.
- Cut!

24
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,629
Did all the actors agree on this?

25
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,469
When I ask them to act,

26
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:40,819
all the men pretend to be Kim Raewon from "Sunflower."

27
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:45,379
All the women say, "I'll break you," or "I love you, Mister"?

28
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,509
You actors...

29
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:50,489
are stuck in your own boundaries.

30
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,159
You should be breaking them instead.

31
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,929
How about this? I'll break my boundaries this time.

32
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:04,269
Could someone please read...

33
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:07,179
Hyun Bin's lines from the popular drama, "Secret Garden"?

34
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:10,949
Then, I'll reenact Gil Rahim's expressions.

35
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,049
I'll give it a go.

36
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,089
Invasion of privacy may be in question,

37
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:20,659
but it's useful for preventing crimes and verifying criminals.

38
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:22,719
For areas of high crime rates and for crime prevention,

39
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,789
more surveillance cameras must be implemented.

40
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:26,659
Can you give us an example?

41
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,189
A serial killer was arrested back in 2006.

42
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,869
Yoon Huijae case is an example.

43
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:34,229
Yoon Huijae didn't leave much evidence,

44
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,189
so it was hard to catch him.

45
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,509
He killed a woman in her 60s in a residential area.

46
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:40,779
He was caught on a CCTV while fleeing.

47
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:44,409
When this became public, it caused societal pressure.

48
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:45,569
That arrest...

49
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,169
ended up being a popular Ji Hyewon case.

50
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:52,819
The CCTV's recording is what led to his arrest.

51
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:57,019
Mr. Chae Dojin, you have several scars.

52
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,689
- What happened?
- They're nothing, really.

53
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:03,699
I got this cut last night at a restaurant.

54
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,119
It was because of some drunk men.

55
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,759
I got this cut...

56
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,429
from a fishnet while helping my elder neighbor.

57
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:15,729
This one's my sibling's first work of art.

58
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,139
"Fishnet"?

59
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,139
Oh, "Chugae Island."

60
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,039
You lived on this island since you were in 10th grade.

61
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,619
Then you quit school...

62
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,419
- and took the GED instead.
- Yes.

63
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:30,759
My mother recommended that I leave school.

64
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,689
Why? Most parents want their children

65
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:34,989
to finish their education.

66
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:37,419
My family couldn't afford it.

67
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,159
I'm her only son.

68
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,789
It was for my own sake.

Many people recognized me since then,

so I started using a stage name.

168

00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:59,109
Nakwon isn't a common name either.

170
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,039
This is crazy.

171
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,489
I never imagined I would meet Yoon Huijae's son here.

172
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:16,049
I took a glimpse from the side, and I think they look alike.

173
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,849
Yoon Huijae was handsome, too.

174
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:21,799
He would drive an expensive car, and he was a smooth talker.

175
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,099
I bet some of the victims got in his car and were killed.

176
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:28,939
Aren't psychopathic traits hereditary?

177
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,929
Right. I heard he was strange.

178
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:36,539
He was grinning while talking about his father during the interview.

179
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,589
I think...

180
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,689
the wrong information spread on the internet.

181
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:03,969
Pardon?

182
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:07,539
It's false that the victim got in Yoon Huijae's car

183
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,979
voluntarily.

184
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,839
While on her way home,

185
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,179
she was abducted while waiting for the bus.

186
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:19,319
She was forced to get into his car.

187
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,909
But since Yoon Huijae confessed falsely about his crime,

188
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,529
and since reporters love stimulating stories,

189
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:29,189
they kept on using that without checking the facts.

190
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:32,529
Everyone talks about it as if that's what really happened.

191
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,889
But the victim was someone...

192
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,529
who would never get in a stranger's car.

193
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,769
Did you say she got in your car voluntarily?

194
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,149
You're a liar!

195
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:48,839
You abducted her then killed her!

196
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:03,619
Therefore...

197
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:07,129
If you ever have the opportunity to talk about that case again,

198
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,729
make sure you set it straight.

199
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,639
If the victim's honor

200
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,979
is tainted by this,

201
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:18,299
it would be exponentially painful

202
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:20,699
for her family members.

203
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:31,789
Hey, and you.

204
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:34,459
Are you avoiding eye contact because you're afraid

205
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,849
that psychopathic behaviors may be contagious?

206
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:40,259
No worries.

207
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,099
Psychopathic tendencies are not hereditary.

208
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:45,439
Even if we're this close,

209
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,009
it's not contagious, like a cold.

210
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:49,909
So...

211
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:52,549
don't be cruel

212
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,849
to the family of the assailant.

213
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:57,139
All I can do is atone

214
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:00,979
for the victim's family.

215
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:05,629
They got rid of collective punishment a long time ago.

216
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,559
Don't you agree?

217
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:44,499
Why don't you just say

218
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,559
what you've been wanting to say?

219
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,159
He's my father.

220
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,839
But as his son and also his junior in acting,

221
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:53,069
I really respect him.

222
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:58,669
I want to thank him and say that I'm so happy he's my father.

223
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,909
Can we give each other a hug?

224
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:03,419
Of course.

225
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,379
All right, then. We'll see you next time.

226
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,479
Thank you for watching our show.

227
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,749
Hi. It's good to see you.

228
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,169
It's been a while.

229
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,549
You look so pretty today.

230
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:34,779
I really want to hug you.

In times like that, come to me.

00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:02,909
When the pain is too much to bear,

235
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:04,949
come to me, Namu.

236
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:09,419
Whatever the situation and whatever else happens,

237
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,519
I will like you for the rest of my life.

238
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:31,909
It's you.

My goodness!

245
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,149
Oh, I'm sorry!

246
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:15,609
He usually doesn't bark.

247
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,179
Unbelievable...

248
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,909
What kind of a dog

249
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:22,219
barks at people with goggles on its head?

250
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:25,049
A country hick like me has nothing on that dog.

251
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,359
My goodness...

252
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,869
I'm very sorry. He got extra excited today.

253
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:47,419
No need to bow. It's fine.

254
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:50,919
If it understood everything, it'd be a human, not a dog.

255
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,749
- Forget about it.
- Pardon?

256
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,989
Hello.

257
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:08,369
Did our dog surprise you?

258
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:10,909
I'm very sorry.

259
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:15,869
It's fine. It's nothing, really.

260
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:18,349
Is this your first time in the area?

261
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:21,519
For some reason, you look very familiar.

262
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,179
Yes. We're moving here today.

263
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,839
I'll see you around often.

264
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,629
I like pork soup and rice.

265
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:35,059
Our entire family likes it a lot.

266

Come by, then.

267
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:41,899
It's not my store, but we serve some great soup.

Okhee. Okhee!

What are you doing out there?

270
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,949
I can't even get a minute's break.

271

I'm coming!

272
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:58,049
Sorry to keep you when you're busy. Bye for now.

273
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,429
I could hear her voice even from the car.

274
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:21,979
Let's eat there one day.

275
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:24,749
- She seems nice.
- Sounds good.

276
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,069
Gil Nakwon, what do you think? Isn't it nice?

277
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:53,559
Do you regret saying you didn't want to move here?

278
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,739
I left all my friends back in Seoul.

279
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,179
It would be strange not to regret it.

280
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,299
You can make new friends here.

281
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,639
Meet your Seoul friends when you visit the city.

282
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:05,289
You're not 10 or 12 years old anymore.

283
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,209
You shouldn't be upset about this. You're all grown up.

284
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,259
Sometimes, you say I'm grown up.

285
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,589
Sometimes, you say I'm young and clueless.

286

She always changes her mind, right, Lucky?

287
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,569
Namu, today at school,

288
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:34,939
my teacher told me that I drew very well.

289
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,689
Aren't you proud of me?

290
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,389
I am. What did you draw?

291
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:42,659
I drew Mom, you, and me.

292
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,289
Our family.

293
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:47,589
What about Dad and Hyeonmu?

294
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:49,919
I didn't draw them yet.

295
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,959
I can't remember what Dad looks like.

296
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,669
You see him every day.

297
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,039
Still, I can't remember well.

298
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,469
Does he look happy, or does he look angry?

299
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:05,779
What about Hyeonmu?

300
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:09,249
I didn't draw him because I didn't want to.

301
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:12,079
He always curses at you and hits you.

302
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,409
If he hits you again and keeps doing that to you,

303
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,959
then I'll run up to him

304
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,389
and bite his hand.

305
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:26,919
You should have included them. They're family.

306
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,659
I only need you and Mom.

307
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,739
If I'm with you and Mom,

308
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:37,179
I'll be happy every day.

309
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:51,159
Hey. I told you not to bark at people!

310
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,199
Namu, what's that?

311
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,959
It's okay. It's a dog.

312
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,559
Dad, Lucky.

313
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:10,869
Sorry, kid. Did you get scared? Sorry.

314
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:50,579
Sorry, kid. I'll punish him when we get home.

315
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:54,979
Sorry. Hey, you come here. Hey. Hey, hey!

316
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:08,559
Wow, that dog is huge and pretty.

317
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,969
Namu, the girl next to the dog...

318
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:13,559
was really pretty too, right?

319
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,109
Yes, she was.

320
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:20,109
What kind of a dog gets so big?

321
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:23,839
It looks like a Golden Retriever. They're smart and gentle.

322
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,989
If they're trained well, they're good guard dogs.

323
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,889
If I meet that dog when I'm in danger,

324
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:33,919
will it protect me, too?

325
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,859
Sohjin, I'll protect you.

326
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:39,269
Wherever you are and from anyone.

327
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:43,759
Then in return, I will protect you, too.

328
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,699
Wherever you are and from anyone.

329
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:50,749
That's why you have to stay with me at all times.

330
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:54,849
Forever and ever, okay?

331
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:58,589
Okay. I will for sure do that.

332
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,459
What's the matter?

There's a lot of luggage.

00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:41,989
What did you say?

337
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:45,299
What? I meant...

338
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,699
Never mind.

339
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:52,839
The cherry blossom petals.

340
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:57,929
They look like snowflakes.

341
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:01,039
I never thought our daughter would say something so poetic.

342
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,249
I raised her for 16 years, and it's my first time hearing it.

343

Geez, not a big deal.

Hey guys.

That's our house.

Do you mean that white, isolated house on the hill?

348
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,989
Yes, that two-story house.

349
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:59,059
It was Ji Hyewon who renovated that house.

350
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,029
Why would a celebrity move to a countryside like this?

351
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,169
Maybe she has no money.

352
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:06,009
No, she has a house in Seoul.

353
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:07,569
This would be a summer house.

354

She came here to take a break for few years.

You know what?

This area is known for clean air and water.

357
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:18,879
She must have so much money that she needs to spend it.

358
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,589
A summer house?

359
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:23,499
Listen! When I saw her earlier,

360
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,289
she looked like an angel. So incredibly beautiful!

361
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,999
She had plastic surgery.

362
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:30,739
All celebrities get several surgeries nowadays.

363
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:32,829
They get nose jobs and make their eyes bigger.

364
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,969
Even I could become an actress.

365
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,509
Really? You should give it a try.

366

Ji Hyewon is known for her natural beauty.

367
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:48,419

- Auntie!
- Yes, I'm coming.

To be honest, I'm quite pretty.

370
00:26:56,969 --> 00:27:00,659
My husband says that he fell in love with me at first sight.

371
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:03,099

Right. Menthol, please.

2 packs of 88 Lights in menthol.

No, they won't sell to kids.

You look terrible. The collar looks so filthy.

He should be eating anything at his age.

That girl...

Why does she act like a baby when she's nine years old?
