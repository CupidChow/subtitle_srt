What are you doing here?

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,740
- I told you to take a break.
- It's about that report.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,140
Did you get rid of it because of me?

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,520
I altered an official document.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,519
I know I don't deserve to be a police officer.

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,319
I still don't regret it.

10
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:35,859
I didn't lie about any criminal records.

11
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,899
Because you were a psychopath's son, people blamed you.

12
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:43,960
I don't want to hear any of that.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,070
But everything was exposed because of Park Heeyeong.

14
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,909
I'm sorry.

15

If I never met you and your mother back then,

18
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,150
I would've probably quit this job a while ago.

During my police career,

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,280
I was let down by people.

25

Until I met you.

26

Hello, Jonghyeon.

36
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,700
Reporter Park Heeyeong was killed.

37
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,670
It was at her home last night.

38
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,530
What?

39
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,369
Come, I'll send you the address.

40

Come before the reporters arrive.

41

There are two sets of footprints.

42
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,069
They were merciless.

43
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:39,310
It's most likely it was due to a grudge.

44
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,950
I found a weapon.

45
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,890
If you can't bring yourself to do it,

46
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,720
I'll do it for you.

47

49
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,819
A hammer?

50
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,219
Were they trying to start a fire? Why was this burned?

51
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:29,959
They did it on purpose...

52
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,860
to show me.

53
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,000
The police reported that the criminal started a fire.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,960
The method of murder was inhuman,

55

58
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,750
It's a copycat crime.

What is this?

64
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,900
They covered their faces, so it's difficult to identify.

Is it them?

They have a similar build as Lee Seungwoo and Yoon Hyeonmu.

It looks like the two of them...

He called you a nuisance.

81

What's with Namu?

88
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,160

- People say psychopaths...

You're basically a forgotten child.

91
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:57,200
Your father only has an obsession with your brother.

92
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,099
That's because he sees something in Namu. I'm right, huh?

93
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:04,439
What kind of person do you think Namu is?

94
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,479
Is his gentle face only a mask?

95
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,649
Could he possibly be even worse than Yoon Huijae?

I don't think they forced the door open.

99

They're either working together...

100

How can I trust you?

106
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,689
If it's really the police, they'll catch you for sure.

107

So stop being scared, and just go back inside...

one was in the living room, but then went inside to hide.

112

In front of the door, the footprints are more concentrated,

113
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:31,230
and no signs of rummaging the room can be found.

My father told me to.

124

He said that you were done with your work...

125

and that you even did what you shouldn't have done.

126
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,820
You must be the offender behind the community attacks.

00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,739
were you also responsible for the Han Jaeyee case?

130
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,380
It was you? Did Yoon Huijae put you up to this?

131
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,950
You're just like my father said, full of questions.

132
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,219
You're calling him your father?

133
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,490
Do you want to be exactly like him?

134
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,360
Then I can make it happen...

135
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,299
just like how I helped him.

136
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,400
I don't care about that.

137
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,510
I'm not interested in killing others with words.

138
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,149
It was like he was punishing the victim.

139
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,289
He batted her to death.

140
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:16,190
Why are you showing up now?

141
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:20,130
Did you want to hear what we were talking about?

142
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:22,860
You jerk.

143
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,120
If he beat her that much,

144
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,249
he must have gotten a lot of the suspect's blood on him.

145
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,190
He probably changed clothes here.

146
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,359
I'm sure he changed his shoes, too.

147
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,929
The blood markings are different.

148
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:55,300
They look like drops of blood that dripped off.

149
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,870
For blood to drip like this,

150
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,730
the clothing must not have absorbed any of the blood.

I can't tell you that.

162
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,930
This will just make us reporters throw around guesses.

Give me a hint. I hate people who say things like that.

170
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:06,429
I think it says a lot.

171
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:15,039
Park Heeyeong was too much, wasn't she?

172
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:19,469
- Do you think she had it coming?
- So what?

173
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:23,280
You're saying she deserved to die?

174
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,650
Aren't you...

175
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,680
a reporter?

176
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
I told you that...

177
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:54,439
everything that makes you...

178
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,279
weak and pathetic...

179
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:00,779
will be terminated by me.

180
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:08,920
The host of Investigation "Why,"

181
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,530
investigative reporter Park Heeyeong,

182
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,730
was found dead in her apartment this afternoon.

183
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,760
- Three years ago...
- Yes, Sir.

184
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,599
- She investigated...
- Right now I'm watching the news.

185
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,400
It's true...

186
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,470
that she bothered you and your brother a lot,

187
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,280
but I'm both scared and sorry hearing what happened to her.

188
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,780
- Recently, she revealed a secret...
- I know.

189
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,719
- about Yoon Huijae and his son.
- You're right.

190
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:39,390
See you tomorrow. You had a long day. Get some rest.

191
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,290
Hello, Sir.

192
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,329
It's been some time. You must be tired.

193
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:48,629
Investigations revealed she was struck with a blunt object...

[Namu]

195

[Namu]

196
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,909
Police collected her belongings...

197
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,280
and are investigating what happened.

198
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,520
A forensic team is collecting evidence at the scene.

199
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,550
Welcome.

200
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,520
Investigations revealed she was hit by a blunt instrument.

201
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,430
The violence of the attack despite the fact that nothing was stolen...

202
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,329
has led police to conclude that the motive was resentment,

203
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:26,800
and that is the direction they will follow.

204
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,740
People who knew Park will be gathered to give statements...

205
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,079
and security and dashboard camera footage from the area will be checked.

206
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,169
Namu.

207
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,509
I came out when you said you'd come.

208
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,609
Namu.

209
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,820
Are you all right?

210
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,759
Yes. I'm sorry.

211
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:29,260
Did you miss me?

212
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,300
Doesn't my presence tend to heal people?

213
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:36,839
Yes.

214
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:39,710
If you...

215
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,150
just admit what happened right away then I...

216
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,119
Nothing bad happened.

217
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:56,290
Don't worry, okay?

218
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:05,530
Just a second. Sorry.

219
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,969
Wait.

221
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,470
Dojin, we found him right away.

222
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeom Jihong, age 26.

223
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,079
Arrested for fraud and embezzlement via stock price manipulation.

224
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,909
In April 2015, he was imprisoned in Euigang Prison

225
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,480
and was released in April of 2018.

226
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,120
That's only a month apart from Yoon Hyeonmu's release.

227
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,619
I called the prison to check.

228
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:30,690
For three years, he participated in the same religious activity as Yoon Huijae.

229
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,460
His father is pretty famous.

230
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,129
His father, Yeom Gijoon, is a famous modern artist.

231
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:39,569
Yeom Jihong studied business at a famous American university.

232
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,840
His older brother lives in Gangnam.

233
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:44,040
I'll message you his address.

234

Go there. We'll meet you there.

235
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,710
Okay. I'll go right now.

236
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,519
Don't wait outside anymore.

237
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,919
If something happens, call me.

238
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,659
Don't wander around by yourself.

239
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:07,829
Don't meet strangers by yourself either.

240
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:09,900
At least for now.

241
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:17,769
Sorry. I'm a bit too...

242
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:22,010
No.

243
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,480
You have to go now, don't you?

244

are things that I've wanted to say to you.

Don't you love your sister?

Why did you let her near my son?

253
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,440
Does Namu hate me?

254
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,509
Definitely not.

255

It's Namu. We're the most alike.

256
