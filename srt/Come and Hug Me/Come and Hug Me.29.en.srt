00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,570
I was mad that I was being lectured by the son of a criminal.

173
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,308
I'm a normal person, not a murderer's child.

174
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:58,648
I already saw myself as someone higher than him in my head.

175
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:02,748
It looks like you thought the same way as I did.

176
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:05,818
Am I wrong?

177
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:07,760
Nonsense.

178
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,760
You committed four crimes while on parole.

179
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,688
First, the Gangnam District Area Attacks.

180
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,298
This was most likely attempted murder.

181
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:16,159
You stole a vehicle and committed assault.

182
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,599
That's a robbery.

183
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,538
You broke into Han Jaeyee's garage and planned to kill.

184
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:22,168
It was an accident,

185
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:26,310
but stabbing Chae Dojin will be seen as criminal negligence, too.

186
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,408
You will have a long sentence.

187
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:36,748
I heard that you attempted to save your mother and your sister.

188
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:39,290
That was uncharacteristic of you.

189
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,988
Just like how your mother and your sister...

190
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,160
will remember the scars left by Yoon Huijae and Yeom Jihong,

191
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:48,499
your victims...

192
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:51,430
will be scarred forever because of you.

193
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,739
To some people,

194
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,338
you'll be seen as just like your father.

195
00:16:01,178 --> 00:16:03,739
You'll be imprisoned as soon as you're discharged.

196
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,350
I hope you'll pay for your crimes.

197
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,090
Did a prosecutor come all the way here...

198
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:13,619
just to tell me about my sentence?

199
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,689
What about you?

200
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:19,088
Did you pay for your crime?

201
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,960
What about you?

202
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,998
You never told anyone...

203
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:27,800
about your story, right?

204
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:31,110
It's not like anyone would believe...

205
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,310
a story that comes from me, so...

206
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,249
What's the point?

207
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,780
My life is already messed up.

208
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,788
I stabbed...

209
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,588
the murderer.

210
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,930
I was 12.

211
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,700
The murderer who killed my mom and dad.

212
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,138
Later, I found out...

213
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,210
that I had committed murder.

214
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:16,380
I was too young to handle it, so I was admitted to a hospital.

215
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,550
A judge in the court ruled it self-defense.

216
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,119
When I was in the hospital...

217
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,488
my adoptive parents visited me.

218
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,229
To take me home.

219
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,368
They knew...

220
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,270
my birth parents.

221
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:38,038
They never told me...

222
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:40,910
what to do.

223
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,310
They just...

224
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,078
waited for me.

225
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,020
Without saying anything.

226
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,418
Well?

227
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:53,420
Good job.

228
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,319
- Thanks, Nakwon.
- Good job.

229
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,288
Nakwon was 10 then.

230
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:04,298
Ever since the murder, I haven't been able to look at my hands.

231
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:06,928
She held them first.

232
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,410
If I were to repay Nakwon's family for what they did,

233
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,040
it would take more than a lifetime.

234
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,350
So...

235
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,018
never touch my sister again.

236
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:26,988
My brother.

237
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:30,318
Yoon Namu.

238
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:33,488
He would've done the same.

239
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,700
To protect her, as you did.

240
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,500
He would've done what he did...

241
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,840
to protect your sister that night.

242
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,508
So...

243
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,548
don't treat him like a monster too much.

244
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,920
Tell your sister that...

245
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,588
I'm sorry.

246
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,279
I'm looking into Yoon Huijae and Jeon Yoora,

247
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,018
but I've found nothing yet.

248
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:30,448
I'm looking for any connections...

249
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:32,120
with the past cases.

250
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,160
Do you have anything else on Yeom Jihong?

251
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,490
He's staggering from the shock that...

252
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,230
Yoon Huijae fooled him.

253
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,730
He's refusing to speak.

254
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,170
Nakwon's having a difficult time.

255
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,140
She never used to tell me if something was bugging her.

256
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,510
Because she knows what my past did to me.

257
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:03,380
So, she's not good at expressing her own pain.

258
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,550
She'll tell you the minimum.

259
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:10,018
- Right.
- So...

260
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:13,160
Are you all right?

261
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,498
Your father.

262
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,098
Seeing him again.

263
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:21,000
Aren't you scared?

264
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,678
Where are you going?

265
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,579
Nowhere.

266
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,490
What's a cop doing here?

267
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,918
I told you not to visit.

268
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:43,858
I wanted to see you.

269
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,490
To see if you're doing okay.

270
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,558
Then you can leave now.

271
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:50,398
You put on a brave face.

272
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:52,130
What?

273
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,340
I'm relieved to see you're doing all right.

274
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,738
And you?

275
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,538
Are you okay?

276
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:08,248
Thanks for saving Mom and Sohjin.

277
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,220
I'll forget about...

278
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,550
everything else.

279
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,190
But...

280
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:20,928
not Nakwon's incident.

281
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,928
You have to...

282
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,330
go to her and say sorry.

283
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
In person.

284
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,568
I'll come and see you often.

285
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,279
Even if you don't want me to,

286
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:39,250
let me visit for Mom and Sohjin's sake.

287
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,690
Don't forget you always have a place to return to.

288
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,788
Don't go too far away.

289
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:53,328
Okay?

290
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,568
Hey.

291
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:04,240
That night.

292
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,238
Were you really going to kill Dad?

293
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,418
Does it...

294
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,118
bother you?

295
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,488
Why did you...

296
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,560
toss the hammer to me?

297
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:30,530
Why do you think?

298
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,500
Because it didn't seem like you.

299
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:38,968
You must have known all along,

300
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:42,478
but didn't want to admit it.

301
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,308
That Dad...

302
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,250
was a monster.

303
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,518
I'm not normal,

304
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,890
but you're human.

305
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,088
However crazy you get,

306
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,628
don't ever cross the line.

307
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:06,028
Yes.

308
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:09,270
If you die,

309
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,610
Namu will fall apart even more.

310
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:16,910
So...

311
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,878
be careful.

312
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,418
I'm just a piece of trash to Dad,

313
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,420
but you're...

314
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,058
almost like his alter ego.

315
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:30,890
I don't want to see you get hurt as well.

316
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,078
You haven't eaten, huh?

317
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:54,918
Go wash your hands. It's almost done.

318
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,188
You cook?

319
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,920
I rarely cook, but I'm good when I do.

320
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,760
Go on.

321
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,940
Thanks. And two of those.

322
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,770
These too?

323
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:25,810
Thanks. Go wash your hands.

324
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:35,518
Ta-da.

325
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:42,229
Well? Is it good?

326
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,928
Is it too salty?

327
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,138
It's delicious.

328
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,038
We filmed until dawn today...

329
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,140
and Segyeong grabbed Yoonseong by the collar.

330
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,110
For flirting with female staff instead of working.

331
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,519
She grabbed it like this in front of everyone.

332
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,790
He's still not very kind or decent.

333
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,460
- You still don't like him?
- Yes.

334
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,028
Segyeong said she'd visit again.

335
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:17,428
She wants to see her junior.

336
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,010
I guess my boyfriend's really attractive.

337
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:31,078
He has nice eyes, a nice nose, and lips too.

338
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:39,090
And those hands save lives.

339
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:41,890
They're so pretty.

340
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,598
Let's eat.

341

Yes.
