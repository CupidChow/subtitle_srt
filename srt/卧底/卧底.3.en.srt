77
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:39,937
this community college student?

78
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:42,597
What does it matter
which school he goes to?

79
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:44,547
- Apologize to him.
- Do I look ridiculous to you

80
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:45,714
now that you've passed the bar exam?

81
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:47,231
You beat an innocent person.

82
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:49,076
You should apologize to him.

83
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:51,676
It's okay. I'm fine.

84

87
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:07,427
Here.

91
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:21,677
Oh.

92
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:24,526

Are you going to be
a prosecutor or a judge?

99
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:43,626
Neither of the two.

100

101
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:46,194
A lawyer?

102
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,110
You passed the bar exam as a protester,

103
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:51,644
and you'll be a lawyer?

104
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:54,511

105
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:55,843

107
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:23,727
Do you date

108
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,337
community college students too?

109
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,511
Why not?

110
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,860
But I'm not asking you out on a date.

111
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:32,560
There's a conference.

112
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,644
Oh.

113
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:37,293
Yeon-soo!

114
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:38,593
Hey.

115
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:39,794
I have to go.

116
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:46,594
Shall we have

117
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:49,594
jajangmyeon together after that?

118
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:53,593

119
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,461

Stop, Young-geol.

123
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:26,594
No.

124
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:29,160
Are you Attorney Choi Yeon-soo?

125
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:33,260
- Yes.
- I've seen you on TV.

126
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:35,343
You seemed very reliable.

127
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:37,660
What can I do for you?

128
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:39,194
You know.

129
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,860
I feel like I'm going crazy.

130
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:45,226
My wife and I have been married
for over 20 years.

131
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,497
I found out a couple of days ago

132
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:49,610
that she cheated me during our marriage.

133
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:51,393
She used an alias.

134
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:52,943
What was her real name?

135
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:56,310
Anyway, what should I do in this situation?

136
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:58,064
I'm sorry, but this is

137
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,647
hardly the place to talk about that.

138
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:01,760
Please come to my office later.

139
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:04,860
Since I met you, I want
to hear what you think.

140
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:09,243
How could she cheat me
under an alias for 20 years?

141
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,826
I'm a little busy now, sir.

142
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:13,876
Please come to my office.

143
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,144
Let's go.

144
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,160
You're not the same person I've seen on TV.

145
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,931
You're completely different.

146
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,576
You seemed to care
a lot about wronged people like me.

147
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,164
- Just a second, Jung-hyun.
- Yeon-soo.

148
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,910
What's your name, sir?

149
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:37,444
Me?

150
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:40,060
Well...

151
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:44,960
I'm Lee Suk-gyu.

152
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,576
Mr. Lee Suk-gyu.

153
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:52,097
I suggest that you
consult a divorce attorney

154
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:53,193
instead of me.

155
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:55,710
I'm not seeking a divorce.

156
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,981
It's fraud.

157
00:08:58,061 --> 00:08:59,531
It's a criminal act.

158
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:03,760
I don't know what is
the truth and what isn't.

159
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:06,513
But I think the wronged one is your wife

160
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:10,010
who has been living with a rude
man like you for over 20 years.

161
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:12,497
- What?
- Call me

162
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,097
before you sign the divorce papers.

163
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:17,226
I'll do my best to help your wife.

164
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:18,511
Bye, then.

165
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:21,376
- Let's go.
- Okay.

166
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:36,910
All right, Choi Yeon-soo.

167
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,793
Remember what you just said.

168
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:45,943
Good luck.

169
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:03,993
What's wrong?

170
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:05,944
Are you still bothered by that guy?

171
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:08,644
No.

172
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,110
Jung-ho hired another attorney.

173
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,243
What are you saying?

174
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:22,061
He wants to do the retrial
with another attorney.

175
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:24,126
Why, all of a sudden?

176
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,681
He must've heard that
Choong-mo offered me

177
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,041
the position of CIO Director.

178
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:31,281
<i>Choi Yeon-soo</i>

179
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,410
must not be the Director of CIO.

180
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:37,260
He told me to stop taking care of
wronged people like him,

181
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,484
and change the world so there won't
be any wronged people in the first place.

182
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,231
He just wants me to quit.

183
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,126
I don't know what to do.

184
00:10:58,827 --> 00:10:59,827
You should

185
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:03,143
stop taking care of someone like me.

186
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:05,961
Change the world

187
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:09,893
so there won't be people like me

188
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:13,277
in the first place.

189
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,061
Okay?

190
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:24,831
I'm taking off.

191
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:25,926
Oh, okay.

192
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:27,976
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

193
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,210
I'm home.

194
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:39,261
Hey, Seung-mi.

195
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:42,893
Something's burning, Dad.

196
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,427
- Oh!
- Look at that.

197
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:55,795
Dad.

198
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:03,277
It's good.

199
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:07,411
Chew it well.

200
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:08,993
It's delicious.

201
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,160
Did you starve?

202
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:29,697
This is my first meal today.

203
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,337
I had to prepare for a trial yesterday.

204
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,514
That was yesterday.

205
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:33,714
Why is this your first meal?

206
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:35,726
I worked until this morning.

207
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:37,527
Goodness.

208
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:39,393
You'll be rich.

209
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:40,676
No.

210
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,560
My client can't afford to pay me.

211
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:47,426
It's hard to understand.

212
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:49,726
If I passed the bar exam,

213
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:51,464
I'd be a judge or a prosecutor.

214
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:52,514
Or if I chose to be a lawyer.

215
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:54,110
I'd try to make a lot of money.

216
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:55,537
Why are you living like this?

217
00:12:56,861 --> 00:13:00,043
We're all supposed to
help sick and poor people.

218
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,893
That's what I've learned
since kindergarten.

219
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:05,210
But not everyone lives like that.

220
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,810
Why did you do that in the chicken coop?

221
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:09,077
The chicken coop?

222
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:12,493
To get out of there.

223
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,321
Why did you help me and Choong-mo then?

224
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:19,614
See?

225
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:21,760
You're someone like me.

226
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:26,407
I'm not a great person like you.

227
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:29,743
If you hadn't helped me that day,

228
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:32,060
I would've probably been disbarred.

229
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,626
Why did you go there and get arrested?

230
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:37,844
Anyway,

231
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:40,993
the fact that there are wronged people

232
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:43,043
like Mr. Hwang
Jung-ho in this country

233
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:45,493
makes me feel uncomfortable.

234
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,593
But you skip meals,

235
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:51,426
and work all night long for something

236
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,501
you won't get paid for.

237
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:57,593
I'd rather work hard
than feel uncomfortable.

238
00:13:57,861 --> 00:14:01,193
I can't avoid it, so
I've decided to enjoy it.

239
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,764
Ma'am. Can we have more pickled radish?

240
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,860
Yes.

241
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:09,177
Pickled radish, please.

243
00:15:05,894 --> 00:15:06,894
Here.

244
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:13,660
I've lived just like that.

245
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:19,826
Jung-hyun.

246
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:22,945
Yes?

247
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,293
I've thought carefully

248
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:28,160
about what Jung-ho said.

249
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,001
About the director of CIO?

250
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:32,543
Yes.

251
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:36,426
I'm going to take

252
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:38,460
Jung-ho's retrial to the end.

253
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:44,394
Let's go, Jung-hyun.

254
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:46,293
Wait, Yeon-soo?

255
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:48,844
Huh?

256
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:57,426
You're wrong this time.

257
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:00,247
What do you mean?

258
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,626
Helping wronged people like Jung-ho?

259
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:04,097
That's important.

260
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:06,243
But how long do you
think you can do that for?

261
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:11,176
Don't you want to put up a real fight?

262
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:16,810
You want to catch all
the bad guys, don't you?

263
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:19,010
I do.

264
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:20,943
- But--
- That's why...

265
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,226
Jung-ho let you go.

266
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,326
He's afraid you'll waste your time

267
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:28,177
when you have to put up a real fight.

268
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:31,993
But Jung-hyun.

269
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:36,393
I can't give up on Jung-ho and go to CIO.

270
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,743
Jung-ho fired you.

271
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,311
That's because...

272
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,467
He's afraid you'll reject the offer

273
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:45,661
because of him.

274
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:47,241

275
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:48,414

276
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:49,854
all her life without giving up.

277
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,893
For goodness' sake.
What's wrong with everyone?

278

Because you're the
right person for the job.

280
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:05,147
You're someone who
sticks to her convictions

281

and lives righteously

282

283

371
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:14,193
It's been over 20 years.

372

373
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,093
really delicious green onion pancakes.

374
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:24,893
I miss Tae-yeol a lot these days.

375
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:28,010

376
00:24:29,077 --> 00:24:30,626

377
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:32,927
if he hadn't died?

378
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:37,081
We would've drunk together more often.

379
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:40,944
Seriously,

380
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:43,921
when Tae-yeol died like that,

381
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:45,610
I was so angry.

382
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:47,237
I felt like I had to do something.

383
00:24:48,227 --> 00:24:50,197
So I packed my law books,
and went to a temple to study.

384
00:24:50,277 --> 00:24:52,247
I thought you'd gotten arrested too,

385
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:55,097
so I checked every
police station in a panic.

386
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:57,226
I studied really hard for two years.

387
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,826
Thanks to Tae-yeol,
I passed the bar exam,

388
00:25:03,444 --> 00:25:04,484
and have come this far.

389
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:10,660
I really want to do well.

390
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:12,751
When I see Tae-yeol again,

391
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:16,076
I don't want to be ashamed of myself.

395
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:33,694
I'll do it.

396

Really?

397
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,393
I thought you were going to reject it.

398

- Yes.

Is there a bus that goes there?

00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,730
You were sent to this agency.

Mr. Park.

554
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:41,326
As you can see here,
the report on Cha Min-ho's death case

555
00:34:45,177 --> 00:34:46,193
Suicide.

556
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:48,276
It's a suicide case.

557
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:53,397
That case has already been closed.

558
00:34:53,477 --> 00:34:54,659

Can you take responsibility for this?

00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:02,267
Can I take responsibility?

563

If you have doubts,

564
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,870
take your time to investigate it again.

Not the lengthy one.

The real motto.

573
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,343
Oh.

nothing is going to work.

579
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:01,559
We must work undercover.

If we expose our identities,

581
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,409

I'd like to ask,

586
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,359
for your understanding and cooperation.

00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:25,854
You'll do that for us, right?

But...

589
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:35,793
I want to find out how
Mr. Cha Min-ho died.

590
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,310
Oh, boy.

591
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:38,885
Did you date him or something?

592
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:40,443
Was he your friend?

593
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,710
No, it's not that.

594
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:44,059
I need to sign this document.

595
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,097
- Eh?
- I don't do sloppy work

00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,310
Oh.

598
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:52,894
Sloppy work?

599
00:36:54,994 --> 00:36:55,994
All right.

600
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Do as you please.

601
00:36:58,427 --> 00:36:59,427
See you again.

602
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:13,443
What a moron.

603
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:19,393
Yes.

604
00:37:19,677 --> 00:37:21,597
You know Choo Dong-woo
of the Inspection Bureau?

605
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,576
So let me summarize.

606
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:29,147
Mr. Cha drove his car outside

607
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:31,059
the day before his death.

608
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:32,014
Right.

609
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:33,626
You reported it stolen,

610
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,959
and the towing service contacted you.

611
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:37,730
Right.

612
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,780
But when you checked the record,

613
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,414
it was towed for illegal parking

614
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,780
at 11 p.m. in Yangjae-dong

615
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,126
the day before his death.

616
00:37:47,394 --> 00:37:48,443
Correct.

617
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:52,293
The rent-a-car company is in Guri.

618
00:37:52,827 --> 00:37:55,143
He parked his car
illegally in Yangjae-dong,

619
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,176
and went all the way there.

620
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,130
Besides, the rent-a-car company doesn't

621
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,959
lend cars to individuals.

622
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,576

- No, right?
- What is?

Well...

648
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:42,459
I know I should've told you beforehand.

649

My.

650
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,797
Then are you actually becoming one?

651
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:50,073

00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,743
I've handled everything in life.

That's when you were young and alone.

Here's what I think.

714
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:07,809
Stop it.

You don't know what
Do Young-geol might do.

722

Hey.

723
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:31,114

I won't stay still.

726
00:43:37,377 --> 00:43:39,443
Then, what?

727
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,510
Well?

728
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:45,909
Whatever.

730

she becomes the Director of CIO.

- No.

- Wait.

918
00:55:55,794 --> 00:55:57,859
<i>His mom is going to become</i>

919
00:55:58,644 --> 00:56:01,476
<i>Director of the CIO? I just can't...</i>

920
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,043
- It's crazy.
- My gosh.

921
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,626
- Unbelievable.
- <i>I can't even sleep alone.</i>

922

923

926
00:56:23,177 --> 00:56:25,147
I haven't even visited the Blue House yet.

927
00:56:25,227 --> 00:56:26,267
So how could they do this?

928
00:56:29,127 --> 00:56:30,915
This was all prepared, wasn't it?

929
00:56:32,427 --> 00:56:35,567
I don't know who but
they're trying to scare me off.

930
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,309
It's my fault, I guess.

931
00:56:47,427 --> 00:56:49,976
Looking at our kids, I wondered

932
00:56:51,827 --> 00:56:54,926
if it was right to make my family suffer
because of me.

933
00:56:57,777 --> 00:56:59,526
If you back down now,

934
00:57:00,844 --> 00:57:02,364
that's admitting to Seung-goo's fault.

935
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,509
People don't know about him.

936
00:57:07,044 --> 00:57:10,080
So they might think
he's a dangerous man

937
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,976
who committed a random assault.

938
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:16,359
Giving in

939
00:57:17,144 --> 00:57:19,176
is exactly what the
ones behind this want.

940
00:57:19,444 --> 00:57:20,476
Don't do it for them.

941
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,426
You guys are all dead meat.

Then should I

946
00:58:08,577 --> 00:58:10,643
go get her some food tomorrow morning?

947
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:12,910
Yes.

I won't stop Yeon-soo.

958

It will be faster for you
to stop your superior.

960
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,909

01:07:05,024 --> 01:07:07,946

about Seung-goo's case?

01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:09,607
By any chance,

1035
01:07:10,191 --> 01:07:11,723

It was my child's case.
Is that involvement?

1045
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:37,261
It was exposed after you were vetted.

1046

Wait, Mr. Park.

1048
