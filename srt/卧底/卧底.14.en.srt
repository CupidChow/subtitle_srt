4
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:37,907
I overdid it to speak with you privately.

5
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,041
Kim Tae-yeol?

6
00:01:44,624 --> 00:01:46,440
You've got a lot of backbone as they say.

7
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:48,740
I heard you're

8
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:51,307
one of the most competent agents
in the ANSP.

9
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:52,496
What do you want?

10
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:54,110
Release Mr. Hwang Jung-ho.

11
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:55,644
You should've abducted the judge.

12
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:56,944
You've got the wrong person.

13
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:58,994
"Frame him for committing
such a heinous crime

14
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:02,061
as setting fire to his friend's body,
and pushing him from the rooftop

15
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:03,673
to overturn public opinion."

16
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,928
Your team planned this

17
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:08,340
with the police and the prosecution.

18
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,357
I think you're overestimating me.

19
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:23,341
Let's go.

20
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,857
There's still one more trial.

00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:42,624
I'm okay.

Park Won-jong is still missing.

34

What should we do?

35
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:42,974
Give me a week.

36
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,259
I'll finish it in a week.

37
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,473
We still have a few more days left.

38
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:57,523
<font color="#ffff00">Restricted number</font>

39
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,873
Hello?

40
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:03,991
Who?

41
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,304
At last, we meet in person.

42
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:35,986
Did no one follow you today?

43
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,386
I'm sorry about the other day.

44
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:42,107
Are you okay?

45
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:47,629
Wow, the view is nice.

46
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:58,657
The photos you sent me

47
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:01,923
were captured images of a video.

48
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:04,308
Right.

49
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:07,148
The video.

50
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,257
You tried to give me
the original, didn't you?

51
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,340
Yes.

52
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,493
But I don't have it anymore.

53
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:20,516
The man in the photos.

54
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:24,833
The man who was strangling Tae-yeol.

55
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:27,523
Who is it?

56
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,250
Im Hyung-rak.

57
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,024
Im Hyung-rak?

58
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,033
It's Im Hyung-rak?

59
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:25,809
Executive Director Im Hyung-rak.

60
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,791
You know him, right?

61
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,048
Where...

62
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,621
Where's the original now?

63
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:39,491
His man took it

64
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,436
right before we met.

65
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,361
Do you have any other evidence?

66
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,441
No.

67
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,679
But I saw Kim Tae-yeol get killed

68
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,923
at the police station with my own eyes.

69
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:55,437
If you get Im Hyung-rak, I'll testify.

70
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,067
That's not enough.

71
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,291
Then

72
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:04,480
who do you think killed Min-ho?

73
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:07,490
Min-ho?

74
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,180
You mean Mr. Cha Min-ho?

75
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:12,658
Yes.

76
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:16,401
I can't tell you now.

77
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,569
Im Hyung-rak killed him too, right?

78
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:28,313
Why are you so cautious?

79
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:30,334
You aren't confessing love or anything.

80
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,423
In order to get him and punish him,

81
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:35,257
we need to prepare thoroughly.

82
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:38,640
That's harder than confessing love.

83
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,462
Are you not curious to know who I am?

84
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:45,840
A former ANSP agent.

85
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,757
A colleague of Lee Suk-gyu's.

86
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,174
Did he tell you?

87
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:53,175
Did Suk-gyu tell you that?

88
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:55,740
You don't need to know.

89
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:02,057
Why are you telling me this now?

90
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,806
Because now I know what it meant

91
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:13,140
for Suk-gyu to choose you
over everything else.

92
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:21,120
I was scared, so I turned a blind eye.

93
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:23,544
But it only left me with regrets.

94
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:28,446
I ignored it to save my neck,

95
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,076
and lived as a coward.

96
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:31,604
But, jeez.

97
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,673
It came back to haunt me.

98
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:41,333
Suk-gyu at least has no regrets

99
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:45,003
about choosing you over everything else.

100
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:48,990
Maybe it's just
too late for him to regret it.

101
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:52,540
I'm jealous of you.

102
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:55,848
He gave up

103
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,078
Everything he had to be with you.

104
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,158
Can you believe it?

105
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:05,050
It's like a fantasy, isn't it?

106
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:07,543
I guess you don't know it

107
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,957
because it's actually happening to you.

108
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,794
He made me deny my whole life.

109
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,923
How is that a fantasy?

110
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,312
Don't look at
the things that he lied about.

111
00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:27,660
You need to see what
he has given up for you.

112
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:35,394
If you can't, it can't be helped.

113
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:37,440
He's not my man anyway.

114
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:41,591
Bye.

115
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:44,707
Isn't Im Hyung-rak after you?

116
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,081
That's why you need to get him soon.

117
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,223
Bo-ri!

118
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:15,273
- Bo-ri!
- Dad!

119
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,314
- Bo-ri!
- Dad!

120
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:24,382
Dad. Are you upset
because I didn't come with you?

121
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,691
Bo-ri.

122
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,057
Oh, Bo-ri!

123
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:33,358
Oh!

124
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:35,207
Bo-ri.

125
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:36,724
Bo-ri.

126
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,294
Why is Bo-ri alone?

127
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,394
- Where have you been, Bo-ri?
- Dad.

128
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:43,773
Where's Dad, Bo-ri?

129
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:46,753
Bo-ri. Where's Dad?

130
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,173
Dad.

131
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:52,702
Im Hyung-rak is
the one who killed Tae-yeol.

132
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:57,178
- What are you saying?
- Im Hyung-rak

133
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:59,283
killed Tae-yeol himself.

134
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:04,373
I see.

135
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,493
Did you know?

136
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:11,489
No, I just learned it from you.

137
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,013
Why are you not surprised?

138
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,460
You said you'd resign in a week,

139
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,828
and you have three days left.

140
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:23,223
But you're trying to get away with it
by bringing this up.

141
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:24,668
That's more surprising to me.

142
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:27,358
Did Im Hyung-rak

143
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,790
tell you about
Jung-hyun's real identity?

144
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:34,673
There's a time bomb in
the middle of my house.

145
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:38,511
What does it matter
who told me where it is?

146
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,794
The person who murdered Tae-yeol

147
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:42,437
is manipulating you into driving me out.
Doesn't it matter to you?

148
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:43,878
- Do you have evidence?
- He tried to murder

149
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,244
The witness who had the evidence.

150
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,767
- That's enough to--
- Do you have evidence?

151
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,060
There's a witness.

152
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:51,282
The statute of limitations
has already expired,

153
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,343
and you have no evidence.
What can you do with a witness?

154
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:54,458
Hey, Kang Choong-mo.

155
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:56,576
Face the reality.

156
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,633
You're the loser.

157
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,320
I can't count on your vengeance,

158
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,327
and put this administration in danger.

159
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,858
I'm not trying to take vengeance.

160
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,561
I just want to catch a criminal
who pocketed public money,

161
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,673
and killed people to get what he wants.

162
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:15,473
You've been fooled even by your husband.

163
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:17,830
How are you going to get him?

164
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,776
You have three days left to resign.

165
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:49,508
Wow.

166
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,223
You're incredible.

167
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:03,973
Too bad we didn't have a chance to meet

168
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:05,944
earlier.

169
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,807
You are a loyal person.

170
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:17,708
It's a shame to have sworn your loyalty
to the wrong person.

171
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:22,957
You wouldn't have ended up here

172
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,790
if you had been

173
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,440
loyal to me instead of Choi Yeon-soo.

174
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:35,690
Now you'll die because of your loyalty.

175
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:39,543
Then again, the boy named Han Jung-hyun

176
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:41,140
died a few decades ago,

177
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,507
so we can't really call this a death.

178
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:49,626
Life is a series of regrets after all.

179
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,527
"I shouldn't have betrayed
my colleagues.

180
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:54,078
I shouldn't have
followed Choi Yeon-soo.

181
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:55,878
I should've stopped her when I was told to.

182
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,357
I should've seen

183
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:04,057
my children's faces
once more this morning."

184
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,490
Regrets?

185
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,557
I have some regrets too.

186
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:15,507
"Why didn't I do this from the beginning?"

187
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:30,160
<i><font color="#80ffff">You've been fooled even by your husband.</i></font>

188
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,964
<i><font color="#80ffff">How are you going to get him?</i></font>

189
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:35,407
<i><font color="#80ffff">You have three days left to resign.</i></font>

190
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,823
<font color="#ffff00">Director Choi Yeon-soo</font>

191
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:44,990
<font color="#ffff00">Seung-mi</font>

192
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:47,308
Hi, Seung-mi.

193
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:51,957
What?

194
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:55,057
His phone is turned off?

195
00:16:58,304 --> 00:16:59,986
Don't worry. I'll be right there.

196
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:08,241
Woo-jin.

197
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,589
Wait, Woo-jin.

198
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:30,921
He must have something
to say. Take off the tape.

199
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:39,896
I won't be able to deliver your last words,

200
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:42,317
but go on and say what you want to say.

201
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,241
I'm not

202
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:50,543
going to die in your hands.

203
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:01,424
Seung-mi.

204
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,290
Mom.

205
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,561
- Is he still out of touch?
- Yes.

206
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:14,296
Dad asked me to come
with him to walk Bo-ri,

207
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:15,790
but I didn't.

208
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:18,708
Dad ran away from home, right?

209
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:21,103
He left because you hated him,

210
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:22,529
and I yelled at him, right?

211
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:28,058
Why would he run away from
home with Bo-ri? He didn't.

212
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,060
<i><font color="#80ffff">The phone is turned off.</i></font>

213
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:32,307
<i><font color="#80ffff">Please leave a message after the tone.</i></font>

214
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,240
<font color="#ffff00">Jung-hyun</font>

215
00:19:57,824 --> 00:19:59,061
<i><font color="#80ffff">The phone is turned off.</i></font>

216
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:01,740
<i><font color="#80ffff">Please leave a message after the tone.</i></font>

217
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,620
Dad wrote this.

218
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,060
Why did he write down the things

219
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,478
that were already in his head?

220
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,661
Why?

221
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,044
<font color="#ffff00">Seaweed soup</font>

222
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:35,690
<font color="#ffff00">Ingredients, seasonings, how to make</font>

223
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,257
Do you think he wrote this

224
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:39,059
because he was planning to leave?

225
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,733
Did he prepare it in case of his absence?

226
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,473
What's going on?

227
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,490
What's happening to him?
Why is he doing this?

228
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:51,723
We need to find him, Mom.

229
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,543
We need to tell him to come back.

230
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:55,850
Yes, don't worry.

231
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:57,242
We'll find him.

232
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,326
I'll go to work and look for him.

233
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:00,484
Are you sure?

234
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:02,923
Yes.

235
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:14,107
<font color="#ffff00">Kimchi pancake</font>

236
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:26,044
We can't rule out the possibility

237
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:27,557
that Park Won-jong is dead.

238
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:31,877
The police are looking for him too.

239
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,687
But the thing is, he went missing

240
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:35,494
after he jumped out of the taxi.

241
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,447
Do you think he was murdered?

242
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:41,141
He may have been killed,

243
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:44,219
for the same reason as Mr. Cha Min-ho.

244
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,423
Director Choi.

245
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:51,845
Yes?

246
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:53,140
Well...

247
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:57,772
Park went to Son Joo-ri's house
in Gangnam,

248
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,574
and then

249
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:02,360
to your house in Uijeongbu.

250
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:06,623
And he rode in this car from there.

251
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:12,083
This is my husband's car.

252
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:16,410
He called me from my house,

253
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:17,961
so I asked my husband to bring him to me.

254
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,323
Oh.

255
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:22,083
That's dangerous.
You could've told us to do it.

256
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:26,456
You shouldn't have lost Park Won-jong.

257
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,513
- Sorry?
- He went to Director Choi's house,

258
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:30,143
but tried to run away again.

259
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,978
That's why her husband stepped in to help--

260
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:33,058
Mr. Bae.

261
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:37,106
Please go on.

262
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,931
It's highly likely that this person is

263
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:42,077
the mastermind behind the whole thing.

264
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:44,457
This is what we've found out
about Im Hyung-rak.

265
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:48,296
Im Hyung-rak, the executive director
of the NIS.

266
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:53,057
Finally, the time has come.

267
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:55,311
He has a good reputation.

268
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:56,391
He's frugal.

269
00:22:57,191 --> 00:22:58,990
He has a house, but it's not that big.

270
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,527
His son completed his military service.

271
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:05,063
He's a self-made man
who went to a prestigious university.

272
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:07,693
He's a good husband and father,

273
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:09,412
and a model civil servant.

274
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:12,128
Since he got promoted very fast,

275
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:15,029
he must've been recognized within the NIS.

276
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:18,328
But he's the quiet type
who has never attracted attention.

277
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:20,143
Maybe he was loyal to his higher-ups

278
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:21,927
without attracting much attention.

279
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:24,313
He has neither friends nor enemies.

280
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:26,012
A man like him is a murderer?

281
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,525
That's really scary.

282
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:30,836
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

283
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:33,733
I think he's the devil in sheep's clothing.

284
00:23:36,553 --> 00:23:37,836
Let's wrap it up.

285
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:39,673
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:42,481
I need to talk to you, Mr. Bae.

287
00:23:43,341 --> 00:23:44,341
Yes, ma'am.

288
00:23:49,524 --> 00:23:50,761
Jung-hyun...

289
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,123
What about Mr. Han?

290
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:55,081
He's been out of contact since yesterday.

291
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:57,307
What are you saying?

292
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,043
Are you saying he didn't come home again?

293
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:01,394
He went out to walk our dog,

294
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:02,514
but only our dog returned.

295
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,290
And his phone is turned off.

296
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:06,107
My goodness.

297
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:09,694
The situation seems
to be different this time.

298
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:11,307
I'm anxious for a different reason.

299
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:16,457
Don't worry too much.

300
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm sure he's fine.

301
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,973
Please secretly track his cell phone.

302
00:24:23,258 --> 00:24:25,340
Okay. I'll locate his cell phone,

303
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,256
and check all the CCTV footage.

304
00:24:29,138 --> 00:24:30,387
Please wait.

305
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:32,430
Goodness.

306
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,109
I need you to watch Lee Suk-gyu's house.

307
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:48,727
What's going on now, sir?

308
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:51,874
I'm sure he's already met
Park Won-jong by now.

309
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,811
Does that mean...

310
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:58,364
Watch closely to see
what's happening with his family.

311
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:00,773
Yes, sir.

312
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,307
And one more thing.

313
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:06,411
Report to me all the drowned bodies

314
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:08,679
found near Han River for a while.

315
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:12,124
Yes, sir.

316
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:20,067
How long are you going to live
as a wanted criminal?

317
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:23,959
- I'm sorry, sir.
- If we get rid of Choi Yeon-soo,

318
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:27,393
you'll just be punished
for being negligent.

319
00:25:27,474 --> 00:25:29,154
Your return will only be a matter of time.

320
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:33,423
I'll report back to you
as soon as possible.

321
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:50,503
Did he really drown that punk?

322
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,289
- Hey.
- Yes?

323
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:57,806
Locate Lee Suk-gyu's cell phone.

324
00:25:58,374 --> 00:25:59,374
Why?

325
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:01,113
Never mind.

326
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,027
Let's go to his house first.

327
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:05,108
What are you going to do?

328
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:07,473
We should return to work.

329
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:10,260
- Don't talk back to me.
- I'm sorry, sir.

330
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:11,341
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:25,298
Hi.

332
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,394
Welcome to Han's Bike Lab.

333
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:30,723
How can I help you, sir?

334
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:32,324
How have you been?

335
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,010
Don't you remember me?

336
00:26:39,124 --> 00:26:41,423
Oh. Hello.

337
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:43,110
Bo-ri is doing well.

338
00:26:44,508 --> 00:26:45,508
Where's your dad?

339
00:26:46,391 --> 00:26:47,723
D-Dad is...

340
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:49,940
Well...

341
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:53,377
Dad isn't home at the moment.

342
00:26:54,337 --> 00:26:55,586
Oh.

343
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,676
He didn't sleep at home last night, right?

344
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:07,090
How do you know that?

345
00:27:07,781 --> 00:27:09,580
How do you...

346
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:12,493
I know where your dad is.

347
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:14,254
- Do you want me to take you there?
- What?

348
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:16,943
Where is my dad?

349
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:19,278
Shall we go find him?

350
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:22,973
Yes, I miss him. I need to find him.

351
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:28,940
Forget it.

352
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,590
How would I know that?

353
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:37,258
Gosh.

354
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:42,043
Where are you, Lee Suk-gyu?

355
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:47,171
No drowned bodies were found
near Han River recently.

356
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:51,111
And Lee Suk-gyu hasn't been home
since last night.

357
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,034
What about Choi Yeon-soo?

358
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:56,313
The CIO...

359
00:27:57,141 --> 00:28:00,240
secretly tracked
Lee Suk-gyu's cell phone.

360
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:02,958
Okay.

361
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:08,098
By any chance...

362
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:13,891
What?

363
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,207
Is there a chance...

364
00:28:16,585 --> 00:28:19,590
That Lee Suk-gyu might have
failed to meet Park Won-jong?

365
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,207
- Mr. Do.
- Yes?

366
00:28:23,474 --> 00:28:26,073
It's not over until it's over.

367
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:28,246
I'm sorry, sir.

368
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:30,177
Though it looks certain,

369
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,573
it's just an assumption
until we find proof.

370
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:38,807
I'll keep an eye on it.

371
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:14,056
Director!

372
00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:15,577
- What's wrong?
- Director Choi.

373
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:17,910
We confirmed the location of his phone.

374
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:19,461
- Where is it?
- South Seoul Police Station.

375
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,827
- I'll be back.
- I'll come with you, Director.

376
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:22,908
Director.

377
00:29:30,757 --> 00:29:31,757
Is this it?

378
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:33,724
Just a moment.

379
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:38,374
<font color="#ffff00">Draw an unlock pattern</font>

380
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:47,910
Yes, it is.

381
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:50,573
An old man picked it up
while he was taking a walk.

382
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:53,268
He brought it here,
and asked us to find the owner.

383
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:56,024
Where did he find it?

384
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,446
By the Han River.

385
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,473
- By the Han River?
- Yes.

386
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:03,210
It was placed neatly by the river.

387
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:05,911
Those who try to end their lives

388
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:07,631
usually place their belongings neatly.

389
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:10,594
Or he may have just lost it.

390
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:12,414
Don't worry too much.

391
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:41,623
<font color="#ffff00">Seung-goo, Yeon-soo, Mr. Oh</font>

392
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:44,707

393
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:50,423

394
00:30:52,324 --> 00:30:53,324

395
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,023
<i><font color="#80ffff">The person you've dialed is unavailable.</i></font>

396
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:04,049
What happened to you, Jung-hyun?

397
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:10,657
<font color="#ffff00">Chief Secretary Kang Choong-mo</font>

398
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:24,024
Congratulations on
becoming the chief secretary.

399
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,957
Thank you.

400
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:29,024
You still haven't made up your mind?

401
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:33,207
I have.

402
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,573
I'll get rid of everything that
jeopardizes national interest.

403
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:41,257
She'll resign from her post in two days.

404
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:43,857
That's good news.

405
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:47,110
I don't care about your past.

406
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:49,703
Whoever you arrested, tortured,

407
00:31:50,924 --> 00:31:51,924
or killed.

408
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:55,977
I only hope that you're someone
who can contribute

409
00:31:56,058 --> 00:31:57,298
to the present and future

410
00:31:58,511 --> 00:31:59,511
of this country.

411
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:27,641
Chief.

412
00:32:29,177 --> 00:32:30,842
Song Joo-pil wants me to write

413
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:32,243
a series of articles titled,

414
00:32:32,324 --> 00:32:33,778
"CIO Director Choi Yeon-soo's
Empty Pledges"

415
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,047
by the end of this week.

416
00:32:35,128 --> 00:32:36,596
Did you two agree on this?

417
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:38,865
"Choi Yeon-soo's Empty Pledges"?

418
00:32:40,714 --> 00:32:43,263
Why is he dying to criticize her?

419
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:45,780
It seems that he often meets

420
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:48,527
Yoo Sang-dong of
Justice Party these days.

421
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:49,608
Why?

422
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:50,973
Is he trying to win the nomination?

423
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:53,494
He bragged that he advised Yoo Sang-dong

424
00:32:53,574 --> 00:32:55,811
about the direction of the country.

425
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,394
He advised a party delegate
instead of interviewing him?

426
00:32:58,474 --> 00:32:59,695
I know.

427
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:04,548
He'll use this company
as a stepping stone

428
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,773
to enter the political arena?

429
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,357
For goodness' sake.

430
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,280
What about the articles?

431
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:14,477
You take care of it, dude.

432
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:21,660
You and Mr. Im Hyung-rak?

433
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:23,726
Tomorrow morning? Sounds good.

434
00:33:24,258 --> 00:33:25,258
Yes.

435
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:30,420
Inspired by the meeting with you yesterday,

436
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:34,473
I'll publish a series
of articles this week.

437
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:35,883
The title?

438
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,707
I'll tell you at the golf course tomorrow.

439
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:42,241
Bye.

440
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:47,910
All right. You may all go home now.

441
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:49,007
Okay.

442
00:33:51,324 --> 00:33:52,590
<font color="#ffff00">South Seoul Police Station</font>

443
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:57,446
Bae Goo-taek, speaking.

444
00:33:58,341 --> 00:33:59,341
What?

445
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,013
Where is it?

446
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,083
The forensics team is still on the way.

447
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:05,761
So we haven't identified the body yet.

448
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:07,591
Yes.

449
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:09,957
<font color="#ffff00">Under investigation</font>

450
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:19,073
Hello, Mr. Bae.

451
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:20,357
<i><font color="#80ffff">Well...</i></font>

452
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:23,957
A drowned body was found near the place

453
00:34:24,474 --> 00:34:26,273
where Mr. Han's phone was found.

454
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,940
<i><font color="#80ffff">It hasn't been identified yet.</i></font>

455
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,210
I'm on the way there now,

456
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,593
so please wait

457
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:36,940
<i><font color="#80ffff">at your place.</i></font>

458
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,128
No, I'm coming too.

459
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,444
<i><font color="#80ffff">I don't want people to talk</i></font>

460
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:42,511
about the CIO director's
visit to the scene.

461
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:44,740
Just listen to me, for goodness' sake!

462
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,990
Okay.

463
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,550
Then please do it on my behalf.

464
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:11,261
<font color="#ffff00">Are you going to be late?</font>

465
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:12,044
<font color="#ffff00">You called me</font>

466
00:35:12,124 --> 00:35:13,907
<font color="#ffff00">You must be busy, so I'll see you later</font>

467
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,160
<font color="#ffff00">Did you eat, Yeon-soo?</font>

468
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:16,961
<font color="#ffff00">Don't skip a meal even though you're busy</font>

469
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,028
<font color="#ffff00">Are you okay?</font>

470
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:19,344
<font color="#ffff00">Don't overwork</font>

471
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,424
<font color="#ffff00">Just come home</font>

472
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:21,644
<font color="#ffff00">Patting</font>

473
00:35:29,758 --> 00:35:32,590
<font color="#ffff00">Han's Bike Lab</font>

474
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:41,374
Wait.

475
00:36:42,874 --> 00:36:43,907
Don't turn on the light.

476
00:36:58,567 --> 00:36:59,567
Jung-hyun.

477
00:37:03,674 --> 00:37:04,674
Jung-hyun.

478
00:37:10,337 --> 00:37:11,619
What happened?

479
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:13,461
I worried about you so much.

480
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:14,573
I'm sorry.

481
00:37:20,414 --> 00:37:21,534
What happened to your wrist?

482
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:26,157
How did you get this bruise?

483
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,323
What is all this?

484
00:38:40,558 --> 00:38:42,498
Did Im Hyung-rak do this to you?

485
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:46,433
Why is he doing this to us?

486
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:49,591
Is it all because of me?

487
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:52,219
Will he stop if I quit?

488
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:53,853
No.

489
00:38:56,091 --> 00:38:57,907
Even if you quit, he won't stop.

490
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,116
Let's go to the police.

491
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:02,029
You were even shot. Let's go.

492
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:04,000
You know my testimony

493
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:06,496
won't be enough to get Im Hyung-rak.

494
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:12,190
For now, it's safer

495
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:15,840
to make him believe that I'm dead.

496
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,944
Is that why you didn't call us,
and didn't come home?

497
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:25,740
I thought something
bad had happened to you.

498
00:39:27,308 --> 00:39:28,623
I had no other choice.

499
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:29,891
What about our children?

500
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,396
They worry about you so much.

501
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:38,673
He tried to kill me.

502
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:41,478
If he finds out that I'm alive,

503
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:43,607
he'll try to kill me again.

504
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:46,944
It'll put you and our
children in danger too.

505
00:39:55,178 --> 00:39:56,193
I'll hide somewhere

506
00:39:57,624 --> 00:39:58,624
for a while.

507
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:00,993
Don't worry.

508
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:08,908
<font color="#ffff00">Min Sang-a</font>

509
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:10,991
Take it.

510
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,543
Hi, Sang-a.

511
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:21,387
Oh, hey.

512
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:24,340
Joo-pil is going to write
an article about the CIO

513
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:25,511
before the general election.

514
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,873
<i><font color="#80ffff">Do you know what the title is?</i></font>

515
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:28,423
What is it?

516
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:32,340
"CIO Director Choi Yeon-soo's
Empty Pledges."

517
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:37,099
<i><font color="#80ffff">He's been having some fun
with Yoo Sang-dong lately.</i></font>

518
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:38,386
With Yoo Sang-dong?

519
00:40:38,574 --> 00:40:39,340
<i><font color="#80ffff">Yes.</i></font>

520
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:42,306
<i><font color="#80ffff">He's playing golf with Yoo Sang-dong,</i></font>

521
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:45,502
<i><font color="#80ffff">and Im Hyung-rak tomorrow morning.</i></font>

522
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:47,883
Tomorrow morning? Where?

523
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:51,532
<i><font color="#80ffff">At Yongin Ian Bridge CC.</i></font>

524
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:56,213
<i><font color="#80ffff">Anyway, don't be so
surprised by the article.</i></font>

525
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:58,261
Okay, thank you. I'll call you again.

526
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,373
I'll go.

527
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:08,206
Where will you go in that condition?

528
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:10,757
Don't worry.

529
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:13,357
I have somewhere to go.

530
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:26,323
I don't want you to do
anything dangerous now.

531
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:43,407
Don't worry.

532
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,923
<font color="#ffff00">Vacant</font>

533
00:42:22,108 --> 00:42:23,108
Get in.

534
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:25,196
I told you to just leave.

535
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:27,343
I'm not doing this to help you.

536
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:30,407
I know you won't believe me.

537
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,553
I'm just annoyed.

538
00:42:34,058 --> 00:42:36,657
I want to see Im Hyung-rak behind bars.

539
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,420
Satisfied? Now get in.

540
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:02,358
Who's this?

541
00:43:05,908 --> 00:43:06,990
Who is it?

542
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:19,707
Suk-gyu.

543
00:43:24,419 --> 00:43:25,432
You...

544
00:43:25,513 --> 00:43:26,795
Not the hospital.

545
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:33,540
Suk-gyu. Suk-gyu.

546
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,890
<font color="#ffff00">Lee Suk-gyu</font>

547
00:44:07,824 --> 00:44:08,840
<font color="#ffff00">Lee Suk-gyu</font>

548
00:44:11,424 --> 00:44:12,457
Suk-gyu.

549
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:15,463
There. Lie down.

550
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:17,907
Good.

551
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,540
Let me see.

552
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:24,373
It's okay.

553
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:28,910
Suk-gyu.

554
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,152
Who did this?

555
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:33,903
Im Hyung-rak?

556
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:59,140
I bet your wife was startled.

557
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,041
She was.

558
00:45:03,608 --> 00:45:05,957
I see. Let's get it done quickly.

559
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:09,010
You don't have to do this.

560
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:11,890
It's to make myself feel comfortable, okay?

561
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:13,740
Let me do it.

562
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:15,940
Anyway, so where

563
00:45:16,624 --> 00:45:17,657
should we go now?

564
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:20,241
What do we do first?

565
00:45:22,165 --> 00:45:23,964
Yongin Ian Bridge CC.

566
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:26,100
Yongin Ian Bridge CC?

567
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,553
Tomorrow morning, Im Hyung-rak,

568
00:45:29,074 --> 00:45:30,543
and Assemblyman Yoo Sang-dong

569
00:45:30,763 --> 00:45:32,046
will play golf there.

570
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:33,973
Yoo Sang-dong?

571
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,323
The leader of the Justice Party.

572
00:45:38,158 --> 00:45:39,707
Early tomorrow morning, right?

573
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:42,540
Let's go get some sleep somewhere.

574
00:45:53,977 --> 00:45:55,778
Hey, doesn't this

575
00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:58,707
remind you of when we did stakeouts?

576
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:01,023
Oh, goodness.

577
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,340
We were so young back then.

578
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:05,611
You're still young.

579
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:07,457
As if.

580
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,257
Every day feels different.

581
00:46:09,524 --> 00:46:10,744
Driving this taxi all day

582
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:12,373
makes my back sore like crazy.

583
00:46:13,174 --> 00:46:14,174
Hey.

584
00:46:14,976 --> 00:46:16,743
When we stayed up all night for days

585
00:46:16,824 --> 00:46:18,323
to mop up the narcotics ring,

586
00:46:19,124 --> 00:46:20,657
we were so hardworking.

587
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:23,507
You were incredible back then.

588
00:46:25,091 --> 00:46:26,640
You really were hardworking.

589
00:46:28,131 --> 00:46:29,663
Why did you retire so soon?

590
00:46:30,714 --> 00:46:33,029
Well, I stayed long
enough as a section chief.

591
00:46:34,974 --> 00:46:36,566
It wasn't my thing anyway.

592
00:46:36,774 --> 00:46:38,073
Oh, come on.

593
00:46:38,624 --> 00:46:40,144
"You're Han Jung-hyun from now on.

594
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:43,350
Live Han Jung-hyun's
life to the bone. Okay?"

595
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:45,947
I could tell you were born for the job.

596
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:47,929
I did that?

597
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:53,640
At that time, I thought it was my thing.

598
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:56,210
But you see,

599
00:46:56,524 --> 00:47:00,271
I felt like I was
being used in time.

600
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,163
What do you mean?

601
00:47:02,244 --> 00:47:05,184
You know there are people who care
only for their own good

602
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:07,578
in any kind of organization.

603
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,178
I guess it takes up about one percent.

604
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,373
People like Im Hyung-rak.

605
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:17,727
If something serves their interests,

606
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:19,890
they make it their goal,

607
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:21,894
and just take any means necessary.

608
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:25,373
Whether 99 percent of people
like us die, or whether it's right,

609
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:26,923
they just push ahead with it.

610
00:47:27,974 --> 00:47:29,663
They discard those people when it's done.

611
00:47:29,758 --> 00:47:32,074
If one seems to know something,
they trample on them.

612
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,360
I've done so many things

613
00:47:34,441 --> 00:47:36,207
that shouldn't have been done.

614
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:39,823
I thought to myself that it was my duty.

615
00:47:40,978 --> 00:47:43,568
That it was my way to
be loyal to the country.

616
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,807
But it wasn't.

617
00:47:49,062 --> 00:47:50,877
I was nothing but a tool

618
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:53,023
for their shady schemes.

619
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,223
Guess what's even more ridiculous.

620
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:03,157
I've realized that I hadn't changed.

621
00:48:07,074 --> 00:48:08,340
I'm sorry.

622
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:14,231
Anyway, when I saw you leave
after I betrayed you.

623
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:18,923
I wanted to go kill myself.

624
00:48:20,741 --> 00:48:23,557
But you came back to see me.

625
00:48:24,391 --> 00:48:25,673
I'm so glad,

626
00:48:26,724 --> 00:48:27,740
and grateful.

627
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:30,340
I mean it.

628
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:32,157
Will you stop?

629
00:48:32,974 --> 00:48:34,757
Just thinking about that time...

630
00:48:38,224 --> 00:48:40,273
Hey, isn't that the one?

631
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:55,457
Suk-gyu.

632
00:48:56,758 --> 00:48:58,557
Remember you're injured and be careful.

633
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:01,077
If you get hurt, everything will be over.

634
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:02,278
Take care of yourself first.

635
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,723
Okay, stay here.

636
00:49:28,778 --> 00:49:30,377
Someone sloppy must've dropped it.

637
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,990
Let's just leave it there.

638
00:49:32,494 --> 00:49:33,626
Find its owner.

639
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:34,707
Yes, sir.

640
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:41,601
- Good shot.
- Nice shot.

641
00:49:45,794 --> 00:49:48,460
Indeed, some clubs
are pricey for a reason.

642
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:50,676
The more you invest, the farther you hit.

643
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:52,324
It's not only for golf.

644
00:49:52,405 --> 00:49:53,757
It's how the world works.

645
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,840
Of course, even for elections.

646
00:49:57,124 --> 00:49:59,423
The more you invest,
the more votes you get.

647
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:02,388
Oh. How is it going
with the general election?

648
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:04,090
Safe constituencies

649
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:07,990
will be ours even
with a single golf club.

650
00:50:08,524 --> 00:50:09,540
In the end,

651
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:12,390
it's about who takes
the swing constituencies.

652
00:50:12,908 --> 00:50:14,044
Make sure you select where to invest

653
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:15,911
among those constituencies wisely.

654
00:50:15,991 --> 00:50:18,290
Has the investment money
been prepared already?

655
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:19,857
Yes.

656
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:21,923
This country was

657
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:24,629
worthless in the world,
but our seniors

658
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:27,090
led it to today's abundance.

659
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:29,657
We must keep moving forward

660
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,363
and eliminate everything
that gets in the way.

661
00:50:35,608 --> 00:50:37,611
That's our job,
so don't worry about the money.

662
00:50:37,691 --> 00:50:38,723
This time,

663
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:41,340
let's take all the targeted seats,

664
00:50:41,874 --> 00:50:43,474
and get started with the impeachment.

665
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:46,728
Are the materials ready?

666
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:47,808
Yes.

667
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:49,254
When will you make the investment?

668
00:50:50,658 --> 00:50:51,690
In a few days.

669
00:50:51,974 --> 00:50:53,757
As soon as Choi Yeon-soo resigns.

670
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:57,607
You never disappoint.

671
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:06,270
- Nice shot.
- Nice shot.

672
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:09,228
- Here.
- Yes, sir.

673
00:51:09,308 --> 00:51:10,573
You're a strong hitter indeed.

674
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:11,873
All right, let's go.

675
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:27,413
Someone sloppy must've dropped it.

676
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:28,907
Let's just leave it there.

677
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:43,899
Hello.

678
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,698
Hello. How can I help you?

679
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,811
Did you get any lost phones?

680
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:53,427
Please wait. There's one,
but we have to check first.

681
00:51:53,508 --> 00:51:54,961
It will recognize my fingerprint.

682
00:52:02,508 --> 00:52:03,711
It's yours.

683
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:06,107
Thank you.

684
00:52:11,124 --> 00:52:12,157
<font color="#ffff00">Recorded files</font>

685
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:13,973
<font color="#ffff00">New recording</font>

686
00:52:18,941 --> 00:52:21,977
Excuse me. Did someone
claim the lost phone?

687
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:23,573
Yes, just now.

688
00:52:24,124 --> 00:52:26,417
- Just now?
- It's that man over there.

689
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,057
That man?

690
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:41,973
Excuse me.

691
00:55:05,508 --> 00:55:08,381

Goodness, these punks.

698
00:55:21,524 --> 00:55:23,307
What an old-fashioned scheme.

699
00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:25,344
They're still doing things like this?

700
00:55:26,058 --> 00:55:27,144
Unbelievable.

701
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,757
<i><font color="#80ffff">Don't worry about the money.</i></font>

702
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,840
Let's go.

703
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:32,108
Okay.

704
00:55:38,874 --> 00:55:40,328
They confirmed the identity

705
00:55:40,408 --> 00:55:41,840
of the body found by the Han River.

706
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,227
I see.

707
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,490
It was Park Won-jong who went missing.

708
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:53,976
Our concern ended up becoming true.

709
00:55:56,008 --> 00:55:57,290

Earlier this morning, his subordinate

716
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,486
found a suicide note in his office.

717
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,882
After all this time,
they found the note now?

718
00:56:25,491 --> 00:56:28,023
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, everyone. Goodbye.</font>

719
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:32,653
He even came to my house
to report the smoking gun.

720
00:56:32,941 --> 00:56:35,678
And what, he killed himself
because he couldn't stand

721
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:36,994
the over straining investigation?

722
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:38,473
This is ridiculous.

723
00:56:40,424 --> 00:56:42,473
It matches his signature,

724
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:44,773
but to commit suicide.

725
00:56:45,308 --> 00:56:46,447
He loved himself too much.

726
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:49,110
This isn't suicide.
He was forced to die.

727
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:50,191
Could he be

728
00:56:50,758 --> 00:56:52,211
doing this to get rid of everyone

729
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:53,823
related to the tablet PC?

730
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:55,328
So why? Why?

731
00:56:55,408 --> 00:56:57,128
Because they got in the way?

732
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:59,444
Cha Min-ho, Kim Myung-jae,
Park Won-jong. All three of them?

733
00:56:59,524 --> 00:57:02,107
What's sure is that
he isn't an easy target.

734
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:03,454
Goodness gracious.

735
00:57:05,191 --> 00:57:06,440
Mr. Choo.

736
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,831
Let's make sure to get
this guy, Im Hyung-rak.

737
00:57:21,974 --> 00:57:22,974
Well...

738
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:26,543
You haven't heard anything

739
00:57:26,624 --> 00:57:28,140
from Mr. Han yet. have you?

740
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:31,257
Director.

741
00:57:31,744 --> 00:57:34,310
Park Won-jong was found dead.

742
00:57:34,391 --> 00:57:35,993
I have this feeling

743
00:57:36,074 --> 00:57:40,140
that we shouldn't keep hesitating
about this matter.

744
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:43,773
Let's report him missing.

745
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:47,416
I feel so anxious
that I can't work.

746
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:50,116
Let's wait a few more days.

747
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:57,307
<font color="#ffff00">1 unread message</font>

748
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,390
<i><font color="#80ffff">Do you remember where
we had jjajangmyeon,</i></font>

749
00:57:59,658 --> 00:58:00,938
<i><font color="#80ffff">for the first time together?</i></font>

750
00:58:02,008 --> 00:58:03,728
I'll leave work first.

751
00:58:03,808 --> 00:58:05,340
Well, okay.

752
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,340
- I'm going home.
- Okay, goodbye.

753
00:58:15,345 --> 00:58:17,410
Goodness, this frustration is unbearable.

754
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:19,909
I need some soju to calm it down.

755
00:58:20,308 --> 00:58:21,857
I'm meeting someone.

756
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:23,610
I'm a little tired.

757
00:58:23,691 --> 00:58:24,973
I want a drink too.

758
00:58:25,758 --> 00:58:26,773
Let's drink.

759
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:06,690
Director Choi is in a tight spot, right?

760
00:59:09,524 --> 00:59:10,540
Will she get fired?

761
00:59:11,211 --> 00:59:12,493
Yes, in a few days.

762
00:59:13,191 --> 00:59:15,773
The Blue House is grilling her like crazy.

763
00:59:16,824 --> 00:59:18,590
I wanted to do well.

764
00:59:18,874 --> 00:59:20,511
You were right.

765
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,707
I'm always right...

766
00:59:24,008 --> 00:59:25,135
What do you mean?

767
00:59:25,308 --> 00:59:27,528
You said that
it'd be stupid, silly, and foolish

768
00:59:27,608 --> 00:59:29,577
to become Director of the CIO.

769
00:59:29,658 --> 00:59:30,957
Even worse than that.

770
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:32,993
I feel

771
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:35,140
so sorry that if she resigns,

772
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:36,771
I'll resign along with her.

773
00:59:37,224 --> 00:59:38,977
That's a given.

774
00:59:39,058 --> 00:59:40,058
Same here.

775
00:59:41,341 --> 00:59:43,078
Stop eating already.

776
00:59:43,158 --> 00:59:45,194
I can't believe you're
digging in like this

777
00:59:45,274 --> 00:59:47,194
when our director is
about to get kicked out.

778
00:59:47,896 --> 00:59:49,195
Are you kidding me?

779
00:59:49,276 --> 00:59:51,012
You're too quiet given this situation.

780
00:59:51,093 --> 00:59:52,126
I have nothing to say.

781
00:59:52,646 --> 00:59:53,883
You're too much.

782
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:55,372
I'm so disappointed in you.

783
00:59:55,674 --> 00:59:57,223
Didn't you see this coming?

784
00:59:58,462 --> 00:59:59,490
What?

785
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:01,636
Did you think they'd get caught easily?

786
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,386
Bad guys aren't stupid.

787
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:08,216
They're diligent and tenacious.

788
01:00:09,158 --> 01:00:12,543
They fight with their lives
on the line not to go to jail.

789
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,094
We're up against
the worst one among them.

790
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,540
So?

791
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:22,466
So what?

792
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:25,229
If you're that smart, say something.

793
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,664
Right, so what should we do?

794
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:37,867
You want to know?

795
01:00:38,741 --> 01:00:39,990
We must bet our lives too.

796
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,576
Like Director Choi.

797
01:00:45,191 --> 01:00:47,408
Have you come all this way
without such determination?

798
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:48,757
I'm so disappointed in you.

799
01:00:49,081 --> 01:00:50,363
Buy a drink.

800
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:52,451
Give us another bottle of soju, please.

801
01:00:56,858 --> 01:00:58,407
Well... Mr. Choo.

802
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:01,682
I will bet my life too.

803
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:04,010
Me too.

804
01:01:04,091 --> 01:01:07,144
I didn't know
that's how you felt.

805
01:01:07,224 --> 01:01:09,007
Let's drink first.

806
01:01:11,608 --> 01:01:13,361
Let's bet our lives, cheers.

807
01:01:13,441 --> 01:01:14,673
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

808
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,640
<font color="#ffff00">Chive and oyster jjamppong</font>

809
01:01:36,394 --> 01:01:38,460
This place is still the same.

810
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:41,271
I was a bit surprised to see it too.

811
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,030
Sit down.

812
01:01:49,008 --> 01:01:50,244
Are the kids all right?

813
01:01:50,324 --> 01:01:51,340
Yes.

814
01:01:53,424 --> 01:01:54,723
How's your injury?

815
01:01:55,508 --> 01:01:57,307
Well, I'm okay.

816
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:24,157
Didn't you have lunch?

817
01:02:24,401 --> 01:02:25,417
It's my first meal today.

818
01:02:30,124 --> 01:02:33,378
Well, isn't it obvious to help out
those sick and struggling?

819
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,727
That's what I learned since kindergarten.

820
01:02:35,808 --> 01:02:37,057
Anyway,

821
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:40,360
I just feel
too uncomfortable to know

822
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:42,507
that people face injustice

823
01:02:43,331 --> 01:02:44,863
like Hwang Jung-ho.

824
01:02:46,204 --> 01:02:47,953
Why did you want to meet me here?

825
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,367
You haven't changed.

826
01:02:53,624 --> 01:02:54,890
Things you said.

827
01:02:55,424 --> 01:02:57,223
Your confidence.

828
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,007
Your first intention.

829
01:03:00,074 --> 01:03:02,390
I remember so vividly being seated here.

830
01:03:03,974 --> 01:03:05,507
I hardly remember now.

831
01:03:07,957 --> 01:03:09,012
I'm sorry.

832
01:03:09,093 --> 01:03:11,678
Be careful.
Park Won-jong's body was found.

833
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:15,090
You expected that.

834
01:03:18,077 --> 01:03:20,143
I'm going to get Im Hyung-rak for sure.

835
01:03:20,224 --> 01:03:22,738
Right, you will.

836
01:03:23,874 --> 01:03:26,158
And this is also my concern now.

837
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:27,910
Jung-hyun.

838
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:29,790
You. Seung-goo, Seung-mi.

839
01:03:31,108 --> 01:03:32,640
I want you guys to be at ease again.

840
01:03:38,074 --> 01:03:39,293
I have to get my revenge too.

841
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:41,423
What can you do in that state?

842
01:03:44,591 --> 01:03:46,073
Once you resign,

843
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,827
Im Hyung-rak
will start making a move.

844
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:49,923
<font color="#ffff00">New recording</font>

845
01:03:50,298 --> 01:03:51,818
It's what Im Hyung-rak talked about

846
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:54,040
with his allies on
the golf course today.

847
01:03:55,108 --> 01:03:56,390
You...

848
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:01,841
<font color="#ffff00">New recording</font>

849
01:04:03,158 --> 01:04:05,990
His goal is
the next general election.

850
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:10,360
<i><font color="#80ffff">Has the investment money
been prepared already?</i></font>

851
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:11,677
<i><font color="#80ffff">Don't worry about the money.</i></font>

852
01:04:11,758 --> 01:04:13,210
We must get him this time.

853
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:14,573
It's our last chance.

854
01:04:14,874 --> 01:04:16,211
<i><font color="#80ffff">And get started with the impeachment.</i></font>

855
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:18,407
<i><font color="#80ffff">Are the materials ready?</i></font>

856
01:04:18,758 --> 01:04:19,773
Yes.

857
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:22,242
Are they trying to buy
off votes with money?

858
01:04:24,158 --> 01:04:25,457
Yes.

859
01:04:59,134 --> 01:05:00,433
Everything's ready.

860
01:05:01,027 --> 01:05:03,343
Wait in the car.
It could be dangerous.

861
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:06,007
No. I need to see it for myself.

862
01:05:17,574 --> 01:05:18,852
Let's begin.

863
01:05:29,987 --> 01:05:31,143
Let's begin.

864
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:32,528
Yes, ma'am.

865
01:05:49,094 --> 01:05:50,610
Let's go inside already.

866
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:07,930
What are you doing?

867
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:09,147
We're from the CIO.

868
01:06:09,228 --> 01:06:11,260
We'll search this house
from this moment on.

869
01:06:12,328 --> 01:06:14,327
Stop being absurd, and go back.

870
01:06:14,741 --> 01:06:15,797
You can't go inside.

871
01:06:15,878 --> 01:06:18,381
Open the gate. We're getting in
no matter what.

872
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:19,631
- Goodness.
- Move.

873
01:06:19,711 --> 01:06:21,164
- Stop them!
- Let's go.

874
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:22,681
- Goodness.
- Stop them.

875
01:06:22,761 --> 01:06:23,793
Move.

876
01:06:25,344 --> 01:06:26,534
No, stop them all.

877
01:06:33,228 --> 01:06:35,493
What, you want a fight?

878
01:06:37,867 --> 01:06:39,547
I have a third-degree black belt in kendo.

879
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:41,813
We're risking our lives like some people,

880
01:06:41,894 --> 01:06:43,177
so let's bring it on.

881
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:47,110
Drop your guns.

882
01:06:52,794 --> 01:06:53,896
What is going on?

883
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:55,526
Excuse me, Mr. Im.

884
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:56,897
We're from the CIO.

885
01:06:56,978 --> 01:06:59,100
We'll search this house
from this moment on.

886
01:06:59,181 --> 01:06:59,986
A search warrant.

887
01:07:00,078 --> 01:07:01,564
According to Article
216, Clause 1, Section 1,

888
01:07:01,644 --> 01:07:04,131
Paragraph 200-2 of the
Criminal Procedure Code,

889
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:06,248
emergency search and seizure can be made

890
01:07:06,328 --> 01:07:08,414
in case a culprit may
destroy evidence or flee.

891
01:07:09,878 --> 01:07:13,131
All right, let's search every corner
of this house.

892
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:14,198
- Okay.
- Okay.

893
01:07:14,278 --> 01:07:15,310
Follow them.

894
01:07:20,394 --> 01:07:21,760
Hello.

895
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:26,298
You must've been in a rush.

896
01:07:26,378 --> 01:07:28,964
We received a report
that somewhere in this house,

897
01:07:29,044 --> 01:07:31,577
there's a tablet PC used to
manage the special budget.

898
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:33,421
This place is possessed by the country.

899
01:07:33,973 --> 01:07:36,404
Outsiders are strictly forbidden
from entering.

900
01:07:38,361 --> 01:07:39,593
You know this guy, right?

901
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:41,943
Park Won-jong.

902
01:07:42,761 --> 01:07:46,331
He stole the tablet PC
before he died. Where is it?

903
01:07:46,411 --> 01:07:48,898
Did you barge in here to ask me this?

904
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:50,998
Against manners, breaking the rules?

905
01:07:51,078 --> 01:07:53,313
Your people tried to approach me

906
01:07:53,394 --> 01:07:55,743
but they ended up dying one by one.

907
01:07:56,294 --> 01:07:57,294
Cha Min-ho,

908
01:07:57,712 --> 01:07:59,511
Park Doo-sik, Park Won-jong.

909
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:01,898
Trying to keep manners and procedures,

910
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:04,481
I can't let more people die.

911
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:06,327
I don't understand what you mean.

912
01:08:06,661 --> 01:08:08,331
You see, Americans remember

913
01:08:08,411 --> 01:08:11,448
themselves watching the planes
crash into the Twin Towers

914
01:08:11,528 --> 01:08:15,677
of the World Trade Center
during the September 11 attacks.

915
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:19,860
You must remember

916
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:21,804
the day Kim Tae-yeol died.

917
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:23,718
Since you're the one who killed him.

918
01:08:24,997 --> 01:08:26,029
Kim Tae-yeol.

919
01:08:27,194 --> 01:08:28,743
Kim Tae-yeol...

920
01:08:31,304 --> 01:08:32,561
You are

921
01:08:33,315 --> 01:08:35,281
such a horrible judge of character.

922
01:08:36,065 --> 01:08:37,065
Are you aware of that?

923
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:38,066
What?

924
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,396
Look around you,

925
01:08:39,814 --> 01:08:41,296
and look back on the past.

926
01:08:44,585 --> 01:08:46,039
Do you still not get it?

927
01:08:47,513 --> 01:08:49,328
Especially, when it comes to men.

928
01:08:49,596 --> 01:08:51,128
Lee Suk-gyu is one example.

929
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:55,946
He abandoned
his everything for me.

930
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:01,929
You messed with my family.

931
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,950
I'll make you pay for it,

932
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:07,062
Mr. Im Hyung-rak.

933
01:09:08,113 --> 01:09:09,930
- Is that a threat?
- No.

934
01:09:10,963 --> 01:09:12,246
I'm declaring war.

935
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:13,796
Wow.

936
01:09:18,663 --> 01:09:20,162
Please open the safe.

937
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:23,052
Sure thing.

938
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:24,530
Let's go.

939
01:09:25,599 --> 01:09:26,615
What's your name?

940
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:28,444
Choo Dong-woo, sir.

941
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,183
The safe you mentioned was already empty.

942
01:09:36,263 --> 01:09:38,829
Among what was seized
from Im Hyung-rak's house.

943
01:09:39,097 --> 01:09:40,800
We couldn't find anything

944
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,446
related to the Widow's Cruse Project,

945
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,450
or Cha Min-ho and
Kim Myung-jae's deaths.

946
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:47,766
As we expected, the NIS

947
01:09:47,847 --> 01:09:51,196
reported you for abuse of power,
and illegal inspection.

948
01:09:51,673 --> 01:09:53,738
The prosecution will indict you soon.

949
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:55,075
I bet.

950
01:09:55,647 --> 01:09:57,696
Director, well...

951
01:09:58,247 --> 01:09:59,796
you'd better watch this.

952
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,083
<i><font color="#80ffff">The spokesperson of the NIS has said</i></font>

953

01:10:34,423 --> 01:10:36,263
<i><font color="#80ffff">for the immediate

967
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:38,800
What, serial killers?

968
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,179
This is darn ridiculous.

969
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:43,084
The media can't be doing this alone.

970
01:10:44,013 --> 01:10:46,812
Let's not be bothered by the media play.

971
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,329
Oh, and I'll watch the result
of Mr. Hwang's retrial

972
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,900
before coming to work tomorrow.

973
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,779
What, already?

974
01:10:54,753 --> 01:10:57,116
Goodness. Now that I've aged,

975
01:10:57,197 --> 01:10:59,529
time flies like crazy.

976
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:02,472
Today becomes tomorrow
before I even realize it.

977
01:11:02,639 --> 01:11:03,888
The days pass by so quickly.

978
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:09,433
I hope things work out for him.

979
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:12,630
- Director Choi.
- Yes?

980
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:13,718
Have a safe trip.

981
01:11:14,512 --> 01:11:15,528
Okay.

982
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,261
I'm home.

983
01:11:21,496 --> 01:11:22,761
Seung-mi.

984
01:11:23,296 --> 01:11:24,578
What are you doing?

985
01:11:26,129 --> 01:11:27,395
Today's Seung-goo's birthday.

986
01:11:28,396 --> 01:11:30,732
Oh, my. I forgot.

987
01:11:30,812 --> 01:11:34,128
Don't worry. I followed
exactly what Dad's recipe says.

988
01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:36,961
<font color="#ffff00">Seaweed soup</font>

989
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:44,478
Seung-goo.

990
01:11:45,823 --> 01:11:47,108
Happy birthday.

991
01:12:01,646 --> 01:12:02,911
Should I do it?

992
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:10,645
Seung-goo.

993
01:12:11,179 --> 01:12:12,461
Eat up.

994
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:17,145
Okay. I'll enjoy it.

995
01:12:17,429 --> 01:12:18,945
I'll enjoy it too.

996
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:37,328
What?

997
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,399
- Is it not good?
- It's okay.

998
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:44,078
I followed Dad's recipe...

999
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:46,379
Gosh.

1000
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:50,279
What is this?

1001
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:53,111
Dad's seaweed soup is good.

1002
01:12:55,212 --> 01:12:56,212
Why is it sweet?

1003
01:12:59,596 --> 01:13:00,611
Dad...

1004
01:13:01,406 --> 01:13:02,406
Dad.

1005
01:13:03,867 --> 01:13:05,916
I'll make it again for you.

1006
01:13:05,997 --> 01:13:06,997
Don't.

1007
01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:09,165
Please don't.

1008
01:13:09,929 --> 01:13:11,228
Okay.

1009
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:17,595
Jung-hyun?

1010
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:39,041
Sorry. I forgot about Seung-goo's birthday.

1011
01:14:40,162 --> 01:14:41,395
Did you have dinner?

1012
01:14:42,196 --> 01:14:43,761
Yes, Seung-mi cooked.

1013
01:14:46,312 --> 01:14:48,345
Then have it tomorrow morning.

1014
01:14:49,379 --> 01:14:51,195
Okay, Seung-goo will love it.

1015
01:14:52,512 --> 01:14:53,528
How's your injury?

1016
01:14:53,996 --> 01:14:55,845
I'm okay. It's gotten a lot better.

1017
01:14:57,696 --> 01:14:58,978
Did you come to give me this?

1018
01:15:03,396 --> 01:15:04,396
Yes.

1019
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:35,978
Choi Yeon-soo seems
to be confused

1020
01:15:36,062 --> 01:15:37,449
unable to let anyone know

1021
01:15:37,529 --> 01:15:39,045
about her husband's disappearance.

1022
01:15:40,329 --> 01:15:42,361
Hwang Jung-ho's retrial
will be ruled tomorrow,

1023
01:15:43,396 --> 01:15:45,156
but she doesn't have
the leisure to mind it.

1024
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,424
By the way,

1025
01:15:48,046 --> 01:15:50,345
the media are expecting

1026
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:52,452
that the ruling will
declare his innocence.

1027
01:15:53,729 --> 01:15:54,978
Well,

1028
01:15:56,029 --> 01:15:58,861
then I should send her a gift.

1029
01:16:00,162 --> 01:16:01,695

Oh, Mr. Hwang's

retrial result will be
out tomorrow, right?

1035
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:25,746
Yes.

1036
01:16:26,562 --> 01:16:28,328
It will turn out well. Don't worry.

1042
01:17:07,912 --> 01:17:09,195
I'm okay.

1043
01:17:15,096 --> 01:17:17,161
Yang Ki-heon's written will.

1044
01:17:17,696 --> 01:17:19,448
It's crucial enough to overturn

1045
01:17:19,529 --> 01:17:21,295
Hwang Jung-ho's trial, isn't it?

1046
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:27,095
Mr. Kim Tae-yeol,

1047
01:17:27,812 --> 01:17:30,178
why are you showing this to me?

1048
01:17:31,662 --> 01:17:32,678
This...

1049
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:34,745
Tae-yeol?

1050
01:17:35,262 --> 01:17:36,078
What?

1051
01:17:36,296 --> 01:17:37,311
<i><font color="#80ffff">That written will.</i></font>

1052
01:17:38,262 --> 01:17:40,161
<i><font color="#80ffff">Is it tempting enough to the ANSP?</i></font>

1053
01:17:40,696 --> 01:17:42,995
I'd like to hear your
advice, Mr. Im Hyung-rak.

1054
01:17:43,636 --> 01:17:45,652
If you hand it over to us,

1055
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:47,469
Hwang Jung-ho will be sentenced to death.

1056
01:17:49,425 --> 01:17:50,425
It can't be helped.

1057
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:51,216

1060
01:17:54,429 --> 01:17:55,961
"It can't be helped"?

1061
01:17:57,796 --> 01:17:59,578
Is this really Tae-yeol?

1062
01:18:00,579 --> 01:18:01,861
<i><font color="#80ffff">What is it that you want?</i></font>

1063
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,895
I'd like to meet someone.

1064
01:18:07,179 --> 01:18:08,179
Who?

1065
01:18:08,622 --> 01:18:09,905
The President of Korea.

1066
01:18:14,146 --> 01:18:15,161
<i><font color="#80ffff">The President?</i></font>

1067

1071

1072
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:25,432
<i><font color="#80ffff">- start protesting again.</i></font>
- I don't get it.

1073
01:18:25,512 --> 01:18:27,578
I can't guarantee what will happen next.

1074
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:34,578
I will have a debate
with him on TV about our current state.

1075
01:18:37,603 --> 01:18:38,631
Yeon-soo.

1076
01:18:38,712 --> 01:18:40,966
<i><font color="#80ffff">- So in exchange for the evidence...</i></font>
- I'm okay.

1077
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:42,499
<i><font color="#80ffff">proving Hwang Jung-ho's innocence,</i></font>

1078
01:18:42,579 --> 01:18:44,032
you want to have the entire country

1079
01:18:44,112 --> 01:18:46,557
watch your debate with the President?

1080
01:18:47,499 --> 01:18:50,219
<i><font color="#80ffff">So to speak. Do you
actually think that's possible?</i></font>

1081
01:18:50,629 --> 01:18:54,588
<i><font color="#80ffff">Why not? I'm sure he's
confused with the situation too.</i></font>

1082
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:56,668
<i><font color="#80ffff">What are you trying to say?</i></font>

1083
01:18:56,749 --> 01:18:58,798
I'll explain what the people want,

1084
01:18:58,879 --> 01:19:00,366
and what kinds of complaints they have.

1085
01:19:00,446 --> 01:19:02,181
And he will say, "I understand.

1086
01:19:02,262 --> 01:19:04,611
I will take your opinion
into consideration."

1087
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:08,245
That will make him a generous leader.

1088
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:11,781
A president of communication

1089
01:19:11,862 --> 01:19:13,742
who even listens to a
young college student.

1090
01:19:14,462 --> 01:19:16,715
And you will become the hero

1091
01:19:16,796 --> 01:19:18,799
who led the country's cohesion

1092
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,813
through that negotiation
with the President?

1093
01:19:20,979 --> 01:19:23,795
We call that a win-win.
