00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:48,236
Okay.

13
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:50,253
Wait.

14
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:52,672
Sir.

15
00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:54,799
Can you open the window?

16
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:01,992
Open the window, please.

17
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:16,403
Oh.

18
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,800
Please step out of the car.

19
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:23,973
I said, step out of the car.

20
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,053
What's the matter?

21
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,635
What's going on?

22
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:56,919
Oh. He said I can't park here.

23
00:06:57,953 --> 00:06:58,953
Oh.

24
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,336
Are you the CIO Director, by any chance?

25
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,973
Yes, hello.

26
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:04,319
I'm Choi Yeon-soo.

27
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:07,385
What brings you here?

28
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:09,640
I have some questions to ask.

29
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,952
About what?

30
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,706
How many people were dispatched

31
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:16,052
when Park Doo-sik died on October 7th?

32
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,310
Weren't they dispatched
from Honam Patrol Division?

33
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:20,790
Yes.

34
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,196
Did you see the murder scene of Park

35
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,822
who died in the motel?

36
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,702
Yes, we did.

37
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,316
But the Investigation Unit came,
so we withdrew immediately.

38
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:30,871
They arrested

39
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,585
the culprit as well.

40
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:35,869
Did you see an old newspaper,

41
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:39,202
or anything peculiar
at the murder scene?

42
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:41,673
We didn't inspect the scene.

43
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,002
So I don't know the details.

44
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:46,035
Anything peculiar?

45
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:48,052
No, there wasn't anything.

46
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,135
By the way, who is this man?

47
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:55,203
He's my husband.

48
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,719
Oh, is he?

49
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:00,053
May I ask

50
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,819
what his name is?

51
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:04,353
Why do you ask?

52
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:12,219
I'm Han Jung-hyun.

53
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:14,503
Han Jung-hyun?

54
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,402
I asked because you looked familiar.

55
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,769
Do you want me to move my car?

56
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,352
Yes. This parking area is for patrol cars,

57
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:26,869
so please move your car.

58
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:29,169
- Okay, we're sorry. Thank you.
- Sure.

59
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,052
He looks very much like that guy.

What's wrong?

71
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:39,236
Did Park Doo-sik

72
00:09:40,986 --> 00:09:42,252
come to see me?

73
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,352
<font color="#ffff00">North Korean defector. Deceased</font>

74
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,663
Mr. Choo.

75
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,100
I checked Park Won-jong's call history.

76
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:03,606
Did you find anything?

77
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,573
There's a person he frequently talked to
after Cha Min-ho's death.

78
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,860
Captain Goo Seo-bok
of the Investigation Unit.

79
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:12,628
- Who?
- Captain Goo Seo-bok.

80
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,406
The one who kicked me out of the unit.

81
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,935
After the incident,
he scrapped the rental car,

82
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:19,481
ignored all the doubts,

83
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,535
and hurriedly concluded
the case as suicide.

84
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,069
He talked to Park Won-jong?

85
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,529
Yes.

86
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:31,123
Early in the morning on
the day of Cha's death,

87
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,151
Park Won-jong and Goo talked on the phone.

88
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:34,903
On the day the investigation ended,

89
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:37,390
they talked on the phone,
and met at a hotel in Gangnam.

90
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,602
And they talked again
on the phone a week ago.

91
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,015
<font color="#ffff00">Outgoing call</font>

92
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:43,372
Mr. Jeong.

93
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:47,908
Do you remember when I twisted your arm?

94
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,070
Well...

95
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,414
Why are you bringing that up again?

96
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,919
You, as a detective,
let someone twist your arm?

97
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,185
He looks like a fine detective

98
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,565
but how should I put it?

99
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,285
I feel close to him for some reason.

100
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,570
It's nothing like that.

101
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:04,353
- I was--
- Did you find

102
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:06,435
the memory chip of the dash cam

103
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:08,302
in Cha's car?

104
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:14,788
No.

105
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,906
- Good morning!
- What? Where are you going?

106
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:21,267
We'll tell you when we get back.

107
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,291
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

108
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,019
- Good morning.
- Hello, ma'am.

109
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:31,806
What's going on?

110
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:32,922
I don't know.

111
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:35,299
They talked about
something I didn't understand.

112
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
Goodness.

113
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:38,285
- Mr. Bae.
- Yes?

114
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,069
Park Doo-sik was murdered.

115
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:42,586
Park Doo-sik?

116
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,744
The guy who killed Kim Tae-yeol?

117
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:50,219
At Eunajang Inn in Uijeongbu
on October 7th.

118
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:52,901
I think he came to meet me.

119
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:54,020
What?

120
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,835
Who on earth did that?

121
00:11:56,386 --> 00:12:00,326
The murderer is the serial killer
in Sokcho who recently died.

122
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:01,486
What?

123
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:04,161
My goodness.

124
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:10,055
It seems that you have
something to tell me,

125
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:11,401
but I don't want to hear it.

126
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:13,171
I see.

127
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,080
Okay. I'll look into it then.

128
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,637
Who's in charge of the case?

129
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:28,656
Captain Goo Seo-bok
of the Investigation Unit.

130
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:31,990
Why did something like that happen

131
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,102
at a time like this?

132
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,321
For goodness' sake.

133
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,308
- Please do me a favor.

What is it?

157
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:22,719
It's a message sent to
Choi Yeon-soo just now.

158
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,389
"I witnessed Kim Tae-yeol's death.

Park Doo-sik isn't the real culprit."

160
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:28,303
Kim Tae-yeol?

161
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:30,756
Did Choi Yeon-soo read this?

162
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,402
Yes, she already did.

163
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:34,140
There are attachments too.

165

166
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:40,036
We can't find that out.

167
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:41,336
Darn it.

168
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:03,435
Who else saw these pictures?

169
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:04,990
Only Kim Gwang-cheol.

170
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,302
Choi Yeon-soo saw them too.

171
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:08,086
Oh.

172
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:09,869
Yes, she did too.

173
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,490
I'll check who sent it and
watch Choi Yeon-soo thoroughly.

174
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:18,756
- Young-geol.
- Yes, Mr. Im?

175
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,173
Don't you want to come back
and get a promotion this year?

176
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Yes. I'll do my best.

<font color="#ffff00">Send a text message</font>

179
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,073
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

180
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:19,590
Goo is the one who signed the paper

181
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,373
to scrap the rental car,
which was evidence.

182
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:23,056
He also took the memory chip

183
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:24,673
of the dash cam in Cha's car.

184
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:27,519
It was caught on CCTV,
and we got the footage.

185
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,723
He omitted the memory chip

186
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:31,335
from the list of evidence.

187
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:34,090
He destroyed the evidence,
obstructed the investigation,

188
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,170
and committed theft.

189
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,623
I constantly raised doubts,

190
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,373
but he ignored them
and kicked me out of--

191
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:39,769
- It's highly likely...
- Oh.

192
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:42,602
That Goo is working for Park Won-jong.

193
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,340
We need to arrest Goo
before Park notices it,

194
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,660
and does something about it.

195
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:49,373
All right. Locate Goo's whereabouts,

196
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:50,890
and carry out
a search and seizure.

197
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,985
Yes, ma'am.

Get your head on straight

207
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:15,899
Seriously, I feel sick.

208
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,035
Can you please let me take a day off?

209
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,821
That's none of my concern.

210
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:26,633
You think this is a joke?

211
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,650
No, sir.

212
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,982
Tell the truth, you son of a gun.

213
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:04,991
The other spy, your partner.

214
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:07,053
Who is it?

215
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,149
Boss.

216
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:10,862
What are you talking about?

217
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:12,721
The other spy?

218
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:39,399
What's going on?

219
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,712
Where have you been all day?

220
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,493
It's none of your business.

221
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:46,574
What?

222
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,269
I went to a clinic.

223
00:19:58,983 --> 00:19:59,983
Why?

224
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:03,240
What does it matter to you
if I aborted a child?

225
00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:10,960
Sear him until he tells the truth.

226
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,950
Follow me.

227
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,611
- You're dead.
- Hey.

228
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:50,719
It's your first time, so you may not know.

229
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,705
But this will help you
forget all your pain.

I'd set myself free.

Have you thought about it?

243
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:36,470
Tell the truth and be freed

244
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:39,795
from everything.

245

I want to go back to that time.

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I liked it.

I worked really hard for my country.

253
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:19,634
But when my body broke down,
they abandoned me.

254
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,665
I was in hell.

I'm sorry.

257
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:43,116
I'm meeting...

258
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:48,122
Choi Yeon-soo today.

<i><font color="#80ffff">- Don't worry. I won't talk about you.</i></font>

260
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:54,901
The Company did this to me.

261
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:58,084
I'm going to tell her what they did.

262
00:24:58,616 --> 00:24:59,803

<i><font color="#80ffff">The same applies to you.</i></font>

264

You're still under their thumb.

265
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,379
What matters to me is my family.

00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:17,344
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'm going to fight.</i></font>

267

Don't you know what they are like?

268

I know

269
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,177
who killed Kim Tae-yeol.

<i><font color="#80ffff">I'm going to tell that
to Choi Yeon-soo.</i></font>

271
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,479

272
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,415
<i><font color="#80ffff">No, Yoon-joo.</i></font>

273
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:43,898

278
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:55,733
Yoon-joo.

279
00:25:57,252 --> 00:25:59,096

I'm checking it now.

284
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:45,611
It's heading to Mi World.

285
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:48,111
Secure all the CCTVs nearby.

00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:04,694
Suk-gyu.

345
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:12,672
Who are you?

346
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,536
Is this the right way
to the artificial waterfall?

347
00:39:40,616 --> 00:39:42,633
- Yes, it is.
- Thank you.

348
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:15,252
Excuse me.

349
00:40:16,323 --> 00:40:18,630
Hello? Ma'am. Are you okay?

350
00:40:18,952 --> 00:40:20,201
Ma'am.

351
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,599
Why is she here?

352
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,516
Ma'am.

353
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:55,127
Ma'am. Are you okay?

354
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,637
Wake up.

355
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:08,103
The man in a denim jacket over there,
please call 119.

356
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:09,912
She's suffering a heart attack. Hurry.

357
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:17,069
One, two, three, four,

358
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,108
five, six, seven, eight...

362
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,420
- Coming through.
- Please make way.

363
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,686
Coming through.

364
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:24,703
Please make way.

365
00:42:24,783 --> 00:42:26,236
Coming through.

366
00:42:26,316 --> 00:42:27,599
- What...
- Let us through.

367
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,915
Coming through.

368
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,182
Yes, sir.

369
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:32,716
<i><font color="#80ffff">Pull out</i></font>

370
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:33,953
Pardon?

371
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:35,683
Let's have dinner together later.

372
00:42:37,146 --> 00:42:39,178
Sure, I'll see you later.

373
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:46,651
Darn it.

374
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:51,404
Look, stay with me.

375
00:42:52,356 --> 00:42:53,855
Come on.

376
00:42:58,266 --> 00:42:59,266
Here!

377
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,520
Excuse us. What happened?

378
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,382
She's breathing again, but unconscious.

379
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:05,666
Ma'am, can you hear my voice?

380
00:43:05,747 --> 00:43:07,387
We must take her to
the hospital quickly.

381
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,615
Careful.

00:43:28,616 --> 00:43:30,665

<font color="#ffff00">Catmiau</font>

387
00:43:58,016 --> 00:43:59,049
What...

388
00:44:00,116 --> 00:44:01,116
Why...

389
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,619
She's a close friend of mine.

390
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,749
A friend?

391
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,815
A friend who?

392
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,165
A friend from my orphanage.

393
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:16,491
What...

394
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,299
How can...

395
00:44:38,622 --> 00:44:40,121
Mr. Im wants us to pull out.

396
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,025
Let's wrap up here.

397
00:44:42,828 --> 00:44:44,394
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

398
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,182
What is he doing here this time?

399
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:15,982
Seung-goo.

400
00:45:16,766 --> 00:45:17,953
Is your dad home?

401
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:19,065
<i><font color="#80ffff">Dad?</i></font>

402
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:20,461
He isn't home.

403
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,199
He stepped outside to visit a vendor.

404
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:24,735
I see.

405
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:26,515
Okay.

406
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:42,441
<i><font color="#80ffff">If I could,</i></font>

407
00:45:42,983 --> 00:45:44,765
<i><font color="#80ffff">I want to go back to that time.</i></font>

408
00:45:45,283 --> 00:45:46,470
<i><font color="#80ffff">I was happy then.</i></font>

409
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,985
<i><font color="#80ffff">No, Yoon-joo. You'll only get hurt.</i></font>

410
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:52,220
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'm meeting Choi Yeon-soo soon.</i></font>

411
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:54,362
<i><font color="#80ffff">- Yoon-joo, are you okay?
- I'm going to fight.</i></font>

412
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:56,562
<i><font color="#80ffff">Excuse me. Look.</i></font>

415
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,300
<i><font color="#80ffff">was transferred to
Daehan Medical Center.</i></font>

416
00:47:18,716 --> 00:47:19,742
How's her condition?

417
00:47:19,823 --> 00:47:21,824
<i><font color="#80ffff">The one who found
her gave good first aid.</i></font>

418
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,421
<i><font color="#80ffff">She's safe for now.</i></font>

419
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:31,835
Okay, thank you.

420
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:07,515
<font color="#ffff00">Enter pass code</font>

421
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:20,140
- Director Choi.
- Yes?

422
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:22,052
I found something from Mr. Goo's laptop.

423
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,188
- Really?
- Yes.

424
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:26,685
Mr. Jeong, what is it this time

425
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:28,203
that you wanted
to meet us in secret?

426
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:29,315
It's making me anxious.

427
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:33,085
The day Park Doo-sik died on October 7,

428
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,886
the CCTV camera near the inn captured this.

429
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,356
This man isn't mentioned
in the official record.

430
00:48:37,437 --> 00:48:38,969
The murderer left the inn

431
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,863
two minutes earlier than this guy.

432
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:45,597
What... What is this?

433
00:48:47,142 --> 00:48:48,641
Can you play it again?

434
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:04,068
What's the use of this?

435
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,448
The real culprit already got caught.

436
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,435
No, this man was even arrested
near the crime site.

437
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,688
He got arrested?

438
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:14,141
Yes, his name is...

439
00:49:14,506 --> 00:49:15,771
Lee Suk-gyu.

440
00:49:15,992 --> 00:49:18,008
What, Lee Suk-gyu?

441
00:49:20,516 --> 00:49:21,516
And?

442
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:25,576
He could be a witness,
or an accomplice.

443
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:29,268
<i><font color="#80ffff">Section chief, I'm Lee Suk-gyu.</i></font>

444
00:49:30,383 --> 00:49:32,169
<i><font color="#80ffff">Kim Tae-yeol is here.</i></font>

445
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:34,549
<i><font color="#80ffff">Auntie's Bar in Sadang-dong.</i></font>

446
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,332
<i><font color="#80ffff">Auntie's Bar</i></font>

447
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,115
<i><font color="#80ffff">in Sadang-dong.</i></font>

448
00:49:39,633 --> 00:49:42,199
<i><font color="#80ffff">Oh, that man from earlier.</i></font>

449
00:49:43,153 --> 00:49:45,435
Didn't we see him at Mr. Hwang's hospital?

450
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:47,548
I mean, at the parking lot.

451
00:49:48,035 --> 00:49:51,068
He talked about getting
divorced with a hat on.

452
00:49:53,152 --> 00:49:54,384
Lee Suk-gyu.

453
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,103
<font color="#ffff00">Jung-hyun</font>

454
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:06,420
If we track down this man
named Lee Suk-gyu,

455
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,953
we might be able
to reveal another truth

456
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:10,065
behind Park Doo-sik's case.

457
00:50:14,155 --> 00:50:16,954
The way I see it, the real culprit

458
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,505
already got arrested,
and it's a little

459
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:22,799
off to find a connection between this,
and Park Won-jong.

460
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,232
We'll be going.

461
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,199
<font color="#ffff00">Jung-hyun</font>

462
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:50,920
<font color="#ffff00">You called. I guess you're busy...</font>

463
00:50:51,204 --> 00:50:52,469
<i><font color="#80ffff">You called.</i></font>

464
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:54,781
<i><font color="#80ffff">I guess you're busy... See you later.</i></font>

465
00:51:17,229 --> 00:51:19,503
<font color="#ffff00">You called. I guess you're busy...</font>

466
00:52:43,908 --> 00:52:45,441
I decline your suggestion.

467
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,745
I was young.

468
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:35,636
<font color="#ffff00">Senior Secretary Kang Choong-mo</font>

469
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:42,449
Hello, Mr. Kang.

470
00:54:43,233 --> 00:54:45,615
This is Im Hyung-rak of the NIS.

471
00:54:46,002 --> 00:54:48,018
I'm calling to have
an urgent word with you.

472
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:12,521
When did you come?

473
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:18,014
You couldn't be reached.
I guess you were busy.

474
00:56:08,536 --> 00:56:09,785
Why are you drinking alone?

475
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,003
Wait a bit. I'll make some ramyeon for you.

476
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:14,811
Let me pour you a glass.

477
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:29,532
When I was seven,

478
00:56:30,938 --> 00:56:33,706
I stole a jawbreaker from
a supermarket in my neighborhood.

479
00:56:35,883 --> 00:56:37,665
Just one jawbreaker.

480
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,953
It was so tasty that I sucked it all

481
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:43,565
without taking a single bite.

482
00:56:45,366 --> 00:56:47,570
The supermarket lady
wasn't going to know

483
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,165
how many jawbreakers there were,

484
00:56:49,308 --> 00:56:51,268
and no one saw me do it.

485
00:56:51,962 --> 00:56:53,744
I ate it in secret.

486
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:57,149
So I thought nobody would know.

487
00:56:59,356 --> 00:57:00,888
I thought

488
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:04,744
it was okay because nobody...

489
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,004
Nobody knew.

490
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:16,497
But it wasn't okay.

491
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:18,899
Do you know why?

492
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:23,632
I didn't...

493
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,542
feel okay. I just couldn't.

494
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,965
From that moment,

495
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:38,334
I did what made me feel okay.

496
00:57:39,842 --> 00:57:41,562
Although it was uncomfortable,

497
00:57:41,643 --> 00:57:43,625
and took a lot of patience

498
00:57:44,216 --> 00:57:46,299
even when nobody knew.

499
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:48,618
You know it as well.

500
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:51,538
I'm okay only when my heart tells me so.

501
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:56,253
I do.

502
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,732
What about you?

503
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:08,833
Do you feel okay?

504
00:58:15,853 --> 00:58:16,897
Yeon-soo, I--

505
00:58:16,978 --> 00:58:19,294
I thought you were like me.

506
00:58:22,627 --> 00:58:26,211
These days, I keep thinking
that you might not be.

507
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:28,782
Yeon-soo.

508
00:58:32,535 --> 00:58:34,301
What are you talking about?

509
00:59:21,872 --> 00:59:24,404
I thought you were like me.

510
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:31,008
These days, I keep thinking
that you might not be.

511
01:00:06,605 --> 01:00:07,605
Mr. Do.

512
01:00:08,032 --> 01:00:09,531
Isn't that Lee Suk-gyu?

513
01:00:10,003 --> 01:00:13,454
This crazy punk hasn't
come to his senses yet.

514
01:00:13,535 --> 01:00:16,053
You see, he seemed
to follow someone.

515
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:17,443
So I tracked him down.

516
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:20,051
This man went in there.

517
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:22,698
Go Yoon-joo collapsed
and got taken to the ICU.

518
01:00:23,116 --> 01:00:25,249
Then he came out here.

519
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:27,436
Lee Suk-gyu followed him but collapsed.

520
01:00:28,089 --> 01:00:30,388
This could be the Ghost.

521
01:00:34,186 --> 01:00:35,201
Hey.

522
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:37,428
Discard all this,

523
01:00:38,108 --> 01:00:39,708
and delete Go Yoon-joo's e-mail, photos.

524
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:41,885
- Everything.
- What?

525
01:00:41,966 --> 01:00:45,203
Delete them. Just delete them all.

526
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:46,283
Yes, sir.

527
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:50,132
Darn it.

528
01:01:10,982 --> 01:01:12,264
Well,

529
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,449
I should've taken care of her

530
01:01:16,016 --> 01:01:17,765
when she surfaced.

531
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:20,299
Today,

532
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:24,382
I deleted all the information
about Go Yoon-joo.

533
01:01:26,441 --> 01:01:27,450
However,

534
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:31,691
I feel like I've done
only half the mission.

535
01:01:33,142 --> 01:01:35,191
If you had trusted me,

536
01:01:35,272 --> 01:01:37,038
and given me a little more time...

537
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:40,966
Young-geol.

538
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:45,032
Yes?

539
01:01:45,982 --> 01:01:47,531
At that time, you and I...

540
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:50,199
saved this country.

541
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,190
Yes.

542
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:04,064
I will...

543
01:02:04,695 --> 01:02:07,511
have Go Yoon-joo taken care of.

544
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,508
Don't mind her.

545
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:12,370
Pardon?

546
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:13,609
Choi Yeon-soo.

547
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,249
She's all you need to care about.

548
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,782
Yes.

549
01:02:22,616 --> 01:02:23,616
I understand.

550
01:02:31,866 --> 01:02:33,949
<font color="#ffff00">Parents' Love Nursing Hospital</font>

551
01:02:39,816 --> 01:02:41,036
Where did your dad go?

552
01:02:41,117 --> 01:02:42,625
I don't know. He lied!

553
01:02:42,706 --> 01:02:44,605
<i><font color="#80ffff">The old man I volunteered to serve</i></font>

554
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:46,828

<font color="#ffff00">Parents' Love Nursing Hospital</font>

556
01:03:21,705 --> 01:03:22,921
How may I help you?

557
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:26,671
I'm here to ask you something.

558
01:03:28,635 --> 01:03:32,218
Mr. Lee Man-ho used to stay
in this hospital.

559
01:03:32,299 --> 01:03:33,565
Did he pass away?

560
01:03:34,552 --> 01:03:36,334
Mr. Lee Man-ho...

561
01:03:38,261 --> 01:03:40,294
Yes, he passed away.

562
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:43,038
By any chance,

563
01:03:43,745 --> 01:03:45,278
was it 10 days ago?

564
01:03:46,386 --> 01:03:47,902
When was it?

565
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:51,481
Oh.

566
01:03:52,426 --> 01:03:53,708
It wasn't 10 days ago.

567
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:55,788
It was about two months ago.

568
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,185
Are you sure?

569
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,736
I'm sure.

570
01:04:02,816 --> 01:04:04,270
I was on night duty that day.

571
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,382
I remember seeing him pass away.

572
01:04:07,651 --> 01:04:09,700
<i><font color="#80ffff">The old man I volunteered to serve</i></font>

573
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:11,697
<i><font color="#80ffff">suddenly passed away.</i></font>

574
01:04:16,116 --> 01:04:17,382
Thank you.

575
01:04:40,891 --> 01:04:42,771
Go Yoon-joo was caught
for drugs three times,

576
01:04:42,852 --> 01:04:44,572
and admitted to a
mental hospital two times.

577
01:04:44,653 --> 01:04:45,919
She's a typical junkie.

578
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,970
She was diagnosed
with nicotine addiction yesterday.

579
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,206
Is that why?

580
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:51,552
No, nicotine isn't a hallucinogenic drug.

581
01:04:51,937 --> 01:04:53,374
We find it strange too

582
01:04:53,455 --> 01:04:55,254
but we will get to it once she wakes up.

583
01:04:56,182 --> 01:04:57,182
By any chance,

584
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,952
have you looked
into people around her?

585
01:05:01,232 --> 01:05:02,998
She has elderly parents.

586
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:05,683
But she was hardly in touch with them.

587
01:05:07,245 --> 01:05:08,492
Parents?

588
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:10,235
Both her parents are alive.

589
01:05:10,316 --> 01:05:13,164
They hung up as soon as
we brought their daughter up.

590
01:05:13,245 --> 01:05:14,527
It can't be.

591
01:05:15,941 --> 01:05:17,872
Isn't she an orphan?

592
01:05:17,953 --> 01:05:19,268
What are you talking about?

593
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:21,080
Both her parents are well and alive.

594
01:05:21,696 --> 01:05:22,712
What?

595
01:05:27,433 --> 01:05:28,449
Are you okay?

596
01:06:05,238 --> 01:06:06,987
<i><font color="#80ffff">Both her parents are alive.</i></font>

597

600
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:36,522

<i><font color="#80ffff">Yes, how may I help you?</i></font>

602

I'm looking for someone named

603
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:44,034
Go Yoon-joo who stayed there in the 70s.

604
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:45,628
Go Yoon-joo.

605
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:47,369
<i><font color="#80ffff">Go Yoon-joo.</i></font>

606
01:06:47,584 --> 01:06:49,350

612
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:07,099
Then...

613
01:07:09,512 --> 01:07:10,977
What about Han Jung-hyun?

614
01:07:11,422 --> 01:07:13,188
<i><font color="#80ffff">Just a moment.</i></font>

615
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:19,634
<i><font color="#80ffff">I checked again after the call.</i></font>

616
01:07:20,654 --> 01:07:24,469
Like you said, Han Jung-hyun
used to stay here.

617
01:07:25,669 --> 01:07:27,552
He was born in 1968

618
01:07:29,387 --> 01:07:32,498
and died in 1975.

619
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:37,195
It must be somewhere
around here. Wait a bit.

620
01:07:49,201 --> 01:07:50,217
Here.

621
01:07:50,695 --> 01:07:53,619
This is a group picture taken in 1974.

622
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,153
This is Han Jung-hyun.

623
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:58,541
Oh, there's a close-up of him too.

624
01:08:02,183 --> 01:08:05,432
He had a big burn
scar on his face.

625
01:08:06,507 --> 01:08:07,672
The director at that time

626
01:08:07,753 --> 01:08:10,198
didn't report kids
dead even if they died

627
01:08:10,279 --> 01:08:11,607
to get financial aid.

628
01:08:28,999 --> 01:08:30,831
Are you okay?

629
01:08:34,293 --> 01:08:36,179
- Here.
- Pass.

630
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,509
- Here.
- Catch it!

631
01:08:39,793 --> 01:08:42,092
- Kick.
- There.

Congratulations in advance

on your appointment as Chief Secretary.

646
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:22,863
The VIP gets to decide
who becomes Chief Secretary.

647
01:11:22,943 --> 01:11:24,109
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

648
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:25,190
Figures.

649
01:11:26,353 --> 01:11:28,635
There are two more candidates.

650
01:11:28,919 --> 01:11:29,955
Yet you congratulated me

651
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,019
as if you know what the VIP is thinking.

652
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:36,105
I may not be able to put you
in favor with the VIP.

653
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,717
But I can make sure the other two

654
01:11:38,798 --> 01:11:40,410
are out of favor with him.

655
01:11:46,129 --> 01:11:47,129
Mr. Im.

656
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:49,924
What are you talking about?

657
01:11:50,192 --> 01:11:53,008
I work for this country.

658
01:11:53,366 --> 01:11:54,865
For this country to be safe,

659
01:11:55,564 --> 01:11:58,742
you must take
the chief secretary position.

660
01:11:59,155 --> 01:12:00,771
- Mr. Im.
- But...

661
01:12:01,677 --> 01:12:03,930
for you to become one,

662
01:12:04,011 --> 01:12:06,385
you need to know something.

663
01:12:06,753 --> 01:12:08,102
That's why I asked to see you.

664
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:41,873
If I'd told everything,

665
01:12:43,174 --> 01:12:44,439
would things be different?

666
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:51,589
I'm sorry. Go Yoon-joo.

667
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:55,906
It's too late for me

668
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:01,006
to say that I want
to go back like you did.

669
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,856
You call me Lee Suk-gyu.

670
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:07,906
But to Yeon-soo and our kids,

671
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,956
