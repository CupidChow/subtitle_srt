1
00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:07,787
(Undercover)

2
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,033
(All places, characters, companies,)

3
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:15,913
(and incidents in this drama
are fictitious.)

4
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:21,495
Yang Ki-heon's written will.

5
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:25,612
It's crucial enough to overturn
Hwang Jung-ho's trial, isn't it?

6
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,366
If you hand it over to us,

7
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:29,978
Hwang Jung-ho will be sentenced to death.

8
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:32,812
It can't be helped.

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,169
The country comes first.

10
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,279
(Keep silence)

11
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:00,895
I refuse your offer.

12
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,812
Tae-yeol.

13
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:40,396
Tae-yeol.

14
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:17,313
Those jerks.

15
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:19,613
They locked Tae-yeol
in a cell with a man

16
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:21,659
who escaped
North Korea three months ago.

17
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:24,828
I'm sure they did it intentionally.

18
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,457
They also made his mom sign

19
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:29,737
a cremation consent form

20
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,039
saying it's to refuse an autopsy.

21
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,795
And what? It was a mistake?

22
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:35,313
Darn it.

23
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:36,813
Does it make sense?

24
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:39,008
I need to meet Park Doo-sik.

25
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,250
I'll find out the truth

26
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,228
even if I have to defend him.

27
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:45,662
What?

28
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,912
I'll meet him and find out why he did it,

29
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,962
and who made him do it.

30
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:01,196
Excuse me.

31
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:06,513
Are you guys

32
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:09,078
Mr. Kim Tae-yeol's friends?

33
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:11,613
Yes.

34
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,458
It's a tragedy.

35
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,418
I had...

36
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,078
high expectations for Mr. Kim.

37
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:29,978
He died for nothing.

38
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:33,578
I hope you'll remember it.

39
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:35,378
Thank you.

40
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:37,462
We'll do that.

41
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,145
I hope people will learn

42
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:50,528
what kind of person he was someday.

43
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,966
By the way,

44
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:55,662
who are you?

45
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,112
I'm just an ordinary person

46
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:05,583
who worries about this country

47
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,663
just like you guys.

48
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,095
All right.

49
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:14,878
Let's dig into it to the end

50
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:18,462
so Tae-yeol won't feel wronged anymore.

51
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:23,783
<i>A president of communication</i>

52
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,743
<i>who even listens to a
young college student.</i>

53
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,995
<i>And you will become the hero</i>

54
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:29,733
<i>who led the country's cohesion</i>

55
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:31,693
<i>through that negotiation
with the President?</i>

56
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:34,662
<i>We call that a win-win.</i>

57
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,266
No.

58
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:43,895
It's not true, Jung-hyun.

59
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:47,979
What...

60
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:50,578
What on earth is this?

61
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:52,963
No.

62
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:54,928
It's not Tae-yeol, right?

63
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,145
You listen to it. It is...

64
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:00,952
<i>But what's more amusing is,</i>

65
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,828
<i>thanks to the written will...</i>

66
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,595
This is fabricated.

67
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,166
I'm sure it's fabricated.

68
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:08,416
It's not Tae-yeol's voice, Jung-hyun.

69
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:10,262
<i>I can't guarantee what will happen next.</i>

70
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:12,746
Why...

71
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,178
Why aren't you saying anything?

72
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:24,622
By any chance,

73
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:27,446
Yang Ki-heon's written will

74
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,140
that you found three years ago--

75
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,329
No.

76
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:35,398
Tae-yeol had hidden it, not to lose it.

77
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:42,896
Why?

78
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,978
Why are you looking at me like that?

79
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:57,996
No.

80
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:06,928
(Kim Tae-yeol's voice)

81
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,139
<i>That written will.</i>

82
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,947
<i>Is it tempting enough to the ANSP?</i>

83
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,845
<i>I'd like to hear your advice,
Mr. Im Hyung-rak.</i>

84
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:18,962
<i>It can't be helped.</i>

85
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:20,921
<i>The country comes first.</i>

86
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:24,345
<i>It can't be helped.</i>

87
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,395
<i>The country comes first.</i>

88
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,596
<i>What is it that you want?</i>

89
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,512
<i>I'd like to meet someone.</i>

90
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:32,778
<i>Who?</i>

91
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:34,063
<i>The President of Korea.</i>

92
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,799
(Kim Tae-yeol's voice)

93
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,878
<i>I'd like to meet someone.</i>

94
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,273
<i>Who?</i>

95
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:40,353
<i>The President of Korea.</i>

96
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:42,183
<i>A president of communication</i>

97
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:44,143
<i>who even listens to a
young college student.</i>

98
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:46,049
<i>And you will become the hero</i>

99
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,583
<i>who led the country's cohesion</i>

100
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:49,543
<i>through that negotiation

<i>We call that a win-win.</i>

102
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:05,829
(Kim Tae-yeol's voice)

103
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:36,095
(Episode 15)

104
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:39,066
The court has reached a decision.

105
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,828
The charge against the accused

106
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,230
is unproven.

107
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,310
Therefore,

108
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,795
under Article 325
of the Criminal Procedure Code,

109
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,628
the court has decided to acquit him.

110
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:04,145
(Accused)

111
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:35,383
Yang Ki-heon's written will

112
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:36,978
that you found three years ago

113
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:39,805
was the decisive evidence
leading to this verdict

114
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,612
I see. Thank you for your hard work.

115
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,945
I'll leave you two alone then.

116
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,029
This courtroom

117
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:00,578
was like hell for my entire life.

118
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:03,678
But it's like a paradise today.

119
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,562
Thank you for holding out.

120
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:11,646
What would've happened

121
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,778
if you hadn't helped me
pull myself together?

122
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:22,178
I thought my life was doomed.

123
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,528
But I wasn't just unlucky.

124
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:28,845
Right?

125
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:33,945
I have many things to tell Tae-yeol

126
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:37,028
when I meet him soon.

127
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:40,613
"Thank you,

128
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,195
for keeping the written will,

129
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:47,278
and not letting anyone take it.

130
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,249
Why didn't you tell us
about it before you died?

131
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:54,995
You must've been very upset.

132
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,312
Yeon-soo is doing well.

133
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:02,629
She's living life to the fullest
on your behalf."

134
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:04,989
I'll tell him so.

135
00:10:08,046 --> 00:10:09,078
What's with that look

136
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,363
on a good day like this?

137
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:17,213
We promised to have makgeolli
together when I got acquitted.

138
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,445
Let's do it...

139
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:30,713
when I get well.

140
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:34,233
Will you pick up the tab?

141
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:35,313
Of course, I will.

142
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,019
(Emergency Services, Ambulance)

143
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,345
I'll get going.

144
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:44,317
<i>Mr. Hwang Jung-ho who
was sentenced to life</i>

145
00:11:44,397 --> 00:11:46,063
<i>for murdering his schoolmate</i>

146
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:48,547
<i>named Yang Ki-heon
by setting him on fire</i>

147
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:51,883
<i>on the roof of a building
at Hanguk University in 1991</i>

148
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:55,266
<i>I'm sorry. I don't feel well
today, so I'll take a day off.</i>

149
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,797
Director Choi can't come to work today.

150
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:59,599
<i>Mr. Hwang was accused of murder...</i>

151
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,649
Things only got worse.

152
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:05,313
I'm sure she's torn by anxieties.

153
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:08,048
Why? I even bought
a cake to celebrate.

154
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:09,231
She's sick.

155
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:13,228
All right. Let's get
on with our work.

156
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:16,078
Gosh, I'm so pissed off.

157
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:18,599
There's so much circumstantial evidence.

158
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,216
But we can't put handcuffs on Im Hyung-rak.

159
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:22,249
I feel so wronged and angry.

160
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,549
We need physical evidence.

161
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,114
Mr. Cha Min-ho tried

162
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:30,029
to hand Director Choi
the account list at the risk of his life.

163
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:31,728
That means there is something.

164
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:34,845
I was going to say this
when Director Choi got here.

165
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:38,741
I think Im Hyung-rak pocketed
the money to make an investment.

166
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:40,397
- An investment?
- He used the money

167
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:41,477
to make an investment?

168
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:42,980
That's intriguing. And?

169
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,079
Just a second.

170
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:48,416
I think it's possible.

171
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:49,496
You think so?

172
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:52,863
(Account details)

173
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:54,533
According to these accounts on the list,

174
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:57,133
the money went
to Minguk Investment and Securities,

175
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:00,028
and then came back
almost at the same time.

176
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,766
And the amount of each account

177
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:02,886
was doubled or tripled.

178
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:04,396
What?

179
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,462
It's like a runaway child returning home

180
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,512
with his offspring after marriage.

181
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:10,546
As you can see here,

182
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:13,662
it happened in March and November 2016,

183
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,478
July 2017,

184
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:18,716
twice in 2018 and 2019 respectively,

185
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:22,145
and once between
February and March this year.

186
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,195
Did he invest in stocks?

187
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,933
I'm not sure, but I think it's possible.

188
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:29,563
He could get help from an expert

189
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,680
like Park Won-jong,
so it's possible.

190
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:33,583
I want to check the accounts too.

191
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,649
Please give me a copy of the whole list.

192
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:38,164
Give me a copy too.
Many hands make light work.

193
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:39,244
Okay.

194
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:40,846
Goodness.

195
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,962
I couldn't tell Jung-ho the truth.

196
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:33,356
It's not your fault.

197
00:14:33,436 --> 00:14:34,623
Yes, it is.

198
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:36,912
My life has been a waste.

199
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,774
Everything I believed in was fake.

200
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,233
But I'd pursued such a thing
with profound faith in it.

201
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:45,328
What have I done?

202
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:48,645
Kim Tae-yeol wasn't your reason to live.

203
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,399
You've devoted your life to helping

204
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,719
wronged and troubled people.

205
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,062
Just keep on doing it.

206
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:57,628
How do I know what's right or wrong?

207
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:06,109
This is what Im Hyung-rak wanted.

208
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:08,228
He sent the recording, didn't he?

209
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,879
As you know,

210
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,683
his goal is to make you blame yourself,

211
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:17,562
get discouraged, and resign from your post.

212
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:20,845
Don't let him achieve it.

213
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:33,962
Mom.

214
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:36,778
Mom is here, Seung-goo.

215
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:41,445
Oh. Hi, Mom.

216
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:42,682
Hey.

217
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:45,545
There was good news about Uncle Jung-ho.

218
00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:46,812
Yes.

219
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:49,049
Mr. Hwang has been released.

220
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:50,912
Why are you in a bad mood, Mom?

221
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:52,179
Huh?

222
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:54,699
No. I'm in a very good mood now.

223
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,545
No.

224
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:58,112
You say you're in a very good mood,

225
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,545
but you're actually sad.

226
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:02,597
I can tell by looking at your face.

227
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:04,978
Yeah. Why are you home so early today?

228
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:06,781
I'm just tired. That's all.

229
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:09,645
I'll heat up some seaweed soup for you.

230
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,195
Wait, no.

231
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:13,149
My birthday has passed.

232
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:14,728
It was yesterday.

233
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,984
Then eat it tomorrow morning.

234
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,346
Oh, right.

235
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:27,862
Where did you get this?

236
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,766
Seung-goo. This is really delicious.

237
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:36,799
I'm serious.

238
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,128
- Really?
- Yes.

239
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,046
Oh.

240
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:49,113
Dad?

241
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,629
It's Dad.

242
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:52,162
Where's Dad?

243
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,995
Seung-goo. Eat it with this.

244
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,578
I'm sure Dad made this soup.

245
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,562
Look at this, Mom.

246
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:02,178
Dad cuts meat like this.

247
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:03,945
Oh, boy. Where is he?

248
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,795
It really tastes like Dad's seaweed soup.

249
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,095
Does it?

250
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,613
Yes.

251
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:14,712
Dad must've come home secretly.

252
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:16,509
Don't wait for him anymore, Mom.

253
00:17:17,013 --> 00:17:17,745
What?

254
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:20,695
Or he'll come back late like Santa Claus.

255
00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:25,945
Okay. Let's not wait for him.

256
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,495
Okay.

257
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:32,812
I'm sure Dad made this.

258
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:35,112
I haven't had a decent meal in a while.

259
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,945
The one you made was terrible.

260
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:40,745
That's enough. Eat.

261
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:42,013

264
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,328
Choi Yeon-soo will be finished tomorrow.

265
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:04,613
I'm well aware of that.

266
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:07,116
You can't go back to
the prosecutors' office

267

the bridge back yourself.

273
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,095

The reason is abuse of power.

The executive director's
office of the NIS

309
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,499
charged you with abuse of power.

310
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:25,695
That's the main reason.

What? Come to work?

give up here, were you?

It's a sad day, Mom. Why are you smiling?

449
00:29:58,748 --> 00:29:59,928
I'm not sad at all.

450
00:30:00,196 --> 00:30:02,666
Mom. Did you drink
because you were angry?

451
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:05,295
No. I'm not angry at all.

452
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:06,579
Okay.

453
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,572

454

But why isn't he coming back home?

455
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:16,378
He'll come back soon. I promise you.

456
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:20,979
Keep the promise.

457
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:24,783
Oh. Aren't you guys hungry?

458
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:26,878
I'll make you tteokbokki. Okay?

459
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,945
Well... Mom.

460
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,262
Don't do that.

461
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:33,566
- I can make delicious tteokbokki.
- No. you can't.

462
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,616
They all seem to be cheerful. I'm relieved.

463
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:37,495
Your tteokbokki is not delicious.

464
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:39,528
Don't make it, Mom.

It's not in the safe house.

477
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:48,292
It's not there.

After stabbing you in the back,

479

I was so pissed off I couldn't just leave,

481
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:00,249

483
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:27,212

taking it to the Company.

To the Company?

485
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:31,479
Yes.

487
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:35,486
It must be in the
executive director's office.

488

It's over.

489
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,716
Since your wife has been suspended,

490
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:42,795
she can't search the NIS.

491
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:45,628
Even if she does,
they won't let her take it.

492
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:48,228
It's all over.

493
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:52,545
I'll go in there and get it.

494
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:56,113
You must be crazy.

495
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:58,883
You can't go in there and get it.

00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:03,015

What are you going to do?

501
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,395
This taxi can enter

502
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:11,728
the NIS, right?

503
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:15,249
Yes.

504
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,866
I technically work for them,
so my plate number is registered.

505
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:19,666
- So?
- That means we can get in there.

506
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:21,245
Yes, we can.

507
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,433
But what are you
going to do after that?

508
00:33:23,513 --> 00:33:26,078
Do you know how many
security gates there are?

509
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:27,586
How will you pass through them?

510
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:29,599
How will you get into his office?

511
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,149
You need his fingerprint to get in there.

512
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:33,495
Have you lost your touch?

513
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,128
Getting into the
building is the first thing

514
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:38,539
I need to do.

515
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,279
Jeez.

516
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:05,755
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

517
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:08,573
Good morning.

518
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,876
I feel like I'm back in my hometown.

519
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:15,943
Gosh, Mr. Bae!

520
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:17,863
There's a cockroach in
the room! What do I do?

521
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
Good morning.

522
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:22,576
Give it to me. I'll catch it.

523
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:24,676
Jeez. What was all the fuss about?

524
00:34:24,756 --> 00:34:26,976
You need to learn to interact with nature

525
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:28,743
to quickly adapt to this building.

526
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:31,672
There are tons of cockroaches, leeches,

527
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,489
and ants here.

528
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,522
- Director.
- Yes?

529
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:38,106
What do we do now?

530
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,460
From the Cha Min-ho case,
which we started to investigate here,

531
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,025
to the Kim Myung-jae case,

532
00:34:45,106 --> 00:34:47,007
and Park Doo-sik and
Park Won-jong's deaths.

533
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,706
We need to find out the truth
behind them and punish those

534
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:52,253
who are accountable for them.

535
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:54,976
This won't end unless we get Im Hyung-rak.

536
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:56,839
What about the CIO?

537
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:01,876
All of us got kicked out.

538
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:02,956
Why do you care about it?

539
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,289
Let's accept our fate.

540
00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:08,076

00:35:38,856 --> 00:35:39,872
I think I found it.

547
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,672
- What?
- The investment.

548
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:46,226
When the money was
wired into the accounts,

549
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:47,226
and withdrawn from them.

550
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:48,526
Is it before or after the announcements

551
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:50,101
of such big deals
as national projects,

552
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:52,022
or winning overseas
construction contracts?

How did you know?

554
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:55,189
What? Really?

Yes.

559
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,156
It also happened around
North Korea's missile testing.

560

before it's released to the public.

My goodness, Ms. Song.

562

You've made a great discovery.

563

Oh, I'm flattered.

564
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:20,113
That means they used
confidential information

566

Aren't they so evil?

573
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,903
So what is Im Hyung-rak trying to do
with that money?

574
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:40,025
- To be rich?

ballots with the money?

- Yes.

Yes, it all went to Swiss Center Bank.

915
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:44,825
I'll be too ashamed...

916
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,345

917
00:59:05,273 --> 00:59:07,022
Then since when..

918
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,289
Since when we barged in his house.

919
00:59:10,073 --> 00:59:11,525
What? Does it mean

920
00:59:11,606 --> 00:59:14,465
you got suspended from
your duties on purpose?

921
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:15,360
Yes.

922
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,455
You talked about risking
our lives over jokbal.

923
00:59:17,723 --> 00:59:19,403
Did you mean by playing a betrayer's role?

924
00:59:19,883 --> 00:59:22,535
To be honest, he suits the role
more than us all.

925
00:59:23,123 --> 00:59:26,194
Anyway, we've always been on
the same team. Trust each other.

926

what about Im Hyung-rak's fingerprint?

931
01:00:19,756 --> 01:00:21,839
Will you break his finger
and take it with you?

932
01:00:23,856 --> 01:00:25,105
This will do.

933
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:31,222
