00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:58,304
YEON-SOO

3
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,789
YEON-SOO

4
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:31,504
Where have you been?

5
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:35,363
Oh.

6
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,019
I couldn't sleep, so...

7
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,964
Did you go fishing?

8
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,448
There was no nibbles,

9
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:45,675
so I was going to call it a day.

10
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:46,885
But I got it luckily.

11
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:49,151
Why didn't you answer my call?

12
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:51,058
I left my phone in the car.

13
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:53,870
I saw a missed call from you,
but I thought you'd be sleeping.

14
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:54,883
Why are you still up?

15
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:59,378
I couldn't go back to sleep
because you weren't next to me.

16
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,339
What is this?

17
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:10,229
Your jacket isn't wet at all.

18
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:11,547
Huh?

19
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:14,823
It rained heavily, but your clothes are dry.

20
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,729
Did you really go fishing>

21
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:19,362
Oh.

22
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:20,722
It's not that.

23
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:21,654
What's going on?

24
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,190
Did you do something else?

25
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:27,714
No. Let me explain.

26
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:30,854
When I folded my fishing rod
and got in the car,

27
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:33,261
it started pouring.

28
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:35,852
Really?

29
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,300
You caught a fish and avoided the rain.

30
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:39,464
You were very lucky.

31
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,358
I know.

32
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:43,081
You slept badly. Ypu must be tired.

33
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,503
Let's have steamed crucian carp
for breakfast tomorrow.

34
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,353
Go in and get some more sleep.

35
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:48,456
Okay.

36
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:22,994
UNDERCOVER
(Episode 8)

37
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:25,620
Ms. Song.

38
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:27,245
You're in early.

39
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:31,787
What's that?

40
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:34,347
As you can see,
it's coffee.

41
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,112
What's that?

42
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,175
CHOI YEON-SOO

43
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:54,901
Did you guys have a good rest?

44
00:05:56,644 --> 00:05:57,651
What is he doing?

45
00:05:58,636 --> 00:05:59,149
What's that?

46
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:01,354
It looks like a spy camera.

47
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:02,616
What?

48
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:09,550
Good morning.

49
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:11,354
My, what is he doing?

50
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:12,745
What is all this?

51
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:17,822
What?

52
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,640
This is a spy camera.

53
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Maybe there are more cameras in the other rooms.

54
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,847
The director's office, the secretary's office,
and the meeting room.

55
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,542
There were a total of three spy cameras.

56
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:40,714
Why was that one dangling from the ceiling?

57
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:44,495
The one who installed it
must've done a poor job in a hurry.

58
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:46,956
There may be more in the ladies' room.

59
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:47,976
I apologize.

60
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,331
I'll reprimand the security team
and find out who did it.

61
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,440
Yes. Please check all the offices,

62
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,456
meeting rooms, and restrooms in the CIO.

63
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:57,886
-Hey. Did you delete it?
-Yes.

64
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,665
I deleted the footage that captured you.

65
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:01,321
-But there's a problem.
-What?

66
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,987
Before you went into the office,
someone broke in.

67
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:05,428
What?

68
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:07,657
PARKING LOT ENTRANCE

69
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:10,955
Who's that?

70
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:14,065
It seems that he was here
around the same time as you.

71
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,659
MAIN HALL OF CIO

72
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:30,198
Darn it.

73
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:31,806
Look.

74
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:34,084
He completely covered his face

75
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:36,550
and cleverly hid himself in the blind spots.

76
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:37,839
How did he get into the director's office?

77
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:43,190
Before you go in there,
someone opened the office door

78
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:45,198
with Director Choi's pass.

79
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:48,303
How did he copy the director's pass?

80
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,144
Lee Suk-gyu.

81
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,190
He must know that we work here.

82
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:01,909
Oh.

83
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:05,551
Then the pass was the original>

84
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:07,284
He ust be out of his mind.

85
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:11,578
He really is out of his mind. Darn it.

86
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:29,144
Have you found out who installed the cameras?

87
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,089
Did someone break in last night
and install them?

88
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,394
Well...

89
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:37,049
No one suspicious was captured
on our CCTV cameras

90
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:38,308
since they were turned on.

91
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,151
I presume that some of the utility workers

92
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:43,128
installed them during the renovation.

93
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,167
How...

94
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:47,464
How could something like this happen?

95
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:49,214
I apologize.

96
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,597
Apologizing won't resolve this issue!

97
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:55,971
I'm sorry, ma'am.

98
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,644
Our information was constantly leaked.

99
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,354
Someone watched us through the spy cameras!

100
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,183
It's totally unacceptable.

101
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:05,269
Report it to the police immediately.

102
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,231
Check the entry logs
of both staff and visitors

103
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,870
and all the CCTV footage.

104
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:10,237
I'll take appropriate measures.

105
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,308
I suggest...

106
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,886
that we carry out
an internal investigation first.

107
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,144
What do you mean?

108
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:16,942
If either the police
or the other authorities intervene,

109
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,339
the CIO becomes both a victim and a suspecgt.

110
00:09:20,784 --> 00:09:23,253
Carry out an internal investigation
and report back to me.

111
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,777
Yes, ma'am.

112
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:25,854
I'll make sure to track down the culprit.

113
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:27,089
I'll give you a day.

114
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:34,503
That is why I asked you to check our offices.

115
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:37,323
This wouldn't have happened if you had done it.

116
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,425
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:50,151
If I were the director, I would fire you.

118
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:54,439
I apologize.

119
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:55,672
Follow the procedure.

120
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:58,097
Submit a written apology.

121
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:04,731
Yes, sir.

122
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,785
All our information

123
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,847
including our conversations and e-mail
must've been leaked.

124
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:27,222
When I look back, there two things
that may have been leaked.

125
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,057
The tip-off about Kim Myung-jae.

126
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:33,448
And the conversation between Investigator
Jeong and you about Cha Min-ho's case.

127
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:36,987
We didn't do anything wrong.
Don't be intimidated.

128
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,487
The most important thing is
that this mustn't happen again.

129
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:42,503
Yes, ma'am.

130
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:44,722
Let's get down to the issue that matters now.

131
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:47,706
The report has been confirmed to be fake.

132
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:49,519
A flight ticket to Jeju was booked

133
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:51,636
in Kim Myung-jae's name
five days before the election.

134
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:53,225
Here.

135
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,643
There are pictures of him campaiging in Jeju.

136
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,714
How could he accept a bribe
when he wasn't even home?

137
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,503
He was away.

138
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:17,530
Please set up a press conference
at three this afternoon.

139
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:18,644
Let's wrap it up.

140
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:19,323
Yes, ma'am.

141
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:21,022
Now, the director

142
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:24,888
of the Corruption Investigation Office
for High-ranking Officials

143
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:26,034
will give a press conference.

144
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:42,862
I'm Choi Yeon-soo.

145
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,110
Three days ago,

146
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:50,214
we were tipped off about an irregularity
committed by the current chief secretary.

147
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,081
We, the CIO,

148
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,479
looked into the case,

149
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,019
<i>and I'm here to share
the results of our investigation.</i>

150
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,193
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESULTS

151
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:06,987
<i>The CIO</i>

152
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:11,144
has concluded that

153
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:16,354
the chief secretary is clear from suspicioun.

154
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:17,745
It's an unsupported allegation.

155
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:23,651
Hence, we have decided
to call off the investigation.

156
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:25,979
Now.

157
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,491
<i>The CIO</i>

158
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:38,097
will always watch and investigate

159
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,276
the high-ranking officials

160
00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:42,198
regardless of rank...

161
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:01,065
My, what is this?

162
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:03,338
Is it the same video?

163
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:17,505
EVIDENCE HAS BEEN RELEASED

164
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,216
-Director!
-Director!

165
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,636
Please tell us about Kim Myung-jae's money bag.

166
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,556
Have you watched this video?

167
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,236
Did you properly investigate Kim?

168
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:34,972
Director.

169
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:37,173
Someone sent us this video just now.

170
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,234
Who sent him the money bag?

171
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:59,869
Why did the have to send the video when she
just annouced the end of the investigation?

172
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,109
-Goodness.
-I know.

173
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:03,502
Has Investigator Jeong called us?

174
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:04,326
Sorry?

175
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:23,376
I got you.

176
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,978
Hey, open the door.

177
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:30,524
Hey!

178
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:31,565
Hey, stop!

179
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:11,886
Darn it.

180
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:14,397
I should've used a better car.

181
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:15,064
Director.

182
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:18,175
The place where the e-mail was sent from.

183
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:19,872
You said you failed to locate the IP address.

184
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:20,262
No.

185
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:21,977
I located it.

186
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,331
It's Gimpo. The e-mail was sent from here.

187
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,378
Why didn't you tell us at the meeting
earlier?

188
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,315
I was afraid it'd be leaked again.

189
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:32,894
I see. Well done.

190
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:34,873
-Gimpo?
-Yes.

191
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:37,753
Then please...

192
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:43,292
check to see if this video was sent
from the same place.

193
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:44,718
Huh?

194
00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:46,054
Isn't this...

195
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:48,573
Mr. Kim Myung-jae?

196
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,409
No one, except us, must know about this.

197
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:01,950
THE TRUTH ABOUT KIM MYUNG-JAE

198
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:02,698
Director. You're right.

199
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:05,185
They were sent from the same place.

200
00:16:06,123 --> 00:16:08,839
I think he chose a place
with free Wi-Fi but no surveillance cameras.

201
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:11,244
Please set up a press conference
at three this afternoon.

202
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,511
Let's wrap it up.

203
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,268
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:22,909
Maybe five people.

205
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:26,293
-That'll be enough, right?
-Yes.

206
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:29,633
<i>Stake out during the press conference
and catch him if he appears again.</i>

207
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:37,073
Excuse me.

208
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,591
DIRECTOR

209
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,047
<i>The person you've dialed is unavailable.</i>

210
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:19,938
INVESTIGATOR JEONG CHEOL-HUN

211
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:21,502
Yes.

212
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:24,058
That's Kim Myung-jae.

213
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,206
The truth is that someone

214
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,901
e-mailed me that video yerterday.

215
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:37,128
Are you saying you knew that the video
would be sent to the reporters?

216
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:39,956
I'm sorry. The security
of our information was paramount.

217
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:41,753
It's strange.

218
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,737
He was in Jeju five days before election.

219
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:49,276
Kim Myung-jae got that money
six days before the election.

220
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:52,354
-What?
-How evil they are.

221
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:55,987
Did they try to fool us
by telling us the wrong date?

222
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,198
I hope Mr. Jeong catches the informant.

223
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:13,259
Hey!

224
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:00,849
EMERGENCY

225
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:08,359
Director Choi.

226
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:09,809
Just lie down.

227
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:11,429
Goodness.

228
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:13,441
How did this happen?

229
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,199
I missed him right in front of my .eyes

230
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:20,824
I didn't break any bones.

231
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:21,787
Don't worry.

232
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:27,066
Did you see the fce of the informant?

233
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:28,902
I did, but...

234
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:31,363
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,783
Don't be. It's relief
that things aren't worse.

236
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,197
How did you get into a car accident?

237
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:37,160
It's a hit-and-run driver or his subordinate.

238
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,543
I didn't hear any sound of brakes squealing.

239
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:40,586
Goodness.

240
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:43,035
We played into those punks' hands.

241
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,574
What do we do now?

242
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:49,527
The press will criticize you
without knowing your plan.

243
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:52,723
Look at us.

244
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:57,316
It looks like the CIO favored the Blue House
and turned a blind aye to their corruption.

245
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,636
I'm sorry. I should've caught him.

246
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,723
Right. You should have.

247
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:03,371
But you saw his face.

248
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:05,011
All we need to do is catch him.

249
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:07,371
You're so frustrating, Director.

250
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,160
Things could have been different
if we had caught the guy who sent the video.

251
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:15,020
Now we'll face serious critism
before we even catch him.

252
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,848
Goodness.

253
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:18,832
Are you okay?

254
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:27,072
NIS

255
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:29,824
Who followed you?

256
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:31,520
Oh.

257
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,582
I checked his hospital records.

258
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:36,176
He belongs to the CIO.

259
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:40,496
Did they set a trap or what?

260
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:44,723
I never thought anyone in Korea
would be able to locate my IP address

261
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,043
since I took a detour.

262
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:48,840
I'm sure it was just a coincidence.

263
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:51,723
Mr. Im.

264
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:53,887
About the vehicle that hit him...

265
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:11,880
Hey, Park Won-jong.

266
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:13,801
Yes?

267
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:17,519
Can't you do better than that?

268
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:19,245
Oh.

269
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:20,904
Yes, sir.

270
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:31,082
Mr. Kang.

271
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,168
I'm sorry.

272
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:35,910
I'll hold myself responsible.

273
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:38,949
I'll take all the blame.

274
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,653
That's not what matters!

275
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:47,238
-Mr. Kim.
-I thought...

276
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:51,191
I established this administration.

277
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:53,926
I thought...

278
00:21:55,652 --> 00:21:56,660
Somehow,

279
00:21:57,012 --> 00:21:58,059
I wanted to pass

280
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:01,340
the Budget Transparency Act.

281
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,664
The administration itself is about to go
down.

282
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,332
What's the use of the Budget Transparency Act?

283
00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:08,504
Mr. Kang.

284
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:12,949
We can't end it like this.

285
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,262
You mustn't give up.

286
00:22:17,793 --> 00:22:18,801
Right.

287
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,184
I mustn't.

288
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:23,262
We should do everything we can

289
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:26,105
to stop this administration from collapsing.

290
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:28,449
Yes, we should.

291
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:34,020
We should.

292
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,441
<i>Investigator Jeong will catch</i>

293
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:48,612
the informant in Gimpo.

294
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,004
Are you really

295
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:54,632
going to investigate the Blue House?

296
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:57,124
If they're suspected of a crime, yes.

297
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,637
That's why I joined the CIO.

298
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,402
Same goes for you, right?

299
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:08,265
I'm sure you didn't join it
just to walk on egg shells.

300
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:12,215
I told you.

301
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:14,395
You'll be able to do...

302
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:15,985
what you believes is right.

303
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,653
CHIEF PROSECUTOR GWAK MOON-HEUM

304
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:33,801
-Hi, Moon-heum.
<i>-Hey, Mr. Choo.</i>

305
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:35,934
Let's play golf this weekend.

306
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:39,727
<i>Mr. Choo?</i>

307
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,130
I'm sorry. I have to go to

308
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:42,348
to a memorial ceremony this weekend.

309
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:43,590
<i>Do you?</i>

310
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,207
I see. You're a good son.

311
00:23:47,863 --> 00:23:48,530
<i>All right.</i>

312
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,780
Bye.

313
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:04,371
<i>Chief Secretary Kim Myung-jae
is accused of accepting a bribe.</i>

314
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,235
<i>And the CIO's sluggish response
is a controversial issue.</i>

315
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,113
<i>What do you think?</i>

316
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:09,512
<i>He was caught on camera.</i>

317
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:12,551
<i>That traveling bag can hold
up to five billion won.</i>

318
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:15,848
<i>We must arrest and interrogate him immediately.</i>

319
00:24:16,434 --> 00:24:18,074
<i>Where do you think that money went?</i>

320
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:20,821
<i>I'm sure he spent it illegally
on the election campaign.</i>

321
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:22,060
<i>But the President didn't know about it?</i>

322
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,628
<i>Does it make sense?</i>

323
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:27,176
<i>The problem is that an incmpetent amoateur
become the director of CIO.</i>

324
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,199
<i>I think someone qualified should--</i>

325
00:24:33,785 --> 00:24:37,598
There's clear evidence,
so Mr. Kim can't avoid being held in custody.

326
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:39,476
I have a feeling

327
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:42,848
that a bigger fight than this is awaiting us.

328
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:47,909
When I found out that the informant

329
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:50,131
took a roundabout access route
to avoid leaving a trace,

330
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,316
I thought we shouldn't just arrest Mr. Kim
and close this case.

331
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:58,012
If someone is trying to use us
to get rid of him,

332
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:01,785
we need to know who they are

333
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:04,238
and what they're up to.

334
00:25:04,715 --> 00:25:07,910
They framed Mr. Kim Myung-jae thoroughly
and even threatened the Blue House.

335
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,473
Who could they be?

336
00:25:09,832 --> 00:25:12,582
They're trying to use the CIO
to bring down the administration.

337
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:15,184
They're bold enough to aim at the supreme power,

338
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:18,348
organized enough to figure out our next move,

339
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:22,043
and wealthy enough to invest
as much as five billion won.

340
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,006
If you start this fight,

341
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,824
it won't end unlesswe kill them
or they kill us.

342
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,066
I know.

343
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,770
Either they or we will win.

344
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:37,715
But...

345
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,152
the fight has already begun.

346
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:49,043
A search and seizure warrant
for Kim Myung-jae has been issued.

347
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:54,246
Carry out the warrant.

348
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:04,479
CIO

349
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:06,025
Take all the boxes.

350
00:26:06,674 --> 00:26:07,699
Are you all ready? Let's go.

351
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:13,770
IN THE PERFORMANCE OF OFFICIAL DUTIES

352
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,590
Take everything that seems suspicious. Okay?

353
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:21,240
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

354
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:52,215
CHIEF SECRETARY KIM MYUNG-JAE

355
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:24,590
Let's take it.

356
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:39,793
Ma'am.

357
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:41,582
We're sorry to have caused you trouble.

358
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:52,230
<i>The CIO's investigation into Kim Myung-jae</i>

359
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,371
is poor and biased.

360
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,395
The nation

361
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:59,958
cannot trust them anymore since they tried

362
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,886
to let the corrupt suspect
get away with it.

363
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,256
The inveatigation and confiscation
were sluggish.

364
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:09,534
The CIO is supposed to be investigating
the President by now.

365
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:13,676
<i>But they're investigating the case
in a very clumsy way.</i>

366
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:19,466
<i>It seems that they're trying to meet the
requirements to justify a slap on the wrist.</i>

367
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:20,705
<i>Therefore,</i>

368
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:23,521
<i>we ask the prosecution to parcitipate in...</i>

369
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:25,046
Can you please turn that off?

370
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,845
<i>Money pours out of the bag,
and he gets flustered.</i>

371
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,424
<i>But it doesn't last long.</i>

372
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,453
<i>He hurriedly picks up the money.</i>

373
00:28:40,478 --> 00:28:41,610
KIM ACCEPTING A BRIBE

374
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:46,895
<i>It's Chief Secretary Kim Myung-jae,
accused of accepting a bribe.</i>

375
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:50,863
<i>After putting the money in the bag,</i>

376
00:28:50,888 --> 00:28:52,925
<i>he hurriedly takes it into his house.</i>

377
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:56,301
<i>What he does in this video...</i>

378
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:01,746
Are you okay?

379
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,465
I haven't had dinner yet.

380
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:06,340
What's that video all about?

381
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:10,012
I told you I feel like
I'm playing into someone's hands.

382
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:12,277
My gut feeling was right.

383
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:13,796
What do you mean?

384
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:15,660
Did something happen again?

385
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:18,480
This morning,

386
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,582
we found a spy camera

387
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,441
dangling from the ceiling.

388
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,324
It looked like someone exposed it.

389
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,152
What? A spy camera?

390
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:31,645
I presume that those who installed them
released the video as well.

391
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:35,746
Who could they be?

392
00:29:36,387 --> 00:29:37,395
Don't worry.

393
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:39,152
I'll catch them.

394
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:41,816
Thank goodness we found the spy cameras.

395
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:44,621
Otherwise, they'd still be watching us.

396
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:52,752
Chief Secretary Kim Myung-jae
presented himself at the CIO just now.

397
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:57,951
Kim is known to have been deeply involved
in Ms. Choi's appointment as CIO Director.

398
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:02,012
The whole nation is paying attention to whether
or not the CIO will strictly investigate him

399
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,223
How much was it?

400
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:53,934
It was 5.23 billion won.

401
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:59,775
PUBLIC OPINION POLL, MARKETING

402
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,658
VEHICLES FOR THE CONGRESSMEN

403
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:02,858
PR MATERIALS

404
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:04,426
Who sent it?

405
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:06,613
I don't know.

406
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:10,099
Are you defending the briber now?

407
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:11,496
They didn't reveal themselves.

408
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,254
I didn't try to find them either.

409
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,316
I thought one of our supporters left it there

410
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:19,684
for us to use it.

411
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,512
It was over five billion won.

412
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:24,668
Five billion won?

413
00:31:26,524 --> 00:31:27,824
<i>Six days before the election,</i>

414
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,395
when the release of poll results was banned,

415
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,559
the golden cross was about to appear
on the chart.

416
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:35,160
But...

417
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:38,426
we had run out of money for our campaign.

418
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,848
And I found the bag

419
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:43,449
in front my house that day.

420
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,043
How could you...

421
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:51,230
spend the money without knowing who sent it?

422
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:52,715
I had no time to do that.

423
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:54,941
I was tied up.

424
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:56,875
I just thought I had to hang in there.

425
00:31:56,892 --> 00:31:58,184
What about the one who sent you the money?

426
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:01,132
Have they asked you for anything in return?

427
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:03,343
I guess you're asking if it's a bribe.

428
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:05,093
No one has asked me

429
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,784
for anything in return.

430
00:32:14,272 --> 00:32:16,554
-What about the VIP?
-He didn't know anything.

431
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:20,167
I took the money,
and I'm the one to blame.

432
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:23,931
Are you going to take all the blame for the
President who was elected with dirty money?

433
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:26,230
You think the voters will be touched by it?

434
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,682
Wake up, Mr. Kim!

435
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:33,112
Director Choi.

436
00:32:37,058 --> 00:32:38,066
I'll found out the truth

437
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,691
by all means.

438
00:32:46,712 --> 00:32:48,245
I thought I could pave the way

439
00:32:49,673 --> 00:32:50,384
for the future

440
00:32:51,862 --> 00:32:55,628
of this country
if I just established a new administration.

441
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:01,417
I was dasydreaming when I hadn't
even taken a step away from the past.

442
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:06,175
The moment I took the bag
into my house,

443
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:14,198
the legislation
of the Budget Transparency Act failed.

444
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:18,300
I'm sorry to those who trusted me,

445
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:21,323
but...

446
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:24,456
I deluded myself.

447
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,941
Can I ask you for a favor, Director Choi?

448
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:45,339
Please let me take

449
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,276
all the blame.

450
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:51,847
I'm sorry...

451
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:56,651
to have burdened you
like this.

452
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:11,506
Dissolve the CIO!

453
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:14,642
-Dissolve the CIO!
-Dissolve the CIO!

454
00:34:14,674 --> 00:34:17,331
Dissolve the CIO!

455
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,355
-Dissolve the CIO!
-Dissolve the CIO!

456
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:22,240
Director of CIO must resign!

457
00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:24,325
-Resign!
-Resign!

458
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,884
Dissolve the CIO!

459
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:29,186
-Dissolve the CIO!
-Dissolve the CIO!

460
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:31,495
Director of CIO must resign!

461
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,837
-Resign!
-Resign!

462
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:36,943
-Choi Yeon-soo!
-Choi Yeon-soo!

463
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:51,016
CHOI YEON-SOO IS A SLAVE TO POWER

464
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:04,948
<i>You're incredible, Mr. Im.</i>

465
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:13,636
Your smart plan devastated
both the Blue House and the CIO.

466
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,464
she pretended to be noble and upright.

467
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:22,261
She was such a snob.

468
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:26,370
She's an amateur going wild wearing and armband.

469
00:35:26,581 --> 00:35:28,011
Are you talking about Choi Yeon-soo?

470
00:35:28,571 --> 00:35:30,448
I hate it when she runs around
like a headless chicken.

471
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,909
Mr. Gwak is standing by
to stop that headless chicken.

472
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:40,581
Tellhim to take it easy.

473
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,862
All he needs to do is go through the open door.

474
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,643
HAN'S BIKE LAB

475
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,064
Thank you for the food.

476
00:36:02,651 --> 00:36:03,659
<i>Please...</i>

477
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:06,941
<i>let me take all the blame.</i>

478
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:21,845
What's wrong?

479
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:23,519
Nothing.

480
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,581
I have no appetite.

481
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,058
No wonder.

482
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,526
People are so cruel.

483
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:51,149
Seung-mi.

484
00:36:51,403 --> 00:36:53,470
Don't use a phone at the table.

485
00:36:53,634 --> 00:36:55,165
THE CIO IS A SLAVE TO THE BLUE HOUSE

486
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:00,380
Here.

487
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:02,202
Don't listen to the people.

488
00:37:02,702 --> 00:37:03,855
It does you no good.

489
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:05,347
Thank you.

490
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:12,706
I didn't mind people criticizing me
when I was an attorney.

491
00:37:13,183 --> 00:37:15,300
But now, when I'm criticized,
it feels like the CIO is being criticized.

492
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,487
It's bothers me.

493
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:22,675
Have you found out
who installed the spy cameras?

494
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,562
No. I haven't heard back.

495
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:26,605
It's been days, and  no report?

496
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:29,222
Is the security chief a trustworthy person?

497
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:33,682
He worked
at the NIS for over 30 years.

498
00:37:33,745 --> 00:37:36,460
He's an expert in that field.

499
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:37,175
An expert?

500
00:37:37,675 --> 00:37:39,675
He failed to spot the spy cameras
or catch the culprit.

501
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:40,706
How is he an expert?

502
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:45,730
Why are you so angry?

503
00:37:46,237 --> 00:37:47,245
Dad.

504
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:49,409
We should all get along well.

505
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:52,370
Yes, Seung-goo.

506
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:54,849
But I'm not angry at your mom.

507
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:56,073
I'm just worried about her.

508
00:37:56,105 --> 00:37:57,245
Don't worry too much.

509
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,069
You're interfering in her work.

510
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:00,448
Hey, Han Seung-goo.

511
00:38:00,472 --> 00:38:01,659
Don't interfere in their affairs.

512
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:05,300
You know your dad cares a lot about me.

513
00:38:13,948 --> 00:38:14,956
Hi, Mr. Bae.

514
00:38:16,566 --> 00:38:17,628
Hold on a second.

515
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,120
<i>A warrant for Kim Myung-jae's arrest
has been issued.</i>

516
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:28,004
<i>At 3.30 a.m. this morning,</i>

517
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:29,800
<i>Judge Lee Wook-hyun
of the Seoul Central District
Court</i>

518
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:31,042
<i>issued the warrant after
reviewing the case for 16 hours.</i>

519
00:38:31,316 --> 00:38:36,713
<i>It was to close off the possibility of him
destroying evidence.</i>

520
00:38:36,994 --> 00:38:37,621
I'll be right there.

521
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:39,093
<i>The illegal funds...</i>

522
00:38:50,386 --> 00:38:53,894
I got the news
that Mr. Kim just got locked up in a cell.

523
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:55,300
Okay.

524
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,425
Director.

525
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:01,230
May I report
on the spy camera installer?

526
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:03,550
I've been waiting. Come on in.

527
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:05,870
I looked into it

528
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,526
and found out that two
of the utility workers left for China.

529
00:39:11,097 --> 00:39:12,519
Any evidence that they did it?

530
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:16,636
They came to Korea during the renovation
and went back after just three days.

531
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:18,792
Ask the police for cooperation.

532
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:20,183
There's nothing the police

533
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,409
can do about it.

534
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:24,722
I know quite a lot about China.

535
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,386
I have my sources too.

536
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:29,472
If I ask around,
I can catch them in a month or two.

537
00:39:30,222 --> 00:39:32,456
If our internal issue is leaked to the police,
it could get troublesome.

538
00:39:33,362 --> 00:39:35,409
Let's get them in China first
and hand them over to the police.

539
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:40,058
Can I trust you?

540
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:50,163
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

541
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,230
If I can't catch them,

542
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:52,855
process my resignation, please.

543
00:39:57,972 --> 00:39:59,667
Don't think about quitting.

544
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:00,995
Make sure you catch them.

545
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:06,658
You can count on me.

546
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:21,292
Is this the man?

547
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:22,675
Yes, it's very similar.

548
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:25,542
I wonder who this is.

549
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:31,347
Mr. Kim received money
six days before the presidential election.

550
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:35,409
But this man reported it
as five days instead and caused confusion.

551
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:37,097
He's surely an expert.

552
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:39,269
We must catch him.

553
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:42,503
That way, we'll be able to find out
why the money was sent to Mr. Kim.

554
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,862
Director Choi, we have a serioud problem.

555
00:40:47,222 --> 00:40:48,558
Well...

556
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:52,738
<i>His written will states that he did it alone,
</i>

557
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:53,816
<i>no one knew about it,</i>

558
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:55,110
<i>and he would take</i>

559
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:57,003
<i>full responsibility...</i>
-What should we do?

560
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:58,645
<i>to put an end to it.</i>
-Gosh.

561
00:40:59,612 --> 00:41:03,405
<i>It seems he was worried
the CIO might investigate the President.</i>

562
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:06,398
<i>As Kim Myung-jae passed away,</i>

563
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,496
<i>the CIO is expected to face difficulties
</i>

564
00:41:08,521 --> 00:41:10,767
<i>investigating the illegal funds
related to the presidential election.</i>

565
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:13,410
<i>Especially, the CIO is being criticized</i>

566
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:14,241
<i>for causing his death</i>

567
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:17,284
<i>by procrastinating their investigation</i>

568
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,964
<i>and overly cornering him
to evade responsibility.</i>

569
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:22,042
Mr. Yoo.

570
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:23,170
Yes.

571
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,136
The rain is pouring  down refreshingly.

572
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:29,948
Stick to the original schedule.

573
00:42:22,316 --> 00:42:26,284
I was daydreaming when I hadn't
even take a  step away from the past.

574
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:28,987
I'm sorry to those who trusted me,

575
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:30,917
but...

576
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,050
I deluded myself.

577
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:52,206
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

578
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:18,551
How shameless of you to come here.

579
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:19,529
Don't.

580
00:43:19,616 --> 00:43:21,021
You must feel satisfied.

581
00:43:21,045 --> 00:43:23,208
He can't be investigated anymore.

582
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,175
Keep you manners.

583
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm sorry for your first case
ended up like this.

584
00:43:50,987 --> 00:43:51,814
From next time--

585
00:43:51,877 --> 00:43:52,954
It's not over yet.

586
00:43:53,378 --> 00:43:54,691
What do you mean?

587
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:57,237
He already took responsibility.

588
00:43:57,425 --> 00:43:59,894
I didn't know he'd take responsibility this way.

589
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:02,612
He disappointed

590
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:05,464
a lot of people who trusted him twice.

591
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,990
Don't insult the late man's intetnion.

592
00:44:08,044 --> 00:44:09,769
The way I think, his intention is

593
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,003
to reveal why this happened
so the same case won't happen ever again.

594
00:44:14,302 --> 00:44:16,011
We trusted and put you in that position.

595
00:44:16,276 --> 00:44:18,417
Must you stab us in the back to feel satisfied?

596
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:20,605
It's not about my satisfaction.

597
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:23,655
I'm trying to resolve the suspicion he left.

598
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:25,423
That way, the Blue House will clear its name.

599
00:44:25,502 --> 00:44:26,296
The Blue House?

600
00:44:26,558 --> 00:44:28,980
You just want to be excused from his death.

601
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,925
May he rest in peace.

602
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:08,816
This country has suffered great damage
to lose him.

603
00:45:11,082 --> 00:45:17,691
Doing your job with personal feelings aside
leaves a huge pain sometimes.

604
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,073
Anyway, I'm sorry.

605
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:04,222
Congratulations on calling off
the Budget Transparency Act.

606
00:46:04,808 --> 00:46:05,816
It's only natural.

607
00:46:09,698 --> 00:46:11,534
With the Budget Transparency Act,

608
00:46:11,956 --> 00:46:12,987
It would've been impossible to reactivate

609
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,128
the Widow's Cruse Project.

610
00:46:15,987 --> 00:46:17,097
How is it going with the fund collection?

611
00:46:17,495 --> 00:46:19,058
The first delivery will take place next week.

612
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,572
WIDOW'S CRUSE PROJECT, COLLECTION PROPOSALS

613
00:46:30,948 --> 00:46:31,956
Switzeland?

614
00:46:32,284 --> 00:46:32,628
Yes.

615
00:46:46,894 --> 00:46:48,294
<i>Please place your finger on the reader.</i>

616
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:50,679
For the eternal glory of the country and people.

617
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:51,377
<i>It has been unlocked.</i>

618
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,020

620
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:17,659
What'sthe current balance?

00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,843
452,998,715 dollars.

622

TOTAL: 452,998,715

623
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:26,558
Withdraw 100 million dollars.

624
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:28,414
Yes, sir.

625
00:47:30,675 --> 00:47:31,878
TOTAL: 452,998,715

626
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:34,612
SCB

627
00:47:53,573 --> 00:47:55,761
Sleep at a nice hotel and eat delicious food.

628
00:47:58,034 --> 00:47:59,042
Thank you.

629
00:48:03,198 --> 00:48:04,941
Since you're risking your life for this mission.

630
00:48:22,034 --> 00:48:23,042
Why aren't you coming inside?

631
00:48:24,284 --> 00:48:24,803
Just because

632
00:48:25,972 --> 00:48:27,339
the night breeze is nice.

633
00:48:31,972 --> 00:48:32,980
It isn't your fault.

634
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:39,980
it isn't your fault, Choi Yeon-soo.

635
00:48:45,237 --> 00:48:48,128
It's the fault
of those who set himup.

636
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,808
Tae-yeol.

637
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,722
It's just like the day he left.

638
00:49:00,901 --> 00:49:01,972
He died like that,

639
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,151
but I couldn't do anything.

640
00:49:11,909 --> 00:49:12,958
"THE NIGHT BEFORE THE STRIKE"

641
00:49:23,337 --> 00:49:24,251
-Let's go.
-What?

642
00:49:24,276 --> 00:49:25,962
-Hurry.
-Come along.

643
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,675
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

644
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,763
-What's going on?
-What?

645
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:06,339
-Isn't it...
-It's Tae-yeol.

646
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:08,401
-Goodness.
-It's Tae-yeol.

647
00:50:08,426 --> 00:50:09,809
It's Tae-yeol.

648
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:13,573
Hello, I'm Kim Tae-yeol.

649
00:50:20,206 --> 00:50:22,714
Did you enjoy watching the movie?

650
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:23,964
-Yes.
-Yes.

651
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:26,542
I'm here on the stage

652
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,214
because of Hwang Jung-ho.

653
00:50:29,836 --> 00:50:32,236
As you all know, on June 14,

654
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:33,789
Yang Ki-heon burned himself

655
00:50:33,821 --> 00:50:37,050
and leaped to his death
at the student hall on our campus.

656
00:50:37,597 --> 00:50:41,331
Hwang Jung-ho follow him up
to the rooftop to save him.

657
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:45,968
But he was framed for setting his friend
on fire and pushing him from the rooftop.

658
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:46,945
At the first trial,

659
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:51,308
he was sentenced to death.

660
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,667
-Oh, no.
-That's ridiculous.

661
00:50:54,878 --> 00:50:57,441
His second trial will be held soon.

662
00:50:58,963 --> 00:50:59,839
If there's any clue

663
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,395
or witness about the case,

664
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:04,204
we can save his life.

665
00:51:05,251 --> 00:51:07,956
The current military government is trying

666
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,907
-Excuse me.
-to bring us down...

667
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,208
by framing Hwang Jung-ho

668
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,377
so they can defame those patriotic martyrs

669
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:15,640
who sacrificed themselves for democracy.

670
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,480
Kim Tae-yeol's inside, right?

671
00:51:44,784 --> 00:51:45,982
Let's go inside!

672
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:48,808
-Let's go!
-Go!

673
00:51:54,901 --> 00:51:56,901
-Let's go!
-Move.

674
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:58,925
The police!

675
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:00,403
The police are coming.

676
00:52:00,466 --> 00:52:01,067
-Run!
-Hurry.

677
00:52:01,098 --> 00:52:02,972
-Run.
-Run away.

678
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:18,072
Hurry and go!

679
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:19,151
Hurry. Now!

680
00:52:22,894 --> 00:52:24,318
-Goodness.
-This way.

681
00:52:24,389 --> 00:52:25,229
I got you.

682
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,074
Beat them up.

683
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:41,731
Get them.

684
00:53:04,884 --> 00:53:05,698
What do we do?

685
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:06,797
Break through!

686
00:53:07,003 --> 00:53:07,721
Get them.

687
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:26,798
Why, you little...

688
00:54:00,586 --> 00:54:01,352
You crazy punk.

689
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:13,583
Hurry and go.

690
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,332
Go. Hurry.

691
00:54:21,473 --> 00:54:22,037
No!

692
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,300
Get Kim Tae-yeol first.

693
00:54:46,001 --> 00:54:46,870
Where is he?

694
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,034
Leave this up to us and leave.

695
00:55:12,761 --> 00:55:13,777
Hurry up!

696
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:22,159
Kim Tae-yeol.

697
00:55:22,464 --> 00:55:23,516
It's nice to meet you.

698
00:55:48,332 --> 00:55:50,205
What should we do with Tae-yeol?

699
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:00,464
He will be okay.

700
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:39,928
Tae-yeol.

701
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,352
DIED IN 1991

702
00:57:23,776 --> 00:57:24,956
You're here.

703
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:29,222
What refreshing weather.

704
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,417
Goodness.

705
00:57:39,245 --> 00:57:40,253
Tomorrow,

706
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:42,233
You have a job.

707
00:57:46,737 --> 00:57:47,685
It's simple.

708
00:57:48,419 --> 00:57:50,198
You should wrap it up quickly and return.

709
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,400
Go on inside.

710
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:18,443
Jung-ho.

711
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:22,065
Director Choi Yeon-soo.

712
00:58:24,237 --> 00:58:26,042
I wanted to report my appointment to you.

713
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:28,409
Sorry I'm late.

714
00:58:29,362 --> 00:58:30,370
You didn't have to.

715
00:58:32,316 --> 00:58:33,323
I know...

716
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,487
you will do a good job.

717
00:58:36,073 --> 00:58:36,713
Me?

718
00:58:39,745 --> 00:58:41,191
Are you sure you choose the right person?

719
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,768
Look.

720
00:58:45,386 --> 00:58:47,230
I'm the one who's soon to die,

721
00:58:50,058 --> 00:58:51,933
so why are you looking all down?

722
00:58:55,495 --> 00:58:56,503
You will...

723
00:58:57,831 --> 00:58:58,956
do a good job.

724
00:58:59,644 --> 00:59:00,058
Gosh.

725
00:59:01,448 --> 00:59:02,855
Now this after firing me?

726
00:59:04,722 --> 00:59:06,042
I trust...

727
00:59:07,394 --> 00:59:08,448
your decisions.

728
00:59:12,198 --> 00:59:13,269
Don't give up...

729
00:59:14,753 --> 00:59:16,339
on what you believe.

730
00:59:19,698 --> 00:59:20,925
Move forward.

731
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:25,206
Don't look back

732
00:59:27,886 --> 00:59:29,792
and go forward, Choi Yeon-soo.

733
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,808
Really?

734
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:49,448
Oh, she's coming out.

735
00:59:50,651 --> 00:59:52,480
Well... This is Investigator Jeong.

736
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:54,183
You should take this call.

737
00:59:56,058 --> 00:59:57,066
Hello, Mr. Jeong.

738
00:59:57,316 --> 00:59:58,323
Hello, ma'am.

739
00:59:58,901 --> 01:00:01,605
The prosecution just barged in to get
all the evidence on Kim Myung-jae's case.

740
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:04,328
What? What do you mean?

741
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:07,253
They're making a fuss, urging Mr. Choo
to sign the takeover confirmation paper.

742
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:08,995
Let me talk to Mr. Choo.

743
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,687
Well, that's...

744
01:00:11,683 --> 01:00:12,691
impossible.

745
01:00:16,522 --> 01:00:17,522
CIO

746
01:00:22,589 --> 01:00:24,698
Dong-woo, hurry and sign the paper.

748
01:00:29,394 --> 01:00:30,823
<i>Just sign the confirmation paper.</i>

749
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:33,523
The guys will do the rest.

750
01:00:34,472 --> 01:00:38,374
Once you return to the prosecution,
I'll have you back for sure.

751
01:00:46,495 --> 01:00:47,458
Are you married?

752
01:00:48,573 --> 01:00:49,581
I have two kids.

753
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:54,292

What are you waiting for?

756
01:01:06,298 --> 01:01:07,142
Dong-woo.

757
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:13,745
I just can't do it.

758
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,487
This won't do.

759
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,438
EVIDENCE TRANSFER DIRECTIVE

760
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:26,923
Execute it, guys.

761
01:01:26,962 --> 01:01:28,112
-Stop them!
-Stop.

762
01:01:28,206 --> 01:01:29,178
-Move.
-You punk.

763
01:01:29,229 --> 01:01:31,229
-You punks, let go!
-Goodness.

764
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,382
-No.-Goodness.

765
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:36,122
-Goodness.
-Let go.

766
01:01:36,147 --> 01:01:38,119
You can't do this.

767
01:01:38,836 --> 01:01:39,909
<i>The prosecution will be there.</i>

768
01:01:40,212 --> 01:01:40,853
Cooperate.

769
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,703
Let go of this.

770
01:01:44,728 --> 01:01:46,728
-You punks!
-Get him.

771
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,232
You should've stopped them.

772
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,316
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

773
01:01:53,745 --> 01:01:55,276
I wanted to stop them somehow,

774
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:58,917
but they barged in
with an official notice.

775
01:02:02,776 --> 01:02:03,878
Is your arm okay?

776
01:02:04,128 --> 01:02:05,628
Yes, it's nothing.

777
01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:07,159
I'm sorry.

778
01:02:07,284 --> 01:02:08,441
Go see a doctor first.

779
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:09,876
Okay.

01:02:12,756 --> 01:02:14,436

01:02:22,279 --> 01:02:22,743
<i>The person you have called...</i>

782

<i>...cannor be reached.</i>
-Why isn't he answering?

783
01:02:25,971 --> 01:02:26,697
Mr. Choo.

784
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:30,816
Send them an official notice
to return the evidence immediately.

785
01:02:30,879 --> 01:02:32,463
I doubt they will listen after all this.

786
01:02:32,526 --> 01:02:33,896
Then we will take legal action.

787
01:02:43,004 --> 01:02:44,728
CHIEF PROSECUTOR GWAK MOON-HEUM

788
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:47,683
Mr. Gwak.

789
01:02:48,776 --> 01:02:50,472
You really didn't have to go this far.

790
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:52,472
You went overboard.

791
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,689
<i>What? Hey.</i>

792
01:02:55,362 --> 01:02:57,550
Why didn't you sign the paper?

793
01:03:00,003 --> 01:03:01,136
<i>Why?</i>

794
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:03,995
Hey, Choo Dong-woo.

795
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:05,370
I don't sign that kind of nonsense.

796
01:03:07,269 --> 01:03:08,980
<i>You've gone insane, haven't you?</i>

797
01:03:09,644 --> 01:03:11,386
<i>Enjoy rotting in the CIO, you jerk.</i>

798
01:03:14,941 --> 01:03:18,073
Chief Secretary Kim Myung-jae
has passed away,

799
01:03:18,417 --> 01:03:20,651
and now it's the prosecution's job

800
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:24,093
to catch the one who bribed him.

801
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,253
Thus, we cannot comply with

802
01:03:27,472 --> 01:03:29,472
Director Choi Yeon-soo's request to return

803
01:03:29,495 --> 01:03:30,613
the evidence regarding the case

804
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:32,392
on Kim Myung-jae's bribery case.

805
01:03:32,861 --> 01:03:36,245
If the result indicates
that the culprit is a high-ranking official,

806
01:03:36,441 --> 01:03:38,441
the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office

807
01:03:38,464 --> 01:03:42,974
will entrust the evidence
and the culprit to the CIO.

808
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:44,985
We, the SCPO,

809
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:47,476
promise that we will reveal the truth

810
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:51,452
about this case and fulfil our duty
to the people.

811
01:03:52,276 --> 01:03:54,276
Thank you. I'll take questions now.

812
01:03:57,249 --> 01:03:57,710
You there.

813
01:03:58,163 --> 01:04:00,347
I'm Min Sang-a from Daehan Jeil Daily.

814
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:06,417
Was it the prosecutor general's order
to take over the evidence from the CIO?

815
01:04:08,464 --> 01:04:10,464
No, it was my order.

816
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,378
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

817
01:04:14,675 --> 01:04:18,698
<i>Because we must
catch the culprit who bribe Kim Myung-jae.</i>

818
01:04:20,058 --> 01:04:21,175
<i>The SCPO</i>

819
01:04:21,636 --> 01:04:23,175
<i>will investigate carefully</i>

820
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:24,831
<i>following thorough procedures</i>

821
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,667
<i>so another wrongful sacrifice won't be
made due to inexperience like the CIO.</i>

822
01:04:31,011 --> 01:04:32,019
<i>That's all.</i>

823
01:04:32,457 --> 01:04:33,094
<i>Another question?</i>

824
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:35,662
<i>During the press conference just now,</i>

825
01:04:35,816 --> 01:04:38,222
<i>Chief Prosecutor Gwak Moon-heum</i>

826

834
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:59,304
<i>Moreover, if the culprit is...</i>

835
01:05:07,128 --> 01:05:07,768
Hello?

836
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,542
Hello?

837
01:05:15,605 --> 01:05:17,151
<i>Is this Choi Yeon-soo's house?</i>

838
01:05:20,323 --> 01:05:22,358
Yes. Who is this?

839
01:05:22,816 --> 01:05:23,941
<i>And who are you?</i>

840
01:05:25,706 --> 01:05:26,894
I'm her husband.

841
01:05:27,784 --> 01:05:28,792
<i>Oh, really?</i>

842
01:05:30,183 --> 01:05:31,308
<i>I'm Park Doo-sik.</i>

843
01:05:31,956 --> 01:05:32,964

01:05:33,831 --> 01:05:34,839
<i>Park Doo-sik.</i>

Today isn't the day though.

854
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,230
The old man seems very sick.

855
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:33,948
I'll be back by 7 p.m.

856
01:06:34,839 --> 01:06:35,397

I'm alone.

What, is it your first time seeing a murderer?

865
01:08:33,628 --> 01:08:34,878
Are you really Park Doo-sik?

866
01:08:37,972 --> 01:08:39,730
Ms. Choi looked for you so much.

867
01:08:40,278 --> 01:08:41,308
Why did you show up now?

868
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:44,339
10 years in prison.

869
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:47,551
As soon as I was released,

870
01:08:47,606 --> 01:08:49,372
I was stuck in the darn Yesan Asylum

871
01:08:50,369 --> 01:08:51,893
in Chungcheongnam-do

872
01:08:52,214 --> 01:08:54,159
for 18 years and 247 days.

873
01:08:56,183 --> 01:08:57,948
I wasted 29 years like that.

874
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,401
How did you know our house number?

875
01:09:11,933 --> 01:09:13,081
Someone told me.

876
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:14,047
Who?

01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,400

Where is she right now?

881
01:09:34,839 --> 01:09:36,605
She can't come here. She's on a business trip.

882
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:40,050
On business trip?

883
01:09:40,425 --> 01:09:42,073
What do you have to say
about KimTae-yeol's death?

884
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:49,391
I...

885
01:09:51,628 --> 01:09:52,175
I don't know

886
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:55,581
when I will die.

887
01:09:58,073 --> 01:09:59,151
But before I die,

888
01:10:01,214 --> 01:10:02,222
I...

889
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:22,542
Kim Tae-yeol.

890
01:10:24,503 --> 01:10:25,581
I didn't kill him.

891
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:30,128
You turned yourself in
and served your sentence.

892
01:10:32,253 --> 01:10:34,347
Because of an order I got.

893
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:36,175
But it wasn't me.

894
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,575
That son of a gun...

895
01:10:40,723 --> 01:10:41,720
Those eyes.

896
01:10:44,709 --> 01:10:45,644
It was like

897
01:10:46,381 --> 01:10:48,566
a devil came up from a pit of fire.

898
01:10:51,219 --> 01:10:51,774
Who do you mean?

899
01:10:54,987 --> 01:10:56,154
Did you see his face?

900
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:10,552
I'm about to starve to death.

901
01:11:11,839 --> 01:11:13,839
Get me something to eat.

902
01:11:30,532 --> 01:11:31,438
Wait here.

903
01:11:58,572 --> 01:12:01,902
YEON-SOO

904
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:20,598

905
01:12:21,747 --> 01:12:22,867
This is crazy.

906
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:25,567
Aren't you going to eat, Seung-goo?

907
01:12:26,232 --> 01:12:27,063
Eat without me.

908
01:12:28,151 --> 01:12:29,667
It's 24 minutes before Dad arrives.

909
01:12:30,183 --> 01:12:31,901
I'll eat with him when he comes back.

910
01:12:32,594 --> 01:12:33,160
Okay.

911
01:12:37,244 --> 01:12:37,826
DAD

912
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:45,417
It's 15,000 won.

913
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:47,680
Here.

914
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,308
Thank you.

915
01:12:55,673 --> 01:12:56,673
SEUNG-GOO

916
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,058
Hi, Seung-goo.

917
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:00,886
I'm going home now.

918
01:13:01,784 --> 01:13:03,261
Yes, let's eat together.

919
01:13:05,386 --> 01:13:05,918
Goodbye.

920
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:07,237
Please come again.

921
01:13:14,535 --> 01:13:16,681
Why did you escape from North Korea?

922
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:19,605
I told you already.

923
01:13:21,302 --> 01:13:22,142
I...

924
01:13:22,681 --> 01:13:24,626
I did it for freedom.

925
01:13:25,409 --> 01:13:26,191
<i>Answer properly.</i>

926
01:13:39,297 --> 01:13:40,940
<i>If you complete this mission,</i>

927
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:43,886
<i>I'll give you an apartment, a car,</i>

928
01:13:45,456 --> 01:13:46,361
<i>and freedom.</i>

929
01:13:49,156 --> 01:13:51,380
I will do anything.

930
01:14:05,443 --> 01:14:07,548
Hey, Park Doo-sik. Get in.

931
01:14:57,982 --> 01:14:58,412
INN
