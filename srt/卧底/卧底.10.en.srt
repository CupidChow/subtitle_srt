(All places, characters, companies,)

00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:18,764
(and incidents in this drama
are fictitious.)

5
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:34,681
What's this leery feeling?

6
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,897
Choi Yeon-soo has a boyfriend?

7
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:40,968
I can't believe it.

8
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:42,435
How long have you been dating?

9
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:44,268
It hasn't been long.

10
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:46,743
Did you sleep with him?

11
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:48,067
You must be crazy.

12
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:49,835
No.

13
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:51,776
- We only kissed.
- What?

14
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,872
Why didn't you introduce him to me earlier?

15
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:55,467
You punk.

16
00:00:55,735 --> 00:00:58,768
It hurts. You could've beaten
me to death if I'd slept with him.

17
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:01,692
I thought the Invincible Choi Yeon-soo

18
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,334
would remain single all her life.

19
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,577
Do you have a death wish?

20
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:08,079
Oh, come on.

21
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:10,967
Your standards are very high.

22
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,538
Where did you meet him?

23
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,501
Does he go to our school? Is he tall?

24
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:18,760
Are you interviewing me?
This scoop is too big for our school paper.

25
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:20,334
I should report it to CNN.

26
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,167
Jung-hyun.

27
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:31,966
He looks like Andy Lau plus Leslie Cheung.

28
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:33,454
Jeez.

29
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:35,706
I can't believe you
didn't do more than kiss.

30
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:40,118
I'm Min Sang-a.

31
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,685
I'm Han Jung-hyun.

32
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:46,677
Yeon-soo must've saved this country

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,371
many times in her past life.

34
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:50,051
- Oh, dear,
- Sorry?

35
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:52,327
She's the friend of mine I talked about.

36
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:53,901
She won't bite you. Come and sit.

37
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:05,817
Would you like some coffee?

38
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:07,102
Yes.

39
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:08,368
Excuse me.

40
00:02:11,688 --> 00:02:14,720
So you grew up in an orphanage.

41
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:16,443
And you're a night school student?

42
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:18,351
Sang-a. That's enough.

43
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:20,902
That's right.

44
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,451
Hold on. What about your parents?

45
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:25,660
You don't remember them at all.

46
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:27,517
Sang-a. Why are you doing this?

47
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:31,371
Well...

48
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:33,563
All right.

49
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:35,537
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:39,984
I vaguely remember my mom's face.

51
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:43,727
My dad was a drunken monster.

52
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:45,817
He often wrecked things at home

53
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:48,867
telling us to bring more alcohol.

54
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:52,360
Then I'd get scared and cry,

55
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:54,503
and Mom held me in her arms.

56
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:57,066
And Dad

57
00:02:58,802 --> 00:02:59,901
beat her.

58
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:03,310
On one snowy day,

59
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:06,587
Mom took my hand and
ran away from home with me.

60
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:10,744
We went down a narrow
staircase for some time.

61
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:14,282
And Dad finally disappeared from our view.

62
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:26,051
Can we do the rest of the interview

63
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:27,878
after I use the restroom?

64
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:30,517
Sure. Go ahead.

65
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:41,584
(Restroom)

66
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,343
Does he really work in a factory?

67
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:50,998
His hands are soft, aren't they?

68
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:53,103
He said factory workers use Dial soap too.

69
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:56,243
He doesn't look like a factory worker.

70
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:57,652
He seems more like a writer.

71
00:03:58,618 --> 00:03:59,618
What do you mean?

72
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,393
He accurately remembers what happened
before he was four. Isn't it strange?

73
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,073
Maybe he heard it from his mom.

74
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:07,279
Then he should say what he heard.

75
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:09,594
It sounded like he had
seen and experienced it.

76
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:28,451
(Episode 10)

77
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,556
You...

78
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:47,709
You liked me too.

79
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:55,846
Without Choi Yeon-soo,

80
00:04:57,752 --> 00:04:58,752
things could have

81
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,736
worked out between us.

82
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:32,181
What on earth?

83
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:06,118
Jeez.

84
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:08,537
I feel like a silly old woman.

85
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,335
Tell the truth

86
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,246
and be freed from everything.

87
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:38,952
Like me.

88
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:32,015
Yeon-soo.

89
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,091
Please.

90
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:36,051
Just leave.

91
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:36,587
You're home early today.

92
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:46,918
Where have you been?

93
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:48,667
I went to exercise.

94
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:51,485
Exercise?

95
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:53,768
What exercise?

96
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:56,802
Yeon-soo.

97
00:08:57,818 --> 00:08:58,818
What's wrong?

98
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:03,118
What happened?

99
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,917
Aren't you hiding anything from me?

100
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,223
I'm asking you a question!

101
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,263
Why would I hide anything?

102
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,496
Who was that woman?

103
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:31,894
- What?
- In front of the convenience store.

104
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:36,151
Oh, Yoon-joo?

105
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,610
Yoon-joo?

106
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:39,356
She's a close friend of mine.

107
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:41,611
A friend of yours?

108
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:44,318
How did you meet her?

109
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:47,938
We grew up in the same orphanage.

110
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:54,201
Have you been in touch with her?

111
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:57,751
No, not for years.

112
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:00,941
You became Director of the CIO
and received publicity.

113
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,243
It reminded her of me,
so she came to see me.

114
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,417
She remembered that I married you.

115
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,482
You two must've been very close.

116
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,234
Yes, we were like brother and sister.

117
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:15,960
She remembered who you married

118
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:17,227
even after all these years?

119
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:18,302
Of course.

120
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:20,084
Is that why she hugged you like that?

121
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:22,560
She was so happy to see me again.

122
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:23,635
What could I do?

123
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:26,984
Why didn't I know about her?

124
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:33,567
When we started dating,

125
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,294
I wanted to start all over again.

126
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:40,418
Seriously,

127
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,451
it was a part of my past that I'd erased.

128
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:58,296
I thought I knew everything about you.

129
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,412
But I've recently realized

130
00:11:00,518 --> 00:11:03,075
that there are still so many things
I don't know about you.

131
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,980
Who would know more
about me than you do?

132
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:09,007
I don't know.

133
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:11,701
Yeon-soo.

134
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,009
<i>Hasn't he been strange lately?</i>

135
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:49,901
Don't you know any of his friends
who might know where he is?

136
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:51,870
His friends?

137
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:55,510
Does he have any friends?

138
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:58,351
You don't even know
if he has a friend?

139
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,668
Tell the truth...

140
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:36,717
and be freed from everything.

141
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:41,068
Like me.

142
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:55,443
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

143
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:56,624
- Bon appetit.
- Yes.

144
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,901
- I'm off to work.
- What about breakfast?

145
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:04,168
No, thanks.

146
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,684
Have breakfast, Mom.

147
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,275
The spicy pork is good,
and the bean paste stew is good too.

148
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:10,400
Eat your fill, Seung-goo.
You too, Seung-mi.

149
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:20,002
What's going on?

150
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:21,933
What's with Mom, Dad?

151
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:26,851
Well, she must be very busy.

152
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:28,102
Let's eat.

153
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:43,084
(Director Choi Yeon-soo)

154
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:52,002
Yes?

155
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:55,802
Director Choi.

156
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:57,793
I asked the manufacturer

157
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:00,134
of the expandable luggage bag just now.

158
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:02,934
It was manufactured long ago.

159
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,729
So they can't track it down

160
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,767
without its model name or serial number.

161
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,627
Oh, I see.

162
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,277
Mi-sun is checking to see

163
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,899
what Mr. Kim's family
did after the election.

164
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:17,548
Okay.

165
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:21,202
By the way,

166
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:24,517
you don't look well
today just like the time

167
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:27,186
when Seung-mi was going through puberty.

168
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,102
She's doing fine.

169
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,744
Then Seung-goo?

170
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:31,651
No.

171
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,217
It's strange.

172
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:37,034
I'm sure the one who
worries you isn't Mr. Han.

173
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:50,803
Stay still, you punk.

174
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:54,302
You jerk!

175
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:55,568
(Low battery)

176
00:14:57,618 --> 00:14:59,117
Do Young-geol, that jerk.

177
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:07,235
You jerk!

178
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:40,284
(Lee Suk-gyu)

179
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:43,317
Where are you now?

180
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:20,377
Search this person.

181
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,008
He has neither his phone nor his wallet.

182
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:33,096
Where's the video?

183
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,432
You can't kill me.

184
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,760
- What?
- Yesterday morning,

185
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:41,117
you couldn't report me to the police.

186
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,661
That's because I mustn't be arrested
as Lee Suk-gyu.

187
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:50,664
If that happens,

188
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:54,551
the Widow's Cruse Project
will be revealed too.

189
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,335
Am I right, Do Young-geol?

190
00:16:58,431 --> 00:16:59,697
You murderer.

191
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:14,247
Give me the video.

192
00:17:20,424 --> 00:17:21,424
What?

193
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,810
The original, you jerk. Give me that.

194
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:27,156
Stop being ridiculous.

195
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:30,793
Leave the CIO immediately

196
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:32,943
before I spread it over the internet.

197
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,534
Or you'll get media attention.

198
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:38,273
If Choi Yeon-soo quits, I'll quit too.

199
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:42,576
Now give me the original.

200
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:44,423
Give it to me, you jerk!

201
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,220
You think the NIS will take you back?

202
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:50,173
You're a murderer.

203
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:55,313

That's the problem.

204
00:18:02,637 --> 00:18:04,903
Hey. Go ahead,

205
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:06,737
and release it.

206
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:08,501
If you do,

207
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:10,990
you and your wife

208
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:13,934

209

Don't speak so fiercely like that,

235

CIO Director Choi.

236
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:50,019
It's obviously a situation

237
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,409
where I ran into a friend of mine.

238
00:21:54,717 --> 00:21:55,717
I have nothing to say.

239

I'm just here to feed you.

241
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:38,458
She's his friend from the orphanage.

242
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,068
You mean that woman?

243
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:46,021
Have they been in touch?

244
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:47,613
Of course not.

245
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:50,753
They lost contact after we got married.

246
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,333
When she heard about me in the news,

247
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:55,851
she missed him, so she came to see him.

248
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:01,533
But why

249
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:04,880
did they do that on the street?

250
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:07,243
Just eat the sandwich.

251
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:09,567
Okay. I will.

252
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,948
He said they were like brother and sister.

253
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:32,120
What's this leery feeling?

254
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:38,247
It's just like when I first met Jung-hyun.

255
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:40,435
Jeez.

256
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,333

258
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:56,109
what happened before he was four.
Isn't it strange?

259
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,828
Maybe he heard it from his mom.

260
00:23:58,218 --> 00:23:59,984
Then he should say what he heard.

261
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,284
It sounded like he had
seen and experienced it.

262
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:14,235
Sang-a.

263
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:17,825
If you want to listen to your gut
instead of checking up on a fact,

264
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,751
do that when you write an article.

265
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:22,891
What if I'd listened to
you and lost Jung-hyun?

266
00:24:23,118 --> 00:24:25,483
You're going a little overboard.

267
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:32,170
Jung-hyun has always been

268
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,653
a devoted husband and father.

269
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,352
I know.

270
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:39,884
I got divorced three times.

271
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:41,793
What would I know about men?

272
00:24:42,918 --> 00:24:45,727
Exactly. And I told you that
none of the three of them

273
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:47,424
were right for you.

274
00:24:52,468 --> 00:24:53,717
All right. I'm leaving.

275
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:56,080
Say hello to your mom.

276
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:34,289
Thank you.

277
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:21,026
Oh, you're home.

278
00:26:21,102 --> 00:26:22,785
Hi. Where are the kids?

279
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:24,417
They went out to walk Bo-ri.

280
00:26:25,202 --> 00:26:27,410
You haven't had dinner, right?
Wait for a moment.

281
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,005
- I'll prepare it quickly.
- Jung-hyun.

282
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:30,535
Yes?

283
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,567
To be honest, you sometimes seem like

284
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,601
a different person these days.

285
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:44,196
I'll try to understand you better.

286
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:48,514
So please always be honest with me.

287
00:26:51,385 --> 00:26:53,167
- Okay.
- Don't hide anything.

288
00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:54,952
No, I won't.

289
00:27:19,964 --> 00:27:22,213
The video of Kim Myung-jae
receiving a bribe

290
00:27:22,402 --> 00:27:24,667
has damaged the President's reputation.

291
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:28,611
Impeaching him wasn't
quite possible anyway.

292
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,818
What about Choi Yeon-soo?

293
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:37,541
We checked all
the evidence returned to the CIO.

294
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:39,764
Everything is fine...

295
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,452
except for one thing.

296
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,176
That bag is in Choi Yeon-soo's hands now.

297
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:50,406
I made a cash purchase.

298
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,087
They won't know who bought it.

299
00:27:54,168 --> 00:27:54,917
Okay.

300
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:57,920
Stop talking big and do your job right.

301
00:27:58,688 --> 00:27:59,688
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

302
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:15,751
What is this?

303
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:18,952
I looked into Kim Myung-jae's family.

304
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:21,241
His daughter studied abroad.

305
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,634
She didn't go to an expensive school.

306
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,822
She went to Australia
on a working holiday visa.

307
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:27,221
I see.

308
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,828
Anyway, the point is

309
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:31,853
that she used that
bag when she went there.

310
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:34,179
And I found something different.

311
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:36,852
What is it?

312
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:45,213
There was something attached to it.

313
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,106
But I can't see it well.

314
00:28:51,602 --> 00:28:52,602
Ms. Choi.

315
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:55,560
If we get the original, we can make it out.

316
00:28:56,911 --> 00:29:00,444
Do you think Mr. Kim's daughter
still has it?

317
00:29:15,785 --> 00:29:16,785
Who is it?

318
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:24,481
Hello.

319
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:26,935
What do you need?

320
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:48,272
Dad

321
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:51,601
said sorry to me that day

322
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:56,151
because he couldn't
do anything for me

323
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:59,201
when I was going abroad to study.

324
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:04,477
When I learned where
this bag had come from,

325
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,801
I blamed myself.

326
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:09,702
I should've thrown it away in Australia.

327
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:16,176
I'm really sorry.

328
00:30:17,454 --> 00:30:20,009
I don't know why he had
to make such a choice.

329
00:30:21,335 --> 00:30:22,335
I really don't.

330
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:26,758
We...

331
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:29,836
will uncover the truth.

332
00:30:31,444 --> 00:30:32,960
We'll find out

333
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:37,207
who sent the bag to him and why

334
00:30:39,188 --> 00:30:40,563
they did that.

335
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:47,014
In order to do that,

336
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:50,357
we need your help.

337
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:26,168

338
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:27,724

339
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,384
He rented the room on the first day.

340
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:10,541
That crazy punk.

341
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:12,903
Is he a stalker or what?

342
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,783
He must be crazy. How dare he?

343
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:25,586
Mr. Do, It looks like he's leaving.

344
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:31,335
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:49,934

357
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:39,026
Did he send it to anyone?

358
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,201
It doesn't seem that
he reported or e-mailed it.

359
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:42,937
Then why did he record it?

360
00:33:43,235 --> 00:33:44,235

- A courier?
- He must've sent it by courier service.

364

370
00:34:22,324 --> 00:34:23,589
- Really?
- Yes.

371
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,176
Yes, it was purchased here.

372
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:34,252
Was it?

373
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,848
We'd like to know who bought it.

374
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:37,924
Wait.

375
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:40,806
It's been over two years,
so there can't be any CCTV footage left.

376
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,242
I think the payment
record may still be there.

377
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:45,700
Yes, it should be here.

378
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:49,177
(July 21, 2018)

379
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:50,767
(Cash purchase)

380
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,526
It was purchased in cash.

381
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:53,834
What? By cash?

382
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:55,808
I see.

383
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:57,482
- What do we do now?
- Wait.

384
00:34:57,935 --> 00:34:58,877
What about points?

385
00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:01,218
Didn't the buyer accumulate points
after the purchase?

386
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:02,624
Just a moment.

387
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,034
(Cashback card)

388
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,821
Yes, they did.

389
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,537
They made a cash purchase and got points.

390
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:15,660
Straighten your back. Good.

391
00:35:15,735 --> 00:35:17,501
Lower your chin. More.

392
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:20,560
Good. Repeat this set twice.

393
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:21,635
Okay.

394
00:35:25,668 --> 00:35:26,668
Excuse me.

395
00:35:27,328 --> 00:35:28,393
Are you Son Joo-ri?

396
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:29,468
Yes, I am.

397
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:32,251
I'm from the CIO.

398
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:37,756
Do you know this bag?

399
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:39,868
Sorry?

400
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,348
Haven't you seen it?

401
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:50,602
I'm not sure.

402
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,735
Okay.

403
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:34,492
Go in and just see who she's meeting.

404
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:35,568
By myself?

405
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:37,790
She could recognize me.

406
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,109
She rushed to come here.

407
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:42,551
I'm sure she's here to meet someone
to talk about the bag.

408
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,643
Okay. I'll be back.

409
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:48,133
Wait, Ms. Song.

410
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:49,518
Yes?

411
00:36:49,818 --> 00:36:50,818
Well...

412
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:54,583
I'll be here,

413
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:57,277
so don't worry.

414
00:36:58,468 --> 00:36:59,468
What the heck?

415
00:37:43,235 --> 00:37:44,943
<i>Are you saying the one</i>

416
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:48,292
who reported Mr. Kim
to us bought the bag?

417
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:49,425
Yes.

418
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,167
Here. Ms. Song took the pictures.

419
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:56,930
That guy next to her?

420
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:58,235
Yes.

421
00:38:09,317 --> 00:38:10,317
It's this guy.

422
00:38:13,145 --> 00:38:14,394
The one who sent the video.

423
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:16,080
Yes, it's the same person.

424
00:38:27,258 --> 00:38:28,258
The one

425
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:32,757
who secretly sent the video of Mr. Kim

426
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:36,037
is connected to the bag purchase?

427
00:38:37,635 --> 00:38:39,577
Let's find out who he is first.

428
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:41,610
We also need to find out

429
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:44,410
how Son Joo-ri knows him.

430
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:45,501
- Okay.
- Okay.

431
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:05,834
(To Choi Yeon-soo)

432
00:39:10,185 --> 00:39:11,364
I'm home.

433
00:39:13,137 --> 00:39:14,636
- Hi.
- Hi.

434
00:39:17,868 --> 00:39:18,810
- You got a package.
- Yes.

435
00:39:18,885 --> 00:39:20,245
But the sender's name isn't on it.

436
00:39:20,614 --> 00:39:22,534
Please put it in the study.
I'll go get changed.

437
00:39:22,702 --> 00:39:23,702
Okay.

438
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:33,085
(To Choi Yeon-soo)

439
00:39:37,894 --> 00:39:38,894
Who sent it?

440
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:40,508
Do you want me to open it?

441
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:00,508
What's in this?

442
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:09,460
(Tip-off)

443
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:13,334
(Tip-off)

444
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:15,571
Wait, honey.

445
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,553
What's wrong? It looks like a recording.

446
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:19,452
(Report)

447
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,692

459

Section chief?

Lee Suk-gyu...

461
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:57,101
Lee Suk-gyu... Who is Lee Suk-gyu?

462
00:40:57,868 --> 00:41:00,901
Then what? Were they
watching us at Auntie's Bar?

463
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:03,967
Lee Suk-gyu... Lee Suk-gyu.

464
00:41:04,235 --> 00:41:06,251
Lee Suk-gyu... I can't remember.

465
00:41:07,993 --> 00:41:10,777
Every time Tae-yeol
came in secret,

466
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:12,601
there were a lot of people
at Auntie's Bar.

467
00:41:13,593 --> 00:41:14,842
Right.

468
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,603
Wait, honey.

469
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:19,692
When we met Tae-yeol,

470
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,143
you were there too, right?

471
00:41:23,431 --> 00:41:24,930
Yes, I remember.

472
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:26,744
Have you heard of the name, Lee Suk-gyu?

473
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:32,468
No.

474
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,801
I need to meet Choong-mo.

475
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:56,351
(Auntie's Bar)

476
00:41:58,752 --> 00:41:59,842
Here comes your jeon.

477
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,555
- How appetizing.
- Thank you.

478
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,106
All right. Bottoms up!

479
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:05,696
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

480
00:42:05,785 --> 00:42:07,201
Bottoms up.

481
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:08,227
Tae-yeol.

482
00:42:08,302 --> 00:42:10,527
The police are outside. How did you come?

483
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:12,839
Shush. Let's not tell
everyone that I'm wanted.

484
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:15,859
How have you been, Yeon-soo?

485
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,579
This isn't the time to worry about me.

486
00:42:22,285 --> 00:42:23,534
Who is this man?

487
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:24,676
Oh.

488
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:26,759
He's my life's savior,

489
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,851
Han Jung-hyun.

490
00:42:28,885 --> 00:42:30,134
Your life's savior?

491
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:32,917
Oh, well...

492
00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:40,210
He kicked the door

493
00:42:40,285 --> 00:42:41,760
then knocked the guys down

494
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:44,101
from the front and back.

495
00:42:44,618 --> 00:42:46,384
They all ran away?

496
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:48,168
I'm telling you.

497
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:51,253
You didn't see him there,
but he's just like the son of a general.

498
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:53,410
You're a night student of Jeguk University,

499
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:55,501
so shouldn't you study at night?

500
00:42:58,068 --> 00:43:00,334
Like you, I'm ditching my class too.

501
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,959
I'm Kim Tae-yeol, freshman class of 1987.

502
00:43:07,968 --> 00:43:10,234
We're the same age. I'm Han Jung-hyun.

503
00:43:15,691 --> 00:43:17,940
Your hands are soft for a factory worker.

504
00:43:18,618 --> 00:43:19,884
Gosh.

505
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:22,376
We wash our hands with Dial soap

506
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:24,070
and put on hand cream too.

507
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:27,840
Did you rehearse that sentence just now?

508
00:43:28,618 --> 00:43:29,618
What?

509
00:43:33,435 --> 00:43:36,451
Everyone says that my hands are soft.

510
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:40,757
Actually, I was born with soft hands.

511
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:46,709
This guy reacts so quickly.

512
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:51,680
Yeon-soo, how are you preparing
for Mr. Hwang's trial?

513
00:43:51,768 --> 00:43:55,242
Well, without any concrete evidence
to turn the table around.

514
00:43:55,318 --> 00:43:57,867
It's most likely to be at our disadvantage.

515
00:43:58,621 --> 00:44:00,370
The second trial is coming up soon.

516
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,853
Should I ask for evidence during the rally?

517
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:05,301
Sure, that would help.

518
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:07,527
By the way, I heard you took care of

519
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:09,282
Choong-mo alone when everyone ran away.

520
00:44:10,902 --> 00:44:12,893
We would've gotten
caught without Jung-hyun.

521
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:15,619
So today is my treat.

522
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,909
Really? Auntie, get us
10 bottles of makgeolli.

523
00:44:17,985 --> 00:44:19,251
- Okay.
- Hey.

524
00:44:19,518 --> 00:44:21,034
Auntie, wait.

525
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:24,213
Where are you going?

526
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,826
To ditch my work tonight,

527
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:30,151
I need to make up an alibi.

528
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:31,490
Drink without me.

529
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:36,001
Oh.

530
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:38,034
Be careful.

531
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:39,599
You, be careful.

532
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,486
Did you actually think
I'd drink 10 bottles?

533
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:54,760
Look at that plaster on his head.

534
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:56,351
- Isn't it a burn?
- It hurts so much.

535
00:44:57,185 --> 00:44:58,185
Seriously.

536
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:00,192
10 bottles, please.

537
00:45:03,518 --> 00:45:05,017
- Hey.
- What?

538
00:45:07,568 --> 00:45:09,084
<i>Hello, this is Chungmu Trading.</i>

539
00:45:10,118 --> 00:45:12,884

Hey!

541
00:45:15,735 --> 00:45:17,751
Section chief. I'm Lee Suk-gyu.

542
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:18,960
Hey.

543
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:20,534
<i>Kim Tae-yeol is here.</i>

544
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:22,777
Where are you right now?

545
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:24,310
Auntie's Bar in Sadang-dong.

546
00:45:24,385 --> 00:45:25,884
Where in Sadang-dong?

547
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:28,748
Auntie's Bar.

548
00:45:28,824 --> 00:45:30,409
<i>Auntie's Bar in Sadang-dong? Okay.</i>

549
00:45:30,485 --> 00:45:32,885
Keep him there until we arrive.

550
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:34,158
Okay.

551
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:37,084
Kim Tae-yeol's at Auntie's Bar
in Sadang-dong.

552
00:45:41,202 --> 00:45:42,701
- All right.
- Gosh.

553
00:45:44,235 --> 00:45:45,751
- Goodness.
- Cheers.

554
00:45:53,902 --> 00:45:55,167
Jung-hyun.

555
00:46:04,618 --> 00:46:05,793
All right,

556
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,047
cheers to the innocence of Hwang Jung-ho.

557
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:10,609
Let's go for another round after this.

558
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,427
There's a great pork
skin place near my factory.

559
00:46:13,502 --> 00:46:14,502
Let's go there.

560
00:46:17,884 --> 00:46:18,884
Why, you don't want to?

561
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:20,793
It's a factory ground,

562
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:23,308
so the police won't be there. It's on me.

563
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:28,501
I'm the only one working here. Let's go.

564
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:33,400
Why not?

565
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:34,734
Bottoms up.

566
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,701
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

567
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,467
(Restricted Number)

568
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:54,042
<i>How was it to hear your
old voice for a change?</i>

569
00:46:54,118 --> 00:46:55,384
<i>Wasn't it nice?</i>

570
00:46:56,827 --> 00:46:58,843
Why, didn't you like it?

571
00:46:59,452 --> 00:47:00,967
<i>Gosh.</i>

572
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,710
<i>What can you do?</i>

573
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:04,477
<i>Your voice has always been annoying.</i>

574
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:06,317
In the past and even now.

575
00:47:07,852 --> 00:47:09,867
<i>Voice recordings and even stalking, right</i>

576
00:47:12,418 --> 00:47:13,667
<i>Why aren't you saying anything</i>

577
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:16,451
So why did you

578
00:47:16,718 --> 00:47:19,484
have to cross the
stupid line, you pervert?

579
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:23,084
"Section chief. I'm Lee Suk-gyu.

580
00:47:23,852 --> 00:47:25,043
Kim Tae-yeol is here."

581
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:26,134
Enough.

582
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,917
Jung-hyun?

583
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:33,388
You may lodge a complaint.

584
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:36,193
But the service period is over,
so repairs will be chargeable.

585
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:39,240
<i>It's no use, so suit yourself.</i>

586
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:42,134
What's wrong?

587
00:47:42,921 --> 00:47:44,937
This guy bought a bicycle last year.

588
00:47:45,468 --> 00:47:47,734
He wants the tires to
be exchanged for free.

589
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:50,161
Someone from last year?

590
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:53,367
Yes, he's a black consumer.
Don't mind him.

591
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:54,885
Let's go downstairs.

592
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:12,675
(Lee Suk-gyu)

593
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:15,751
He's a husband to his
wife in any situation.

594
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,134
You're back.

595
00:48:28,585 --> 00:48:30,393
I deleted everything including the one

596
00:48:30,468 --> 00:48:31,815
on Han Jung-hyun's phone just now.

597
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:33,251
- Did you?
- Yes.

598
00:48:34,968 --> 00:48:36,301
Let's call it a day.

599
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,584
<i>What did you do?</i>

600
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,843
Why would you cause this mess by letting

601
00:48:51,918 --> 00:48:54,578
that stupid human rights lawyer go wild?

602
00:48:55,985 --> 00:48:56,985
She's good.

603
00:48:58,033 --> 00:48:59,282
- What?
- I was surprised.

604
00:48:59,747 --> 00:49:01,513
Stunned that she was perfect.

605
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:04,235
What are you talking about?

606
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:07,094
I was ashamed to be her subordinate.

607
00:49:07,824 --> 00:49:09,873
Now I'm ashamed to
be called over like this.

608
00:49:10,085 --> 00:49:11,085
What, you punk?

609
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:12,275
So...

610
00:49:12,351 --> 00:49:13,351
What?

611
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:15,313
I'm going to count on Choi Yeon-soo,

612
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,509
and take this to the end.

613
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:17,585
You punk.

614
00:49:18,045 --> 00:49:19,309
Why did you even come here?

615
00:49:19,385 --> 00:49:20,385
Enjoy your food.

616
00:49:20,787 --> 00:49:22,686
I'll pay for what I ate.

617
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,186
Have you gone insane?

618
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:28,042
You rude punk.

619
00:49:28,118 --> 00:49:29,118
Eat up.

620
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,707
I see you've become fearless.

621
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:36,517
Hey!

622
00:49:38,302 --> 00:49:39,817
(Report on Cha Min-ho's Death Case)

623
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,252

624
00:49:43,652 --> 00:49:45,292
(Final Report on Cha Min-ho's Death Case)

625
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:56,084
<i>Let's start the meeting.</i>

626
00:49:58,135 --> 00:49:59,327
This woman is Julie Son.

627
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:01,609
She's American.
Her Korean name is Son Joo-ri.

628
00:50:01,685 --> 00:50:04,201
She left for Florida last night.

629
00:50:04,485 --> 00:50:06,262
She was hanging out in
Gangnam until yesterday,

630
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:07,782
but she suddenly left Korea?

631
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,375
Maybe she caught on and ran away.

632
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:10,451
What should we do?

633
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:12,102
Goodness,

634
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:14,194
where can we find that man now?

635
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:15,401
And

636
00:50:16,185 --> 00:50:17,185
this man.

637
00:50:17,968 --> 00:50:19,926
He's Chief Director Park Won-jong

638
00:50:20,002 --> 00:50:21,624
of the NIS' Financial Security Center.

639
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,584
What? Do you know that guy?

640
00:50:28,918 --> 00:50:30,167
Ms. Choi.

641
00:50:31,692 --> 00:50:32,692
This is the last case

642
00:50:32,768 --> 00:50:34,501
I reviewed in my former position.

643
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:37,034
(Report on Cha Min-ho's Death Case)

644
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:40,752
(Report on Cha Min-ho's Death Case)

645
00:50:49,802 --> 00:50:52,067
(Report on Cha Min-ho's Death Case)

646
00:50:52,335 --> 00:50:54,617
Are you saying
Cha Min-ho and Kim Myung-jae

647
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,451
both have something
to do with Park Won-jong?

648
00:50:57,718 --> 00:50:58,718
Yes.

649
00:50:58,952 --> 00:51:01,501
Did you get demoted because of this case?

650
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:02,977
As you can see,

651
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:04,412
the investigation was done poorly.

652
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:06,760
Park Won-jong told me to sign the report.

653
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:09,101
And I put it off for re-investigation.

654
00:51:09,885 --> 00:51:11,859
Then the man who kicked you out

655
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,934
from the NIS was...

656
00:51:15,735 --> 00:51:16,984
That man.

657
00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:19,460
My gosh.

658
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,535
Wait.

659
00:51:21,497 --> 00:51:23,530
Last time, you said you
barely knew Cha Min-ho.

660
00:51:23,902 --> 00:51:25,667
Why are you exposing this now?

661
00:51:31,141 --> 00:51:33,940
I wondered if it was for
my personal reasons.

662
00:51:34,085 --> 00:51:35,851
I needed some time to think.

663
00:51:38,668 --> 00:51:39,668
Right.

664
00:51:40,235 --> 00:51:41,943
You hate doing things

665
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:43,976
for personal reasons.

666
00:51:44,051 --> 00:51:46,311
How do we know if you hid it or not?

667
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:47,445
So,

668
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,060
Did you share Park Won-jong's location
only with her in case I'd leak it?

669
00:51:51,864 --> 00:51:53,613
Well, think however you'd like.

670
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:55,967
Wait, Mr. Jeong.

671
00:51:56,485 --> 00:51:57,485
Yes, ma'am.

672
00:51:58,018 --> 00:52:00,227
He also knew the location

673
00:52:00,302 --> 00:52:02,067
you reported to me.

674
00:52:03,181 --> 00:52:04,181
What?

675
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:05,756
I told him everything.

676
00:52:06,602 --> 00:52:08,684
Well, then...

677
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,960
After we got rid of the spy camera,
nothing got leaked.

678
00:52:13,035 --> 00:52:15,284
We've kept working as a team.

679
00:52:16,368 --> 00:52:17,293
Oh.

680
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:20,877
I have no personal feelings
toward you, Mr. Jeong.

681
00:52:20,952 --> 00:52:22,984
Now and in the future.

682
00:52:29,352 --> 00:52:31,617
(This folder is empty)

683
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,167
It's all gone.

684
00:53:15,952 --> 00:53:17,676
What kind of person is Park Won-jong?

685
00:53:17,968 --> 00:53:20,677
He's a financial expert specially hired
by the NIS.

686
00:53:20,752 --> 00:53:23,034
He's known to be well-informed

687
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:24,802
about the flow of
international finances.

688
00:53:25,256 --> 00:53:27,344
A chief director of the
NIS means grade three.

689
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,148
So he may be investigated by the CIO.

690
00:53:30,952 --> 00:53:32,632
(Park Won-jong, grade-three civil servant)

691
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,301
Ms. Choi, are we then
starting the investigation officially?

692
00:53:36,568 --> 00:53:37,908
As of yesterday, Park Won-jong is

693
00:53:37,984 --> 00:53:40,499
under suspicion of bribing Kim Myung-jae.

694
00:53:40,902 --> 00:53:41,902
Director Choi.

695
00:53:42,168 --> 00:53:44,184
I believe it's time.

696
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:50,057
All right, let's investigate.

697
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:53,009
But I'd like him to be unaware of it.

698
00:53:53,085 --> 00:53:56,041
Park Won-jong wouldn't be the end.

699
00:53:56,402 --> 00:53:58,360
I'm not sure who is behind him,

700
00:53:58,435 --> 00:53:59,951
but they are frightening people.

701
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,396
People died, and the secret was concealed.

702
00:54:02,768 --> 00:54:04,884
They are fearless and
willing to take any risk.

703
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,560
If we dig into Park Won-jong,
we'll be able to reveal the secret

704
00:54:08,635 --> 00:54:10,293
to the money that
Kim Myung-jae received

705
00:54:10,368 --> 00:54:12,077
as well as the suspicion

706
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:14,110
regarding Cha Min-ho's death.

707
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:15,201
Right.

708
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,534
We will begin investigating Park Won-jong.

709
00:54:18,568 --> 00:54:19,817
Okay.

710
00:54:21,268 --> 00:54:23,617
<i>Section chief, I'm Lee Suk-gyu.</i>

711
00:54:24,152 --> 00:54:25,917
<i>Kim Tae-yeol is here.</i>

712
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:27,951
<i>Auntie's Bar in Sadang-dong.</i>

713
00:54:28,718 --> 00:54:29,718
<i>Auntie's Bar</i>

714
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:31,751
<i>in Sadang-dong.</i>

715
00:54:33,818 --> 00:54:34,818
Gosh.

716
00:54:36,352 --> 00:54:37,601
Good job.

717
00:54:38,652 --> 00:54:39,652
Well?

718
00:54:39,918 --> 00:54:42,451
Recording things and
getting counterattacked.

719
00:54:43,218 --> 00:54:44,467
Mr. Oh.

720
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:49,010
Yeon-soo found out
that Lee Suk-gyu was there at the time.

721
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,788
I told you that
you could get into trouble

722
00:54:51,864 --> 00:54:53,342
for stirring things up, didn't I?

723
00:54:57,035 --> 00:54:58,234
Let me be flat out honest.

724
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:00,740
This is perhaps your fault.

725
00:55:02,113 --> 00:55:03,369
Auntie's Bar.

726
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,246
When we raided that bar,

727
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:10,493
Kim Tae-yeol wasn't there.

728
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:12,526
Didn't you sneak him away?

729
00:55:14,002 --> 00:55:15,709
As far as I remember,

730
00:55:15,785 --> 00:55:17,227
you were losing your senses from then on.

731
00:55:17,302 --> 00:55:18,871
I told you.

732
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:21,576
He suddenly disappeared on the way.

733
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,417
He disappeared? No, you wished he would.

734
00:55:27,735 --> 00:55:29,928
You weren't even
interested in catching him.

735
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:32,115
Do you want me to continue?

736
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:34,081
The day we arrested Kim Tae-yeol,

737
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:36,341
you beat up Do Young-geol and our guys.

738
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:37,916
We almost lost him because of it.

739
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:42,285
That.

740
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:46,334
That's your karma too.

741
00:55:47,118 --> 00:55:48,118
Suk-gyu.

742
00:55:48,618 --> 00:55:50,901
This all began because of your love.

743
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:52,934
Do you really not get it?

744
00:55:56,002 --> 00:55:58,784
Goodness, I'm done.

745
00:55:59,494 --> 00:56:01,009
Sort things out on your own.

746
00:56:01,085 --> 00:56:02,584
I'm busy making a living.

747
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:04,341
Stop calling me.

748
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:43,927
"This all began because of your love.

749
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:45,217
Do you really not get it?"

750
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:47,284
What a line.

751
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:48,898
It was like a piece of art.

752
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:55,377
This will only come back at you as karma.

753
00:56:55,452 --> 00:56:56,184
You know that?

754
00:56:56,452 --> 00:56:57,677
Goodness,

755
00:56:57,752 --> 00:56:59,551
don't ruin my mood already.

756
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:01,084
Hey, Mr. Do.

757
00:57:02,102 --> 00:57:03,384
I can't do this anymore.

758
00:57:03,902 --> 00:57:05,651
This is the last time, okay?

759
00:57:09,485 --> 00:57:10,984
That decision

760
00:57:11,502 --> 00:57:14,034
isn't yours to make.

761
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:46,140
You look tired.

762
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:47,884
You must be busy.

763
00:57:48,402 --> 00:57:49,651
I didn't expect

764
00:57:49,918 --> 00:57:51,701
to see you this soon.

765
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:55,147
Did the funeral go smoothly?

766
00:57:56,835 --> 00:57:57,835
Thanks to you.

767
00:57:59,237 --> 00:58:00,503
How's the investigation going?

768
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:02,572
I've heard you're looking for the informer.

769
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,376
I wanted to see you for
personal reasons today.

770
00:58:06,452 --> 00:58:07,701
Personal reasons?

771
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,734
Like what?

772
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:14,317
<i>Hello, this is Chungmu Trading.</i>

773
00:58:14,738 --> 00:58:16,954
<i>Section chief, I'm Lee Suk-gyu.</i>

774
00:58:17,685 --> 00:58:19,451
<i>Kim Tae-yeol is here.</i>

775
00:58:19,968 --> 00:58:21,484
<i>Auntie's Bar in Sadang-dong.</i>

776
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:23,339
<i>Auntie's Bar</i>

777
00:58:24,052 --> 00:58:25,336
<i>in Sadang-dong.</i>

778
00:58:25,411 --> 00:58:26,426
Section chief...

779
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:28,117
Chungmu Trading...

780
00:58:29,668 --> 00:58:30,668
It's the ANSP.

781
00:58:31,435 --> 00:58:32,377
The ANSP?

782
00:58:32,452 --> 00:58:34,427
The police. Defense Security Command,

783
00:58:34,502 --> 00:58:36,942
and the ANSP were
after Tae-yeol at that time.

784
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:39,284
Among them, the ANSP was the only one

785
00:58:40,068 --> 00:58:41,628
that used the name, Chungmu Trading.

786
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,851
So that means Lee Suk-gyu

787
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,936
was with the ANSP.

788
00:58:46,576 --> 00:58:49,034
How many times did Tae-yeol come here?

789
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,376
At least twice.

790
00:58:50,452 --> 00:58:53,001
There were a lot of customers every time.

791
00:58:53,518 --> 00:58:55,801
Once, Jung-hyun was with us too.

792
00:58:56,068 --> 00:58:57,835
- Was he?
- Yes.

793
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:00,957
This means

794
00:59:01,402 --> 00:59:03,951
someone was watching us here.

795
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:07,824
You're right, but Tae-yeol
didn't get caught here.

796
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,966
It was on campus a few days later.

797
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:11,868
Right.

798
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:16,631
Who on earth sent this to me?

799
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:19,060
No, why?

800
00:59:26,102 --> 00:59:27,367
Director Choi Yeon-soo.

801
00:59:29,168 --> 00:59:30,168
Yes?

802
00:59:30,523 --> 00:59:31,523
I hope

803
00:59:31,952 --> 00:59:34,234
this doesn't affect you too much.

804
00:59:35,231 --> 00:59:37,368
Those who sent you this file

805
00:59:37,444 --> 00:59:39,710
probably want to sway you.

806
00:59:42,368 --> 00:59:43,368
You think?

807
00:59:43,754 --> 00:59:45,520
Like you said,

808
00:59:45,918 --> 00:59:47,109
even if we find the person

809
00:59:47,185 --> 00:59:48,985
who abetted
Park Doo-sik to kill Tae-yeol,

810
00:59:49,735 --> 00:59:52,268
the statute of limitations expired
a long time ago.

811
00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:54,493
I know. Even if we catch the culprit,

812
00:59:54,568 --> 00:59:55,759
they won't be punished.

813
00:59:55,835 --> 00:59:58,327
Tae-yeol won't come back alive either.

814
00:59:58,402 --> 00:59:59,402
Exactly.

815
00:59:59,918 --> 01:00:01,951
I'm suspicious of their intention.

816
01:00:11,352 --> 01:00:12,352
<i>Suk-gyu.</i>

817
01:00:12,868 --> 01:00:15,401
This all began because of your love.

818
01:00:15,774 --> 01:00:16,774
<i>Do you really not get it?</i>

819
01:00:21,018 --> 01:00:22,567
I'm home.

820
01:00:23,102 --> 01:00:24,384
Welcome back.

821
01:00:25,574 --> 01:00:27,090
What's this smell?

822
01:00:27,554 --> 01:00:28,926
Bindaetteok. It's still warm.

823
01:00:29,002 --> 01:00:30,751
Oh, bindaetteok.

824
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:32,284
Seung-goo.

825
01:00:32,568 --> 01:00:33,584
Where did you buy it?

826
01:00:33,852 --> 01:00:35,101
I went to Auntie's Bar.

827
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:36,461
You're home, Mom.

828
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:38,286
Seung-goo, have some bindaetteok.

829
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:39,934
Okay.

830
01:00:41,114 --> 01:00:42,363
Auntie's Bar?

831
01:00:42,752 --> 01:00:44,251
You must've met Kang Choong-mo.

832
01:00:45,052 --> 01:00:46,052
What did he say?

833
01:00:46,568 --> 01:00:47,688
The man named Lee Suk-gyu

834
01:00:48,085 --> 01:00:50,351
was probably from the ANSP.

835
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:53,500
It seems to be the ANSP

836
01:00:53,935 --> 01:00:55,184
that arrested Tae-yeol.

837
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:00,743
I visited Jung-ho on my way home.

838
01:01:00,818 --> 01:01:01,851
He got a little better.

839
01:01:02,635 --> 01:01:04,134
I see. Jung-ho?

840
01:01:04,209 --> 01:01:06,593
Mom, this is really good.

841
01:01:06,668 --> 01:01:08,126
Eat up, Seung-goo.

842
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:09,279
You should eat some too.

843
01:01:09,355 --> 01:01:10,604
Let me wash up first.

844
01:01:10,685 --> 01:01:11,685
Go on.

845
01:01:22,702 --> 01:01:23,702
Director Choi.

846
01:01:24,334 --> 01:01:25,943
Park Won-jong left Korea this morning.

847
01:01:26,018 --> 01:01:26,942
He left?

848
01:01:27,018 --> 01:01:29,801
Yes, he's coming back
in three days from Switzerland.

849
01:01:31,852 --> 01:01:34,310
And Son Joo-ri is his mistress.

850
01:01:34,385 --> 01:01:35,342
These are the pictures of them

851
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:36,626
coming out together
from a studio apartment.

852
01:01:37,299 --> 01:01:39,660
Gosh. Get things ready

853
01:01:39,735 --> 01:01:41,615
so we can investigate
as soon as he returns.

854
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:44,884
Oh, and check why
he left for Switzerland,

855

I looked into the Widow's Cruse Project.

858
01:01:58,418 --> 01:01:59,860
Widow's Cruse Project was

859
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:05,176
a charity business run by the NIS,
the ANSP at that time.

860
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:07,534
To help African children in 1993.

861
01:02:08,302 --> 01:02:09,493
They received a lot of donations

862
01:02:09,568 --> 01:02:11,584
from the financial
and political circles.

863
01:02:12,102 --> 01:02:13,043

864
01:02:13,118 --> 01:02:14,384
Im Hyung-rak.

865
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:16,152
Do you know him?

866
01:02:16,618 --> 01:02:17,934

They're dead or can't be confirmed.

In the end,

871
01:02:25,285 --> 01:02:27,077
we have to ask Im Hyung-rak, this man...

872
01:02:27,152 --> 01:02:28,152
No.

873
01:02:28,385 --> 01:02:30,110
There's no good in letting them know

874
01:02:30,185 --> 01:02:31,684
about our investigation.

875
01:02:34,002 --> 01:02:36,501

It's the security chief.

919
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:07,517
This is my husband.

920
01:06:07,776 --> 01:06:09,516
I see.

921
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:12,600
It's nice to meet you.

922
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:14,634
Me too.

923
01:06:16,701 --> 01:06:19,217
Enjoy your lunch then.

924
01:06:19,485 --> 01:06:21,017
Thanks, go on.

925
01:06:35,851 --> 01:06:36,851
What's going on?

926
01:06:38,118 --> 01:06:39,367
I don't know.

927
01:06:39,901 --> 01:06:41,650
What is that lunatic doing?

928
01:06:43,185 --> 01:06:44,126
Darn it.

929
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:45,201
What should we eat?

930
01:06:45,518 --> 01:06:48,267
Well... What are you having?

931
01:06:49,035 --> 01:06:49,976
I want galbitang.

932
01:06:50,051 --> 01:06:51,051
Me too.

933
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:53,600
Oh.

934
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:55,218
That man from earlier.

935
01:06:56,151 --> 01:06:58,684
Didn't we meet him at Mr. Hwang's hospital?

936
01:06:59,468 --> 01:07:00,217
What?

937
01:07:00,485 --> 01:07:02,017
You know...

938
01:07:02,471 --> 01:07:03,636
At the parking lot.

939
01:07:04,068 --> 01:07:07,351
He was talking about
getting divorced with a cap on.

940
01:07:14,251 --> 01:07:16,550
What is your name, sir?

941
01:07:16,818 --> 01:07:18,084
Me?

942
01:07:19,622 --> 01:07:21,102
I'm...

943
01:07:22,511 --> 01:07:23,777
Lee Suk-gyu.

944
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:26,175
Lee Suk-gyu?

945
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,959
You should visit

946
01:07:28,035 --> 01:07:30,300
<i>a divorce lawyer not me.</i>

947
01:07:31,335 --> 01:07:32,335
Lee Suk-gyu.

948
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:47,525
Look into the security chief?

949
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:48,601
Yes.

950
01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:52,143
Check if he had
another job at the NIS,

951
01:07:52,218 --> 01:07:55,389
or if he joined the CIO
 for ulterior motives.

952
01:07:56,068 --> 01:07:57,550
Look into him in general.

953
01:07:57,885 --> 01:08:00,360
We were going to do
an internal investigation

954
01:08:00,435 --> 01:08:02,184
after the spy camera incident anyway,

955
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:04,217
but why all of a sudden?

956
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:07,517
I just want to check. Please do it for me.

957
01:08:07,801 --> 01:08:09,317
Sure thing.

958
01:08:15,235 --> 01:08:16,734
Goodness, Lee Suk-gyu.

959
01:08:22,584 --> 01:08:24,083
<i>This is my husband.</i>

960
01:08:24,318 --> 01:08:25,850
I see.

961
01:08:26,418 --> 01:08:27,900
It's nice to meet you.

962
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:32,500
Did that punk come here by coincidence?

963
01:08:34,785 --> 01:08:36,284
Goodness.

964
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:43,667
Kwang-chul.

965
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:48,016
Check Choi Yeon-soo's moves
in real time.

966
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:52,259
- Director Choi.
- Yes.

967
01:08:52,334 --> 01:08:54,575
About Mr. Do...

968
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:55,651
Yes.

969
01:08:55,918 --> 01:08:58,984
He received a citation in 1991.

970
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:00,751
And?

971
01:09:02,493 --> 01:09:05,542
Mr. Do is the one

972
01:09:05,618 --> 01:09:07,884
who arrested Kim Tae-yeol.

973
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:13,250
It isn't a problem to get a citation
for completing his mission.

974
01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:17,575
I saw him before we met in the CIO.

975
01:09:17,651 --> 01:09:18,593
Really?

976
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:21,217
When I was offered this position,
he visited me.

977
01:09:21,468 --> 01:09:22,984
Why did he?

978
01:09:23,767 --> 01:09:25,442
We'll find out who sent him here,

979
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:27,050
and make him answer that question.

980
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,900
Check if he was in league with
outside forces, or leaked any information.

981
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:34,434
Okay.

982
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:40,801
(Jung-hyun)

983
01:09:43,351 --> 01:09:44,351
Hi, Jung-hyun.

984
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:45,664
Hey.

985
01:09:46,151 --> 01:09:47,151
Did you leave work?

986
01:09:47,418 --> 01:09:48,418
I'm about to.

987
01:09:49,114 --> 01:09:51,379
I'm still nearby.
Should we go home together?

988
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:48,239
What did you do in this
neighborhood all day?

989
01:10:49,592 --> 01:10:50,592
Earlier today,

990
01:10:50,668 --> 01:10:52,571
I came to do some after-sales service,

991
01:10:52,951 --> 01:10:54,200
and it ended just now.

992
01:10:54,985 --> 01:10:56,212
I see.

993
01:10:58,301 --> 01:11:00,318
- Hold on.
- Sure.

994
01:11:03,118 --> 01:11:04,060
Hi, Sang-a.

995
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,375
<i>You know the serial killer
who died in Sokcho, right?</i>

996
01:11:06,451 --> 01:11:07,184
<i>Yes.</i>

997
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:09,909
He murdered someone in Uijeongbu.

998
01:11:09,985 --> 01:11:11,484
<i>Guess who the victim was.</i>

999
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:12,726
Who?

1000
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:13,801
Park Doo-sik.

1001
01:11:14,585 --> 01:11:15,585
Park Doo-sik?

1002
01:11:19,151 --> 01:11:20,843
Really? The guy who killed Tae-yeol?

1003
01:11:20,918 --> 01:11:22,400
<i>Yes, that guy.</i>

1004
01:11:23,065 --> 01:11:24,625
<i>Rumors say that when he was found dead,</i>

1005
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,234
<i>he had an article about you
from 25 years ago.</i>

1006
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:30,976
But he died in Uijeongbu?

1007
01:11:31,051 --> 01:11:32,567
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

1008
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:36,100
<i>Hey, how could this happen
by coincidence?</i>

1009
01:11:36,368 --> 01:11:37,634
Let's hang up for now.

1010
01:11:39,685 --> 01:11:41,605
Jung-hyun, I need to
stop by the police station.

1011
01:11:42,451 --> 01:11:43,486
Okay.

1012
01:12:00,035 --> 01:12:01,035
Go on.

1013
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,068
Okay.

1014
01:12:18,135 --> 01:12:19,135
Wow.

1015
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:23,767
It's my first time having
this in my entire life.

1016
01:12:24,818 --> 01:12:26,000
Wow.

1017
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:29,550
The election is coming up in three months.

1018
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:33,600
- Yes.
- We must stand firmly,

1019
01:12:34,135 --> 01:12:35,884
for this country to do the same.

1020
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:39,684
I'll do my best.

1021
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:44,800
- Take your hand off.
- Okay.

1022
01:12:49,435 --> 01:12:50,435
Yes, sir.

1023
01:13:07,485 --> 01:13:09,500
- Is it good enough?
- Gosh, I don't think

1024
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:13,850
I can eat it anywhere else from now on.

1025
01:13:15,651 --> 01:13:17,184
So Park Doo-sik is dead.

1026
01:13:20,251 --> 01:13:21,251
Yes.

1027
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:30,893
Please kill me.

1028
01:13:30,968 --> 01:13:32,693
Don't do this. We're having good food.

1029
01:13:32,768 --> 01:13:34,234
So that it won't be of harm.

1030
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,733
I'll take care of things thoroughly.

1031
01:13:39,787 --> 01:13:40,793
Mr. Do.

1032
01:13:40,868 --> 01:13:42,367
Yes, sir.

1033
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:48,200
I don't know

1034
01:13:50,268 --> 01:13:52,517
what you're talking about.

1035
01:13:55,357 --> 01:13:59,650
I don't know what you
mean. Do you understand?

1036
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:05,017
Yes, of course.

1037
01:14:16,701 --> 01:14:17,701
Here.

1038
01:14:17,968 --> 01:14:18,968
Thank you.

1039
01:14:19,531 --> 01:14:21,013

I just need to check.

1053

Did you find an article from 25 years ago

1054
01:15:35,085 --> 01:15:37,734
among the belongings
of Park Doo-sik who died at the inn?

1055
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:39,842
I can't tell you.

1056
01:15:39,918 --> 01:15:42,529
Can't I take a quick look at the records?

1057
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:44,410
It's still under investigation.

1058

but this is abusing your power.

1060

1061

was caught in Sokcho.

1062
01:15:53,651 --> 01:15:55,076

He won't tell me anything.

1068
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:34,800
What should I do?

1069
01:16:38,118 --> 01:16:40,384
I'd better visit the patrol division.

1070
01:16:43,718 --> 01:16:44,984

1081
