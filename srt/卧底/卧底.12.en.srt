1
00:00:00,082 --> 00:00:07,523
(Undercover)

2
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:10,815
(Undercover)

3
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:16,630
(All places, characters, companies,)

4
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,460
(and incidents in this drama
are fictitious.)

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,841
- Come on in.
- Okay.

6
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:26,941
- Gosh.
- Are you okay, Jung-hyun?

7
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:28,657
Yes, I am.

8
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:34,738
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

9
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:38,473
Everyone must've left early

10
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,388
because it's Saturday.

11
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:43,645
So this is it.

12
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:47,991
This machine is used to make holes.

13
00:00:50,653 --> 00:00:51,929
And this is called milling.

14
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:55,692
It's used to plane metal smooth.

15
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:57,197
I mostly handle it.

16
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:00,998
Well.

17
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,702
This is it.

18
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:05,046
Feel free to look around.

19
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:09,288
It's fascinating. This is where you work.

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,202
Isn't it interesting?

21
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:21,688
One minute.

22
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:34,659
What is that for?

23
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:36,774
It's called SS.

24
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:38,648
- SS?
- Yes, SS.

25
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:42,311
Oh, it's stainless steel.

26
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,566
It doesn't easily get rusty.
It never changes.

27
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:49,136
Watch me.

28
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,449
Do you want to try?

29
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:20,816
Me?

30
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:22,088
- Come here.
- Well...

31
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:27,792
I'm not sure if I can do this.

32
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:29,261
Put your bag over there.

33
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:35,198
Wear these gloves.

34
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:39,235
Wait a second.

35
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:54,644
Yes.

36
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:02,135
Stand right here.

37
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:06,108
And fix it

38
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:07,781
to this.

39
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:11,508
Oh, okay. But Jung-hyun

40
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,944
Jung-hyun. Do you think I can do this?

41
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:16,081
I'll help you.

42
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:18,241
I'm a bit scared.

43
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:24,621
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

44
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:00,514
Well done.

45
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:11,883
Now we need to cool it down like this.

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,824
- Wow.
- Ta-da.

47
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:21,734
It's a ring, isn't it?

48
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:26,476
Do you want to try it on?

49
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,691
Wow, it's very smooth.

50
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,189
It's fascinating.

51
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,310
(Episode 12)

52
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,540
Yeon-soo.

53
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,051
Yeon-soo.

54
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:14,123
Who...

55
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:17,656
Who are you?

56
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,592
You're not Han Jung-hyun.

57
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:28,637
Who are you?

58
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,077
Tell me!

59
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:39,853
Who are you?

60
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:43,113
Put that down first.

61
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,198
Han Jung-hyun is dead.

62
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:47,504
He died when he was seven.

63
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:50,235
His grave is in the orphanage

64
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:51,768
where you said you grew up.

65
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:56,564
- Yeon-soo.
- Don't you try to fool me anymore.

66
00:06:56,643 --> 00:06:57,635
I know everything now.

67
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,079
You tell me.

68
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,809
Who are you?

69
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,128
- I'm sorry.
- That's not what I want to hear.

70
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,199
Answer me!

71
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:47,905
My name is...

72
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:57,606
Lee Suk-gyu.

73
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,883
<i>Section chief, I'm Lee Suk-gyu.</i>

74
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,902
<i>Kim Tae-yeol is here.</i>

75
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:05,687
Lee Suk-gyu?

76
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:08,671
Lee Suk-gyu... Who is Lee Suk-gyu?

77
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,759
Then what? Were they watching us
at Auntie's Bar?

78
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:19,617
His name is Lee Suk-gyu.

79
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:35,945
Yeon-soo.

80
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:39,003
Yeon-soo.

81
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:42,786
Yeon-soo. Yeon-soo.

82
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:46,075
Yeon-soo.

83
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:51,429
Yeon-soo.

84
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,400
(Name: Lee Suk-gyu)

85
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,981
(Undercover name: Han Jung-hyun)

86
00:08:55,512 --> 00:08:57,279
(Agency for National Security Planning)

87
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,008
(Mission failed)

88
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:11,436
(Trying to take follow-up measures)

89
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:20,121
His name is Lee Suk-gyu,

90
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,867
and his undercover name was Han Jung-hyun.

91
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,596
He was one of the undercover agents of NIS,
which was formerly ANSP.

92
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:29,474
We dispatched him to arrest Kim Tae-yeol,

93
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:30,796
the then chairman of NCSR.

94
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,115
To arrest Kim Tae-yeol?

95
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:35,565
Are you saying Jung-hyun was a spy?

96
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:36,710
Yes.

97
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:43,174
When did you find out about this?

98
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,818
We, the NIS agents,
are not supposed to know each other,

99
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:47,008
or each other's missions.

100
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:48,426
I recently

101
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,859
looked into the death of Park Doo-sik,

102
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:51,970
who murdered Kim Tae-yeol,

103
00:09:52,954 --> 00:09:55,893
and found out about Lee Suk-gyu
who had long been forgotten.

104
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:58,094
Are you...

105
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:00,571
threatening me now?

106
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:02,333
I just want us to be careful.

107
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,612
It's not only the dark past of the NIS.

108
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:08,263
If this goes public,
Director Choi Yeon-soo

109
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:11,760
can no longer be in the CIO.

110
00:10:12,554 --> 00:10:15,499
It may also bring trouble to the VIP,
who appointed her.

111
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:16,722
I was worried,

112
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,526
so I requested a meeting with you

113
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:20,369
to let you know about this.

114
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,236
I hope it helps.

115
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,424
She had stomach cramps.

116
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,067
She'll be fine once she gets some rest.

117
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:46,251
- I see. Thank you.
- Sure.

118
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:12,512
Lee Suk-gyu.

119
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:16,002
My social security number
is 680930-1257557.

120
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:18,827
An intelligence agent of ANSP,
Anticommunist Investigation Unit Eight.

121
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:23,916
Entered National Police University in 1987.

122
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:26,599
Entered ANSP during the second semester
of my sophomore year.

123
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,426
In May 1991, I got a mission.

124
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:37,954
It was to gather information

125
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:39,343
needed to arrest Kim Tae-yeol.

126
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:48,526
My job was to investigate
his acquaintances,

127
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,147
and form relationships with them.

128
00:12:58,899 --> 00:12:59,891
A spy?

129
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:05,133
You were a spy?

130
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:09,932
Wait! What's your name?

131
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,160
- Sorry?
- I'm Choi Yeon-soo.

132
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm Han Jung-hyun.

133
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,190
Did you approach me on purpose?

134
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:26,138
In October 1991, Lee Suk-gyu

135
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:30,316
disappeared after
handing in his resignation.

136
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:32,957
No.

137
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,548
No, no. That can't be true.

138
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:37,618
Since then,

139
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:40,381
I've never lived as Lee Suk-gyu.

140
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,453
Don't lie to me.

141
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:46,677
I thought I could do that to be with you.

142
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:50,606
Yeon-soo.

143
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:51,929
Please believe me.

144
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:54,690
No.

145
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:59,498
<i>Thank you, Jung-hyun.</i>

146
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,666
I definitely have an eye for a good man.

147
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:20,082
You and our kids

148
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:22,977
are everything to me.

149
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,287
Shut up.

150
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:39,803
(Daehan Medical Center)

151
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:51,850
(Taxi)

152
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:13,260
<i>Ms. Choi Yeon-soo's husband</i>

153
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:15,982
<i>was one of the
undercover agents of the NIS,</i>

154
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:17,254
<i>which was formerly ANSP.</i>

155
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:21,663
<i>We dispatched him to arrest Kim
Tae-yeol, the then chairman of NCSR.</i>

156
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:39,788
This investigation hasn't progressed much.

157
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:45,071
He keeps asserting that Park
Won-jong is just a friend of his.

158
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:48,161
He doesn't remember
about the memory chip?

159
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,169
Apparently, he forgets things easily
just like a dementia patient.

160
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,217
He luckily hit the jackpot
in the stock market?

161
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:55,598
He invested 20 million won
and earned 100 million in two months.

162
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:56,877
Does he think we'll believe that?

163
00:16:56,957 --> 00:16:58,378
Judging by the dates
of their rendezvous,

164
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,348
I'm sure Park Won-jong
gave him the information.

165
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:03,675
He obstructed the investigation,
and concealed the evidence for sure.

166
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:05,568
But there's no direct evidence

167
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:07,446
that shows Park ordered him

168
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,983
to fabricate the Cha Min-ho case.

169
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:10,087
What do we do?

170
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:14,172
If we fail to find the
link between the two.

171
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:15,660
We'll have to transfer this case

172
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,395
to the prosecution or the police

173
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:18,466
as corruption.

174
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:19,540
Goodness.

175
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,564
By the way,

176
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:25,441
Director Choi is out of the office again.

177
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,694
She's taking the afternoon off.

178
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,791
The CIO Director is her mom.

179
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,953
Ms. Choi's daughter is in ninth grade.

180
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,089
I'm sure she's very fussy.

181
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:40,074
And you're very nosy, Mr. Bae.

182
00:17:40,412 --> 00:17:41,948
Why do you worry about her daughter?

183
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:44,249
Yeon-soo! Wait a second!

184
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:49,039
Hi, Mom.

185
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:51,285
Mom.

186
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:52,702
Are you okay?

187
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:55,940
Dad. What's wrong with Mom?

188
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:04,650
Mom.

189
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,810
Mom. Are you sick?

190
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,523
Don't be sick.

191
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:25,459
If the director of the CIO is sick,

192
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:26,801
everyone will be worried.

193
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:29,834
I'm fine.

194
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,467
Have you been overworking yourself?

195
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,941
Get a good sleep.

196
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:42,248
It'll refresh you.

197
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:44,328
Okay.

198
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:46,378
Seung-goo.

199
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:47,926
Let her get some rest.

200
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:50,410
Sleep tight, Mom.

201
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:09,991
What's wrong with Mom?

202
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:16,800
I'll fix you dinner quickly.

203
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:24,570
Mom and Dad have the
same look on their faces.

204
00:22:26,588 --> 00:22:27,859
Is Dad tired too?

205
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:30,411
I don't think that's the only reason.

206
00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:21,293
Jung-hyun.

207
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:23,421
I had a strange dream.

208
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:28,587
You said you aren't Jung-hyun,

209
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,203
and our relationship is
a complete sham.

210
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,872
It's not true, is it?

211
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:00,307
It can't be true.

212
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:04,709
You saved me in the police bus.

213
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:06,556
It was you. It was Han Jung-hyun.

214
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,245
I can't believe...

215
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,812
this.

216
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:14,679
You made me this ring.

217
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,396
You worked in a factory.

218
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:18,137
All this is real.

219
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:25,915
I first saw you

220
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:33,268
at Hwang Jung-ho's trial.

221
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:38,801
It was fascinating to see you

222
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:40,785
fearlessly tackle the
judge and prosecutor

223
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:44,130
who were old enough to be
your father or older brother.

224
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,137
Your Honor! Let go!

225
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,769
And you call this the court?

226
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:49,072
On the day we first met,

227
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,577
you were in the front row of the protest.

228
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:55,830
The third one from
the central flag on the left.

229
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:57,139
You weren't covering your face.

230
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:00,604
I got caught by the police intentionally

231
00:25:00,684 --> 00:25:02,671
to get on the bus to approach you.

232
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,927
Uphold the Constitution!

233
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:06,287
Hey, you're so loud. Shut your mouth!

234
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:09,992
And when we got out of
the bus with Choong-mo,

235
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,079
you asked me my name.

236
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:14,644
When I went to your
school and got caught

237
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:16,367
by the protesters,

238
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:17,639
you saved me.

239
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:20,698
He's my friend.

240
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:22,383
<i>And when you
called me your friend,</i>

241
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,588
I was so happy.

242
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:29,911
<i>I couldn't believe that
someone like you were my friend.</i>

243
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,017
<i>That's when</i>

244
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:36,577
things started to get tough.

245
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:38,793
Shall we have jajangmyeon together?

246
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:40,695
If you're busy--

247
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,180
Meet me at the front gate
this Saturday.

248
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:44,989
<i>We promised to have jajangmyeon together.</i>

249
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:47,967
<i>And until I met you again,</i>

250
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:51,691
I had the longest days in my life.

251
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:57,205

252
00:29:49,782 --> 00:29:51,698

253
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:54,046
Yeon-soo.

254
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:57,797
Stop.

255
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,159
Yeon-soo, please. Yeon-soo.

256
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:10,554
I'm sorry.

257
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:11,934
It's all my fault.

258
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,688
I'm the one to blame. I'm sorry.

259
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:19,353
Seung-goo.

260
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,343
Seung-mi.

261
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:23,510
Our kids.

262
00:30:31,344 --> 00:30:32,336
Let go of me.

263
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:05,865
Mom.

264
00:31:06,705 --> 00:31:08,373
Where'd you go at this hour of morning?

265
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:09,915
Mom.

266
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:12,343
You weren't in the store.

267
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:14,033
Did you go out dressed like this?

268
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,036
What's wrong?

269
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,836
Mom. Why are you sad?

270
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:30,685
Dad.

271
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,685
Mom is sad.

272
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:34,256
Why is she sad?

273
00:31:58,949 --> 00:31:59,941
Dad.

274
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:01,756
Did Mom find out about it?

275
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:08,881
- Seung-mi.
- You lent money to the lady.

276
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,232
Your old colleague.

277
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:12,040
Did she find out about it?

278
00:32:15,273 --> 00:32:17,960
- It's nothing like that.
- Just be honest with me.

279
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:20,482
You lent a lot of money
to your female friend.

280
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:22,097
No woman would be happy...

281
00:32:25,386 --> 00:32:26,576
Mom is also a woman after all.

282
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,435
But I don't quite understand her.

283
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,241
It's not like you cheated on her,

284
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:35,427
or shacked up with some woman.

285
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:38,930
You just helped a needy person.

286
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,734
Mom spent all her life
trying to help wronged people.

287
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:44,915
She sometimes left us with you,

288
00:32:44,995 --> 00:32:46,304
and didn't come home for days.

289
00:32:50,128 --> 00:32:51,437
It's nothing like that, Seung-mi.

290
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,898
What is it then?

291
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,802
Well.

292
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:00,804
Why are you two so serious?

293
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:05,103
I did something wrong,

294
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:08,014
and hurt her feelings.

295
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,692
You did something wrong?

296
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:11,477
What did you do?

297
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:14,711
How serious is that?

298
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:18,776
Later.

299
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:25,025
I'll tell you everything later.

300
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,213
Right now, I can't.

301
00:34:10,704 --> 00:34:12,223
I'm going to work now, Seung-goo.

302
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:13,512
What about breakfast?

303
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:16,288
I think I have to skip it today.

304
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,788
Are you angry at Dad?

305
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:24,122
See you.

306
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,717
Step aside.

307
00:34:43,797 --> 00:34:45,575
There's something you need to know.

308
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:46,646
Get out of the way.

309
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:48,392
You need to know this. It won't take long.

310
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:53,753
Do something about Do Young-geol.

312
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:17,830
Did you eat?

313
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:27,028
Seung-goo.

314
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:33,063
Seung-goo.

315
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,130
Seung-goo.

316
00:35:40,476 --> 00:35:42,227
You need to eat. Open the door.

317
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:44,763
Seung-mi and I always ate together!

318
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:46,370
Even after a fight!

319
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:48,246
You told us to do it!

Seung-goo. Mom skipped breakfast

321
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:53,485
because she had urgent business.

322
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:55,041
Let's go up and eat.

323
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:57,789
You can make up later but you
should eat together as a family!

324
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:00,353

Goodness.

(Director's Office)

371
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:44,622
(Director Choi Yeon-soo)

372
00:40:50,355 --> 00:40:51,347
Director.

373
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:52,753
Oh.

374
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:54,971
- Yes?
- We've secured

375
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,454
all the charges on Mr. Do.

376
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:58,255
He's a wanted man now.

377
00:40:58,994 --> 00:41:00,237
I see.

378
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,354
Are you okay?

379
00:41:02,636 --> 00:41:03,627
Yes, I am.

380
00:41:04,899 --> 00:41:05,907
Excuse me, then.

381
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:20,615
Hello?

382
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:24,906
Patient Go Yoon-joo?

383
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,464
What do you mean she disappeared?

384
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,605
Did you report it to the police?

385
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:35,636
Okay, call me if you find her.

386
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:37,686
Okay, bye.

387
00:42:04,078 --> 00:42:05,597
Yoon-joo, are you okay?

388
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,960
Suk-gyu...

389
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:46,987
(Incoming call)

390
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:54,249
Hello?

391
00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:01,850
Thanks.

392
00:43:09,452 --> 00:43:10,493
Go Yoon-joo?

393
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:13,988
You saved me once again.

394
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,402
Are you okay?

395
00:43:18,905 --> 00:43:20,127
<i>I left the hospital.</i>

396
00:43:22,987 --> 00:43:24,242
What are you going to do now?

397
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,325
Choi Yeon-soo was followed, wasn't she?

398
00:43:28,556 --> 00:43:29,580
Why do you ask?

399
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,563
<i>I need to meet her again.</i>

400
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,721
I beg you.

401
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:36,388
Please stop dragging Yeon-soo into this.

402
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:41,164
Their next target could be Yeon-soo.

403
00:43:57,244 --> 00:43:59,987
Hello? Hello?

404
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,200
Not yet?

405
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:14,712
No.

406
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:25,155
Seung-goo, open the door just once.

407
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,390
<i>They took off from Hwacheon...</i>

408
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:27,477
Seung-goo.

409
00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:33,494
Take this. I got only the legs.

410
00:44:33,907 --> 00:44:35,427
You can have them all alone.

411
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,325
They're all yours.

412
00:44:38,065 --> 00:44:39,072
Make sure you eat them.

413
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:52,717
Dad.

414
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,956
I don't know how serious the problem is

415
00:44:55,037 --> 00:44:56,292
between you and Mom,

416
00:44:58,008 --> 00:45:00,503
but I can't imagine
our family without you.

417
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:06,353
He may not know.

418
00:45:07,276 --> 00:45:09,484
But he can't live without you.

419
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:13,658
Thanks, sweetheart.

420
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:18,500
Gosh.

421
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,246
I told you to just eat them.

422
00:45:21,326 --> 00:45:22,767
They're 12 chicken legs.

423
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:24,101
You want me to eat them all?

424
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,366
It's your lie, isn't it?

425
00:45:28,515 --> 00:45:30,282
This is all because of your lie.

426
00:45:40,132 --> 00:45:41,387
Gosh, whatever.

427
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:42,909
Do whatever you want.

428
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,671
Don't be so harsh on him.

429
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,269
Anyway,

430
00:45:52,311 --> 00:45:54,822
you should appease Mom somehow.

431
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:00,906
All right, here.

432
00:46:01,273 --> 00:46:02,495
Park Won-jong in a suit

433
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:04,561
is giving a bribe to
Goo Seo-bok in a jumper.

434
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:05,632
A bribe?

435
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,747
How do you know what's inside?

436
00:46:08,277 --> 00:46:10,566
This video alone doesn't prove it.

437
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:13,514
What? Are you saying this isn't all?

438
00:46:14,655 --> 00:46:15,928
You know me.

439
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:18,753
(CCTV)

440
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:21,464
Oh?

441
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,545
What?

442
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:38,700
What about this?

443
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:47,028
This was captured 10
minutes after the meal.

444
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,606
In the bank right next to the restaurant.

445
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,097
Well, this is--

446
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:54,944
Gosh, look at all that cash.

447
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:56,651
You opened a stock account

448
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,935
right away with that money.

449
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:02,003
And the price of the
stocks you bought hit it big.

450
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:03,558
Hey, Jeong Cheol-hun.

451
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:05,263
"Check your surroundings at all times."

452
00:47:05,703 --> 00:47:07,190
Hey, you punk.

453
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:08,896
How can you do this to me?

454
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:10,742
Right, I learned it from you.

455
00:47:12,313 --> 00:47:14,047
"Check your surroundings at all times,

456
00:47:14,825 --> 00:47:15,817
Jeong Cheol-hun."

457
00:47:23,353 --> 00:47:25,615
<i>All right, then... Now...</i>

458
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,618
Anything about Park Won-jong?

459
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:28,891
He's scheduled to arrive in the country

460
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,002
at 10:05 a.m. tomorrow from Zurich.

461
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,675
I see.

462
00:47:32,755 --> 00:47:34,274
I'll get ready and meet him there.

463
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,083
Okay. Any news about Do Young-geol?

464
00:47:37,164 --> 00:47:38,170
No, not yet.

465
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,596
I'll stay on top of it.

466
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:40,836
Okay.

467
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,235
- <i>Who is he?</i>
- <i>Oh.</i>

468
00:47:49,314 --> 00:47:50,474
He's our security chief.

469
00:47:50,553 --> 00:47:51,728
This is my husband.

470
00:47:52,057 --> 00:47:53,841
Oh, I see.

471
00:47:55,131 --> 00:47:56,123
Nice to meet you.

472
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:43,689
Seung-goo, it's not a lie

473
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:46,640
that I like you.

474
00:48:48,707 --> 00:48:49,698
That I like

475
00:48:50,987 --> 00:48:53,002
your mom and Seung-mi.

476
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,274
It's not a lie.

477
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:02,322
But...

478
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:07,413
I told

479
00:49:08,835 --> 00:49:10,172
a lie.

480
00:49:14,486 --> 00:49:15,742
I'm sorry.

481
00:49:22,104 --> 00:49:23,096
I'm sorry.

482
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:43,184
Congratulations on
becoming the party's leader.

483
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,716
It's only natural.

484
00:49:48,423 --> 00:49:49,678
Congratulations.

485
00:49:51,546 --> 00:49:52,537
Cheers.

486
00:49:58,924 --> 00:50:00,426
After Kim Myung-jae died,

487
00:50:01,801 --> 00:50:03,800
our party's approval rating is hiking up.

488
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,480
The ruling party is just too incompetent.

489
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:08,958
We're only benefiting from it.

490
00:50:09,224 --> 00:50:11,075
If the general election was held tomorrow,

491
00:50:12,808 --> 00:50:15,353
we'll easily gain two-thirds of the seats.

492
00:50:15,433 --> 00:50:16,687
200 seats?

493
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:19,682
Isn't that number big enough

494
00:50:19,762 --> 00:50:22,667
to impeach a president unilaterally?

495
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:26,822
I doubt it's possible though.

496
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:28,933
Why is it not?

497
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:32,656
Considering the current trend,

498
00:50:32,735 --> 00:50:34,485
I believe it's possible.

499
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,657
I feel reassured to have a great captain.

500
00:50:40,753 --> 00:50:41,744
Then now,

501
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:44,288
I guess we just have to wait for the wind.

502
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,657
No, not in this kind of world.

503
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:49,689
We must install an engine and take off.

504
00:50:50,512 --> 00:50:52,015
Figures.

505
00:50:53,012 --> 00:50:55,010
You should be that engine.

506
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:57,620
You see,

507
00:50:59,093 --> 00:51:01,851
I'm trying to start the engine,

508
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:04,843
but there isn't enough fuel.

509
00:51:05,372 --> 00:51:07,354
It won't start properly.

510
00:51:07,637 --> 00:51:10,598
An amateur like Choi Yeon-soo
is after some random people,

511
00:51:10,677 --> 00:51:13,189
for being what she is.

512
00:51:14,466 --> 00:51:17,518
It must be frustrating
to fill the tank.

513
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,071
The wind is about
to overturn the ship.

514
00:51:22,592 --> 00:51:25,025
If we stop the ship for how wasteful

515
00:51:25,104 --> 00:51:26,359
the sailors are with gas,

516
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:29,824
all of us will die
in that ship called Korea.

517
00:51:31,357 --> 00:51:33,786
Will you give up on the
ship over a single rock?

518
00:51:35,988 --> 00:51:39,011
Do you have any ideas?

519
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:42,696
I'll be looking forward to reading
a nice article soon.

520
00:51:44,356 --> 00:51:45,380
Well, well.

521
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:49,247
I see you are hiding
something again.

522
00:51:50,504 --> 00:51:51,495
Mr. Im.

523
00:51:52,024 --> 00:51:54,271
Just fill the gas tank.

524
00:51:54,552 --> 00:51:55,544
Then I will

525
00:51:57,098 --> 00:51:59,795
show you how good I am at sailing.

526
00:51:59,874 --> 00:52:01,145
Shush.

527
00:52:04,963 --> 00:52:06,483
Cheers to the future

528
00:52:07,244 --> 00:52:08,236
of Korea.

529
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:13,966
What's with Do Young-geol?

530
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:17,671
You said I shouldn't leave him be. Why?

531
00:52:22,926 --> 00:52:25,871
The NIS put him there
to spy on you.

532
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:26,908
Why?

533
00:52:26,988 --> 00:52:28,755
Why would they want to spy on me?

534
00:52:31,966 --> 00:52:33,502
Can't you stop here?

535
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:35,358
What?

536
00:52:35,437 --> 00:52:37,058
Let's just live like before.

537
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:38,212
Tell me.

538
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:40,972
Why would they spy on me?

539
00:52:44,047 --> 00:52:46,839
Who is the guy that you fought against
with a gun?

540
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,096
What did Go Yoon-joo try to tell me?

541
00:52:50,425 --> 00:52:52,705
What on earth is it that you know?

542
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,267
To me,

543
00:53:01,732 --> 00:53:02,855
my family is everything.

544
00:53:09,298 --> 00:53:10,290
Lee Suk-gyu.

545
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,088
You're still only a spy.

546
00:53:16,635 --> 00:53:17,659
No.

547
00:53:19,877 --> 00:53:21,317
Lee Suk-gyu died after meeting you.

548
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,412
No, Han Jung-hyun died yesterday.

549
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:26,500
My husband and the kids' dad,
Han Jung-hyun died.

It's good to see you. I'm Choi Yeon-soo.

741
01:06:28,013 --> 01:06:30,259
Im Hyung-rak is behind Park Won-jong?

742
01:06:30,339 --> 01:06:31,830
If this information is true,

743
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:34,888
Im Hyung-rak is the mastermind
of Cha Min-ho and Kim Myung-jae's cases.

744
01:06:34,967 --> 01:06:37,758
Do you have evidence
to prove their relationship?

745
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:39,280
I will find it soon.

746
01:06:40,321 --> 01:06:41,575

01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:24,801
It's 100 million dollars in total.

01:07:25,238 --> 01:07:26,492
Good work.

It's top-class chocolate from Switzerland.

01:07:40,381 --> 01:07:41,412
How do you like its taste?

760
01:07:43,597 --> 01:07:44,604
It's bitter.

761

What a mess.

766
01:08:23,774 --> 01:08:24,797
I'm sorry.

767
01:08:24,878 --> 01:08:26,336
I sent you to the CIO
to handle the nuisance,

768
01:08:26,415 --> 01:08:27,901
and you became a nuisance yourself.

Lee Suk-gyu and Choi Yeon-soo

770
01:08:31,424 --> 01:08:33,192
have been behaving strangely.

771
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:37,485
I'm checking if Lee Suk-gyu
has an ulterior motive.

772
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:40,093
If he goes up to her and runs his mouth,

773
01:08:40,627 --> 01:08:41,716
it won't be good at all.

774
01:08:42,675 --> 01:08:45,466
Please take us off the wanted list first.

775
01:08:45,901 --> 01:08:48,180
We will handle the nuisance somehow.

776
01:08:48,836 --> 01:08:50,092

780
01:08:58,342 --> 01:08:59,861
It's been tough for us.

781
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:17,611
Take this.

782
01:09:17,891 --> 01:09:19,349
I hope you aren't starving yourself.

783
01:09:19,428 --> 01:09:20,700

Shut up if you want to save yourself.

Oh, my.

788
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:33,920
Your eyes look wild with all that hunger.

789
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,191
Stay low for the time being.

790
01:09:44,233 --> 01:09:45,472
Thank you, sir.

791
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:48,777
By the way,

792
01:09:49,803 --> 01:09:51,339
when will I be reinstated...

793
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:55,850

801
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:54,879
You got something to tell me?

802

This isn't like you.

803
