(All places, characters, companies,)

4
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:18,681
(and incidents in this
drama are fictitious.)

5
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:21,291
I'm Choi Yeon-soo, Director of the CIO.

6
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:24,306
We'd like to make a statement

7
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:26,406
regarding the alleged bribery

8
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:30,313
that occurred right before
the last presidential election.

9
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:32,822
We, the CIO, will devote all our might

10
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:36,713
to finding the briber,
the cause of this incident.

11
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:38,481
In order to do so,

12
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,830
we ask Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office

13
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:46,372
to immediately return
the list and pieces of evidence

14
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:47,746
according to the CIO law.

15
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:48,780
(Urgent press conference)

16
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:50,596
<i>If they refuse to return these items,</i>

17
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:53,496
<i>the CIO will have no choice</i>

18
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:56,030
<i>but to take extraordinary measures.</i>

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,222
Extraordinary measures?

20
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,013
She's obviously bluffing.

21
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:08,596
Her face always shows what she's up to.

22
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:11,092
Are you keeping the evidence well?

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,113
We'll restore the authority

24
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:15,030
taken away by the CIO.

25
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:17,880
I should get going.

26
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,996
Make a conclusion that the money

27
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:24,563
Kim Myung-jae received
went to the President.

28
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:27,951
Then the National Assembly
will call for his impeachment.

29
00:01:57,147 --> 00:01:58,163
(Director Choi Yeon-soo)

30
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:06,930
You may go now.

31
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:08,230
Director Choi.

32
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:09,530
Are you serious?

33
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:10,813
Yes.

34
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,946
This has never happened
in the history of Korea.

35
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:16,480
- I know.
- Director Choi.

36
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:18,989
What if the prosecution counterattacks us?

37
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:21,213
Then we'll fight them.

38
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,240
Can you really handle it?

39
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:26,689
You still don't know me well, Mr. Choo.

40
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,030
I'm a good fighter.

41
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:31,306
Should we bring handcuffs just in case?

42
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,381
Yes.

43
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:39,096
(CIO)

44
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:13,613
Darn it.

50
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:07,068
Excuse me sir.

51
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:08,446
Wait there.

52
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:12,798
Sir.

53
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:16,397
Sir!

54
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,681
Hey!

55
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:22,464
Stop there! Hey!

56
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:26,913
Hey, stop!

57
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:28,730
Stop!

58
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,031
Stop!

59
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:34,114
Stop!

60
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,296
Go this way. Hurry.

61
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,897
(Clothing bin)

62
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:03,587
Freeze. We'll shoot you if you move.

63

(Episode 9)

64
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:35,706
There's a car coming. Isn't it that one?

65
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,546
Yes, I think it is.

66
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,442
Mr. Choo. What do we do?

67
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:44,714
(Director Choi Yeon-soo)

68
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:48,580
Director Choi.

69
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:49,854
<i>We're here.</i>

70
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:52,163
Arrest him.

71
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:53,430
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:06:58,797 --> 00:06:59,797
Let's go.

73
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:04,964
Good work.

74
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:08,380
Hello, Mr. Gwak.

75
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:13,681
Mr. Choo.

76
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,107
What brings you here at this hour?

77
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,222
You're under arrest
for obstructing justice,

78
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:20,977
and destroying and concealing evidence.

79
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:25,431
Hey.

80
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,156
What do you think you're doing?

81
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,422
You have the right to an attorney,

82
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:30,476
- and to remain silent--
- Hey, Choo Dong-woo!

83
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:32,846
I'm under arrest?

84
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:35,122
You must be out of your mind.

85
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:36,197
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,061
I'll do what I believe is right.

87
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:42,881
Arrest him.

88
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,431
Hey.

89
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,258
You think you can get away with this?

90
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,633
As you know very well,

91
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,756
you can defend yourself,
and ask to review

92
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:53,089
the legality of your arrest.
Please come with us.

93
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:54,946
Hey, let go of me!

94
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:59,046
Choo Dong-woo. I obstructed
justice and destroyed evidence?

95
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:00,613
You jerk.

96
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,356
Let's go and talk,

97
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:04,480
or something unpleasant could happen.

98
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:05,989
Please come with us.

99
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:07,789
Can you take responsibility for this?

100
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,322
You'll have to, you son of a gun!

101
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:10,877
Be ready to hand in your resignation!

102
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:22,947
Gosh.

103
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:31,999
<i>Choi Yeon-soo!</i>

104
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,314
What is all this?

105
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:39,494
What do you think you're doing?

106
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,634
I'm the chief prosecutor!

107
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,780
Hey. Hey!

108
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:49,319
Hey.

109
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,163
I destroyed the evidence?

110
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:53,657
How can you call yourself an attorney?

111
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,580
Listen, Suspect Gwak Moon-heum.

112
00:08:57,347 --> 00:08:58,789
In order to protect the President,

113
00:08:58,864 --> 00:09:01,033
you ignored the law and the procedures,

114
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,372
and gave an order
to seize the evidence. Is that true?

115
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,171
What? Suspect?

116
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:14,730
Why don't you just become a writer?

117
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,830
I bet you can become a best-selling one.

118
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:21,356
The prosecution seized the evidence
that belonged to the CIO

119
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:22,656
to obstruct the investigation

120
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,651
into the President,
which is CIO's authority.

121
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:25,727
Do you admit the charge?

122
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:28,613
We followed the procedures.

123
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:31,889
We needed the evidence to find the briber.

124
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:34,631
That's outside your authority.

125
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:38,146
You've already confessed to the crime.

126
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,413
You said you're
responsible for all of this.

127
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,513
You're driving me crazy.

128
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,143
When did I?

129
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:49,647
You think I'm crazy?

130
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:56,022
<i>Was it the prosecutor general's order</i>

131
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:58,380
<i>to take over the evidence from the CIO?</i>

132
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:01,413
<i>No. It was my order.</i>

133
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:04,496
You're driving me crazy.

134
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,256
Hey. Is this a confession?

135
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:08,539
You were arrested without a warrant,

136
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:11,289
so a warrant has to be issued
within 48 hours.

137
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:12,913
Let me see.

138
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,246
We have 46 hours left.

139
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:26,796
(Police)

140
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:43,147
(Unknown number)

141
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,606
Can a murderer's wife

142
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:47,537
be Director of the CIO?

143
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,746
No.

144
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,509
That crazy jerk.

145
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:53,880
He ruined his wife's career.

146
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,030
Pay the psycho

147
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:57,886
the rest.

148
00:10:58,247 --> 00:10:59,247
Yes, sir.

149
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:03,896
Now you can get rid of both Han and Choi.

150
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,496
You're incredible, Mr. Do.

151
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,646
No one

152
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:13,113
must know about this.

153
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:16,927
Stand by in front of the police station

154
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:18,351
until everything gets settled.

155
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:19,797
Yes, sir.

156
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,431
(Dad)

157
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:25,672
<i>This phone is turned off.</i>

158
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:28,796
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

159
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,080
<i>After the beep...</i>

160
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,566
Dad's phone is turned off.

161
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,563
Why don't you answer your phone, Dad?

162
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,379
Dad.

163
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,446
What's going on?

164
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:51,937
25L 9754, Musso.

165
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,505
A man with blood on his face.

166
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,846
He drove that car and ran away.

167
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,980
Why did you run away?

168
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,946
I didn't run away. I was chasing that car.

169
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:03,652
When will the forensics team get here?

170
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:05,026
- They'll be here soon.
- Okay.

171
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,166
- Is this him?
- Yes, sir.

172
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,743
25L 9754. Musso. Track down the car.

173
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:15,996
He was hurt in the face and was wearing
a bloodstained jacket. He's the culprit.

174
00:12:17,014 --> 00:12:17,780
Have you checked it?

175
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:18,813
Hey.

176
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:20,096
Just a second.

177
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:24,014
Where's his ID card?

178
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,496
Well, he doesn't have it.

179
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:27,983
He doesn't?

180
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,643
What about his phone?

181
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:31,913
He doesn't have anything.

182
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:44,956
(25L 9754)

183
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,813
(23D 4118)

184
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,746
There's no car with the
plate number 25L 9754.

185
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,439
Guys. what on earth have you been doing?

186
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:07,614
What's your name?

187
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:09,680
Your name.

I'm Choi Yeon-soo.

I'm Han Jung-hyun.

191
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:20,663
This don't do.

192
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,511
Get his fingerprints,
and check his police records.

193
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,830
Mister, won't you really
want to tell us your name?

194
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:30,163
Lee Suk-gyu.

195
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:33,231
What?

196
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:39,614
My name

197
00:13:40,397 --> 00:13:41,413
is Lee Suk-gyu.

198
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,996
Lee Suk-gyu.

199
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:48,046
Lee Suk-gyu?

200
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:51,130
- Yes.
- He says he's Lee Suk-gyu.

201
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:52,647
Check that name.

202
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,637
Lee Suk-gyu. Your social security number?

203
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,296

(Uijeongbu Police Station)

206
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:09,239
Mr. Do, the police did a background
check on Lee Suk-gyu just now.

207
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:10,863
What are you saying?

208
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,680
Isn't that Han Jung-hyun's real name?

209
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:14,406
They think Lee is the suspected murderer.

210
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,263
They checked his social
security number too.

211
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:20,363
Gosh, that crazy jerk.

212
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:22,180
Yes, it's him.

213
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:23,931
He's Lee Suk-gyu.

214
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Is he?

215
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:26,874
Take him to the station then.

216
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:28,530
Give me your hands.

217
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:41,831

Mr. Lee Man-ho likes
peanut-flavored jawbreakers.

227
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:04,779

230
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:11,331
That can't be true.

231
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:15,730
My dad said Mr. Lee is very sick.

232
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,030
Bring the evidence back.

233
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:38,113
No way.

Do whatever you want.

Are you threatening me?

238
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,563
It's a piece of advice.

239
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:00,847
Goodnight.

240

Hey, Choi Yeon-soo.

241
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:05,856
You think anything will change
if you lock me up for 48 hours?

242
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,014

you're finished!

00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:53,797
Hey!

248
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:57,284
Mister!

249

Hey, let go of me!

250

You won't get away with this!

251
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:15,546
The suspect ran away.

252
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,431
- Gosh.
- Now what?

253
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,089

We spoon-fed them.

259

Gosh, those idiots.

260
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:36,764
What do we do?

261
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:40,896
You know what to do.
Hurry up and find him. Go!

00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:53,913
I don't know. Didn't you talk to him?

266
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:55,447
No, I didn't.

267

268

He's in a bad mood.

269

he'd be back by seven.

- Yes.

277

I don't know. He lied to me.

278

He lied. He lied to me.

280
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:44,556
No. I'm sure he had urgent business.

281

Why would he lie to you?

282
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:49,271
He lied. He lied to me.

283
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:50,980
Dad lied to me.

It doesn't matter what his name is.

If he gets arrested,

299
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:34,318

373
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:12,380
Gosh.

374
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:06,336
Oh, boy.

375
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:29,146
Goodness.

376
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:31,905
I can't believe
I'm carpooling with you to work.

377
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:36,051
Have you checked?

378
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:38,413
Oh, there's nothing.

379
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:40,486
There as no reported accident

380
00:32:40,562 --> 00:32:42,713
under the name of Han Jung-hyun
in the capital area.

381
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,189
No unidentified victims either.

382
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:46,764
Do you want me to check stations
around the nation?

383
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:49,096
No, it's fine. Thank you.

384
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:54,230
Gwak Moon-heum still refuses
to admit to the charges.

385
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:58,013
I expected it. Leave him alone.
It'll only distress him.

386
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:01,756
Oh, right. And something
serious is happening

387
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:03,630
in front of the CIO now.

388
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:05,414
Something serious?

389
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:10,263
Some prosecutors are camping out
in front of our office.

390
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,291
"Prosecutors block
the entrance to the CIO."

391
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,643
My goodness.

392
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:40,089
Let's go to the underground parking lot.

393
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:41,164
- Mister--
- No.

394
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:43,113
I'll just get off here.

395
00:33:43,197 --> 00:33:44,230
Ms. Choi.

396
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:46,763
You could be humiliated.

397
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:57,372
It's Choi Yeon-soo!

398
00:33:57,447 --> 00:33:58,996
- Director Choi!
- Please wait!

399
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:01,797
Take photos!

400
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:08,389
All right. I'll listen to you first.

401
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:11,263
Ms. Choi Yeon-soo, you're under
arrest for abusing your authority.

402
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:14,006
You have the right to an attorney,

403
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:15,189
and to defend yourself--

404
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,896
Prosecutors Ryu Sung-hyun and Park Jun-suk.

405
00:34:18,507 --> 00:34:20,071
I've wanted to meet you.

406
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:23,406
Did Prosecutor Gwak Moon-heum tell you

407
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:26,330
to barge into the CIO
and seize the evidence?

408
00:34:27,705 --> 00:34:28,970
What are you doing? Arrest her.

409
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,446
Prosecutor Kon Soon-chun.

410
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:32,783
Are you the leader of this group?

411
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:35,422
I'm kind of disappointed.

412
00:34:35,497 --> 00:34:38,384
Isn't Mr. Jeon Hong-go from the SCPO here?

413
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:47,296
You memorized all my men's names.

414
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,917
You must have
a lot of time on your hands.

415
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,344
It's almost nine,
but you're camping out here

416
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:54,946
instead of working in your offices.

417
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:57,325
You're not in the position to say that.

418
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,972
You're under arrest for
abusing your authority.

419
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:02,489
Let's see if I abused my authority.

420
00:35:02,564 --> 00:35:04,346
Should I make an announcement

421
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:07,023
of Mr. Gwak Moon-heum's charges

422
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:09,407
in front of the reporters here?

423
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:14,546
Can you take responsibility for that?

424
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:17,739
Kon Soon-chun, Park Jun-suk,
and Ryu Sung-hyun.

425
00:35:17,814 --> 00:35:19,556
You got an order from Gwak

426
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:21,663
and illegally seized the evidence.

427
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:23,906
I can arrest you three too.

428
00:35:23,981 --> 00:35:25,722
We only did our duty.

429
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:26,797
Your duty.

430
00:35:28,553 --> 00:35:32,606
Is it your duty to obstruct us
in the course of our duty?

431
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:34,463
Please don't do this.

432
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:43,072
Many prosecutors are working hard
in their offices right now.

433
00:35:43,147 --> 00:35:44,606
Don't be a disgrace to them.

434
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:46,213
Just go back to your offices.

435
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:49,764
Get out of the way.

436
00:36:00,652 --> 00:36:01,652
Please step aside.

437
00:36:03,847 --> 00:36:06,130
Excuse us. Please let us through.

438
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:23,138
(Yeoyeong Inn)

439
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:31,806
Go that way.

440
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:44,372
Mr. Do!

441
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,213
- What?
- He's here.

442
00:36:56,656 --> 00:36:57,864
Look around the area.

443
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:58,939
Yes, sir.

444
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:22,171
Lee Suk-gyu. Darn it.

445
00:37:24,218 --> 00:37:26,767
Mr. Do. There's something you need to see.

446
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:41,697
(Siheung, Gangju, Haseong, Yeongdeungpo)

447
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:45,738
Gosh, this jerk

448
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:47,788
is a crazy pervert.

449
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:52,155
He has collected the pictures
of the people he killed.

450
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,321
Is it fortunate for that punk Lee Suk-gyu?

451
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,571
Or for us?

452
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:01,905
What should we do with him?

453
00:38:04,256 --> 00:38:06,538
(Documents, Videos, Pictures)

454
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:09,838
Do you have VXL in the car?

455
00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:12,185
Are you going to kill him?

456
00:38:12,261 --> 00:38:14,026
I'm asking you a question.

457
00:38:37,422 --> 00:38:38,921
Who are you?

458
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,773
So you punk,

459
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:43,332
why did you have to take darn pictures

460
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,856
after killing people?

461
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:47,581
Hey, you punk.

462
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:49,820
Stay still. I'm asking who you are.

463
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,622
(Low battery)

464
00:38:55,406 --> 00:38:57,671
- Goodness.
- Stay still, you punk.

465
00:38:57,746 --> 00:38:59,131
- Gosh, please.
- Darn.

466
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:00,738
- Hey!
- Darn you.

467
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:16,888
(Low battery)

468
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,755
(Low battery)

469
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:24,355
No...

470
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:17,705
Let's go.

471
00:41:24,772 --> 00:41:25,859
Okay.

472
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:27,700
Thank you. Goodbye. Please come again.

473
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:29,089
Goodbye.

474
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:33,971
Seung-goo.

475
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:52,638
Seung-goo. I know you were very worried.

476
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:57,506
Seung-goo.

477
00:41:57,871 --> 00:41:58,871
I...

478
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:01,131
"The volunteer guy didn't come today."

479
00:42:02,828 --> 00:42:05,111
"I can't identify the
patient on the phone."

480
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,564
Did you call the hospital?

481
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:10,997
Parents' Love Nursing Hospital.

482
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:13,105
Its phone number is 031 5989 9321.

483
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,064
You didn't go to the hospital.

484
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:17,623
Lying is bad.

485
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:20,123
Seung-goo.

486
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:21,834
I...

487
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,947
Eunhye Hardware, Euijung-ro 99-gil.

488
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:26,647
A right turn at Shagal Chicken.

489
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:29,038
But you made a left turn.

490
00:42:30,072 --> 00:42:31,072
Seung-goo.

491
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:34,982
"I'll make sure to come back by 7 p.m.

492
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:37,471
I promise."

493
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:44,203
I'm sorry. Seung-goo.

494
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:49,654
What's wrong, Dad?

495
00:42:50,472 --> 00:42:51,414
It's like after you stayed up all night

496
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:52,849
when baby Seung-mi had a fever.

497
00:42:55,194 --> 00:42:56,355
I...

498
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,208
Mr. Lee Man-ho

499
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:01,585
passed away to months ago.

500
00:43:02,756 --> 00:43:05,255
But you went to the hospital
because he was sick.

501
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:11,004
The candy old man

502
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,420
passed away two months ago.

503
00:43:22,748 --> 00:43:24,530
I'm really sorry.

504
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:26,521
I'm sorry.

505
00:43:30,906 --> 00:43:32,405
Don't cry.

506
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:36,721
Right.

507
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,571
If you cry, Santa won't give you a gift.

508
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:48,255
Right.

509
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:50,788
Right, Seung-goo.

510
00:43:52,322 --> 00:43:53,338
I'm not crying.

511
00:43:53,622 --> 00:43:56,581
Andropause causes a man
to lose energy and have mood sings,

512
00:43:56,656 --> 00:43:58,721
such as crying often.

513
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,305
That's not it, punk.

514
00:44:05,972 --> 00:44:08,254
Mom didn't sleep and waited too.

515
00:44:12,106 --> 00:44:13,871
Does she know

516
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:16,096
that I didn't go to the hospital?

517
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:20,005
Tattling is bad.

518
00:44:22,822 --> 00:44:24,855
Seung-mi would cry if I tattled on you.

519
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:04,934
Here's the DNA test result.

520
00:45:10,422 --> 00:45:12,131
(Test Details)

521
00:45:12,206 --> 00:45:14,221
(DNA 1 and DNA 2 are
confirmed to be a match)

522
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,231
So the owner of Yeoyeong Inn
killed the homeless guy.

523
00:45:20,306 --> 00:45:22,605
And this is the crucial evidence.

524
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:26,922
What?

525
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:29,067
<i>You son of a gun.</i>

526
00:45:30,256 --> 00:45:31,464
He filmed this video?

527
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:33,388
What a lunatic.

528
00:45:33,572 --> 00:45:35,739
And this.

529
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:38,011
This, and this.

530
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:40,697
He collected photos of murdered victims,

531
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:42,738
which add up to at least
five unresolved cases.

532
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:46,355
(Mr. Park Won-jong)

533
00:45:48,172 --> 00:45:49,421
I need to take this call.

534
00:45:49,689 --> 00:45:50,689
Sure.

535
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,105
What's the occasion. Mr. Park?

536
00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:03,722
Where?

537
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:05,390
Eunajang Inn?

538
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:08,443
How did you know?

539
00:46:10,672 --> 00:46:11,705
Who?

540
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:14,805
Lee Suk-gyu?

541
00:46:18,656 --> 00:46:21,221
(Report on Eunajang Inn Murder Case)

542
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:25,821
Please continue.

543
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:27,475
Yes, sir.

544
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:29,122
That's right.

545
00:46:30,114 --> 00:46:31,913
Our agent could've confused

546
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,021
to the police investigation
in the process.

547
00:46:36,072 --> 00:46:38,606
Yes, Lee Suk-gyu is one of us.

548
00:46:43,172 --> 00:46:44,172
Yes, of course.

549
00:46:44,706 --> 00:46:46,971
Your team can take all the credit.

550
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,647
Don't worry about that.

551
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:54,561
Okay. I'll count on you then.

552
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:56,939
Bye.

553
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:04,055
I didn't think Lee Suk-gyu
should be exposed.

554

(Defendant Won Bok-dong's Trial Records)

739
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,399
(Defendant Won Bok-dong's Trial Records)

740
00:59:39,016 --> 00:59:40,032
<i>Hey, Won Bok-dong.</i>

741
00:59:40,816 --> 00:59:42,582
You little rat.

742
00:59:42,766 --> 00:59:47,448
How dare a mere police officer
defy the prosecution?

743
00:59:47,949 --> 00:59:49,465
Eight years ago,

744
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:51,782
Sergeant Won

745
00:59:52,299 --> 00:59:55,074
suspected the chief
prosecutor of bribery,

746
00:59:55,149 --> 00:59:57,182
and investigated him.

747
00:59:57,949 --> 01:00:00,232
When the prosecution found out about it,

748
01:00:00,933 --> 01:00:04,790
they tried to take over the case
from the police by force.

749
01:00:04,866 --> 01:00:07,382
Where did you hide the pictures
and voice recording?

750
01:00:08,011 --> 01:00:10,294
Where did you hide them, you rat?

751
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,765
I know your intention.

752
01:00:14,283 --> 01:00:15,815
If I give you the evidence,

753
01:00:17,366 --> 01:00:18,882
you will bury it all.

754
01:00:20,633 --> 01:00:23,498
What are you trying to say?

755
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:26,241
Sergeant Won was certain
that the prosecution

756
01:00:26,316 --> 01:00:28,024
could try to cover for their man.

757
01:00:28,349 --> 01:00:30,398
He refused to hand over the case.

758
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,982
He pushed ahead with
the investigation alone.

759
01:00:34,766 --> 01:00:36,282
Then what did the prosecution do?

760
01:00:37,549 --> 01:00:39,539
So what? what did they do?

761
01:00:41,649 --> 01:00:43,091
You little...

762
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:45,108
Have you gone insane?

763
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,215
Have you, punk?

764
01:00:49,283 --> 01:00:51,758
You're a mere police officer.

765
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:53,274
Don't think you'll be
safe after hiding away

766
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,058
evidence requested by the prosecution.

767
01:00:55,133 --> 01:00:57,148
You won't be, you moron.

768
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:01,158
Until you ruin your career,
and even your life,

769
01:01:01,233 --> 01:01:06,065
I'll do everything I can
to harass you,

770
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,098
You may look forward to it.

771
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:11,408
I'm a Korean prosecutor.

772
01:01:11,483 --> 01:01:13,224
For destroying the evidence,

773
01:01:13,299 --> 01:01:15,024
and obstructing the investigation,

774
01:01:15,099 --> 01:01:17,608
you indicted him.

775
01:01:17,683 --> 01:01:21,732
He was imprisoned,
and even got fired

776
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:24,032
just because he did his job.

777
01:01:24,783 --> 01:01:26,098
<i>I will announce the ruling.</i>

778
01:01:26,553 --> 01:01:29,824
Defendant Won Bok-dong
is sentenced to two years in prison,

779
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:31,932
and five years of suspension.

780
01:01:38,816 --> 01:01:40,774
The charges of Sergeant Won who refused

781
01:01:40,849 --> 01:01:43,648
to submit the evidence
to the prosecution.

782
01:01:44,149 --> 01:01:46,541
The charges of Gwak Moon-heum

783
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:48,715
who robbed the evidence from the CIO.

784
01:01:51,866 --> 01:01:53,415
These two cases

785
01:01:53,966 --> 01:01:55,998
are too similar.

786
01:01:56,499 --> 01:01:58,191
And the charges are

787
01:01:58,266 --> 01:02:00,548
just perfect in juridical terms.

788
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,582
So we're going to attach this precedent

789
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:05,165
to the arrest warrant.

790
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:10,441
- Good work.
- You too.

791
01:02:10,516 --> 01:02:11,458
It's okay.

792
01:02:11,533 --> 01:02:12,533
Bok-dong...

793
01:02:13,049 --> 01:02:14,049
I'll see you later, son.

794
01:02:15,066 --> 01:02:16,508
Thank you.

795
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:18,524
You never disappoint, sir.

796
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:20,632
Hey, don't flatter me too much.

797
01:02:30,609 --> 01:02:31,641
Hold on.

798
01:02:31,716 --> 01:02:34,782
Do you remember now, Prosecutor Gwak?

799
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,091
(Ruling)

800
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:40,091
Figures.

801
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,374
(Defendant: Won Bok-dong)

802
01:02:41,449 --> 01:02:44,208
You were the prosecutor in charge

803
01:02:44,283 --> 01:02:45,741
who came up with that perfect logic.

804
01:02:45,816 --> 01:02:47,598
I bet you remember.

805
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:50,916
I'll go.

806
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:04,515
Hey, Choi Yeon-soo.

807
01:03:05,966 --> 01:03:08,626
You had me locked up in here,
looking for this precedent?

808
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:09,798
No.

809
01:03:13,399 --> 01:03:15,665
At that time, Sergeant Won's family

810
01:03:16,848 --> 01:03:19,647
came and asked me to defend him.

811
01:03:19,816 --> 01:03:20,832
What...

812
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:26,182
(Attorney Request)

813
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:28,232
(Attorney Choi Yeon-soo)

814
01:03:30,016 --> 01:03:33,615
Because he killed himself,

815
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:36,230
it fell through.

816
01:03:43,899 --> 01:03:46,698
Your logic from eight years ago.

817
01:03:48,966 --> 01:03:50,765
Can you beat this?

818
01:03:57,245 --> 01:03:58,511
This is your last chance.

819
01:04:52,866 --> 01:04:54,132
Mr. Jeon.

820
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:55,948
It's me.

821
01:04:56,466 --> 01:04:57,466
<i>Where are you?</i>

822
01:05:01,049 --> 01:05:02,315
<i>Okay.</i>

(Reception, private meeting room)

825
01:05:17,116 --> 01:05:19,148
They returned every piece of evidence.

826
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,358
Good.

827
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:22,748
Send Mr. Gwak home now.

Gosh, that brat.

834
01:05:46,866 --> 01:05:48,524
She literally wrote a love letter

835
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,115
to have a meal with me.

836
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,273

01:06:04,683 --> 01:06:05,965
(Min Sang-a)

838
01:06:18,983 --> 01:06:19,983
Come in.

839
01:06:21,766 --> 01:06:23,241
Welcome, Mr. Gwak.

840
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:24,316
Have a seat.

841
01:06:28,633 --> 01:06:29,648
This is

842
01:06:30,433 --> 01:06:32,498
Executive Director
Im Hyung-rak of the NIS.

843
01:06:33,549 --> 01:06:34,549
Mr. Im.

844
01:06:35,796 --> 01:06:37,078
This is Chief Prosecutor Gwak.

845
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:38,814
We're in the same boat now,

846
01:06:38,889 --> 01:06:39,998
so I've called him over.

847
01:06:41,299 --> 01:06:42,448
It's nice to meet you.

848
01:06:48,449 --> 01:06:50,198
I didn't know we'd have company.

849
01:06:57,383 --> 01:06:58,398
Mr. Im.

850
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:00,182
From what I heard,

851
01:07:00,949 --> 01:07:03,248
This guy went through a lot.

852
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:07,098
I guess he underestimated Choi Yeon-soo.

853
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,841
He's going to get his revenge soon.

854
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:11,682
Sir, let's not talk about it.

855
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:13,309
You need to get your revenge soon.

856
01:07:13,483 --> 01:07:15,515
Of course, I will.

857
01:07:16,316 --> 01:07:18,365
Good. It's okay.

858
01:07:18,899 --> 01:07:21,408
Once you put your mind
to it, Choi Yeon-soo--

859
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:22,832
This isn't a joke.

860
01:07:25,316 --> 01:07:27,098
To save yourself,

861
01:07:27,383 --> 01:07:29,932
You gave the evidence to Choi Yeon-soo.

862
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:31,932
No you'll do what?

863
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,441
Watch what you say to a stranger.

864
01:07:35,516 --> 01:07:38,774
You're just whining after
letting Choi Yeon-soo get you.

865
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:40,382
Come on, Mr. Im.

866
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:43,732
I'm only encouraging him
to do better next time--

867
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,265
We're standing

868
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:48,798
in the middle of a battlefield.

869
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,865
There is no second chance.

870
01:07:52,633 --> 01:07:53,633
My gosh.

871
01:07:54,899 --> 01:07:57,465
I was going to be patient
for Mr. Yoo's sake,

872
01:07:58,233 --> 01:08:00,208
but Mr. Im, you've
dedicated your whole life

873
01:08:00,283 --> 01:08:02,082
to the country.

874
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:04,824
I'll keep my eyes on you.

875
01:08:04,899 --> 01:08:08,465
You have three children
in times like these.

876
01:08:09,233 --> 01:08:10,732
I must say you're more of a patriot.

877
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:13,782
Mr. Gwak.

878
01:08:14,316 --> 01:08:15,848
I thought you had two daughters.

879
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:20,189
I heard you recently held
the first birthday party for your son.

880
01:08:20,999 --> 01:08:22,282
Just go look after him.

881
01:08:22,816 --> 01:08:24,831
That's what you can do for the country.

882
01:08:29,716 --> 01:08:32,748
Come on. You shouldn't leave like this.

883
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:39,132
Mr. Gwak.

884
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,965
What's the sudden occasion?

885
01:08:51,765 --> 01:08:53,565
Did you read my love letter?

886
01:08:54,349 --> 01:08:56,898
Can you stop asking questions?

887
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:00,215
Okay.

888
01:09:00,999 --> 01:09:02,532
I won't ask any questions.

889
01:09:04,346 --> 01:09:05,639
Still,

890
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:08,432
I liked what you asked Gwak Moon-heum

891
01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:10,232
at the press conference.

892
01:09:11,783 --> 01:09:12,724
Why?

893
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:13,799
Darn.

894
01:09:14,599 --> 01:09:16,041
Okay, you brat.

895
01:09:16,116 --> 01:09:18,165
No questions.

896
01:09:23,566 --> 01:09:25,689
Their soup hasn't changed at all.

897
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:31,798
What happened to Mr. Kim.

898
01:09:33,116 --> 01:09:34,398
It's not your fault.

899
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:35,948
Nor is it your responsibility.

900
01:09:40,116 --> 01:09:42,132
Goodness, this won't do.

901
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:45,108
Excuse me. Give us a bottle of soju.

902
01:09:45,183 --> 01:09:46,198
Okay.

903
01:10:03,965 --> 01:10:05,731
(24 Hours Convenience Store)

904
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:36,781
I saw you leave earlier and waited.

905
01:10:38,832 --> 01:10:40,114
What are you doing here?

906
01:10:44,998 --> 01:10:46,281
Are you happy?

907
01:10:49,148 --> 01:10:52,714
You gave up your name,
your life, everything.

908
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:57,297
You hid it all for 29 years.

909
01:11:00,132 --> 01:11:01,414
Are you happy?

910
01:11:04,982 --> 01:11:06,514
Happy?

911
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:14,197
You should let it all out.

912
01:11:16,498 --> 01:11:17,997
Because I'm going to.

913
01:11:21,332 --> 01:11:23,364
I want to be free now.

914
01:11:24,524 --> 01:11:25,607
Yoon-joo.

915
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:26,864
Do you remember?

916
01:11:29,315 --> 01:11:30,581
That night.

917
01:11:35,715 --> 01:11:36,715
Don't go.

918
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,181
Perhaps,

919
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:47,215
we...

920
01:12:00,515 --> 01:12:02,031
Then maybe,

921
01:12:03,582 --> 01:12:04,782
I...

922
01:12:13,048 --> 01:12:14,531
Yoon-joo.

923
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:27,831
Your mom is unbelievable.

924
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,306
Guess what I said.

925
01:12:30,382 --> 01:12:31,382
What?

926
01:12:32,232 --> 01:12:34,140
I said, "He's obedient to you,

927
01:12:34,215 --> 01:12:35,731
so you can live with him."

928
01:12:38,032 --> 01:12:39,797
It's ancient history.

929
01:12:41,598 --> 01:12:42,864
Wait, isn't that...

930
01:12:47,248 --> 01:12:48,764
What?

931
01:12:58,532 --> 01:13:00,647
You...

932
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:06,897
You liked me too.

933
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:14,897
Without Choi Yeon-soo,

934
01:13:16,732 --> 01:13:18,031
things could have

935
01:13:20,098 --> 01:13:21,864
worked out between us.

936
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,847
What on earth?
