Director Choi.

6
00:01:56,357 --> 00:01:57,357
Hello.

7
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,906
It's nice to meet you.

8
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:02,847
I'm in charge of the CIO's Security Team.

9
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,673
My name is Do Young-geol.

10
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:09,889
I see. Mr. Do Young-geol.

11
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,060
I heard you were the best agent

12
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,673
on the security team of the NIS.

13
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:19,757
I feel reassured knowing
that you'll help me.

14
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:21,789
I'm honored to work for you.

15
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Excuse me, sir.

16
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:28,807
How can I help you?

17
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,810
I'm looking forward to working with you.

18
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,906
- Well...
- Me too.

19
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,739
I'm here to meet Mr. Bae Goo-taek.

20
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,573
Oh, I see.

21
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:57,756
- Hello, Mr. Do.
- Get back to work.

22
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:01,639
You look good in a suit, Mr. Do.

23
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,523
Jeez, I can't believe I'm doing this.

24
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,954
- What do I need to see?
- This one, right here.

25
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:20,977
You, the secretariat,
will handle the cases

26
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:24,156
that departments one, two, and three

27
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:25,910
are reluctant to handle,

28
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,856
or the cases that are
ambiguous or ignored.

29
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:30,060
Mr. Choo.

30
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,406
Join the CIO.

31
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:34,507
You're surprised.

32
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:37,406
Were you going to rot in that small town?

33
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:41,006
I need a justification to promote you.

34
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,307
Pretend to give in,

35
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:44,874
and join the CIO.

36
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:46,974
We, the prosecution,

37
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:48,727
need to know what's on their mind

38
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,356
to avoid embarrassing situations.

39
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,456
Right. We need to help each other.

40
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,773
"Help each other"? I like that.

41
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:56,839
Thank you.

42
00:03:57,907 --> 00:03:58,923
Work there

43
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:03,089
until the prosecution
regains its stability,

44
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:05,056
and return in glory.

45
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:07,944
Mr. Choo.

46
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:10,089
Is there any case you want to investigate?

47
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:13,739
No.

48
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,289
Let me know anytime if there are any.

49
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,589
Let's wrap it up for today.

50
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:19,857
<font color="#ffff00">CIO</font>

51
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:21,994
What's wrong with you, Mr. Jeong?

52
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:23,177
Did you not sleep well?

53
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:24,257
No.

54
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,839
I had some work to do.

55
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:27,827
I asked him to do something.

56
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:29,123
No, I'm doing it

57
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,739
because I'm curious about it.

58
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:32,944
What are you working on?

59
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,056
Oh.

60
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,294
I need to restore a hard drive.

61
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:37,610
It's called digital forensics.

62
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,206
It takes a long time.

63
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:40,724
Digital forensics?

64
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,140
Yes.

65
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,574
Oh, right.

66
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:46,139
You also know about the Cha Min-ho case.

67
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:50,523
No, I don't.

68
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,606
You don't know Mr. Cha Min-ho?

69
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:56,377
If it doesn't involve
high-ranking officials.

70
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:59,016
It's not appropriate to talk about it here.

71
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,239
Right.

72
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:07,789
You have a point.

73
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,057
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:10,623
Let's talk about it after work.

75
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:11,907
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:20,344
He talked about it just briefly.

77
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:23,456
Why is he so touchy? Goodness.

78
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,977
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

79
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,856
No, I'm the one who should apologize.

80
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,377
Take your time. Take care of yourself too.

81
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,457
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:43,804
Oh, celebratory rice cakes?

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,949
Ms. Choi and you are meant to be.

84
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:50,574
Mr. Bae.

85
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:52,813
Please take good care of her.

86
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:54,359
Don't worry.

87
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:58,889
Do you want to see your wife for a moment?

88
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:01,410
No, I'd better just go.

89
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,460
No wonder.

90
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,106
She gets embarrassed
about things like this.

91
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,139
Thank you for the rice cakes.

92
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:08,924
- Mr. Bae.
- Yes?

93
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,177
May I use the restroom?

94
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:11,257
The restroom?

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,106
It's over there. Oh, wait.

96
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,713
Is it okay for him to use the restroom?

97
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,260
Thank you for the snack again.

98
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,577
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

99
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:21,689
Gosh, it's heavy.

Yes?

105
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:10,977
Do you really not know Mr. Cha Min-ho?

106
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:14,244
A month and a half ago.

107
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,244
By Mr. Cha's car at the impound lot.

108
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,290
Don't you remember that?

110
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,274
Let go of me.

111
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:36,344
You suddenly asked for my ID card.
You were from an investigation unit.

112
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:39,094
But when I twisted your arm,
you shouted in pain. I remember that.

113
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:42,923
Well... No, not that.

114
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,627
By Mr. Cha's car, we--

115
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:45,867
Investigator Jeong Cheol-hun.

116
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:47,274
Where do you belong?

117
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:50,488
CIO, sir.

118
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,383
Why would you work for
the investigation unit instead of CIO?

119
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:55,473
Do your duty first.

120
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,450
You won't find a studio apartment
like this.

122
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:22,756
The view is nice.

123
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:25,269
I'll rent this room.

124
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,163
You've made a wise choice.

125
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,923
When will you start using it?

126
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,090
Now.

Hi, Seung-goo.

129
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,017
I'm on my way home.

130
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,989
I'll be home in 40 minutes.

131
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:36,224
Okay.

132
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:38,373
Go out and walk Bo-ri.

133
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:59,668
Well, it's our first day.

134
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,839
Since Director Choi must be tired,

135
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:04,004
why don't we have chicken
and beer without her?

136
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:05,507
Oh.

137
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:06,774
Shall we?

138
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:08,274
That sounds good.

139
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,827
Mr. Choo.

140
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:11,142
I don't drink.

141
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:13,757
You don't?

142
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:18,310
Then let's have a drink without him.

143
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,390
Okay.

144
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:21,706
He's uncooperative.

145
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,727

146

147
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,126

148
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:30,489

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,056

<font color="#ffff00">I'd like to report

Mr. Do.

154
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,123
It's begun.

155
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:00,689
Okay.

156
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,023
It's time to watch the drama.

157
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,680
<font color="#ffff00">Kim Myung-jae accepted a bribe

- Is this all?
- Yes, it is.

159
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,606
Maybe it's blackmail,

160
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,423
or mudslinging.

161
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:23,957
Who's the informant?

162
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,473
We haven't checked it yet.

163
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,139
Director.

164
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:33,160
Kim Myung-jae lost his mother

165
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,501
three days after the
presidential election.

166
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:37,357
What?

167
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,821
Then it's a false tip-off.

168
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:43,056
What a nasty person. For goodness' sake.

169
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:46,639
Is this the only article about it?

170
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,223
Yes, that's all.

What do you think, Mr. Choo?

174
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,444
If the information is not correct,

175
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:00,573
I don't think we need to care about it.

176
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,427
Chairman of NEC, the kingmaker,

177
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:05,723
lost his mother,

178
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:08,606
but there was only one article about it?

179
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:10,939
I think it's strange.

180
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,077
Hi, Sang-a.

181
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,473
Director Choi. How was it today?

182
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,289
Do you remember the death
of Kim Myung-jae's mother?

183
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:32,589
Yes, I do. What about it?

184
00:13:32,874 --> 00:13:34,360
After the presidential election?

185
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,444
<i><font color="#80ffff">Her funeral was held after the election,</i></font>

186
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,589
but she died before that.

187
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,390
Why do you ask?

188
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,456
What are you saying?

189
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:44,994
<i><font color="#80ffff">He couldn't be away from his desk</i></font>

190
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,674
<i><font color="#80ffff">because he was the campaign director,</i></font>

191
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:49,739
so he held the funeral after the election.

192
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:51,494
He held it only with his family.

193
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:54,077
So those who served
him didn't know about it.

194
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,015
Do you remember when she passed away?

195
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:57,960
<i><font color="#80ffff">What's going on?
Why are you asking me that?</i></font>

196
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,323
Try to remember.

197
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,173
<i><font color="#80ffff">Let me think.</i></font>

198
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:03,966
<i><font color="#80ffff">Oh.</i></font>

199
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:05,244
The golden cross.

200
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:09,344
The golden cross appeared on the chart

201
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,144
on the day of her death.

202
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:13,006
I talked about it with my men.

203
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,544
We said her funeral couldn't be held

204
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:17,344
because of the golden cross.

205
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,627
Her funeral couldn't be held

206
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:20,131
because of the golden cross?

207
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:21,524
<i><font color="#80ffff">Director Choi.</i></font>

208
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:23,589
<i><font color="#80ffff">Let us interview you.</i></font>

209
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:25,656
Okay. Do so.

210
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,973
Really? When?

211
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:30,323
After I quit my job.

212
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,639
Are you kidding? Hey.

213
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:35,974
For goodness' sake.

214
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,573
Is this tip-off true then?

215
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,094
Mr. Kim's mother passed away

216
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:44,006
five days before the
election. That's true.

217
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,527
Let's suppose that it's true.

218
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:49,360
We can't summon and interrogate

219
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,223
the chief secretary of the Blue House.

220
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,310
Let's look into his assets,

221
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,194
and check the records
of his financial transactions

222
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:58,710
from the presidential
election until now.

223
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,010
- Yes, ma'am.
- Please also check.

224
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,110
The use of the campaign funds
reported to the NEC

225
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,894
five days before
and after the election,

226
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:05,694
- and the scale of the campaign.
- Yes, ma'am.

227
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,760
Then the Blue House will notice

228
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,294
that we're investigating them.

229
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:11,382
Yes. When you contact the NEC,

230
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,694
you need to ask for the
records of both parties.

231
00:15:14,774 --> 00:15:18,060
Oh. Then they won't know
which side is being investigated.

232
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,489
What if we find something suspicious?

233
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,839
Then we should investigate the Blue House.

234
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,620
Please find out who the informant is.

235
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:30,207
Yes, ma'am.

236
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,877
Goodness, the Blue House
from the first day?

237
00:15:35,957 --> 00:15:40,606
Mr. Kim is the one
who helped Ms. Choi get appointed.

238
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,060
We'd be ungrateful if we investigate him.

239
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,820
But if we don't, it's dereliction of duty.

240
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:47,573
What should we do, Mr. Choo?

241
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,692
There's one thing we don't need.

242
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,323
Personal feelings.

243
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,106
We don't and won't need them.

244
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:05,703
We're not machines.

245
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,804
Goodness.

246
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,410
He looks like he doesn't have any friends.
Don't you agree?

247
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,490
Hey guys.

248
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:14,877
<i><font color="#80ffff">At the CIO director's appointment
ceremony held at the Blue House today,</i></font>

253
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:39,097
Bye.

254
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,324
Why are you out here?

255
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:44,889
I was worried about you.

256
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:47,437
I heard the rice cakes were from you.

257
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,273
Mr. Bae must've told you.

258
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:51,073
He didn't have to do that.

259
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:53,639
I enjoyed them.

260
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
Did something happen?

261
00:16:58,057 --> 00:17:00,417
Goodness. Does it show on my face?

262
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:01,907
What happened?

263
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,223
Did something bad happen at work?

264
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,566
I'm off the clock.

265
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:10,373
I want to get some rest.

266
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:12,603
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

267
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:14,739
Did you have dinner?

268
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,460
No. I don't have an appetite.

269
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,540
Why not?

270
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:20,111
Did someone on your team cause trouble?

271
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,337
No, it's nothing like that.

272
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:26,083
I'm sorry. Later.

273
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,706
Let's talk later.

274
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
Okay.

275
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,590
Hey, Mr. Choo.

276
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:16,073
It was your first day.
How was it?

277
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,054
Everything is in confusion.

278
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:25,840
Choi Yeon-soo. How about her?

279
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:28,127
I don't think she'll
hold the post for long.

280
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,256
You don't think so? Why not?

281
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,827
She seems to have no intention to do that.

282
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:34,939
Really?

283
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:40,856
She has no intention to do that?

284
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,573
What did she say?

285
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,570
She said she'd investigate the Blue House.

286
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:53,774
She's crazy.

287
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
The Blue House? Why?

288
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,297
Did someone tip you off
about the President's corruption?

289
00:18:58,674 --> 00:18:59,674
Let me pour you a drink.

290
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:06,139
We were tipped off about an irregularity
committed by Kim Myung-jae.

291
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,756
Really? What kind of irregularity?

292
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,760
He allegedly accepted illegal funds.

293
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,106
Illegal funds?

294
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:21,293
We're trying to find out if it's true.

295
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:22,923
Sang-dong.

296
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:25,160
Shouldn't we take part in the war?

297
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,944
Make your enemies give in.

298
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:28,556
That's the best way to fight a war.

299
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,639
"It's best to win without fighting"?

300
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,444
That's a passage from "The Art of War."

301
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:35,524
Yes.

302
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:40,698
If Choi Yeon-soo fights the Blue House,
and wins on our behalf.

303
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:42,973
It will be the best case for us.

304
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,193
Will she

305
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:48,499
fight the Blue House?

306
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:52,489
If she makes a mistake
and saves the Blue House,

307
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:58,869
we can blame her and
finish the Blue House off.

You said you wouldn't stop your wife
from becoming the CIO director.

314
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:21,612
You told me to stop her if I could.

315
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,444
I'm in charge of the CIO's Security Team.

All right.

324
00:21:07,957 --> 00:21:09,160
Okay, I'm coming.

325
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,806
I don't even have time to eat.

326
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,673
This car is clean.

327
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:17,944

Don't put that look on your face.

332
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:29,514
I'm not giving this to you for free.

333
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:31,439
All right. Goodness.

334
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:32,973
You see

335
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:35,527
Lee Suk-gyu once in a while, right?

336
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:37,277
Me?

337
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:39,160
I saw him just once that day.

338
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,456
Report to me right away if you think

339
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,756
he's up to something.

340
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,639
Come on, man. It's been years
since I retired.

341
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:47,956
Don't make me do that.

342
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,739
Find out what he and the wench

343
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,567
who hurt me at the barbecue place

344
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:53,074
are planning to do.

345
00:21:56,424 --> 00:21:57,439
Here I go.

346
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,723
My goodness.

347
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:08,520
I got lost and wandered around for a while.

348
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,890
Do you drive a taxi now?

349
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:14,314
I shut down the car rental shop.
I need a source of income.

350
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:16,234
Do I look like a taxi driver?

351
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:18,657
Take this.

352
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:20,474
What is it?

353
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:22,194
Have you forgotten? It's your birthday.

355
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
How do you know that?

356
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:25,777
How do I know that?

357
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:26,889
Don't you remember?

358
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,427
I got multiple bonuses thanks to you.

359
00:22:29,507 --> 00:22:31,277
My wife was so happy that she

360
00:22:31,357 --> 00:22:33,290
sent you seaweed soup on your birthday.

361
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:35,424
I remember.

362
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,762
Your wife's seaweed soup
was really delicious.

363
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:41,827
I tried to cook it,
but it doesn't taste the same.

364
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:43,910
Of course not. You need
artificial seasonings.

365
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:52,724
What's wrong?

366
00:22:53,557 --> 00:22:54,924
Does Do Young-geol annoy you?

367
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:59,113
He shook hands with Yeon-soo,
and got approvals from her

368
00:22:59,193 --> 00:23:00,292
with a smile on his face.

369
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:03,039
Did he?

370
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,623
Then,

371
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,307
consider yourself lucky.

372
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,885
Lucky?

373
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:12,727
If he meant to hurt her,

374
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:14,606
he'd do that quietly.

375
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,126
He wouldn't stay near her like that.

376
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
What do you mean?

377
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:20,539
You know what I mean.

378
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:21,839
You were the same.

379
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:24,907
If you had meant to hurt your wife
during the operations,

380
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:27,904
you wouldn't even have started dating her.

381
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:32,173
The Company must be using him as a spy.

382
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:34,387
He's watching the CIO to see what they do.

383
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,107
Then why did they tell me

384
00:23:37,187 --> 00:23:38,969
to stop her in the first place?

385
00:23:40,957 --> 00:23:41,989
That's what I'm saying.

386
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:45,339
The NIS was worried
about something for sure.

387
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,640
Your wife handled many political cases.

388
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:53,780
Is there any case

389
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:55,577
that she recently looked into

390
00:23:55,657 --> 00:23:56,977
which might have annoyed them?

391
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,699
Do you have any idea?

392
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,812
Kim Tae-yeol's case.

393
00:24:06,557 --> 00:24:07,573
Or Cha Min-ho's case?

394
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:11,277
Find out what he and the wench

395
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:13,006
who hurt me at the barbecue place

396
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:14,574
are planning to do.

397
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:18,706
Kim Tae-yeol's case was closed long ago.

398
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,257
Cha Min-ho?

399
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:23,566
I wonder if Go Yoon-joo knows something.

400
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Go Yoon-joo?

401
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,073
Haven't you talked to her since then?

402
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:31,956
No.

403
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,740
You haven't?

404
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,370
I'll bring it to you right away.

405
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,723
Hello.

406
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:50,257
By any chance,

407
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,419
did the lady come here after that?

408
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:54,674
Well...

409
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:56,087
I don't know.

410
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,039
<font color="#ffff00">Random Internet Cafe</font>

411
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,394
- Come with us.
- Come on!

412
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,756
All right. Let go of me first.

413
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,056
Gosh.

414
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:13,533
For goodness' sake.

415
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:15,377
Let go of me if you want to talk to me!

416
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:17,094
- Come.
- I said I would.

417
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:18,494
- You jerks!
- Jeez.

418
00:25:18,574 --> 00:25:19,574
- Hey!
- Catch her!

419
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:22,473
Let go of me, you thugs!

420
00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:24,306
How dare you? Let go!

421
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,606
Hey! Let go of me!

422
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,377
Let go of me, you jerks. Let go.

423
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:32,248
I said, let go. How dare you, you jerks?

424
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:37,127
Ma'am.

425
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:39,773
You're so loud. Stop swearing.

426
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Listen attentively.

427
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
All right.

428
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:45,610
David is the father of Solomon

429
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,910
and Solomon is whose father?

430
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,273
The father of savings banks.

431
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:51,856
Banks bear interest
and interest bears more interest.

432
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:55,973
That's what brought us here today.

433
00:25:56,274 --> 00:25:57,274
Jeez.

434
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,873
For goodness' sake. Hey.

435
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:01,627
You crazy jerk.

436
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:03,127
What bears what?

437
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:04,539
You're talking crap.

438
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:06,827
Hey. Gosh.

439
00:26:06,907 --> 00:26:08,956
- Let go of me, you jerks!
- My goodness.

440
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,577
You're so drunk in broad daylight.

441
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:14,689
Your debt!

442
00:26:17,557 --> 00:26:19,306
Pay your debt.

443
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,106
Debt?

444
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,063
My debt?

445
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:24,974
Gosh.

446
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,323
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

447
00:26:27,857 --> 00:26:29,877
All right. I'll pay my debt,
you sons of guns

448
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:31,239
but I don't have money now.

449
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,507
Let go of me.

450
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:33,839
Hey!

451
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:37,394
Gosh.

452
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:38,677
You lent me 500,000 won,

453
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:40,994
and took way more
money than that from me!

454
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:42,794
Hey, kill me.

455
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:44,956
Kill me. Just kill me.

456
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,177
Yes, we'll do that.

457
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,339
Right now, ma'am.

458
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Guys.

459
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:52,939
Draw blood from her

460
00:26:53,724 --> 00:26:54,927
- and check her blood type.
- Yes, Boss.

461
00:26:55,007 --> 00:26:56,994
Hey, don't you do that to me.

462
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,560
Don't touch me!

463
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,094
- Let go of me!
- Hey.

464
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:02,773
You should listen to me, woman.

465
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:04,557
Look at me.

466
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,124
Hey, look at me.

467
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:08,724
Make her stand.

468
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:10,157
All right.

469
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,174
Put her in the car.

470
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:27,914
What happened to the door?

471
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:01,797
Gosh.

472
00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:07,090
Hey, man. Who are you?

473
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:10,473
You're old enough to know

474
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:13,630
what to stay out of.

475
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:17,244
Do you have a death wish?

476
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:23,074
Jeez.

477
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:29,256
Gosh, my nose.

478
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,057
Guys.

479
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:46,792
Hey, guys. All right.

480
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Follow me, guys.

481
00:28:50,474 --> 00:28:51,474
Follow me.

482
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:52,757
Darn it.

483
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:09,739
Yoon-joo.

484
00:29:10,274 --> 00:29:11,274
Are you okay?

485
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,690
Suk-gyu?

486
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:38,957
Use it wisely.

487
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:47,773
You're not rusty like I am.

488
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,145
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

489
00:29:57,357 --> 00:29:58,873
What went on between you and Min-ho?

490
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,390
Min-ho?

491
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:02,427
Why do you want to know that?

492
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:03,827
You said you'll get back at them.

493
00:30:06,817 --> 00:30:09,190
They killed him.
They must be punished.

494
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:12,666
Were you and Min-ho...

495
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:13,827
What are you trying to say?

496
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:16,453
The only woman he loved was his wife.

497
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:19,127
Just like you.

498
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:27,464
I do have an eye for a good man.

499
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:32,439
How did you keep in touch with him?

500
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:38,296
Everyone abandoned me.

501
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:40,239
My country,

502
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:41,789
The Company,

503
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:45,439
and you.

504
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,869
Only Min-ho cared about me.

505
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:58,090
He came to see me once in a while,
though I didn't call him.

506
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:03,170
I have no idea how he
knew that I was broke.

507
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:06,492
No need to be sorry.

508
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:08,123
After all,

509
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:10,836
it's every man for himself.

510
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,420
I'm going to kill those jerks,

511
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:16,923
and leave this place.

512
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:29,494
What is this?

513
00:31:29,574 --> 00:31:30,574
Take a look.

514
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,989
<font color="#ffff00">Special Operations Team of NSPA</font>

515
00:31:34,774 --> 00:31:35,977
Our new members who'll be assigned

516
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:37,777
to the operation to arrest Kim Tae-yeol.

517
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,723
<font color="#ffff00">Go Yoon-joo</font>

518
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:43,757
Why is she on the list?

519
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:45,919
Oh, Go Yoon-joo?

520
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:47,854
She volunteered to work on this team.

521
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,723
You met her last year.

522
00:31:50,757 --> 00:31:52,573
I'm thankful.

523
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:54,560
When I met her last year,

524
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,939
I thought she was
quick-witted and tenacious.

525
00:31:58,007 --> 00:31:59,207
Anyway, look through the list.

526
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:05,739
Mr. Oh.

527
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,290
I want you

528
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,856
to exclude Go Yoon-joo.

529
00:32:11,157 --> 00:32:12,157
Why?

530
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,852
There's a problem.

531
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:18,574
A problem?

532
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:19,857
Yes.

533
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,190
What's the problem?

534
00:32:25,383 --> 00:32:26,932
- Are you dating her?
- No, I'm not.

535
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:28,890
It's nothing like that.

536
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:30,974
I just have

537
00:32:31,914 --> 00:32:33,262
a bad feeling about her.

538
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:34,817
Can you elaborate on that?

539
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:36,327
Gosh, just exclude her.

540
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:38,377
"Just exclude her"?
Are you messing with me right now?

541
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,057
Because you're the agent I cherish most?

542
00:32:40,483 --> 00:32:42,060
I need them on this team.

543
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,706
I'll do the work of two people.

544
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:53,756

555
00:33:47,274 --> 00:33:49,889
The tip-off about Kim Myung-jae
accepting a bribe.

556
00:33:51,457 --> 00:33:52,457
How...

557
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:54,369
How do you know that?

558
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:57,044

It's true, isn't it?

562
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:06,894
Hey. Someone in the
reporters' chat room

563
00:34:06,974 --> 00:34:08,494
tipped us off about it a minute ago.

564
00:34:14,357 --> 00:34:15,623

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,772
I have something to tell you.

580
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:15,124
Follow me.

581
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,006
That tip-off is slander.

582
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,510
Did you come and see me to tell me that?

583
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,110
You can at least hear the explanation.

584
00:35:29,924 --> 00:35:31,173
Okay. Go ahead and explain it.

585
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,040
I'll see whether it's an explanation,
or external pressure.

586
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:37,156
I asked Mr. Kim and confirmed it.

587
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,427
Are you saying what
he says is the evidence?

588
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:41,747
You know this administration

589
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,294
is trying to publicize

590
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,054
our special operations expenses, right?

591
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,506
About a trillion won is used

592
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,727
as special operations
expenses every year.

593
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:51,367
But we don't know where the money goes.

594
00:35:52,157 --> 00:35:53,010
You know that.

595
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,377
Are you saying those who are

596
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:56,726
trying to stop the bill from passing

597
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,823
slandered Mr. Kim?

598
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:00,594
Have you found out
who the informant is?

599
00:36:00,674 --> 00:36:02,973
What matters is whether or not it's true.

600
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:04,727
If it's a false tip-off,

601
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:06,294
we don't need to worry about anything.

602
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:07,374
Yeon-soo.

603
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:10,427
Investigating Mr. Kim now

604
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:12,806
is what those who did this want.

605
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:17,096
The Blue House had faith in you.

606
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:18,887
Please give us some time too.

607
00:36:22,053 --> 00:36:23,069
When will you

608
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,006
propose the bill?

609
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,290
Next week.

610
00:36:27,214 --> 00:36:28,513
We'll propose it next week.

611
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:35,606
I always think about
what Tae-yeol would do.

612
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:37,907
If it were him,

613
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:40,944
He would be excited like a child

614
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,998
and spend restless
nights working on this.

615
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:45,673
Transparent Korea.

616
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,556
Tae-yeol can't see it,

617
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:51,856
but we can see it soon.

618
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,302
The country we dreamed of.

619
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,239
I need evidence that shows it's slander.

620
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:09,480
But you're just being emotional.

621
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:12,410
Check up on it.
Mr. Kim wasn't in Seoul

622
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,810
five days before the election.

623
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:16,339
- What?
- If the bill doesn't pass,

624
00:37:16,994 --> 00:37:19,890
It'll be a good thing only for those
who tried to slander him.

625
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,589
Please do me a favor.

626
00:37:50,674 --> 00:37:51,939
They had a date?

627
00:38:00,474 --> 00:38:01,927
Do it by looking at it.
The right foot first.

628
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:03,539
It's not easy.

629
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,130

00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:33,724
Not like that, Seung-mi.

635
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:38,673
You look haggard.

636
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:41,006
Did you watch the news?

637
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,010
The ink on your certificate of
appointment hasn't even dried yet.

638
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,450
I can't believe this is happening.

639
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,506
We don't know whether or not it's true.

640
00:38:50,824 --> 00:38:52,810
Mom! I shot a layup!

641
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,094
Yes, Seung-mi. I saw it.

642
00:38:54,174 --> 00:38:55,877
- Good job.
- Hi. Mom.

643
00:38:55,957 --> 00:38:57,410
Hi, Seung-goo.

644
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,460
- Hi.
- Did you see it?

645
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,780
- It was awesome.
- Yes, I saw it.

646
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:04,956
When the President presented
the certificate of appointment to me,

647
00:39:05,507 --> 00:39:07,764
he told me to investigate
even the living authorities.

648
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,889
It feels like the whole
nation is watching me

649
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:13,843
to see if I'm doing my job properly.

650
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,157
Maybe

651
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:22,756
someone really is watching you.

652
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:26,060
Gosh, I don't need anyone else

653
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,939
to be watching me, but you.

654
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:31,839
It's not like I watch you all the time.

655
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:33,623
What?

656
00:39:34,157 --> 00:39:36,473
I know you do.

657
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,289

Gosh, you startled me.

What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

669
00:40:07,598 --> 00:40:09,323
My mom made kimchi.

670
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,060
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

671
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,673
Auntie Sang-a. Kimchi is good.

672

Jung-hyun, it's nicely matured.

Gosh, thank you.

674
00:40:17,274 --> 00:40:18,539
You have no other intention?

675
00:40:19,357 --> 00:40:20,517
You didn't answer your phone.

676

- See you.
- Bye.

677
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:25,289
Goodbye.

678
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:28,009
Hey.

679
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:30,297
I heard you met Kang Choong-mo yesterday.

680
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:31,724
Who told you that?

681
00:40:32,274 --> 00:40:33,806
Don't feign ignorance again.

682
00:40:34,074 --> 00:40:36,060
Why, did it spread through messenger too?

683
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,960
Yes, this morning. If you were
to hand your photos with him over

684
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,880
to the media, you
could've given them to me.

685
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,290
Hand over what photos?

686
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,094
You leaked the photos on purpose to stop

687
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:47,362
the Blue House from pressuring the CIO.

688
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:51,044
No?

689
00:40:51,124 --> 00:40:53,139
This is driving me insane.

690
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:54,939
Hey, Choi Yeon-soo.

691
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,073
Give me something.
You cold-hearted brat.

692
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:03,796
- Let's go, Jung-hyun.
- Okay.

693
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,691

Who on earth is it? They even took photos.

699
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:27,683
Each article got tons of comments.

700
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,544
"Kim Myung-jae is corrupt,"

701
00:42:29,624 --> 00:42:31,344
Kang Choong-mo puts on external pressure."

702
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,910
The public opinion isn't so good.

My gosh. Whoever this person is,

704
00:42:35,224 --> 00:42:37,639
they did a great job making mischief.

705
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:40,694
As you all know by
looking at the pictures

706
00:42:40,774 --> 00:42:42,823
of me and Mr. Kang, it's clear

707
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,673
that information is being leaked.

708
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,589
Whether it's the Blue House or us.

709
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,060
What's most urgent is

710
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,570
to check if Mr. Kang was right

711
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,677
about Mr. Kim not being in Seoul

712
00:42:55,757 --> 00:42:58,944
five days before the
presidential election.

713
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:00,406
Did Mr. Kang say that?

714
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:03,160
It'll be over once he has an alibi.

715
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,260
Look into where he went at that time.

716
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,144
Okay.

717
00:43:07,224 --> 00:43:08,356
That's all.

718
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,923
- Good work.
- You too.

719
00:43:19,316 --> 00:43:20,316
Yes, Mr. Jeong.

720
00:43:20,396 --> 00:43:22,277
About the computer Cha Min-ho used
at the internet cafe,

721
00:43:22,357 --> 00:43:23,677
its hard drive has been restored.

722
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:24,832
Really?

723
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:28,492
He searched one keyword
on the portal website that day.

724
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,956
Widow's Cruse Project.

725
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,210
Widow's Cruse Project?

726
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,910
<i><font color="#80ffff">Yes, that's what he searched.</i></font>

727
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,389
Widow's Cruse Project?

728
00:43:43,776 --> 00:43:44,790
<font color="#ffff00">Widow's Cruse Project</font>

729
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,980
This couple is trying
hard to end their lives.

730
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,677
Is this being recorded?

731
00:43:50,757 --> 00:43:51,757
Yes.

732
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,656
Widow's Cruse...

733
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,789
An inexhaustible supply of something...

734
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:01,544
Is that all?

735
00:44:01,624 --> 00:44:02,656
Yes, for now.

736
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,989
Widow's Cruse Project.

737
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:10,110
Once we settle Kim Myung-jae's issue,

738
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,973
we'll look into it together.

739
00:44:12,224 --> 00:44:13,756
- Okay.
- Good job.

740
00:44:14,824 --> 00:44:15,824
No problem.

741
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:21,289

745
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,173

00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:39,166

749
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:47,200
<i><font color="#80ffff">Yes, that's what he searched.</i></font>

750
00:46:51,334 --> 00:46:53,071
- Mr. Do.
- Yes, sir.

751
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:54,970
- Listen carefully.
- Yes.

752
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,992
Figure out what the CIO does
about the Widow's Cruse Project.

753
00:46:58,072 --> 00:46:59,106
Yes, sir.

754
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:01,416
This is more important than your life.

755
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,250
Do you understand?

756
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:06,051
I'll check thoroughly
and report back to you.

757
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:08,021
You should wrap things up well there,

758
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:09,616
and come back soon.

759
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:11,433
Yes, sir.

760
00:47:12,234 --> 00:47:13,234
I'll be going.

761
00:47:16,117 --> 00:47:17,117
Get going.

762
00:47:18,217 --> 00:47:19,500
Go on.

763
00:47:20,577 --> 00:47:21,577
Do a good job.

764
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:22,851
Sure.

765
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,135
The general election is around the corner.
What will you do now?

766
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:29,626
Widow's Cruse Project.

767
00:47:29,784 --> 00:47:31,316
Choi Yeon-soo got wind of it.

768
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:33,788
- Will it be okay?
- What are you talking about?

769
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,250
That can't be an excuse to stop it all.

770
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:39,050
It's my job to get rid of Choi Yeon-soo.

771
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:41,877
Yes, sir.

772
00:47:41,957 --> 00:47:44,773
I can't sit back and watch
this country go down.

773
00:47:45,201 --> 00:47:46,233
Right.

774
00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:48,583
How long will it take to retrieve it?

775
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:52,433
About four weeks, sir.

776
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:55,098
Make it three weeks.

777
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,242
I'll do that. sir.

778
00:48:02,284 --> 00:48:03,647
What are you waiting for? Do it.

779
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:05,276
Oh, yes.

780
00:49:39,784 --> 00:49:40,800
Who are you?

781
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:47,234
Well,

782
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,266
isn't this 123-gil, Yangseo-ro?

783
00:49:49,817 --> 00:49:50,833
No.

784
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:53,683
It's strange.

785
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:55,862
It has to be somewhere around here.

786
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:22,900
Welcome. Welcome, welcome.

787
00:50:23,117 --> 00:50:26,000
- Grandpa.
- Goodness.

788
00:50:26,284 --> 00:50:27,833
Goodness, my pumpkins.

789
00:50:27,913 --> 00:50:29,821
- Welcome. Let's go inside.
- We're here.

790
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,916
Welcome.

791
00:50:31,307 --> 00:50:32,339
Park the cars.

792
00:50:32,419 --> 00:50:33,187
- Sure.
- Okay.

793
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:34,533
Let's go in.

794
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:36,333
Come along.

795
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,060
Who is he?

796
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:54,183
This is Im Hyung-rak.

797
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:57,620
- Who?
- Im Hyung-rak.

798
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,287
Don't you remember?
The other team leader

799
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:01,861
who made a fuss
during the narcotics case.

800
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,783
I told you before.

801
00:51:15,984 --> 00:51:17,500
That's him?

802
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:19,254
The current executive director of the NIS?

803
00:51:19,334 --> 00:51:20,600
Yes, him.

804
00:51:25,284 --> 00:51:26,324
Did you take this picture?

805
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:30,183
What's wrong with you?

806
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:32,500
You could be in serious trouble.

807
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:34,016
This man

808
00:51:35,201 --> 00:51:37,037
got Do Young-geol into the CIO.

809
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:38,604
Whatever the case is,

810
00:51:38,684 --> 00:51:40,330
why would you dig into
the executive director?

811
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:41,471
Then what?

812
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:43,504
Do Young-geol is stuck at Yeon-soo's side.

813
00:51:43,584 --> 00:51:45,650
I can't just listen to you and stay still.

814
00:51:49,817 --> 00:51:50,817
Whatever.

815
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:52,962
I'm out.

816
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:55,024
So don't call me for something like this.

817
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:56,666
Don't ask for me.

818
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:07,287
Five days before the presidential election,

819
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:09,650
Mr. Kim was in Jeju Island.

820
00:52:10,451 --> 00:52:12,654
I'll look more into it
to find clear evidence.

821
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:14,204
- Okay, please do that.
- Okay.

822
00:52:14,284 --> 00:52:15,284
Ms. Choi.

823
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:17,666
I don't think we can confirm the informant.

824
00:52:17,951 --> 00:52:18,904
Can't it be tracked?

825
00:52:18,984 --> 00:52:21,033
No, I did.

826
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:24,354
But apparently, it was sent

827
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:27,071
from a photo studio in Nairobi, Kenya.

828
00:52:27,151 --> 00:52:28,204
I inquired about it at the embassy.

829
00:52:28,284 --> 00:52:30,066
They said the studio had no CCTV cameras,

830
00:52:30,617 --> 00:52:31,821
and so it couldn't be confirmed.

831
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:33,037
You mean it was an expert?

832
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:34,200
Yes.

833
00:52:36,301 --> 00:52:37,754
Still, work on it to the end.

834
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:38,971
Okay.

835
00:52:39,051 --> 00:52:40,051

Thank you for trusting me.

842
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:23,200
Don't mention it.

843
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:26,500

847
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:54,766
No, to change top lifts.

848
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,271
Dad has worn those shoes

849
00:55:56,351 --> 00:55:58,621
since my middle
school entrance ceremony.

850
00:55:58,701 --> 00:55:59,733
Throw them away.

851
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:01,800
They're fine, so why?

852
00:56:02,051 --> 00:56:03,616
Goodness, gracious.

853
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:12,650
Aren't you even shaken
after being criticized like that?

854
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:16,016
It's because people don't know.

855
00:56:16,284 --> 00:56:18,821
Invite all those people who say

856
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:20,387
that he took bribes
worth billions of won.

857
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:22,300
I want to hear what they babble.

858
00:56:30,117 --> 00:56:31,916
The one struggling the most

859
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:33,483
is your dad.

860
00:56:33,751 --> 00:56:36,600
I know. I'm just upset.

861
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,117
<i><font color="#80ffff">Cha Min-ho. Go Yoon-joo.</i></font>

862
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,950
<i><font color="#80ffff">Their leader at that time.</i></font>

863
00:57:19,217 --> 00:57:20,783
That darn man.

864
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,787
He's the current executive director
of the NIS.

865
00:57:23,867 --> 00:57:24,900
This man

866
00:57:25,684 --> 00:57:27,404
got Do Young-geol into the CIO.

867
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:28,704
Whatever the case is,

868
00:57:28,784 --> 00:57:30,850
why would you dig into
the executive director?

869
00:58:09,967 --> 00:58:12,266
This should be enough for you
to resolve your issue with them.

870
00:58:15,634 --> 00:58:18,200
Is it out of sympathy or something?

871
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,350
I feel like I'm partly responsible

872
00:58:21,907 --> 00:58:23,472
for your struggles.

873
00:58:29,851 --> 00:58:31,571
What if I waste this
money away on drinks

874
00:58:31,651 --> 00:58:32,971
instead of paying off my debt?

875
00:58:38,301 --> 00:58:39,816
Goodness.

876
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:42,666
I got free money, but I feel horrible.

877
00:58:46,817 --> 00:58:47,817
By any chance,

878
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:50,916
do you know why Cha Min-ho died?

879
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:53,716
Why did he die?

880
00:58:54,234 --> 00:58:55,234
Do you know?

881
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:57,033
No.

882
00:58:58,194 --> 00:58:59,309
Then he didn't tell you

883
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:02,700
anything about
Do Young-geol or Im Hyung-rak?

884
00:59:04,801 --> 00:59:05,801
Im Hyung-rak?

885
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:07,833
Yes, Im Hyung-rak.

886
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,493
Min-ho was his subordinate.

887
00:59:11,984 --> 00:59:14,800
Why did he keep working
for that piece of trash?

888
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:16,601
That piece of trash?

889
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,599
He's a piece of trash?

890
00:59:23,584 --> 00:59:24,600
Im Hyung-rak.

891
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:28,233
Im Hyung-rak.

892
00:59:30,584 --> 00:59:31,883
Im Hyung-rak.

893
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,904
Im Hyung-rak... Im Hyung-rak.

894
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:35,266
Im Hyung-rak.

895
00:59:35,517 --> 00:59:37,350
Yoon-joo, are you okay?

896
00:59:43,517 --> 00:59:44,517
You will

897
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:47,916
never be able to escape from him either.

898
00:59:49,467 --> 00:59:51,000
You'll suffer like us.

899
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:55,117
What do you mean?

900
00:59:56,717 --> 00:59:57,733
Why did he

901
00:59:58,784 --> 01:00:01,100
keep working for Im Hyung-rak?

902
01:00:02,934 --> 01:00:04,483
Tell me.

903
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:06,766
Why is he a piece of trash?

904
01:00:12,701 --> 01:00:13,983
I get it.

905
01:00:16,817 --> 01:00:17,850
That was it.

906
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:25,817
Yoon-joo.

907
01:00:29,277 --> 01:00:31,576
What is it? Tell me.

908
01:00:33,028 --> 01:00:34,041
Dad.

909
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:37,433
Seung-mi.

910
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:43,634
Is she your daughter?

911
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:47,319
Hello.

912
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:50,354
Hey.

913
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:52,183
I am

914
01:00:53,217 --> 01:00:55,283
your dad's old acquaintance.

915
01:01:08,267 --> 01:01:09,282
Take this.

916
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,971
It's okay.

917
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:13,866
Take it. I want to give it to you.

918
01:01:15,701 --> 01:01:17,250
Thank you.

919
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:19,583
You're pretty.

920
01:01:20,384 --> 01:01:21,650
Just like your mom.

921
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,639
It was nice seeing you. Bye.

922
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:28,566
Well, okay. Bye.

923
01:01:28,842 --> 01:01:30,089
Bye.

924
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:31,883
Goodbye.

925
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:47,550
Does Mom know her too?

926
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:51,416
No, we were friends before I met your mom.

927
01:01:52,201 --> 01:01:53,201
What...

928
01:01:53,517 --> 01:01:55,316
Then how does she know Mom's face?

929
01:01:57,951 --> 01:01:59,111
I don't know.

930
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:01,283
Maybe she saw her on TV.

931
01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:08,706
Hey, you look just like your mom.

932
01:02:09,254 --> 01:02:11,054
Is she your ex-girlfriend?

933
01:02:11,134 --> 01:02:12,183
Are you kidding me?

934
01:02:12,451 --> 01:02:13,704
We were colleagues at work.

935
01:02:13,784 --> 01:02:15,066
Oh, well.

936
01:02:16,367 --> 01:02:18,104
I should've greeted her properly.

937
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:19,450
It's okay.

938
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:24,100
It's fascinating.

939
01:02:24,884 --> 01:02:25,916
What is?

940
01:02:26,434 --> 01:02:28,233
You did have a friend.

941
01:02:30,067 --> 01:02:34,154
I mean, I even wondered
you were an outcast.

942
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:35,283
Oh, please.

943
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:38,350
I was super popular
before you guys were born.

944
01:02:39,766 --> 01:02:42,332
Goodness. As if.

945
01:02:45,084 --> 01:02:46,084
What?

946
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,371
<i><font color="#80ffff">Once the bill falls through,</i></font>

947
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:07,187
It will do good only to those
who slandered Mr. Kim.

948
01:03:07,267 --> 01:03:09,616
Invite all those people who say

949
01:03:09,696 --> 01:03:11,337
that he took bribes
worth billions of won.

950
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:12,966
I want to hear what they babble.

951
01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:54,050
Did something happen?

952
01:03:54,851 --> 01:03:57,100
You're here. Sit down.

953
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:03,866
Why? Is it because of Mr. Kim?

954
01:04:06,734 --> 01:04:10,037
I had no idea I would
investigate the side

955
01:04:10,117 --> 01:04:11,917
that proposed the
Budget Transparency Act.

956
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,150
Is that Mr. Kim?

957
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:17,834
Yes.

958
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:21,683
Mr. Kim Myung-jae still wears

959
01:04:22,751 --> 01:04:24,454
the shoes that he
wore at his daughter's

960
01:04:24,534 --> 01:04:26,014
middle school entrance ceremony

961
01:04:26,351 --> 01:04:28,900
by replacing the top lifts.

962
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:32,500
But he should be
better off with his salary.

963
01:04:35,634 --> 01:04:37,183
Why? What is it?

964
01:04:44,267 --> 01:04:46,583
Is the report true?

965
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:50,171
If I catch Mr. Kim,

966
01:04:50,251 --> 01:04:51,704
I'll only be the puppet of those

967
01:04:51,784 --> 01:04:53,704
who want to stop the
Budget Transparency Act.

968
01:04:58,984 --> 01:05:00,000
Choi Yeon-soo.

969
01:05:01,034 --> 01:05:02,034
Yes?

970
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,416
Don't be intimidated.

971
01:05:06,058 --> 01:05:07,607
You are no longer an attorney.

972
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:10,433
You're in charge of the CIO.

973
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:13,305
Your job is

974
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,500
to catch people who
committed wrongdoings.

975
01:05:19,134 --> 01:05:20,666
Think only about that.

Okay, see you.

980
01:07:39,884 --> 01:07:40,900
Okay.

Who's there?

986

Mr. Do, what are you doing here?

987
01:12:23,734 --> 01:12:24,937
Is everything okay?

988
01:12:25,017 --> 01:12:26,017
Yes, sir.

989
01:12:26,584 --> 01:12:28,383

Yes.

I'm about to check the Director's Office.

994
