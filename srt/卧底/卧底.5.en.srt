00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:40,053
I heard in the hospital that you two

11
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:42,294
already hung out without me.

12
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:45,407
We just ran into each other

13
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,049
and had a meal and a drink.

14
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:50,039
Sure. It was a coincidence.

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,230
You two are acting strange.

16
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:56,140

00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,516
Hey. Let me see your arm.

19
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:22,581
What happened to it?

20
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:24,101
Let me see.

21
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:27,613
You had bruises the other day too.
They're bigger this time.

22
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:28,756
What happened?

23
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:32,598
She became a junkie while
she was trying to catch junkies.

24
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:34,181
- Min-ho.
- What are you saying?

25
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,487
Then you should tell the Company
and go into rehab.

26
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,303
Do you think the Company will help her?

27
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:44,807
They'll fire her.

28
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:46,047
That's ridiculous.

29
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,882
It happened while working for
the government. They can't do that.

30
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:50,314
Why are you so naive?

31
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:51,400
Why should I care?

32
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,218
I need to take a leak.

33

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,288
You drank too much.

42
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,601
Let's go.

43
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:01,882
Stop drinking.

44
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,096
Wait. What's wrong?

45
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,920
Wait.

46
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:19,449

54
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,750
Hold on.

00:28:46,804 --> 00:28:47,811
(Jo Dong-pal)

371
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:51,827
(Kim Do-hee)

00:28:53,844 --> 00:28:55,082
(Lee Suk-gyu)

373
00:28:57,876 --> 00:29:00,867
(Lee Suk-gyu)

374
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:32,038
Where have you been at this hour?

375
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,442
One of my customers
got stuck at Jungnang Stream

376
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:37,008
because the gears got damaged.

377
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,759
He must've been really frustrated.

378
00:29:43,024 --> 00:29:44,527
Are you okay?

379
00:29:46,313 --> 00:29:48,312
It's a suspicious death,

380
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:51,055
but the evidence and witnesses
constantly disappear.

381
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:53,088
Do you think

382
00:29:54,113 --> 00:29:55,880
Mr. Cha Min-ho didn't commit suicide?

383
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:57,976
I'll be able to answer that question

384
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:01,123
once I find and ask the guy
who secretly took

385
00:30:01,202 --> 00:30:04,365
the envelope out of the locker,
and deleted all the CCTV footage.

386
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:11,529
I don't know what it is.

387
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:14,322
But it seems that he tried
to hand it over to me

388
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:15,474
at the risk of his life.

389
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:21,246
If I had been faster, I would've gotten it.

390
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,205
Why are you blaming yourself?

391
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,493
I always miss things by a second
because I'm busy with the CIO job.

392
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,790
Oh.

393
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:35,095
Excuse me.

394
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:37,872
Hi, Reverend.

395
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,826
Where's A-soon?

396
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,873
She's right next to me.

397
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,258
A-soon. What happened?

398
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:46,515
<i>Ms. Choi.</i>

399
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:48,513
<i>I'm doing fine.</i>

400
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,047
I lost contact with you
for over three months.

401
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:52,118
So I was really worried.

402
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:54,083
Nothing happened.

403
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,452
<i>I'm relieved.</i>

404
00:30:55,531 --> 00:30:57,883
<i>You're with the reverend now,
so everything will be fine.</i>

405
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,992
Yes.

406
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:01,155
<i>Always be careful though.</i>

407
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:02,940
Okay.

408
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:04,560
Thank you.

409
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,360
How have you been?

410
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:11,311
Are you healthy?

411
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,765
<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

412
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,028
Do you eat well?

413
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:26,064
My goodness.

414
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:28,638
Why are there so many leaflets here?

415
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:30,391
Goodness.

416
00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:34,145
For goodness' sake.

417
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:35,914
What is all this?

418
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:37,186
(Attorney Choi Yeon-soo's Office)

419
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:38,256
Jeez.

420
00:31:44,123 --> 00:31:46,171
Mr. Bae. Why are you not coming in?

421
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:49,443
She's doing well, right?

422
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:51,213
She's busy as always.

423
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:54,438
Is she still investigating
Cha Min-ho's case?

424
00:31:54,518 --> 00:31:56,736
You know her. She won't give up.

425
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:57,821
For goodness' sake.

426
00:31:57,901 --> 00:31:59,590
She just doesn't listen to me.

427
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,945
There's a reason why I tried to stop her.

428
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:05,160
Jeez.

429
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,014
Are you really not going to come back?

430
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,245
I can't do all the work by myself.

431
00:32:09,324 --> 00:32:10,332
Why should I care?

432
00:32:11,341 --> 00:32:12,332
Oh, right.

433
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:14,380
Give this to her.

(Car rental agreement)

436
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,040
What?

437
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:30,807
This is from Mr. Bae.

438
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:33,567
Mr. Bae?

439
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:35,768
Prosecutor Choo Dong-woo
was dispatched

440
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:37,863
to the Inspection Unit of NIS
a year ago.

441
00:32:56,736 --> 00:32:57,728
Choo Dong-woo, speaking.

442
00:32:58,769 --> 00:32:59,813
Prosecutor Choo.

443
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:02,007
This is Choi Yeon-soo.

444
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:04,305
Hello, Ms. Choi.

445
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:05,808
<i>How have you been?</i>

446
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:07,531
Is this regarding your son?

447
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,865
No, it's not.

448
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:12,418
I heard you're working for the NIS now.

449
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,987
Mr. Choo.

450
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,998
<i>I'm waiting to be assigned now.</i>

451
00:33:21,574 --> 00:33:24,862
Mr. Choo, have you heard of Cha Min-ho?

452
00:33:27,193 --> 00:33:28,121
Mr. Choo,

453
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,192
<i>have you heard of--</i>

454
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:30,885
I have nothing to say. I have to go.

455
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:36,546
Mr. Choo. Hello?

456
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,464
"I have nothing to say"?

457
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,251
He didn't say he's never heard of him.

458
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:50,630
That means he knows something.

459
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:53,290
Gosh, I'm so frustrated.

460
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,900
This is the worst of all.

461
00:34:00,112 --> 00:34:03,185
What's your thought on
Nominee Choi Yeon-soo?

462
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:05,746
I'd like to say

463
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:09,563
you've found the
right person for the job.

464
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:11,534
Really?

465
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:12,620
Ms. Choi is a woman.

466
00:34:13,696 --> 00:34:16,095
It's not easy for a female attorney

467
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:18,190
to achieve such results.

468
00:34:18,455 --> 00:34:20,966
She's very smart and competitive.

469
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:22,920
I went through all the cases

470
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:24,255
she was in charge of.

471
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:28,782
I didn't find anything problematic.

472
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,823
No wonder. If there were any problems,

473
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:33,899
someone would've already brought it up.

474
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:35,113
Exactly.

475
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:38,107
Besides, none of her family members

476
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:39,689
have any issues.

477
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:42,235
Good.

478
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:44,002
You weren't given much time.

479
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,539
Thank you for your work.

480
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,325
Mr. Kim.

481
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:51,093
Yes?

482
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,447
Are you going to push
ahead with the plan

483
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,239
to publicize our special
operations expenses?

484
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:02,032
Last year, we attained a 24-trillion deal

485
00:35:02,314 --> 00:35:03,702
to build nuclear power plants

486
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:05,816
in Arbekia in the Middle East.

487
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:09,865
We could beat the UK, our rival,

488
00:35:10,824 --> 00:35:12,905
and win the contract

489
00:35:13,436 --> 00:35:14,876
because we won the information war

490
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:16,851
by finding out about their conditions.

491
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,805
We used the special operations budget

492
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:23,581
to dispatch our secret agents.

493
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:26,655
And we also used the
budget to investigate,

494
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:29,729
and get information
about Ms. Choi Yeon-soo.

495
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:31,744
If we had required receipts,

496
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:35,264
the informants wouldn't
have cooperated with us.

497
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:41,066
The Blue House

498
00:35:41,578 --> 00:35:43,362
has no intention to restrict

499
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,778
the activities of the NIS.

500
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:46,933
We just want to be

501
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,436
transparent about

502
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:50,919
where the taxpayers'
precious money goes.

503
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:53,062
If the Budget Transparency Act
passes into law,

504
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:55,823
all the state institutions
including the NIS

505
00:35:56,484 --> 00:35:58,119
would eventually abandon

506
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:01,082
Korea's national interests
for transparent accounting.

507
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:02,515
The Budget Transparency Act

508
00:36:03,142 --> 00:36:05,216
is the key reform project
of this administration.

509
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:09,291
But

510
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:13,373
I'll keep the practical
problems in mind.

511
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:17,935
Thank you.

512
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:23,768
I'll expect you

513
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:27,783
to make a wise decision.

(National Intelligence Service)

515
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:38,658
We've deleted all the transactions
on the accounts

516
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:40,875
except those you put a hold on.

517
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:41,962
When should we...

518
00:36:44,508 --> 00:36:45,499
Mr. Park.

519
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:49,319
Yes?

520
00:36:49,862 --> 00:36:50,790
What did you say?

521
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,294
The accounts you put a hold on.

522
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:53,381
For goodness' sake.

523
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:56,422
Hey.

524
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,503
I told you I'd take care of them!

525
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:06,618
How is it going,

526
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:07,913
Mr. Park?

527
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:09,907
What the...

528
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:16,533
Wow.

529
00:37:17,707 --> 00:37:18,797
Is this

530
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:21,590
the heart of the finance team

531
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:24,271
that prevents financial attacks

532
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:27,902
from our adversaries like hackers,
and takes charge of

533
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:29,923
the financial security of Korea

534
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:31,720
by collecting information

535
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,531
about financial institutions
in and out of Korea?

536
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:36,794
Well.

537
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:38,314
Kind of.

538
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:40,594
Then what does this office do?

539
00:37:42,132 --> 00:37:43,163
Not the offices out there.

540
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:44,858
But this one.

541
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,931
Gosh, Mr. Do.

542
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,948
What's your pay grade again?

543
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:52,509
Well...

544
00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:57,009
Except for hands-on
workers, it can be opened

545
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:59,583
only to those above grade three
with permission.

546
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,647
I happen to keep covering up
for your messes.

547
00:38:05,913 --> 00:38:07,849
I need to know what the mess is

548
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:09,447
so I can be less irritated.

549
00:38:09,978 --> 00:38:11,464
What is this place for?

550
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,249
Exactly.

551
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,600
Come when you become grade three.

552
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:21,069
Keep your subordinates
under better control

553
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:24,188
or is it you that causes problems?

554
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:29,150
You say you support
your family abroad

00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:30,749
But you don't play things safe.

556
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,687
You could get in trouble.

557
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:34,455
How dare you say that to someone

558
00:38:34,534 --> 00:38:37,194
who's struggling to handle your mess?

559
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,318
Even if you struggle so hard,

560
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,118
I doubt you'll be grade
three before you retire.

561
00:38:45,904 --> 00:38:47,671
Darn.

562
00:38:58,196 --> 00:38:59,822
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, didn't you look for a lady</i>

563
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:01,668
<i>with overdue bills?</i>

564
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:04,676
<i>I couldn't tell you back then
because my boss was around.</i>

565
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:07,486
<i>But there's this lady
who didn't pay up.</i>

566
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:09,782
Where is your store?

567
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:16,062
Once she comes,
she stays for a whole week.

568
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:17,273
Gosh.

569
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:19,102

570
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:20,871
Even the guy

571
00:39:21,136 --> 00:39:23,833
who came once a month stopped coming.

572
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:25,416
- The guy?
- Yes.

573
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,139
He used to come every month

574
00:39:27,218 --> 00:39:29,729
to pay off her bill.

575
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:34,042
How much is it?

576
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,595
Including jjajangmyeon
she ordered last time,

577
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:40,883
it's 188,300 won in total.

578
00:39:46,222 --> 00:39:46,968
Her number.

00:40:53,857 --> 00:40:55,480
Right, somehow.

a strange connection, right?

- If it weren't for you, I really--

work really hard.

Of course, I hate him.

692
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:30,692

693
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:36,013
Ms. Choi, are you trying to sock it to me?

694
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:37,953
You haven't changed.

695
00:45:38,047 --> 00:45:41,318
I'm the guy who put
your son behind bars.

696
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,574
Now,

697
00:45:42,971 --> 00:45:44,375
you want me to work under you?

698
00:45:44,624 --> 00:45:47,338
Right, at that time,

699
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:50,624
I hated you and badmouthed you so much.

700
00:45:51,234 --> 00:45:54,279
But considering the
circumstantial evidence now,

701
00:45:54,572 --> 00:45:55,844
I would have judged the case

702
00:45:56,508 --> 00:45:58,524
the same way if I were you.

703
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:02,718
It isn't because of your ability
that you've been sent here.

704
00:46:03,743 --> 00:46:05,001
What do you know?

705
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,440
It wasn't just Seung-goo's case.

706
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,473
You indicted Chief Prosecutor Seo's son,

707
00:46:08,552 --> 00:46:10,303
for his hit-and-run under the influence.

708
00:46:10,856 --> 00:46:13,036
It was the same for the drug case

709
00:46:13,361 --> 00:46:15,360
of the majority floor
leader's son-in-law.

710
00:46:16,385 --> 00:46:17,889
This time as well,

711
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:20,834
you've been sent here for doing your work.

712
00:46:20,914 --> 00:46:21,905
Enough.

713
00:46:22,818 --> 00:46:25,363
The prosecution is like home to you.

714
00:46:25,442 --> 00:46:27,457
I know it's not easy to leave.

715
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:29,659
But I promise,

716
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:32,249
I'll help you live out your convictions.

717
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:37,637
A prosecutor joining the CIO

718
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:41,190
means they're out of their mind.

Oh, Ms. Choi.

725
00:47:10,424 --> 00:47:11,795

727
00:47:16,506 --> 00:47:17,497
- Thank you.
- No problem.

728
00:47:21,546 --> 00:47:23,049
Did you get demoted here?

729
00:47:24,057 --> 00:47:26,337
Not really. I got reinstated.

730
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:28,804
People here restore digital evidence,

731
00:47:28,883 --> 00:47:31,861
and hand it over
to special investigative teams,

732
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,130
for them to catch culprits.

733
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,245
I was so envious of that.

734
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:38,798
It was so hard to join
the Investigation Unit.

735
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,854
Maybe I caused trouble to too many people.

736
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:44,383
I can't hold my curiosity, you see.

737
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:53,505
There's a job suitable for you.

738
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:56,033
Thank you. I'll devote my life.

739
00:47:56,564 --> 00:47:58,483
No, don't risk your life.

740
00:47:58,563 --> 00:48:01,012
Just don't hold your curiosity.

741
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:02,346
Now and forever.

742
00:48:03,124 --> 00:48:04,362
Don't worry about that.

(010 0497 1145)

745
00:48:21,104 --> 00:48:23,752
Are you still with those jerks?

746
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:25,615
You guys killed Min-ho, didn't you?

747
00:48:26,392 --> 00:48:27,384
"You guys."

748
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:30,935
Who are "you guys"?

749
00:48:34,192 --> 00:48:36,257
<i>The person you have
dialed isn't available...</i>

750
00:48:39,315 --> 00:48:40,306
Do Young-geol.

751
00:48:41,595 --> 00:48:42,851
Are you one of "you guys"?

752
00:48:48,238 --> 00:48:50,221
What on earth did you do to it?

753

(Lee Suk-gyu)

755
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:06,283
Hi, Suk-gyu.

756
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:07,478
Hi. Mr. Oh.

757
00:49:07,557 --> 00:49:08,549
Yes, hi.

758
00:49:09,094 --> 00:49:11,048
It seems your wife is most likely

759
00:49:11,127 --> 00:49:12,568
to be Director of the CIO.

760
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:13,639
<i>Congrats.</i>

761
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:15,935
Why don't we have a glass of soju?

762
00:49:16,432 --> 00:49:17,625
<i>Hey, why a glass?</i>

763
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,223
It has to be at least three glasses.

764
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:20,744
When should we meet up?

765
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:21,999
<i>By the way...</i>

766
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:24,281
What? Say it.

767
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:27,936
Could we meet up with Do Young-geol too?

768
00:49:30,164 --> 00:49:31,171
Do Young-geol?

769
00:49:38,757 --> 00:49:41,046
Hey, why aren't you asleep?

770
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:42,790
It's just...

771
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,542
What?

772
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:48,760
It's very hard to get
those I want on board.

773
00:49:56,721 --> 00:49:57,712
Who are they?

774
00:49:58,674 --> 00:49:59,804
It's not just one or two.

775
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:02,177
- So name just one.
- Why?

776
00:50:02,256 --> 00:50:04,160
I'll grab them by the
collar and drag them here.

777
00:50:08,354 --> 00:50:09,494
Why don't we

778
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:11,316
go watch the sunrise at dawn?

779
00:50:11,395 --> 00:50:13,365
Again? You must be insane.

780
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:14,638
The hearing is right around the corner.

781
00:50:14,717 --> 00:50:15,838
So what?

782
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:17,645
All the assemblymen

783
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:19,971
will shiver in fear at the hearing.

784
00:50:21,774 --> 00:50:23,756
It seems you're the only one on my side.

785

(Reverend Ha)

786
00:50:28,747 --> 00:50:31,126
Hello Reverend, how did it go?

787
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:33,654
I see, the day after tomorrow.

788
00:50:34,184 --> 00:50:35,422
That's good to hear.

789
00:50:36,481 --> 00:50:38,959
Yes, do you need my help with anything?

790
00:50:44,562 --> 00:50:45,784
Gosh, thank you.

791
00:50:47,058 --> 00:50:49,804
How is it working out
being the chief prosecutor in Seoul?

792
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:51,837
Gosh. I miss those times

793
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:54,101
when I was after thugs and frauds.

794
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,658
Receiving and reviewing
reports on my desk

795
00:50:56,737 --> 00:50:58,426
is killing me.

796
00:50:58,526 --> 00:50:59,682
Look at you.

797
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:02,694
You might fall sick if I make you

798
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:04,012
Prosecutor General.

799
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:07,238
My gosh. Don't get
me full of empty hope.

800
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:08,452
I might die of it.

801
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:12,555
And you never say no.

802
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,199
I'm just following your lead.

803
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:21,880
I hear you've been rivals

804
00:51:22,273 --> 00:51:24,106
with Yeon-soo since your trainee days.

805
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:28,330
Oh, please. She's an ingenuous
human rights lawyer.

806
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:29,990
She can't be my rival.

807
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,824
She was the top student.

808
00:51:32,354 --> 00:51:34,142
And you were a rank behind her.

809
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:38,104
At that time. I took one more class.

810
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:40,880
Introduction to Drinking,
Dancing, and Singing.

811
00:51:41,394 --> 00:51:42,648
You know, right?

812
00:51:45,194 --> 00:51:46,186
That's right.

813
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:50,994
Why isn't he coming?

814
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:53,505
He must be running over here by now.

815
00:51:55,539 --> 00:51:56,530
Oh.

816
00:51:57,803 --> 00:51:58,979
I'm sorry I'm late.

817
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:00,297
You're here, Mr. Choo.

818
00:52:00,811 --> 00:52:02,330
This is Assemblyman Yoo Sang-dong.

819
00:52:02,596 --> 00:52:03,834
Say hello.

820
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:06,858
Nice to meet you, sir. I'm Choo Dong-woo.

821
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:11,171
Come sit down here.

822
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:12,957
Yes.

823
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:20,277
We went to the same college.

824
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,045
Just treat me casually.

825
00:52:24,343 --> 00:52:25,334
Yes, sir.

826
00:52:28,921 --> 00:52:29,912
Let me pour you a drink.

827
00:52:32,473 --> 00:52:33,465
Mr. Choo.

828
00:52:34,456 --> 00:52:36,122
I hear you're the eldest of nine siblings.

829
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:37,728
Yes.

830
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,002
How blessed.

831
00:52:41,315 --> 00:52:42,227
Is that why?

832
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:44,688
You have a high sense of responsibility.

833
00:52:47,098 --> 00:52:48,090
You're flattering me.

834
00:52:50,387 --> 00:52:53,411
How is the air in Gangwon-do?

835
00:52:54,932 --> 00:52:56,452
I have a lot of time to think.

836
00:52:56,733 --> 00:52:58,996
Seeing you rot there

837
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,806
breaks my heart.

838
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:05,280
Sir, I'd like to have him

839
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,126
board my bandwagon.

840
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:09,936
What do you think?

841
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:16,997
Mr. Choo.

842
00:53:17,076 --> 00:53:18,068
Yes, sir.

843
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:21,884

visited you, didn't she?

(Hwang Hyun-ju, confirmed)

847
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:44,875
Goodness, I'd really like

848
00:53:44,954 --> 00:53:46,871
help even from someone random.

849
00:53:48,756 --> 00:53:51,485
Shouldn't we tell the Blue House

850
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:53,827
and fix this situation somehow?

851
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:58,806
You may be upright

852
00:53:58,885 --> 00:54:01,368
without anything shady to be revealed,

853
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,871
but we could pass out,

854
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:04,696
preparing for the
hearing and all like this.

855
00:54:05,496 --> 00:54:06,685
Gosh.

856
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,832
Come in.

857
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,443
Gosh.

858
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:18,203
Mr. Choo?

859
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,261
Who is it?

860
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,020
What an unpleasant visit.

861
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:25,804
What brings you here?

862
00:54:26,087 --> 00:54:27,821
Your offer back in Gangwon.

863
00:54:28,962 --> 00:54:30,102
Is it still valid?

864
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:31,639
Of course.

865
00:54:32,433 --> 00:54:35,687
But you refused the offer.

866
00:54:39,257 --> 00:54:40,281
I've changed my mind.

867
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:43,386
Are you joining us then?

868
00:54:43,868 --> 00:54:44,860
Resigned.

869
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:50,428

I had to prepare for the hearing
until late last night.

878
00:55:36,271 --> 00:55:37,328
Sorry I made you wait.

879
00:55:37,407 --> 00:55:39,757
I ordered in advance,
so you can finish and hurry off.

880
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:42,503
I'm busy, so that's good.

881
00:55:47,855 --> 00:55:50,366
Show the Assembly's presence to the people.

882
00:55:52,168 --> 00:55:53,737
Our presence isn't the issue.

883
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:56,199
It's to save the country.

884
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:02,615
She will be ragged after the hearing.

885
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,585
Don't be bothered too much.

886
00:56:05,256 --> 00:56:06,565
Prevention is better than a cure.

The country

888
00:56:12,395 --> 00:56:14,361

922
00:58:14,998 --> 00:58:15,989
I'm stepping outside.

923
00:58:16,502 --> 00:58:18,782
Come back quickly so
we can watch her together.

924
00:58:19,311 --> 00:58:21,232
Okay. I'll be back soon.

925
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,086
Okay.

926
00:58:22,352 --> 00:58:24,225

934
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,111
Ms. Choi.

935
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,182
Yes.

936
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:50,135
Yes.

937
00:58:50,214 --> 00:58:51,998
Are you conservative or liberal?

938
00:58:53,106 --> 00:58:54,498
I'm with the law and justice.

939
00:58:54,577 --> 00:58:56,002
Stop playing with words,

940
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:57,777
and answer properly.

941
00:58:58,377 --> 00:59:01,385
Are you conservative or liberal?
Choose either one.

942
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:03,913
If you ask,

943
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:06,148
I've tried to be

944
00:59:06,227 --> 00:59:08,226
with the alienated weak until now.

945
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:10,444
But once I get appointed,

946
00:59:10,524 --> 00:59:13,581
I'll side with the people
who respect the law and justice.

947

<i>Next is Assemblyman Park Young-soo.</i>

948
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:24,949
I'm Assemblyman Park Young-soo.

949
00:59:25,711 --> 00:59:27,495
Your son, Han Seung-goo,

950
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:29,466
was exempt from military service, right?

951
00:59:29,545 --> 00:59:31,266
Yes, for a fair reason.

952
00:59:31,346 --> 00:59:33,873
Is the fair reason,

953
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,629
autism?

954
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,116
(Diagnosed with autism, level-3 disability)

955
00:59:39,196 --> 00:59:40,405
That's right.

956
00:59:40,485 --> 00:59:41,476
All right.

957
00:59:41,972 --> 00:59:44,219
He didn't even serve
the military due to autism.

958
00:59:44,765 --> 00:59:46,312
But look.

959
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:49,461
He openly runs a business.

960
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,068
Maybe you lied about his illness

961
00:59:52,598 --> 00:59:53,774
to get him exempted.

962
00:59:53,854 --> 00:59:55,031
Do you hear yourself?

963
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:57,046
Can't an autism patient run a business?

964
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:59,389
He's only asking a question.

965
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:01,558
That guy is too mean.

966
01:00:01,637 --> 01:00:02,867
This is time to ask and answer.

967
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:04,958
So answer me, Ms. Choi.

968
01:00:06,743 --> 01:00:07,768
My son

969
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:10,515
has become an adult.

970
01:00:10,595 --> 01:00:12,300
 But he still has difficulties

971
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:14,427
carrying out a social life with people.

972
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:17,373
Disabled people must have income

973
01:00:17,452 --> 01:00:18,877
in order to become independent.

974
01:00:18,956 --> 01:00:20,459
That's why he opened a business.

975
01:00:21,237 --> 01:00:22,508
It was only possible

976
01:00:22,774 --> 01:00:25,268
with my husband's help from the start.

977
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,454
He's improved enough

978
01:00:27,533 --> 01:00:28,804
to run it by himself now.

979
01:00:29,301 --> 01:00:32,374
And I am proud of my son.

980
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:42,504
(Personnel hearing)

981
01:01:00,038 --> 01:01:03,061
Gosh, it needs to be boiled a little more.

982
01:01:03,607 --> 01:01:05,776
What are you doing? We're drinking
in the afternoon for a change.

983
01:01:05,856 --> 01:01:07,653
Here, drink up.

984
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:13,706
Why?

985
01:01:14,234 --> 01:01:16,019
Are you worried Young-geol
might not show up?

986
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,811
Don't worry.

987
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:21,339
He always acts like he's busy.

988
01:01:30,726 --> 01:01:31,718
How's your work hanging?

989
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:34,230
I closed it.

990
01:01:34,494 --> 01:01:35,423
Why?

991
01:01:35,502 --> 01:01:37,006
I don't know. The Company told me to.

992
01:01:39,585 --> 01:01:41,211
Because of what Yeon-soo visited you for?

993
01:01:43,385 --> 01:01:45,260
I was going to close it anyway.

994
01:01:45,339 --> 01:01:48,412
I retired years ago, and
they keep making me

995
01:01:48,491 --> 01:01:50,807
cover up for their messes.

996
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:54,077
What messes?

997
01:01:55,647 --> 01:01:57,105
Don't look at me like that.

998
01:01:57,184 --> 01:01:59,397
I don't know anything.

999
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,632
Gosh, I have to survive

1000
01:02:01,712 --> 01:02:03,682
on my tiny pension now.

1001
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,264
I need to marry my child off too.

1002
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:07,298
Hold on.

1003
01:02:07,546 --> 01:02:08,552
(Do Young-geol)

1004
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:13,130
Hello? Where are you?

1005
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:15,382
Where are you?

1006
01:02:15,461 --> 01:02:18,187
Hey, here. Right here.

1007
01:02:28,774 --> 01:02:29,619
What is this punk doing here?

1008
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:31,300
What are you waiting for? Sit down.

1009
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,316
I asked him to let me see you.

1010
01:02:33,582 --> 01:02:34,573
Why?

1011
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:37,613
Have a seat first.

1012
01:02:45,711 --> 01:02:48,223
I'm not at your beck and call.

1013
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,309
Goodness, look at the way you talk.

1014
01:02:52,388 --> 01:02:55,036
We just want to talk about the old days.

1015
01:02:55,115 --> 01:02:56,126
What are you doing?

1016
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:58,270
You called him out, so pour him a drink.

1017
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:02,121
Let me.

1018
01:03:03,394 --> 01:03:04,881
Don't try to pull a trick.

1019
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:06,650
I have your leash

1020
01:03:07,178 --> 01:03:08,334
in my hand.

1021
01:03:09,195 --> 01:03:10,186
I know.

1022
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:17,307
Right, let's not be too inflexible.

1023
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:19,075
Let's clink...

1024
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:38,625
Your husband's name
is Han Jung-hyun, right?

1025
01:03:39,139 --> 01:03:41,385
That's right, it's Han Jung-hyun.

1026
01:03:43,435 --> 01:03:44,691
All right.

1027
01:03:44,964 --> 01:03:48,756
Your husband has never paid
any income tax until now.

1028
01:03:49,285 --> 01:03:51,565
Nor does he have any assets. Is he jobless?

1029
01:03:56,193 --> 01:03:57,580
- Sir.
- Say it.

1030
01:03:57,961 --> 01:03:59,154
He is jobless, isn't he?

1031
01:03:59,233 --> 01:03:59,960
Why would he...

1032
01:04:00,242 --> 01:04:01,419
With all due respect,

1033
01:04:01,498 --> 01:04:03,451
please watch what you say.

1034
01:04:03,531 --> 01:04:05,017
Jobless, really?

1035
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:06,228
Don't be so rude.

1036
01:04:06,307 --> 01:04:08,508
This is my time to ask questions.

1037
01:04:08,588 --> 01:04:10,452
I called him jobless
because that's what he is.

1038
01:04:12,884 --> 01:04:13,875
Quiet down.

1039
01:04:15,908 --> 01:04:17,890
Ms. Choi, please answer.

1040
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:19,676
Okay.

1041
01:04:20,674 --> 01:04:21,629
Sir.

1042
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:26,917
More than 15 million housewives
sacrifice themselves

1043
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:30,734
for the social activities
of their family members.

1044
01:04:30,814 --> 01:04:34,168
I believe you wouldn't
consider them jobless.

1046
01:04:39,506 --> 01:04:41,212
My husband, Han Jung-hyun,

1048
01:04:45,307 --> 01:04:46,917
I'm only grateful

1049
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,843
that I married someone like him.

1050
01:05:06,096 --> 01:05:07,254
So you wanted to see me?

1051
01:05:08,393 --> 01:05:09,384
Why?

1052
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:12,441
Did your wife ask you to win me over?

1053
01:05:12,914 --> 01:05:13,979
Or,

1054
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,307
now that she's about to be appointed,

1055
01:05:20,077 --> 01:05:21,068
are you afraid?

1056
01:05:22,621 --> 01:05:24,294
How twisted you are.

1057
01:05:24,373 --> 01:05:27,053
Young-geol, this is
only to build friendship.

1058
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:28,371
Don't put things like that.

Goodness,

1061
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:35,940
you still are a poor judge of character.

1062
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:39,725
I see.

1063
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:41,989
Yes, sure. Mr. Do.

1064
01:05:42,766 --> 01:05:44,996
Let me go to the bathroom.

1065
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:46,269
Okay.

1066
01:05:52,384 --> 01:05:54,664
Darn it. What are you doing?

1067
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:58,977
Don't make a fuss over a small thing.

1068
01:06:00,019 --> 01:06:02,964
It's just water. Your pants are ruined.

1069
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:04,529

Hurry on.

01:08:17,577 --> 01:08:19,498
he was wanted for taking the lead

1105
01:08:19,577 --> 01:08:21,063
in various violent protests.

1106
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:22,815
For two years,

1107
01:08:23,328 --> 01:08:26,566
he coquetted the public power
while on the most wanted list.

1108
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,864
You met him then, didn't you?

1109
01:08:30,913 --> 01:08:32,895
- Yes.
- Why didn't you report him?

1110
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:35,659
I only followed the duty to keep
my client's information a secret.

1111
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:37,242
Your client?

1112
01:08:37,755 --> 01:08:40,299
Are you saying you were an attorney

1113
01:08:40,812 --> 01:08:42,810
of Kim Tae-yeol,

1114
01:08:43,076 --> 01:08:44,810
that ringleader of the leftist forces?

1115
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:52,379
The Constitution states
that anyone in Korea

1116
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,598
has the right to an attorney.

1117
01:08:54,677 --> 01:08:57,143
You keep asserting your duty
to maintain secrecy,

1118
01:08:57,222 --> 01:08:58,741
and his right to attorney.

1119
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:02,332
According to Article 112
of the Criminal Procedure Law,

1120
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:06,288
an attorney may report their client

1121
01:09:06,856 --> 01:09:09,863
if needed for
significant public interests.

1122
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:11,384
Don't you know?

1123
01:09:13,136 --> 01:09:14,209
Are you

1124
01:09:14,739 --> 01:09:16,659
still proud to have
given legal advice

1125
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:17,994
to Kim Tae-yeol?

1126
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:42,782
I am.

1127
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:44,319
My.

1128
01:09:45,096 --> 01:09:46,368
See you have

1129
01:09:46,931 --> 01:09:49,937
some big faith in your client.

1130
01:09:50,715 --> 01:09:52,900
How impressive.

1131
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:54,189
Impressive.

1132
01:09:54,268 --> 01:09:56,069
- Goodness.
- My.

1133
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:58,852
Is it the same for Kim A-soon,
the North Korean defector?

1134
01:09:59,606 --> 01:10:01,092
- Pardon?
- Put the photo up.

1135
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:07,234
The former singer
of Eunhasu Band in North Korea.

1136
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:10,169
The spy who caused a ruckus

1137
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,742
in the country three years ago.

1138
01:10:13,769 --> 01:10:14,697
You don't know her?

1139
01:10:14,776 --> 01:10:16,577
- What?
- What is this about?

1140
01:10:17,602 --> 01:10:20,991
Do you still think she isn't a spy

1141
01:10:24,477 --> 01:10:25,469
Yes.

1142
01:10:26,493 --> 01:10:27,748
You're the one

1143
01:10:28,278 --> 01:10:31,453
who let this disguised spy

1144
01:10:31,533 --> 01:10:34,263
Kim A-soon, go around freely

1145
01:10:34,343 --> 01:10:35,800
in this country.

1146
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,056
Well, Mr. Yoo.

1147
01:10:37,135 --> 01:10:39,353
She was cleared of her suspicion.

1148
01:10:39,432 --> 01:10:40,671
Right.

1149
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:43,199
You helped her clear her name.

1150
01:10:43,465 --> 01:10:44,703
Right?

1151
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:49,032
Yes, I defended her.

1152
01:10:49,298 --> 01:10:52,800
Are your wife and kids
still in the Philippines?

1153
01:10:54,586 --> 01:10:56,585
Goodness, poor you.

1154
01:10:56,851 --> 01:10:58,122
It must cost a lot.

1155
01:11:00,138 --> 01:11:02,253
Since when did you care so much about me?

1156
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:06,389
What is this punk doing

1157
01:11:06,468 --> 01:11:08,466
after calling me out when I'm busy?

1158
01:11:15,343 --> 01:11:16,879
What? Where is it?

1159
01:11:17,391 --> 01:11:18,415
What?

1160
01:11:19,457 --> 01:11:20,464
My car key.

1162
01:11:36,098 --> 01:11:37,585

me in jail, not him.</i>

1169

<i>South Korea is a paradise only to the rich.</i>

1170
01:12:09,843 --> 01:12:11,892
<i>It's like a pit of fire to the poor.</i>

1171
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:15,181

1172

01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:20,407
<i>I saw the real South Korea</i>

1175
01:12:20,486 --> 01:12:22,192

1176
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:24,918

<i>Stop the video.</i>

1183
01:12:42,828 --> 01:12:44,253
I got this video clip

1184
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:47,604
from a TV program
in North Korea.

1185
01:12:48,646 --> 01:12:49,867
You know that woman, right?

1186
01:12:53,157 --> 01:12:55,651
Nominee Choi, who is that woman?

1187
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,150
She's Kim A-soon.

1188
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,237
Right.

1189
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:05,190
She is Kim A-soon,
the woman you helped prove

1190
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,508
not guilty of being a spy.

1191
01:13:07,171 --> 01:13:09,488
That very woman returned to North Korea.

1192
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:12,169
She's now humiliating
our country like that.

1193
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:14,743
How are you going to take responsibility?

1194
01:13:14,822 --> 01:13:17,106
Right. How will you take responsibility?

1195
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:18,114
Say something.

1196
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:19,634
How could you say that?

1197
01:13:19,713 --> 01:13:21,154
There's no direct proof about this.

1198
01:13:21,233 --> 01:13:22,658
That video is the proof.

1199
01:13:22,738 --> 01:13:23,959
She's a spy.
