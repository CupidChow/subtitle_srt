1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:06,713
(Undercover)

2
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,903
(All places, characters, companies,)

3
00:00:12,982 --> 00:00:14,782
(and incidents in this drama
are fictitious.)

4
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:17,625
I need to give you
something. I'll be waiting.

5
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,220
You have no right to be here.

6
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:40,764
<i>I know</i>

7
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:43,107
who killed Kim Tae-yeol.

8
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,164
<i>I'm going to tell that to Choi Yeon-soo.</i>

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,437
<i>Is it Im Hyung-rak?</i>

10
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,007
It's been a while.

11
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:53,568
Nice to see you again.

12
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:58,298
Im Hyung-rak is behind Park Won-jong?

13
00:00:58,378 --> 00:00:59,868
If this information is true,

14
00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:01,372
Im Hyung-rak is the mastermind

15
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,157
of Cha Min-ho and Kim Myung-jae's cases.

16
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:08,190
How have you been?

17
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:12,605
It's a nice day for a memorial service.

18
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:16,738
Is this your husband?

19
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,150
Yes.

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,363
Oh.

21
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,446
I'm Im Hyung-rak.

22
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,951
Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,685
I'm Han Jung-hyun.

24
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:42,186
If Mr. Kim Tae-yeol were alive,

25
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,971
He would've played

26
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:46,796
a key role in Korea just like you two.

27
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,821
That's why my wife

28
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:52,056
can't give up on finding out

29
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:53,325
the truth behind his death.

30
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:59,125
You two are like-minded.

31
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:00,662
It must be...

32
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:03,751
reassuring to have each other.

33
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:06,594
I'll go up first.

34
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,954
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,126
Thank you for coming all the way here.

36
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,683
Thank you for remembering Mr. Kim Tae-yeol.

37
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:36,754
Thank you.

38
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:39,551
Excuse me.

39
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,199
Excuse me, everyone.

40
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,041
It's good to see you again.

41
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:47,020
You'll be appointed as
Chief Secretary tomorrow.

42
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,181
Congratulations.

43
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,591
Are you here to check up on me?

44
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:57,708
No, because I'm worried.

45
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:59,699
- Worried about what?
- About this country.

46
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,771
Mr. Im.

47
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:03,805
I hope you've made up your mind.

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,338
Did you think you'd see me

49
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,466
ask Director Choi to resign right here?

50
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,254
Just like Kim Myung-jae
who accepted a bribe,

51
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:15,952
and Director Choi
whose husband was a spy.

52
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:18,468
Do you know how many more people

53
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:21,241
in this administration
are pretending to be innocent

54
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,735
despite their shortcomings?

55
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,379
We can't afford to
have a war of attrition.

56
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:32,583
We still have

57
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:34,431
a long way to go.

58
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:36,030
That's right. Exactly.

59
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:38,096
And Choi's resignation

60
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:40,938
will be the first step.

61
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,007
Thanks to you two,

62
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:48,713
many people came to the memorial service.

63
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:57,100
Do you have any memory
of the deceased, Mr. Im?

64
00:03:58,903 --> 00:03:59,894
Well.

65
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:02,487
I was also very shocked

66
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,912
when I learned that he had passed.

67
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,858
Did you know Tae-yeol personally?

68
00:04:08,388 --> 00:04:10,172
No, I didn't.

69
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,183
But I believed that he was a real patriot

70
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:15,127
who cared about Korea
more than anyone else.

71
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:18,306
You're from the ANSP.

72
00:04:18,386 --> 00:04:21,268
I'm surprised to hear
you call him a patriot.

73
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,603
Though we were in different places,

74
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:25,905
we both worried about this country.

75
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:31,656
You two...

76
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:34,568
went to the same school as Mr. Kim,

77
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:36,481
so you must've known him personally.

78
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:43,485
Did your husband personally know him too?

79
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,685
I met him...

80
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,997
a few times through my wife.

81
00:04:57,287 --> 00:04:59,336
Oh, I see.

82
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:05,202
I heard the Americans
remember themselves

83
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:09,829
watching the airplanes
crashing into the Twin Towers

84
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:12,126
when the September 11 attacks occurred.

85
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:15,729
Where they watched the news,

86
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:17,997
and who they watched it with.

87
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:19,860
When something traumatizes you,

88
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,165
it gets imprinted on your memory.

89
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,288
Do the three of you

90
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,841
also remember the day Mr. Kim died?

91
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:42,682
I apologize.

92
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:44,620
I'm sure it's a painful memory.

93
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,186
I shouldn't have brought it up.

94
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:48,218
Do you...

95
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,010
remember that day, Mr. Im?

96
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,708
You didn't know him personally
like my wife or Mr. Kang,

97
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:00,834
so maybe you don't have
any special memories of him.

98
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:10,021
What else would a government employee do?
I was probably working.

99
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,093
I hope...

100
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,345
your job wasn't
to catch student activists.

101
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:22,733
Mr. Han always stays
by Director Choi's side,

102
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:24,068
and guards her.

103
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,673
Isn't it impressive?

104
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:33,238
<i>The memorial service will begin shortly.</i>

105
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:34,510
All right. Let's all go up.

106
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:36,638
<i>Please come to the grave, everyone.</i>

107
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,254
(Episode 13)

108
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,079
(The 30th memorial
service for Kim Tae-yeol)

109
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:10,085
(Spearhead of Democracy, Kim Tae-yeol)

110
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,183
Have you made up your mind?

111
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,417
Yes.

112
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,899
Our investigation into
the Kim Myung-jae case

113
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:15,168
- has made some headway.
- No.

114
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,108
I want you to resign
by the end of this week.

115
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:21,860
I can't do that.

116
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:27,198
Are you going to hold out then?

117
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:30,474
We have found out
who bribed Kim Myung-jae.

118
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:31,545
Who is it?

119
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:34,133
(The memorial service for Kim Tae-yeol)

120
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,472
I can't tell you now.

121
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:48,649
Are you kidding?

122
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:50,387
What worries me more is our future

123
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,616
that you're about to ruin,

124
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:52,931
not the chances of failing

125
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:54,201
to find out who bribed him.

126
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,067
I'll finish it as quickly as possible.

127
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:58,343
Give me a chance.

128
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:01,888
Choi Yeon-soo.

129
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,247
I have no intention to hold out.

130
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:11,883
Give me a week.

131
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:13,870
I'll finish it in a week.

132
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,936
What can you do in a week?

133
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,173
If I succeed,

134
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:20,062
we can find out
who trapped Kim Myung-jae.

135
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:23,092
Whether I succeed or fail,

136
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:24,673
resign after a week.

137
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:27,683
Just give me a week. Please.

138
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:32,229
You take care of state affairs

139
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:33,829
regardless of time and place.

140
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:38,019
You seem to be busy,

141
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:39,959
so I'll leave.

142
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,416
Why did you do that earlier?

143
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:02,290
That man.

144
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:03,810
I don't like him.

145
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,786
Wait a minute. I need
to give you something.

146
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:11,183
Let's go.

147
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,255
Yeon-soo.

148
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,464
<i>Mr. Im Hyung-rak.</i>

149
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,737
<i>What was the budget</i>

150
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,711
<i>for the NIS' special
activity expenses last year?</i>

151
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,802
<i>As far as I know,</i>

152
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,422
<i>It was 723 billion,
382 million and 376,000 won.</i>

153
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,824
<i>More than 700 billion won was used</i>

154
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:04,907
<i>for your special activity expenses.</i>

155
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:08,129
<i>Right? Tell us the amount with receipts.</i>

156
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,130
<i>The NIS isn't obliged
to collect receipts</i>

157
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,022
<i>for its special activity expenses.</i>

158
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:20,294
(The Budget Transparency
Act fail to pass)

159
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,603
(due to Kim Myung-jae's death)

160
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,321
Yes?

161
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:35,568
What is this?

162
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:36,951
We found out that Park Won-jong sent

163
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,181
a diplomatic pouch from Switzerland,
so we tracked it down.

164
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,661
It was sent to Italy,
and then arrived at Incheon Airport.

165
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,341
And Im Hyung-rak took it.

166
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,106
- Is this Im Hyung-rak?
- Yes.

167
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,803
He picked it up himself.

168
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:54,397
What's in the pouch?

169
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,628
We haven't found that out yet.

170
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:00,550
Is Park Won-jong involved in the use

171
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,594
of the NIS' special activity budget?

172
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:05,011
I'm not sure. He's in charge of finance,

173
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:06,980
so I think he manages funds for Im.

174
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,292
There's no way to find out

175
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:12,751
where they used the budget, right?

176
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,069
You know it's impossible.

177
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,614
Okay. Then please find out

178
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:18,677
what was in the diplomatic pouch.

179
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:19,749
Yes, ma'am.

<i>Let's have a cup of coffee.</i>

183
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:42,769
Hey.

185

Meet him again

186
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,700
and warn him

187
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:58,153
not to do anything stupid.

188
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:05,791
Your wife found out about everything?

189
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:07,321
But why did you meet Im Hyung-rak?

190
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:08,466
I didn't mean to meet him.

191
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,538
He came to the memorial service.

192
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,841
He went there on purpose?

193
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:17,901
Yes, I'm sure.

194
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,426
He came to check if Kang Choong-mo

195
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:21,884
asked Yeon-soo to resign,
and to come between them.

196
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:26,158
Gosh, I don't know about this.

197
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:27,910
But

198
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:30,863
Mr. Im is on the move himself.

199
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:33,475
It's a serious thing.

200
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:37,042
Just back off and ignore it.

201
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:39,041
He's trying to bind
Yeon-soo hand and foot

202
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:41,189
to remove her from her position.
How can I ignore it?

203
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:43,086
You said your wife will resign soon.

204
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,201
Then you can stop what you're doing now.

205
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:46,822
No.

206
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,571
I won't let him do as he pleases.

207
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,134
What will you do then?

208
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:54,196
They take every means possible.

209
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,207
And I'll do just the same.

210
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:03,608
So you're

211
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,635
planning to get rid
of all the obstacles?

212
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,878
You don't mind revealing
your identity to the Blue House,

213
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:11,623
and you're ready to take on all the risks?

214
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:14,884
Do you know what that means?

215
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:19,069
You may put your
wife and children in danger.

216
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:22,467
You need to survive.

217
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:24,784
Do you think people
put up with dirty things

218
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:26,489
because they're not disgusted by them?

219
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:29,091
They do because they need to survive.

220
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,826
What really matters is your own life.

221
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,903
Vengeance? All right.

222
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:37,971
But what's the point of
getting back at them

223
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:39,082
after suffering losses?

224
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:41,702
That's why I'm going to

225
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:44,511
make the first move.

Goodness.

377
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:01,971
- Aren't you tired?
- Oh! What is this?

378
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:03,661
Obviously, it's coffee.

379
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:05,909
Director Choi!

380
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:08,490
- Director.
- What is it? Did you find something?

381
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,362
Take a look at this.

382
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,173
- Is it one of the borrowed-name accounts?
- Yes.

(Kang Kyeong-ja)

384

8.3 billion was transferred

to Kang Kyeong-ja's account.

386

387

- Yes, sir.

391
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:56,545

(Kang Kyeong-ja)

393
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:00,592
Good shot. Oh, boy.

394
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:04,575
Now what?

395
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,230
You did a great job earlier,

396
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,796
but this one was terrible.

397
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:09,797
Jeez.

398
00:28:10,293 --> 00:28:12,691
You're almost a stalker now.

399
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:13,763
A stalker?

400
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:15,745
You know that I like you.

401
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:18,598
I've found out why you're so confident.

402
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:22,204
Go away if you don't want to get hit.

403
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:25,366
Your mother-in-law is very wealthy.

404
00:28:25,446 --> 00:28:27,412
She lives on a pension.

405
00:28:27,993 --> 00:28:29,330
- Stop the nonsense.
- Come on.

406
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:32,138
She invested over eight
billion won in stocks.

407
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:34,369
But she bought at the top of the market.

408
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:37,113
But that's not her money,

409
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:39,839
- is it?
- Jeez.

410
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,264
No one would've noticed it

411
00:28:43,343 --> 00:28:44,830
if you had returned the money

412
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:46,565
after making a profit.

413
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:49,044
But the information was false.

414
00:28:49,123 --> 00:28:51,461
You borrowed the money for a short while

415
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,212
but lost too much.
You're in trouble now.

416
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:56,067
Okay. Enjoy making up stories.

417
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:59,258
(Mother-in-law)

418
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:01,788
- Hello?
- <i>Won-jong.</i>

419
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:04,710
<i>I received a summons from the CIO.</i>

420
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:05,950
<i>What is it?</i>

421
00:29:06,373 --> 00:29:08,119
Your mother-in-law is
going through so much

422
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:09,190
because of you.

423
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,251
Are you threatening me now?

424
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:16,393
No, I'm consoling you.

425
00:29:17,898 --> 00:29:19,120
You're the tail.

426
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,903
What we want to get is the body.

427
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:24,590
Mr. Cha who committed suicide... Suicide?

428
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,008
Anyway, I'm reminded of Mr. Cha

429
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:28,078
who committed suicide.

430
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,582
I'm worried about you.

431
00:29:39,283 --> 00:29:40,274
Good shot.

432
00:30:13,556 --> 00:30:14,547
Mr. Park.

433
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,282
Why are you here on a weekend?

434
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,840
You'd better return
8.3 billion won immediately.

435
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,117
Hey.

436
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,886
We have to send in
an interim statement for this quarter.

437
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:31,093
I told you I'd do it.

438
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:33,683
We can be tracked down because of that.

439
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:36,906
It's none of your business, you jerk.

440
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:39,154
Get out.

441
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:41,137
Get out!

442
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,182
No, I'm consoling you.

443
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:53,299
You're the tail.

444
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,530
What we want to get is the body.

445
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:58,538
Mr. Cha who committed suicide... Suicide?

446
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,167
Anyway, I'm reminded of Mr. Cha
who committed suicide.

447
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:03,776
I'm worried about you.

448
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:06,290
Darn it.

449
00:31:42,811 --> 00:31:44,032

(Total gain and loss)

451
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,519
Gosh.

452
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:50,264
This is driving me crazy.

453
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:15,336
His mother-in-law's account?

454
00:32:15,415 --> 00:32:17,133
Yes, I'm sure.

455
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,190
Where's Park Won-jong now?

456
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,363
He briefly stayed in his office and left.

457
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,322
You may leave.

458
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,971
Oh, boy.

459
00:32:51,194 --> 00:32:52,415
Have you met Lee Suk-gyu?

460
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:55,383
Yes, I have.

461
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:56,455
Anything suspicious?

462
00:32:58,646 --> 00:32:59,677
<i>That's why I'm going to...</i>

463
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:00,876
make the first move.

464
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,603
Like what?

465
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:07,276
Did you find anything?

466
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:09,010
Nothing. What can there be?

467
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:10,168
He's always the same.

468
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:12,233
He's just stressed out and nervous.

469
00:33:12,313 --> 00:33:14,543
- Nothing else.
- Are you sure? Is that all?

470
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:16,526
Yes, I'm sure.

471
00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:18,774
Mr. Do.

472
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,925
Thank you for getting me this taxi

473
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:25,357
when even my tiny pension was seized.

474
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:28,131
But don't call me over all the time.

475
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,202
For goodness' sake.

476
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,936
I told you.

477
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:33,415
If you want to quit.
I'll let you quit forever.

478
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:38,041
Why do you say that again?

479
00:33:38,122 --> 00:33:39,287
That's not what I mean.

480
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,482
You call me over so often,
so I can't take jobs.

481
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:42,557
(Executive Director)

482
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:44,309
You don't have to talk that way.

483
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,381
Hello, Mr. Im.

484
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:56,976
Get Park Won-jong and bring him to me.

485
00:33:57,056 --> 00:33:59,525
Do you mean, Chief Director Park Won-jong?

486
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,030
Go get him right now.

487
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:02,270
Yes, sir.

488
00:34:02,943 --> 00:34:04,747
Thank you for giving me another chance.

489
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,147
What do I do? Can I go?

490
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:12,218
Jeez.

491
00:34:15,571 --> 00:34:16,616
Kwang-cheol.

492
00:34:16,696 --> 00:34:20,104
Track down Park Won-jong's
phone, credit cards,

493
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:21,175
and car now.

494
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:23,157
Don't ask questions.

495
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,388
It's our chance to return to work.

496
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:27,563
Come over here now. Bye.

497
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:41,318
(Choo Dong-woo)

498
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,296
Mr. Park.

499
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,042
You're forbidden from leaving the country.

500
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:51,700
Are you trying to kill me now?

501
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,266
We didn't do it.

502
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,993
I told you I'm worried about you.

503
00:34:57,002 --> 00:34:59,232
It's not too late. Go turn yourself in.

504
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:09,660
(Airport Terminal)

505
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,146
Darn it!

506
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:28,087
What the...

507
00:35:42,897 --> 00:35:44,351
He's still at the airport terminal.

508
00:35:59,386 --> 00:36:00,378
What?

509
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:07,543
Darn it!

510
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:13,317
Gosh.

511
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:20,398
- Director.
- Yes?

512
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:23,495
Mr. Jeong lost Park Won-jong.

513
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:25,300
What? Our counterpart

514
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,665
must be searching
for him desperately too.

515
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:30,406
He turned off his phone
and got away from us.

516
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:32,389
They've forbidden him
from leaving the country.

517
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,621
If he gets caught,
we may not be able to find him.

518
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:35,923
I don't think he trusts us.

519
00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:49,264
It won't take long.

520
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:52,655
Don't go anywhere. Stand by.

521
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:54,733
Why should I do that?

522
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:56,407
I don't know what you're doing,

523
00:37:56,486 --> 00:37:58,220
but don't get me involved in it.

524
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:01,691
I said, stand by.

525
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:07,426
I don't know anything.

526
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:12,878
Your fare is 78,000 won. Remember that.

527
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:16,862
This way.

528
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:46,409
Im Hyung-rak, speaking.

529
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,382
I've committed a grave sin, sir.

530
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:52,841
Mr. Park.

531
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:55,118
Where are you?

532
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,048
I must've been out of my mind.

533
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:11,048
I'll return the money by all means.

534
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:14,006
You still feel uncomfortable with me.

535
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:15,263
I understand everything.

536
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:17,365
Don't worry. Just come back.

537
00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:20,203
Does that mean...

538
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,407
Do you really forgive me?

539
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,391
Of course, I do.

540
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,365
Are you sure?

541
00:39:58,014 --> 00:39:59,731
<i>Come back first. And then we'll talk.</i>

542
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:02,510
Oh.

543
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:04,859
I see.

544
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,962
Thank you.

545
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:11,217
I'll return soon.

546
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:43,047
Darn.

547
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:47,525
Darn it.

548
00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:49,508
Mr. Do.

549
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:51,986
It seems he kept his phone on,

550
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:53,553
and lured us here.

551
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:55,473
I see.

552
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:00,901
Why this little...

553
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:04,039
He's dead meat when I catch him.

554
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:30,540
Welcome.

Welcome.

558
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,550

(Name: Park Won-jong)

562
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:52,787
Is Director Choi inside?

563
00:41:55,283 --> 00:41:56,505
She went to work.

564
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:58,736
On a weekend?

565
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,488
Unbelievable.

566
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:04,206
Let me make a call with the phone here.

567
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,702
- What's the matter?
- Hurry.

568
00:42:09,174 --> 00:42:10,396
I need to meet her.

569
00:42:10,982 --> 00:42:11,974
Hurry.

570
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:25,633
Hello, it's me. Don't hang up.

571
00:42:26,187 --> 00:42:27,408
Someone came to the house.

572
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:33,374
This is Park Won-jong.

573
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,092
Come to the CIO.

574
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:39,587
You don't want to see me dead.

575
00:42:40,596 --> 00:42:42,269
Im Hyung-rak got all
his men to look for me.

576
00:42:42,348 --> 00:42:44,066
They're probably there too.

577
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,553
Wait, Mr. Im is trying to kill you?

578
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:49,706
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

579
00:42:49,785 --> 00:42:52,448
Was he behind Cha Min-ho's murder?

580
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,766

581
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:55,254

00:42:58,246 --> 00:42:59,753
This isn't time for a phone interview.

584
00:43:02,724 --> 00:43:03,946
I'll send the police there.

585
00:43:04,026 --> 00:43:05,692
What... Look.

586
00:43:06,536 --> 00:43:08,501
Im Hyung-rak has
influence on the police too.

587
00:43:08,882 --> 00:43:10,368
Then I'll send my people.

588
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:15,325
Are you sure you want
to get Im Hyung-rak?

589
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:16,427
Yes.

590
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:17,596
Okay.

591
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:19,861
Then I will...

592
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:24,322
The smoking gun.

593
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,322
I know where it is.

594
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:28,183
If you want to catch Im Hyung-rak,

595
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,978
you'll need it for sure.

596
00:43:30,057 --> 00:43:31,049
What is it?

597
00:43:31,296 --> 00:43:32,969
Then I'll request a search warrant now

598
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:34,192
Don't be so frustrating.

599
00:43:34,272 --> 00:43:36,768
If you follow that darn procedure,
you won't get anything.

600
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:38,175
Without following those steps,

601
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:40,917
That smoking gun
won't work as evidence.

00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:43,723
Don't you know who Im Hyung-rak is?

604
00:43:44,236 --> 00:43:46,202
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

605
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:49,688
She just doesn't get it.

606
00:43:51,689 --> 00:43:53,176
The CIO is hopeless too.

607
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:01,620
He just left.

608
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,356
We must not let him go.

609
00:44:03,436 --> 00:44:04,427
I know.

610
00:44:06,595 --> 00:44:07,586

Why?

614
00:44:25,468 --> 00:44:27,202
Get in first. Let's talk on the way.

615
00:44:30,193 --> 00:44:31,416
That smoking gun.

00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:33,167
Find it with me.

617
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:35,416
Why should I?

618
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:37,553
Im Hyung-rak must be
caught for you to survive.

619
00:44:43,877 --> 00:44:44,868
What about you?

620
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:46,602
Im Hyung-rak must be caught

Gosh.

Mr. Im, Park Won-jong just

631
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:09,627

Darn.

These punks must be heading
to the CIO.

00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:27,987
Yes, sir.

Come out quickly.

661
00:49:41,919 --> 00:49:44,380
If we can't find that tablet PC,
everything will be over.

662
00:49:44,629 --> 00:49:46,796
Our survival is dependent
on his survival, okay?

663
00:49:46,877 --> 00:49:48,346
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

You can't just leave like this
after working me like a horse.

00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:56,321
Give me 100,000 won at least.

Everyone's about to go down now.

Hey, track down

- Hurry up.

Did you take the tablet PC?

678
00:50:36,122 --> 00:50:37,345
How did you know?

679
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:39,823
Listen up.

<i>You know what I mean, right?</i>

682
00:50:44,487 --> 00:50:46,025
He's tracking down
your phone and car,

683
00:50:46,106 --> 00:50:48,002
so abandon your car
and turn your phone off.

684
00:50:48,082 --> 00:50:50,498
- I have no time for that.
- Just listen to me.

685
00:50:51,508 --> 00:50:54,729
You need to avoid being traced.
He's got a gun.

686
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,473
<i>I'll come pick you up. Where are you?</i>

687
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,309
He's here. Let's go.

688
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:57,873
I need a phone.

689
00:51:58,882 --> 00:51:59,874
Why?

690
00:52:00,865 --> 00:52:02,335
Before I meet Director Choi,

691
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,839
I want to bargain a bit.

692
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:09,003
Mr. Oh, can you lend him your phone?

693
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:10,302
Okay.

694
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:12,279
- Your phone is off, right?
- Yes.

695
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:13,771
Here.

696
00:52:18,762 --> 00:52:19,754
It's me.

697
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:21,905
How did it go?

698
00:52:21,985 --> 00:52:22,976
Hold on.

699
00:52:27,223 --> 00:52:28,215
Director.

700
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,831
I risked my life to get it out.

701
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,660
What will you do for me?

702
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:35,869
If you cooperate with the investigation.

703
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:37,385
We'll extenuate your circumstances.

704
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:39,137
What are you saying, extenuate?

705
00:52:39,403 --> 00:52:40,395
My gosh.

706
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:42,298
Is that all you can offer in exchange

707
00:52:42,378 --> 00:52:44,112
for evidence worth 370 billion won?

708
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:47,087
Put Jung-hyun on.

709
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:51,830
Here.

710
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:55,778
Yes, the mid-point?

711
00:52:56,788 --> 00:52:58,026
Where?

712
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,613
Okay.

713
00:53:02,026 --> 00:53:02,753
Mr. Oh.

714
00:53:03,017 --> 00:53:04,009
Oh.

715
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:30,581
Darn it.

716
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:34,564
How did they know to abandon the car?

717
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:37,043
His phone is off too.

718
00:53:39,756 --> 00:53:42,466
Oh Pil-jae, this crazy old geezer.

719
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:06,066
Gosh, look at that guy.

720
00:54:06,145 --> 00:54:07,317
He won't even look ahead.

721
00:54:08,657 --> 00:54:09,879
What? Hey!

722
00:54:17,597 --> 00:54:18,589
Hey!

723
00:54:19,085 --> 00:54:20,306
Darn it.

724
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:41,461
What...

725
00:54:42,204 --> 00:54:43,196
Did we lose him?

726
00:54:43,707 --> 00:54:44,699
Darn it.

727
00:54:45,528 --> 00:54:46,750
This is bad.

728
00:54:47,178 --> 00:54:48,367
Where are you going?

729
00:54:49,674 --> 00:54:50,895
Darn.

730
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:08,731
Here. Right outside that street,

731
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,032
we'll see the taxi.

732
00:55:22,228 --> 00:55:23,682
You rat.

733
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,603
What? Goodness, get off me.

734
00:55:27,682 --> 00:55:28,842
Let go of it.

735
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:30,144
Hey.

736
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:32,391
Long time no see.

737
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,392
Mr. Park...

738
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:35,878
Won-jong.

739
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,708
Why did you bother running away?

740
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,819
Is this it?

741
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:46,075
Yes.

742
00:55:46,571 --> 00:55:47,562
Mr. Do.

743
00:55:48,372 --> 00:55:49,792
If we go to Switzerland with it,

744
00:55:50,801 --> 00:55:52,205
we can withdraw 370 billion won.

745
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:53,280
Oh.

746
00:55:53,776 --> 00:55:54,998
You guys and I...

747
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:56,939
can go to Switzerland together,

748
00:55:57,494 --> 00:55:58,981
and share the money.

749
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:01,725
Hey.

750
00:56:02,717 --> 00:56:05,132
- Let's say I take the money.
- Right.

751
00:56:05,211 --> 00:56:07,115
Why would I share it with you?

752
00:56:07,194 --> 00:56:09,176
If I were to do that.
I'd take it all alone.

753
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:12,789
Don't be ridiculous.

754
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,391
What?

755
00:56:15,887 --> 00:56:17,605
What?

756
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:18,799
What is this?

757
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:20,386
("Seoul Famous Restaurant Guide Book")

758
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:34,201
("Seoul Famous Restaurant Guide Book")

759
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,440
You little...

760
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:37,936
Ouch, Mr. Do. Wait.

761
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:39,423
- What, the restaurant guide book?
- No.

762
00:56:39,502 --> 00:56:41,237
This isn't the one. Mr. Do.

763
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,690
(Day off)

764
00:56:48,459 --> 00:56:49,451
Goodness.

765
00:56:55,615 --> 00:56:56,638
What should we do?

766
00:57:04,092 --> 00:57:05,314
What?

767
00:57:08,074 --> 00:57:09,066
You..

768
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:11,411
Did you know he'd do that?

769
00:57:12,288 --> 00:57:13,280
I guess.

770
00:57:14,272 --> 00:57:15,263
Let's go.

771
00:57:18,238 --> 00:57:19,229
(Day off)

772
00:57:57,254 --> 00:57:58,493
(Day off)

773
00:58:00,246 --> 00:58:01,237
Thanks.

774
00:58:02,477 --> 00:58:04,442
No problem. Take care.

775
00:58:06,956 --> 00:58:07,947
Goodbye.

776
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:31,578
Suk-gyu.

777
00:58:45,509 --> 00:58:46,501
I'm sorry.

778
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,953
I told you not to trust people.

779
00:59:10,645 --> 00:59:11,817
Mr. Han.

780
00:59:12,826 --> 00:59:14,064
Mr. Han.

781
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,526
Mr. Han.

782
00:59:19,288 --> 00:59:21,005
Are you awake?

783
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:25,287
Yeon-soo.

784
00:59:25,534 --> 00:59:26,756
Goodness.

785
00:59:32,094 --> 00:59:34,705
What on earth is going on?

786
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:37,432
What happened?

787
00:59:38,936 --> 00:59:39,927
I'm sorry.

788
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,149
I told you not to trust people.

789
00:59:48,457 --> 00:59:49,679
I lost it.

790
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,043
Are you saying some guy came

791
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:57,097
and stole that tablet PC,
the crucial evidence?

792
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,080
Did you see who it was?

793
01:00:11,557 --> 01:00:12,549
Goodness.

794
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:20,249
You're bleeding.

795
01:00:23,274 --> 01:00:26,248
Let's hurry to
the hospital first. Goodness.

796
01:00:27,488 --> 01:00:28,710
I'm okay.

797
01:00:42,691 --> 01:00:44,410
Goodness.

798
01:00:51,632 --> 01:00:52,887
(Taxi)

799
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:14,007

800
01:01:18,989 --> 01:01:20,015
Hello?

801
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:21,707
<i>Mr. Oh, I'm Im Hyung-rak.</i>

802
01:01:22,964 --> 01:01:24,186
Who...

803
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:27,442
Yes, this is Oh Pil-jae.

804
01:01:27,753 --> 01:01:30,230
Bring me the thing that Lee Suk-gyu took.

805
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:32,912
I don't understand what you mean.

806
01:01:33,012 --> 01:01:35,886
Bring it to me and
you'll be rewarded. If not,

807
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:39,109
you will die.

808
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,862
Hello?

809
01:02:38,056 --> 01:02:39,279
Long time no see.

810
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:41,262
I didn't expect to see you like this.

811
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:48,483
Oh, right.

812
01:02:55,457 --> 01:02:57,176
Is this what you were looking for?

813
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,901
I guess it's quite valuable.

814
01:03:03,902 --> 01:03:05,558
(Enter pass code)

815
01:03:05,638 --> 01:03:07,558

(Total)

817
01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:17,920
Mr. Oh, keep working hard

818
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:19,584
in your life like this.

819
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:22,370
- Pardon?
- That's all you need to do.

820
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,608
Oh, I see. Right.

821
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:29,829
By the way...

822
01:03:31,987 --> 01:03:32,990
What?

823
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:37,154
I'm wondering about the
reward that you mentioned earlier.

824
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,137
I see.

825
01:03:39,218 --> 01:03:41,448
Right, right.

826
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:07,789
Isn't this enough?

827
01:04:11,062 --> 01:04:12,300
Well,

828
01:04:13,646 --> 01:04:16,065
even when you pick up cash on the street.

829
01:04:17,509 --> 01:04:18,979
Considering the trade ethics...

830
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,514
Goodness.

831
01:04:22,283 --> 01:04:24,170
You were looking for it yourself.

832
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:25,983
So that thing must be quite important.

833
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:39,419
Goodness.

834
01:05:14,222 --> 01:05:16,420
Mr. Oh, you have

835
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:19,659
very dangerous ideas
and memories in your head.

836
01:05:22,815 --> 01:05:25,872
I guess they should
be erased immediately.

837
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:29,094
Right, of course.

838
01:05:32,005 --> 01:05:33,016
I will erase them.

839
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,581
Can I trust you?

840
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,581
Of course.

841
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:39,229
Well, there's nothing to erase
because I don't know anything.

842
01:05:39,308 --> 01:05:40,300
If you don't erase

843
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,266
your ideas and memories completely,

844
01:05:46,266 --> 01:05:47,735
I will go

845
01:05:48,249 --> 01:05:49,718
do it myself at any time.

846
01:05:52,727 --> 01:05:54,445
Do you understand

847
01:05:56,694 --> 01:05:57,932
what I mean?

848
01:06:00,692 --> 01:06:01,898
Yes.

849
01:06:02,907 --> 01:06:04,129
Good.

850
01:06:05,154 --> 01:06:06,624
You can go now.

851
01:06:14,343 --> 01:06:15,564
Mr. Oh.

852
01:06:23,282 --> 01:06:24,505
The compensation.

853
01:06:25,266 --> 01:06:26,488
Take this with you.

854
01:07:04,547 --> 01:07:06,017
Darn it.

855
01:07:09,522 --> 01:07:12,478
What have I done, Suk-gyu?

856
01:07:18,048 --> 01:07:19,518
(Executive Director)

857
01:07:29,236 --> 01:07:30,227
Mr. Im.

858
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:32,441
I'm sorry.

859
01:07:33,945 --> 01:07:35,928
But you know.

860
01:07:36,689 --> 01:07:38,344
That money... Your money.

861
01:07:38,424 --> 01:07:40,824
<i>I doubled the amount for you.</i>

862
01:07:40,903 --> 01:07:43,464
My money? Did you say, my money?

863
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:44,868
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

864
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:46,355
If you forgive me.

865
01:07:46,621 --> 01:07:47,613
I will make it

866
01:07:48,108 --> 01:07:49,100
three times... No.

867
01:07:49,763 --> 01:07:52,490
More than four times
the amount, sir.

868
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,562
<i>Hey, you punk!</i>

869
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:57,977
That money was the seed money to rebuild
this collapsing country.

870
01:07:58,057 --> 01:08:00,225
You wasted the people's precious tax money!

871
01:08:00,304 --> 01:08:02,534
<i>You parasite.</i>

872
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:09,244
I will...

873
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,465
make sure to restore it.

874
01:08:12,896 --> 01:08:14,403
I'll spend all my fortune if I must,

875
01:08:14,483 --> 01:08:18,105
and make sure
to pay it back, sir.

876
01:08:18,185 --> 01:08:19,423
<i>In your next life,</i>

877
01:08:21,176 --> 01:08:22,910
be a patriot.

878
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:24,399
<i>Mr. Do.</i>

879
01:08:28,381 --> 01:08:29,293
Yes, sir.

880
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,106
Like I said, make him sign the paper,

881
01:08:31,603 --> 01:08:32,595
and leave him there.

882
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:37,320
Okay, I got it.

883
01:08:38,808 --> 01:08:41,489
No. No, Mr. Im.

884
01:08:41,568 --> 01:08:42,960
- Stay still, you punk.
- No!

885
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:43,967
Don't move!

886
01:08:44,047 --> 01:08:45,950
Mr. Do, spare me.

887
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,686
- You punk.
- Mr. Do, please.

888
01:08:47,765 --> 01:08:48,925
- Sign the paper.
- Please.

889
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:50,164
No.

890
01:08:50,244 --> 01:08:51,421
- I can't.
- Sign it.

891
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,492
- I can't.
- Darn it.

892
01:08:53,235 --> 01:08:54,891
Mr. Im wants us to get you to sign

893
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:56,705
the written promise and leave.

894
01:08:58,458 --> 01:08:59,449
The written promise?

895
01:09:00,251 --> 01:09:01,473
Really?

896
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,840
You little...

897
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,022
If we were to kill you,
we would've done it already.

898
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:06,902
Do it quickly.

899
01:09:08,389 --> 01:09:09,380
Oh.

900
01:09:09,977 --> 01:09:10,969
Okay.

901
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,619
Got it.

902
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,850
I'll sign it.

903
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,320
(Park Won-jong)

904
01:09:26,303 --> 01:09:27,789
Done.

905
01:09:28,551 --> 01:09:29,542
Let's go.

906
01:09:33,276 --> 01:09:34,268
Hold on.

907
01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:37,608
Will today be

908
01:09:38,482 --> 01:09:40,216
our last time seeing him?

909
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:43,121
- Right.
- That won't do.

910
01:09:43,608 --> 01:09:46,582
It'll be upsetting then.

911
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:49,405
Mr. Do.

912
01:09:49,918 --> 01:09:51,388
- Mr. Do.
- What was it again?

913
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:54,300
Am I starving myself?

914
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,866
We aren't in the same league, punk?

915
01:09:56,267 --> 01:09:57,505
I shouldn't play smart,

916
01:09:57,618 --> 01:09:59,337
and do what I'm told?

917
01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:02,079
Just do what I'm told?

918
01:10:06,311 --> 01:10:08,028
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

919
01:10:08,311 --> 01:10:09,533
Okay.

920
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:00,750
Gosh.

921
01:12:01,262 --> 01:12:03,244
You really are a professional.

922
01:12:04,766 --> 01:12:06,653
I didn't imagine that I'd be sitting here,

923
01:12:06,733 --> 01:12:09,210
so how did you find me here?

924
01:12:14,945 --> 01:12:16,168
Why, you want to kill me?

925
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,878
Aren't you curious though?

926
01:12:21,655 --> 01:12:23,620
Why I betrayed you.

927
01:12:27,789 --> 01:12:30,515
Anyone can do that over money.

928
01:12:35,586 --> 01:12:38,047
Guess how much I got for betraying you.

929
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,781
This.

930
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:47,764
The price for betraying you.

931
01:12:53,252 --> 01:12:55,746
Darn it. I'm always one to get fooled.

932
01:12:56,986 --> 01:12:58,209
Beat me.

933
01:12:59,499 --> 01:13:01,497
I'm ready, so beat me up.

934
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,935
Do it now!

935
01:13:21,395 --> 01:13:22,386
Thank you

936
01:13:23,395 --> 01:13:24,864
for everything you've done for me.

937
01:13:26,633 --> 01:13:27,625
Suk-gyu.

938
01:13:42,713 --> 01:13:44,266
Thank you.

939
01:13:59,128 --> 01:14:01,342
Park Won-jong seems to have leaked

940
01:14:01,932 --> 01:14:03,637
something else other than the tablet PC.

941
01:14:04,942 --> 01:14:06,625
Pardon? What could that be?

942
01:14:06,705 --> 01:14:08,895
The list of borrowed-name accounts
for the Widow's Cruse Project.

943
01:14:10,075 --> 01:14:12,288
I'm sure Choi Yeon-soo has the list.

944
01:14:13,864 --> 01:14:15,085
Was the original copy

945
01:14:15,364 --> 01:14:17,577
that I secured and brought to you.

946
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:20,962
We underestimated Lee Suk-gyu.

947
01:14:23,299 --> 01:14:24,342
I'm sorry, sir.

948
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:26,637
He even came here with Park Won-jong.

949
01:14:27,513 --> 01:14:28,608
Leave it up to us.

950
01:14:28,688 --> 01:14:30,513
We'll handle it without
making any mistakes...

951
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,400
Good work.

952
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:34,718
- Pardon?
- You may leave.

953
01:14:36,966 --> 01:14:37,958
Yes, sir.

954
01:14:38,702 --> 01:14:39,693
Mr. Im...

955
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:54,367
(The fishing ground is open)

956
01:15:18,743 --> 01:15:21,915
(Braised mackerel)

957
01:15:24,213 --> 01:15:26,905
(Ingredients: two mackerels)

958
01:15:36,144 --> 01:15:37,136
Dad, what are you doing?

959
01:15:38,127 --> 01:15:39,349
Braised mackerel.

960
01:15:42,106 --> 01:15:43,576
Why are you writing this though?

961
01:15:44,093 --> 01:15:45,269
Braised mackerel, spicy pork.

962
01:15:45,348 --> 01:15:47,050
You know all the recipes.

963
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:55,528
I keep getting forgetful these days.

964
01:15:56,289 --> 01:15:57,281
You're lying.

965
01:15:58,562 --> 01:16:01,255
You like me, and that's not a lie.

966
01:16:01,742 --> 01:16:03,460
You said that when I was asleep.

967
01:16:05,989 --> 01:16:08,186
When I said I liked you,

968
01:16:09,789 --> 01:16:11,011
I wasn't lying.

969
01:16:12,451 --> 01:16:13,673
When I said

970
01:16:14,186 --> 01:16:15,903
I liked your mom and Seung-mi,

971
01:16:18,152 --> 01:16:19,622
I wasn't lying.

972
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:24,395
But...

973
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,587
"I'm sorry I lied.

974
01:16:27,861 --> 01:16:29,018
I'm sorry."

975
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:32,049
And why are you writing these now?

976
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:36,831
That's...

977
01:16:36,911 --> 01:16:38,148
Are you going somewhere?

978
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:42,229
Are you going somewhere
because Mom hates you?

979
01:16:44,477 --> 01:16:45,469
Seung-goo.

980
01:17:14,306 --> 01:17:16,474
Come here. Sit down.

981
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:18,271
Good dog.

982
01:17:35,673 --> 01:17:36,895
What's wrong, Bo-ri?

983
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:50,532

<i>Mr. Im Hyung-rak.</i>

997
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:35,354
- Is this a threat?
- No.

998
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:36,748
I'm declaring a war.
