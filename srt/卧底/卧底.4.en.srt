A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,280
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS EARLIER

3
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Passport, please.

4
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Passport, please. You too.

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,040
We can't, we don't have...

6
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,520
Get your hands off my wife.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you all.

7
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm looking for Patrick Diericks.
It's urgent. Where is he?

8
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,040
I don't know where Bob is.

9
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,960
I haven't heard from him.
I'm worried. Where is he?

10
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,160
Not here. Come on.

11
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,440
You can't just show up here.

12
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,960
- He said he'd be home today.
- Maybe his plane is delayed.

13
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
He would have called me.

14
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,840
His phone is turned off,
I can't reach him.

15
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,520
I can feel something's wrong.

16
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,360
- Did he tell you anything?
- No.

17
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,400
- You have to look for him.
- I can't.

18
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,400
Why not?

19
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,920
This operation is not official.
There's nothing I can do.

20
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
We'll just have to wait.

21
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,920
Look, Bob is the best I know.

22
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,880
He'll turn up. You'll see.
Come on, go home.

23
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,120
Excuse me? You expect me
to sit around at home and wait?

24
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,360
You have to look after your people.
You've already lost one UCA.

25
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,080
Something's wrong, I can feel it.

26
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,120
Look, this baby was an accident.
We weren't sure we should keep it.

27
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,400
It was Bob who wanted to go for it.
He promised me he'd be there for us.

28
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,080
And he's kept his promise.
So the fact that he hasn't called me...

29
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,800
Something's wrong.

30
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,200
Just arrest that gang.
They'll know where he is.

31
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
If I could, I wouldn't need Bob.

32
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,120
Look, I'll make some phone calls
to see if I can find anything.

33
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,400
But you need to leave now.

34
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,360
Thanks.

35
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,160
I really thought you took the deal.

36
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,960
Thanks.

37
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,080
You knew I'd keep silent?

38
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,320
No. I don't trust you one bit.

39
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,720
I trust those Turks even less.

40
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
What?

41
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,160
- Fuck off, man.
- Leave him alone.

42
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,160
We have to call Patrick.

43
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,640
Why didn't you just say you're a cop?

44
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm not a cop, okay?
Besides, it's too risky.

45
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,440
If Leyla hears, it's over.

46
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,800
Over? Look around you, man.

47
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,520
We may have to spend the next 15 years
in some foul Turkish shithole.

48
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,080
There is always a solution, Ferry.

49
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,080
What? Sit here and do nothing?

50
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,880
Maybe I should have taken the deal.

51
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,520
We're not taking any deal.

52
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,640
We have to call Patrick.
That's our only chance.

53
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,160
Alright, thanks. I'll call you.

54
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,960
They're held at the police station
in Güngören Cd.

55
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,080
- And Reinhard?
- He's in the hospital.

56
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,040
Maybe we can have him transferred
to a private hospital.

57
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,120
- Is he being guarded by police?
- Around the clock.

58
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,080
They'll question him
as soon as he awakes from his coma.

59
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,000
That idiot.

60
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,200
Leave him to his fate.

61
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,320
What about Peter and Ferry?

62
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,000
We need them.

63
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Okay.

64
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,640
Do we know anything more?

65
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,600
- They're at Güngören police station.
- And the money?

66
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,800
We lost it. Two million.

67
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
But it won't be linked to us, right?

68
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,440
Thank God you weren't in that car.
What would we have done then?

69
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,280
- I'm going to change.
- Okay.

70
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,840
Goddamnit.

71
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,680
Brother, you know Leyla is trying
to get those two men released, right?

72
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,080
She can try. Those lawyers
can't be linked to us, right?

73
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,000
I know, but still.

74
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,840
All that money spent on two guys
who haven't proven their worth yet.

75
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,160
Leyla knows what she's doing.

76
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
What?

77
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,640
- Timur.
- It's nothing.

78
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,920
- You don't have any secrets for me, right?
- No, I don't have any secrets, no.

79
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Brother...

80
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,240
I don't know how to say this.

81
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,360
When we were at the restaurant...

82
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,160
That Peter... that bastard.

83
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,640
I think he put his hands on Leyla.

84
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,280
Under the table. I think.

85
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
"I think"?

86
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
"I think"?

87
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,120
You come into my house to tell me this.

88
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
And you say "I think"?

89
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,400
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Know what?

90
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
That you want to get back at Leyla
because of your nephew?

91
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Because that's all there is to know.

92
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,040
I might be mistaken.

93
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,800
Do you have any idea
how much she does for me?

94
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,600
That's love. It's unconditional.

95
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,760
She would never betray me.

96
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,040
And if you ever
say something like this again...

97
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,280
I'll kill you.

98
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,440
I won't care that we're friends.

99
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Okay.

100
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,000
I must be mistaken.

101
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,520
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- Get out.

102
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,680
Of course I get worried
when they phone me late at night.

103
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,160
- I didn't know they'd phone you.
- Who else?

104
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm the primary contact. I'm responsible
when you suddenly disappear.

105
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,520
Where the hell were you?

106
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,960
- Just, you know.
- You know, what?

107
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,920
Away for a bit. I'm back now, am I not?
Jesus.

108
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,560
- You're not doing drugs again, are you?
- No.

109
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,600
- I just went somewhere else.
- Just tell me where.

110
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,840
To see a hooker. Happy now?
Do you need me to describe her?

111
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,400
She was blonde up there,
but down there she was pretty...

112
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,000
You met a nice girl online, didn't you?
That was going well, right?

113
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,440
- Through chat it was, yes.
- Right.

114
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,480
So why don't you ask her to meet you?

115
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,160
My profile picture isn't up to date.

116
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,040
- If I smile, she'll run for the hills.
- Of course not.

117
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
- Yes, she will.
- You're a great guy.

118
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
She'll see that as well.

119
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,400
And what do I tell her
if she asks about my teeth?

120
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,120
That I'm an ex-junkie?
Even my own sister doesn't trust me.

121
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,720
Yeah, fuck, sorry.

122
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,880
I'm just really worried
you'll fall back into old habits.

123
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,400
But you're doing super well.

124
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,800
I'm super proud of you.

125
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,920
- Really?
- Yes, really.

126
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,000
I need you to know that.
I know I panicked, but...

127
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,640
I should have trusted you. I'm sorry.

128
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,440
Why don't you send her a message?

129
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
No way.

130
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,280
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

131
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,200
- Right.
- It's true.

132
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,360
HEY VICKY,
DO YOU HAVE PLANS TONIGHT?

134
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,920
Let's give Patrick's number
to the next guy who leaves.

135
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
Have him pass on a message.

136
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,040
Yeah? Who is the next guy leaving?

137
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,880
Well, do you have a better idea?

138
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,640
- Give him the card.
- No, not him. Let's wait for the next one.

139
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,520
- The next one? Why?
- Because he's a nutcase.

140
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,280
Hey, fuck off.

141
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,440
Was it smart to give him the card?

142
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,120
I've learned the number by heart.
I'm not stupid.

143
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,560
Hey, calm down. Easy.

144
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,200
- Yildirim, come with us.
- Finally.

145
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,400
But first I'll pay a visit
to that dirty whore of a mother of yours.

146
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,760
We need a doctor here immediately.

147
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,640
Let him bleed.

148
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,240
We can't, we'll get in trouble.

149
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,760
Look at my nose, man.

150
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
That was the other guy.

151
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,600
Fuck it. Just you wait, asshole.

152
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,320
Yes, police station Güngören. Hurry up.

153
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,280
Peter.

154
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,760
Shut up.

155
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,080
- Shut up.
- Make noise. Now.

156
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,360
Shut up.

157
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,280
I can make a phone call here,
if we can get this guard to leave.

158
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,160
Goddamnit.

159
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,000
...we see that these numbers
will balance out.

160
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,120
Beyond that, we need to keep
communicating with the other agencies.

161
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,320
We know where the problems are.

162
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
- But we'll still have to...
- Hello?

163
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,640
Ferry Bouman.

164
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,520
- We're at a police station in Istanbul.
- Where?

165
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,560
Gungoren or something.

166
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,560
We were caught with a lot of money
in our car.

167
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,120
And we have to act now, or else...
I have to go.

168
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,240
What? Hello?

169
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,360
Ouch. Goddamnit.

170
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,640
Are you okay?

171
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,080
Did you succeed?

173
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,240
What do you think?

174
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
I'm Ferralt Bogman.

175
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,280
I know where Bob is.

176
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,840
Is he alright? Where is he?

177
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,920
At a police station in Istanbul.
He's been arrested.

178
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,560
Oh, no.

179
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,440
He's there as a civilian, not as a cop,
so he'll be brought before a judge.

180
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
What does that mean?
Will he end up in a Turkish jail?

181
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,680
That's all I know.

182
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,200
But I can't call the embassy
without blowing up the entire operation.

183
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,440
That's why I'm calling you.
You could call them.

184
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,760
Call the embassy? Me?
What am I supposed to tell them?

185
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,280
That your husband's been arrested.
Maybe they can help you.

186
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,840
But... I mean...
You should be able to solve this, right?

187
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,920
- You can't just...
- I'm sorry, this can't lead back to me.

188
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,880
- But...
- I'll send you the phone number.

189
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,880
Fuck you, man. Fuck you.
You're the one who caused this problem.

190
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,400
So you're going to solve this.
Either you make sure he doesn't go to jail

191
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,840
or I'll call your boss or the press.
And don't think I'm bluffing.

192
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,720
That won't help him.
It's only going to endanger him.

193
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,480
Bob is not going to jail, do you hear me?

194
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,320
If he's not home tomorrow,
I'll start making phone calls.

195
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,280
Nathalie, come on... Nathalie.

196
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
So?

197
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,920
They're still in custody.

198
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,320
Held by a bunch of idealists
who don't care for money.

199
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,400
We really need Bouman's pills.

200
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,200
And that Peter as well. He's a smart guy.

201
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
If there's nothing more we can do,
we'll have to find another partner.

202
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Like who?

203
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,880
Orlando Martina.

204
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,360
Orlando? Don't you remember
the shit he pulled in Rotterdam?

205
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
Not with us. I've never had any problems
with him.

206
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,040
I'll think about it.

207
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,640
What?

208
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,240
I love you.

209
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,040
- Finally.
- Yes.

210
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,360
In real life, as they say.

211
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,480
Sorry I'm late.

212
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,400
My daughter didn't want to be put to bed
by the babysitter.

213
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,160
Four years old, and already a diva.
Unbelievable.

214
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,960
No problem. I've already signed us up.

215
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,720
- Ah, fantastic.
- Yeah, so...

216
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,880
Shall we start right away?

217
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,680
- That's why we're here, right?
- Yes.

218
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,840
I hope you can handle losing to a girl.
Because I'm going to kick your ass.

219
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,280
Right, I'll go get you some shoes.
What size do you have?

220
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,640
- Thirty-nine.
- Thirty-nine. Okay.

221
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,840
- Peter?
- Ferry.

222
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,480
Goddamnit.

223
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
Come closer.

224
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,640
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

225
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,840
I have a feeling
we're not driving to court.

226
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,040
Maybe Patrick is behind this.

227
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,600
Maybe you went too far.

228
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,960
You fucking broke that guy's nose.

229
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,960
- I had to create a distraction, and I did.
- Did you have to seduce Leyla as well?

230
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,880
I have to use whatever means I have.

231
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Thanks to your scheming
I'll be rotting away in the desert soon.

232
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,360
They're not going to kill us.
I told them I have kids.

233
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,400
So what?

234
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,920
- They know someone will look for me.
- Are you saying no one will look for me?

235
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,880
Well, who would?
You've sucked them all dry.

236
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
Jürgen, Remco.
And now your brother-in-law.

237
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,560
Lars and I help each other. Shut up.

238
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,560
Putting a junkie in a lab. Good plan.

239
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,560
Oh, shut up.

240
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,800
- You're selfish.
- Shut the fuck up.

241
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,600
- No one will miss you.
- Shut up.

242
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,400
I've done nothing wrong.

243
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,760
You're here illegally.

244
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,200
Please, I can't go back.

245
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,120
You'll be fine. There's no red notice
and no extradition order.

246
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,000
I have a girlfriend here.

247
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,320
You have no idea who I am, man.

248
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,520
Danielle is the only one who knows me.
She'll miss me.

249
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,800
Christ, that I should have to end up
in a hole in the desert with you.

250
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,520
Trust me, I didn't want this, either.

251
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,320
I think we left the freeway.

252
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,840
I'm simply respecting the law.

253
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,360
What do we do when those doors open?
Attack?

254
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,719
Wearing handcuffs?
You want to bite them to death?

255
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,560
Take it easy.

256
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,520
Sorry, man.

257
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
It's not...

258
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,440
I'm okay, I'm okay.

259
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,640
A copy of his deportation file, please.

260
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Hello?

261
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Okay.

262
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,120
If you ever come back to Turkey
we'll bury you so deep

263
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,760
that no one will ever find your bodies.

264
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,280
You'll find your own way home.

265
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,880
Oh, honey...

266
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,840
DELETE CHAT?

267
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,800
<i>You've reached Lars.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

268
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,040
<i>Hey Lars, it's Ferry.</i>

269
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,960
<i>I'm just calling to see how you're doing.</i>

270
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,040
<i>Our Turkish friends were very happy.
Thanks to you.</i>

271
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
<i>Well done.</i>

272
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,480
<i>Call me back.
Or come visit me some time.</i>

273
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,120
<i>I have plenty of space here
for you to stay over.</i>

274
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
Lars?

275
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,880
<i>Refugee Forum, good afternoon.</i>

276
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,960
A man named Suleyman Özturk was
brought to the asylum center in Merksplas

277
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,840
with an expulsion warrant.
He'll be deported from there.

278
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,040
But his right to be heard
has been violated.

279
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,360
<i>Violated? How?</i>

280
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,760
He has a partner and a child here.
That's not in the police report.

281
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,680
It could affect his case.

282
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,200
<i>I'll look into it right away.
Thanks for the info. What's your name?</i>

283
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,680
<i>Sir?</i>

284
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,920
Have some more.
We brought it just for you.

285
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Not hungry.

286
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,040
- Peter and Ferry have been released.
- Why?

287
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,840
The police couldn't prove they had
anything to do with Reinhard's money.

288
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,080
They were deported.
They landed this morning.

289
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,440
That means we can do business with them.

290
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Yes.

291
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,440
I've already made a deal with Orlando.

292
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,720
You'll have to cancel it.

293
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,280
I trust Peter and Ferry now.

294
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,360
I trust Orlando.
He doesn't get caught by the police.

295
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,920
What happened to you?

296
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,080
Before we left, you were defending them.

297
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,720
I changed my mind.

298
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,560
I'm going to meet them at the party venue.
They left their car there.

299
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,440
Did you see a doctor?

300
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,080
A few stitches.
They'll be removed on Monday.

301
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,120
And you? Wifey happy to see you again?

302
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,360
She didn't want to let go of me.

303
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,840
Will things be okay between you and Leyla?

304
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,440
She sounded relieved.

305
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,080
I hope you don't expect me
to act all cheery.

306
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,560
I'm sick and tired of that bitch.

307
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,480
I know that. So am I,
and I'll make sure she knows that.

308
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,200
But we can't blow things up now.

309
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,760
So you're just going to suck up
to her again?

310
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,040
I'm going to keep going
until I know who the mole is.

311
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,600
And then we'll roll up the entire gang
and be done with it.

312
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,960
- I'm happy to see you.
- Happy?

313
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,880
Yes.

314
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,400
That idiot buddy of yours almost landed us
in Turkish jail for the rest of our lives.

315
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,360
You're right. I'm sorry.

316
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,880
You were my guests,
and I should have ensured

317
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,000
you got back to the hotel safely.

318
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,320
You won't see Reinhard again.

319
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,720
We'll find a new solution
for the payments. Okay?

320
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,760
So that's all we get? An apology?

321
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,880
I suggest we leave the past behind us
and look towards the future. I trust you.

322
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,960
I really hope the problems in Turkey
don't get in the way of our collaboration.

323
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,720
I don't really want to collaborate
anymore.

324
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,440
I've managed to stay
under the police's radar for years.

325
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,120
I'd like to keep it that way.

326
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,840
So I don't know
if I can trust you anymore.

327
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,400
- You can trust me.
- How?

328
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,880
I can guarantee you won't get in trouble
with the police again.

329
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,280
No one can guarantee that.

330
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,960
I get info from the inside.

331
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,360
I know every move the cops make.
Including where it concerns you.

332
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,200
How do you think we've managed
to operate for so long?

333
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,840
How reliable is that info?

334
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,960
A hundred percent.

335
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,280
You found some detective
with a money problem

336
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,920
and we're supposed to be impressed?

337
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,200
The info comes straight from the top.

338
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,240
Oh, yeah? So phone him. Right now.

339
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,800
Ask him if he knows
we were in a Turkish prison.

340
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,040
- That's not how it works.
- Come on.

341
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,000
He's off duty for five days.

342
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,760
He has a sports injury.

343
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,480
What a coincidence.

344
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,200
He'll be back on Monday.

345
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,280
Leyla, you're bullshitting us. Who is he?

346
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,360
I've already said too much.

347
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,320
Then call us when you're able
to tell us more.

348
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,520
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

349
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,240
Well done.

350
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,080
- JUST CAME FROM LEYLA. BIG NEWS.
- COME BY MY PLACE.

351
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,600
You have no idea how happy I am
to see you.

352
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,760
- What happened to you?
- You don't want to know.

353
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,680
What matters is I got you out.

354
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,640
I told my bosses I have a sports injury.

355
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,120
NEXT TIME

356
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,920
- Ferry, wait.
- I've waited enough. I'm gonna kill you.

357
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Goddamnit.

358
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,760
Mrs. Bouman.

359
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,720
Van Marken. I'm divorced.

360
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,240
Don't hang up. I need your help.

361
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,240
Forward it to me. I want to have a look.
We need to be careful with this.

362
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,640
There's one more thing I can try.

363
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,160
He was doing so well, damnit.

364
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,520
It's not my fault.

365
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,000
Just admit you're having him cook again.

366
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,000
Mom's not here.
Sila said she went with Peter Bogaert.

367
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,400
