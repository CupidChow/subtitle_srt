00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,880
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,160
Today you'll become a man.

3
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,800
Strong, loyal, considerate to your family.

4
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,640
The pain will go away fast.

5
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Just dream about all the things
you can buy with the money you'll get.

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,640
And the presents and the gold.

7
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,800
Come.

8
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,160
We're proud of you.

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,080
Let me see, bro. My little buddy.
Let's go over here.

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,120
Are you ready? You're like the pashas.
Praise be.

11
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,920
- Congratulations, Serkan.
- Congratulations, Halil.

12
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,640
- Will Peter come to the party tonight?
- Yes, together with Bouman.

13
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,040
I don't want them to come.

14
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,120
- Why not? We've talked about this.
- What's his number doing in your bag?

15
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,560
- You went out to eat with him?
- No.

16
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,680
The number was on the restaurant bill.

17
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,000
Peter wrote his number down after we
went to that warehouse. That's all.

18
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,160
I also told him
Timur will be his contact.

19
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
Your phone.

20
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,400
Are you checking up on me?

21
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,920
Come on, really.

22
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,120
I told them I won't do business with them
until you're on board.

23
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,160
Go check with them, if you like.

24
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,960
I found this in Leyla's bag.

25
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,440
Peter's number's on it.

26
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,840
She said she went to a warehouse
with them the day before yesterday

27
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,960
and that she wasn't in the restaurant.

28
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,040
I want to know if she's lying.

29
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,200
Okay, brother. Let me handle it.

30
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,360
The invitation is a good sign.

31
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,920
Leyla has enough say
to make Serkan change his mind.

32
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,080
You need to speak with them,
so we make sure the deal is ours fast.

33
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,040
But it won't be easy.
There's a competitor.

34
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,960
We need to take him out of play as fast
as possible, before he takes us out.

35
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,840
But we don't know who it is.

36
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,040
CONGRATS, ORLANDO

37
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,920
That's why Patrick and Tanguy
have set up a surveillance operation

38
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,280
in Serkan and Leyla's home,
when everyone is at the party.

39
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,400
Hopefully we'll find out
who our competitor is,

40
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,680
in order for us to know
who we're up against.

41
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,600
Serkan normally never leaves his home,

42
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,760
so this is also our chance
to plant cameras and bugs.

43
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,080
The leak has been sealed,
so now we're on equal footing.

44
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,080
This is the end game, guys.
This is our chance.

45
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,800
Don't strain yourself.
You're over eight months pregnant.

46
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,760
- Come on, being pregnant isn't a disease.
- I know you. Don't exaggerate.

47
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,320
- Will you look after your mom?
- Sure.

48
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,680
- See you later.
- Good luck.

49
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,720
Don't leave any streaks.

50
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,200
Hello?

51
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
What?

52
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,520
Strange. I'll be there.

53
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,960
The alarm in the store went off. I need to
go there, the neighbors are going crazy.

54
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,680
You go to the venue with Emine
and Halil. I won't be long.

55
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,440
- Hey, Lars. Isn't Ferry ready yet?
- No.

56
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,280
Two minutes.

57
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,680
And? How's living with him?

58
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,160
Looking for something?

59
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm thirsty.

60
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,560
No, don't bother.

61
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,040
Let's go.

62
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,400
Stay focused and don't do anything stupid
when you're surrounded by pills.

63
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,720
- I promised your sister.
- Yeah, sure. You can count on me.

64
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,760
We love you.

65
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,000
Just one more time. Then I've got enough
money and I can get others to do it.

66
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,320
If you need me, just call.

67
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,080
- See ya.
- See ya.

68
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Have you changed dresses?

69
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,920
Go on in. We'll be right there.

70
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,480
And?

71
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,920
- The Russians were waiting for me.
- What? Are you okay?

72
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,640
Yes. They want their pills fast,
otherwise it's war.

73
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,080
War? I'll send an army their way.

74
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,680
Honey... Don't worry.
We'll deal with them later.

75
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,120
But right now, they're right.
We need to stick to the deal.

76
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,880
We need those pills, now. Otherwise
the others will be at my store as well.

77
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,240
Ferry and Peter will be there soon.
You'll sit with them tonight, okay?

78
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,240
We're closed.

79
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,400
I just want to ask something.

80
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,720
- Okay.
- I'm looking for my sister, Leyla.

81
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,680
She hasn't come home yesterday.
The last thing we know

82
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,640
is that she was here with a business
partner the day before yesterday.

83
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,040
I can take a look.

84
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,720
- The day before yesterday?
- Yes. Leyla Bulut.

85
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,840
No, I don't see any Bulut or Leyla.

86
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,880
- What's her business partner's name?
- Bogaert, Peter.

87
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,840
Bogaert... No, I can't...
No, I can't find him either.

88
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,360
- Do you maybe have a photograph?
- Sure.

89
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,360
- It must have been around noon.
- No.

90
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,360
I'm sorry. I wish I could help you,
but I don't think she was here.

91
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,080
Hello.

92
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,160
- I hope you'll find her soon.
- I hope so too.

93
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,880
"IF YOU'RE NOT CIRCUMCIZED,
THERE WON'T BE A GIRL FOR YOU"

94
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,720
SO I'M GETTING CIRCUMCIZED
WELCOME TO MY PARTY

95
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,920
- Max?
- A Turkish guy with a ponytail came by.

96
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,640
He wanted to know
if you and Leyla had been here.

97
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,480
- You're kidding.
- I didn't tell him anything.

98
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,520
I know how sensitive these things are.
But I'd be careful if I were you.

99
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,120
Okay, thanks.

100
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,760
Timur's asking questions about Leyla
at the restaurant.

101
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,360
- And now?
- We'll stick to the plan.

102
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,360
We need to get that competitor
out of the picture.

103
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
- Do you have money?
- What?

104
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,200
I don't have a present.
Danielle always bought those.

105
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,080
Come on, man.

106
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,960
Give it here.

107
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,200
- Serkan. Long time no see.
- Ferry.

108
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,360
A lot has happened since then.

109
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,040
You already had a beautiful daughter,
and now a big boy too.

110
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,240
I remember back then it was almost
impossible to get to talk to you.

111
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,440
And look how it is now. It only took
one call for you to come here.

112
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,680
It's easier for me to come to you
than for you to come to me.

113
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,720
- Where do I put this money?
- Give it to him, if you want.

114
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,240
Here you go, son. Half of it
is for your sister, don't forget.

115
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,360
Serkan, this is Peter.
Peter, my husband Serkan.

116
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,640
Nice to meet you. It's an honor.

117
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,160
Congratulations.
I can imagine you're proud of your son.

118
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,200
Here you go.

119
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,000
Very nice. Thank you.

120
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Thanks for coming.
Enjoy the food and the music.

121
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,599
If you need something, tell me.
You're our guests tonight.

122
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,319
Maybe we'll get a chance later.
To talk a little.

123
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,200
Welcome.

124
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,520
Good evening. Hi, I'm Ferry.

125
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,200
- And?
- The owner says they haven't been there.

126
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,360
But I think he's lying.

127
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,840
What did you do?

128
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,600
There were guests coming in, so I
had to cut it short. I'll go back tonight.

129
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,640
I don't know what I should do
if she lied.

130
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,600
And now she wants me
to sit with that guy.

131
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,800
Don't do anything you don't want to.
Especially not today.

132
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,520
Could you help? How does it work?

133
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,520
- How does it work?
- You need a key for that.

134
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,040
- Be careful.
- Of course.

135
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,400
Shall we go and ask
if everyone is having a good time?

136
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,080
Okay, but I'm not going to sit
with Bouman and that Peter.

137
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,440
This again? How many times
do you want to discuss this?

138
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,800
I changed my mind.
I don't like the way he looks.

139
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,760
The way he looks? What bullshit is that?
I'm so fed up with your crap.

140
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,960
I've been wanting to work with Orlando
since the beginning.

141
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,840
If you hadn't been
going on and on about that Peter

142
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,080
- we'd already have what we needed.
- Serkan, you're not thinking straight.

143
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,760
Don't you use that tone with me.

144
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,200
Okay, then I'll explain it softly.

145
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,760
The Russians will kill us
if they don't get their pills in time.

146
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,560
Ferry and Peter are screened.
But that sweet Orlando of yours

147
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,720
proved time and time again
that he can't be trusted.

148
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:40,920
Do you realize the risk we're taking? If
he doesn't deliver in time, we're offed.

149
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,280
We're doing business with Orlando.
Period.

150
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,520
Be cheerful now. It's a party.

151
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,200
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Bob, it's time.

152
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,160
- I just had my first contraction.
- Really? Are you okay?

153
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,840
Yes, but I spoke to my ob/gyn and
it's best to go to the hospital right now.

154
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,800
Hello? Bob?

155
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,560
- Are you still there?
- Honey, I can't leave right now.

156
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,960
I'll be there as soon as possible.
Be careful and keep me posted.

157
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,080
Sure. See you soon.

158
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,520
They're just letting us sit here.

159
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,760
- I have to check with Leyla.
- Don't push her.

160
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,120
- I don't have time.
- Chill out, man.

161
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,600
What's this? You're ignoring us.

162
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,960
It's your own fault. Serkan found
your number on the restaurant bill.

163
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,320
- So what?
- So what?

164
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,680
I had to lie about it. I told him we went
to look at a warehouse with Ferry.

165
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
I'd didn't tell him
because I was afraid he'd be jealous.

166
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,920
If he finds out, I'll be in big trouble.

167
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,280
Timur went to Max to ask questions.

168
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,960
He denied everything.

169
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,960
Serkan doesn't trust you.

170
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
He went to talk to another supplier.

171
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,920
He even got into a car himself
for the first time in two years.

172
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,880
- Whom did he talk to?
- A guy he knows from before.

173
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,680
Leyla, we went out to lunch
because we want to do business.

174
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,360
If we can't do that without this bullshit,
what's our partnership worth?

175
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,480
You invited us.

176
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,160
Ferry and I were very respectful
and I expect the same from you.

177
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,560
You've got till tonight to decide.
Otherwise it's over.

178
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,720
- Bob?
- Are they still at Serkan's?

179
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,240
Yes.

180
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,400
Ask them to look for the spare key
to Serkan's car.

181
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,320
- I want to check his GPS.
- Why?

182
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,280
Serkan drove to our competitor.
Maybe his address is in there.

183
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,000
- Then we can find him.
- Okay, I'll tell them.

184
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,000
- Not bad, this.
- Serkan doesn't want a deal with us.

185
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,960
- I told you to leave her alone.
- He doesn't trust us.

186
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,960
- Fucking hell.
- But she's still on our side, I think.

187
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,480
You think.

188
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,360
- We need to take the competitor out.
- We don't know who he is.

189
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,360
Danielle?

190
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,240
Wait a minute, I can't hear you.
I'll go someplace quiet.

191
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,720
<i>- Ferry, where the hell are you?</i>
- Why do you want to know?

192
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,440
<i>I've been trying to get a hold of Lars,
but he doesn't answer. Is he with you?</i>

193
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,160
No.

194
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,760
- I'm at a party.
<i>- Okay, but is Lars with you?</i>

195
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,360
- No.
- Jesus Christ.

196
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,040
You were supposed
to keep an eye on him.

197
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,880
When I left he was playing a video game
and he probably hasn't stopped.

198
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,520
I wouldn't be so sure. I'm at your
bungalow and there's no one home.

199
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,680
Fuck, I just know he's scoring dope.
I can feel it.

200
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,280
He's just getting fries or whatever.
Don't always be so negative.

201
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,320
Did you forget about that time
we had to go look for him

202
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,120
and lure him away from that whore,

203
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,200
break his heart and send him away in
an ambulance. I don't want that again.

204
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,080
Me neither.

205
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,920
<i>What?</i>

206
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,720
He probably isn't answering his phone
because he's pissed off.

207
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,760
Pissed off?

208
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,040
Because he couldn't stay with you.

209
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,920
- So he's really mad at me?
- You know... I...

210
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,920
- I'll call him and I'll have him call you.
- Okay, thank you.

211
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,080
Why don't you pick up
when Danielle calls? Dumb-ass.

212
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,280
- I had my hands full.
- I had my hands full? You call her back.

213
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,400
And then? Do you want me to lie?

214
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,960
You've lied for years.
Lying is the only thing you can do.

215
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,480
You call her back
and you say you're with a girl.

216
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,360
Or that you went out for fries
or whatever.

217
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,360
Okay, I'll call her.

218
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,240
ARE YOU AT THE HOSPITAL
ALREADY? HAVE YOU GOT NEWS?

219
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,520
Did I get a message? Will you look?

220
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,760
Are you okay?

221
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,440
- Hello?
<i>- I dropped the key underneath your car.</i>

222
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,920
<i>- Right rear tire.</i>
- Thanks.

223
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,000
- You have to help me with Serkan's car.
- Get lost.

224
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,680
RECENT DESTINATIONS

225
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,360
Stop that.

226
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,280
Let's go.

227
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
- Did he see your face?
- No.

228
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,800
Nice job putting him in hospital. Damnit.

229
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,360
"Thanks, Ferry. Good job.
Without you I would have been screwed."

230
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,400
Nick, they caught me. The guy didn't see
my face, but there's been some trouble.

231
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,120
- You need to send an ambulance.
<i>- What happened?</i>

232
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,800
Just send an ambulance. He needs help.
Near the rear entrance.

233
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,680
<i>- But what will you say to the police?</i>
- I don't know.

234
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,200
- Just say there are car thieves here.
<i>- Car thieves?</i>

235
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,600
- Do you have a better idea?
<i>- Please tell me you found an address.</i>

236
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,280
Two hundred Kralingseweg, Rotterdam.

237
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,440
CAN'T CALL YOU RIGHT NOW
EVERYTHING OKAY?

238
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Here. We know who our competitor is.

239
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,280
- Orlando Martina.
- You're kidding.

240
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,040
He prefers him over us? Jesus.

241
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,600
I'll ask Nick to send Patrick an e-mail.
That'll put him out of the picture.

242
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,200
I'm going to make sure Leyla reads it.

243
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,080
What's going on here?

244
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,080
According to the police a couple of cars
in the neighborhood were broken into.

245
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,400
- They think he caught them.
- And you believe them?

246
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,520
Yes.

247
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,360
Listen, I saw a grey Audi A6 here earlier.

248
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,320
A typical undercover cop car.

249
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,120
They probably had a look, installed some
bugs. They used to do that to me too.

250
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,560
That guy caught them, they beat him up
and called an ambulance.

251
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,400
- Come on, Ferry.
- I swear, that's how it went.

252
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,600
- I can't have that. I'll get into trouble.
- Why? You're a party guest.

253
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,640
I'm on probation.
If they see me with you, I'll hang.

254
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,520
And the guy that was supposed
to protect us... Call him.

255
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,600
I'm not sitting with Serkan if you can't
guarantee me there aren't any cameras.

256
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,240
And?

257
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,680
UNREAD

258
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,320
SURVEILLANCE MOTORCYCLE GANG

259
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,040
ORLANDO MARTINA SPOTTED
AT MOTORCYCLE CLUB IN BILZEN

260
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,520
Look at Halil. He's so happy.

261
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,199
I don't want to fight with you, Serkan.

262
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,639
Same here.

263
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,679
It's not good for us, not for the kids
and not for business.

264
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,600
Forget about business for once.

265
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,440
Look, they're why we do all this.
Just enjoy it.

266
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,760
I know, but we're not in the position.
It might just all fall apart.

267
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,640
Those Russians? We'll take care of that.

268
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,800
Really? How?

269
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,600
The police received an e-mail
about Orlando Martina.

270
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,400
They spotted him with a motorcycle gang
in Bilzen.

271
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,120
The Belgians informed the Dutch already.
They're keeping an eye on him.

272
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,200
- So we need to stay away from him.
- Yes.

273
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,560
But time is running out.

274
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,640
Ferry and Peter are still here.

275
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,520
Hasn't that stubbornness lasted long
enough? Just go and talk to them.

276
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,400
- Tell me one thing.
- What?

277
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Do you have feelings for Peter?

278
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,600
Honey, why do you say that?
Why would I have feelings for him?

279
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,240
Who is he anyway?

280
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,600
Since he's in the picture,
you're acting differently.

281
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,840
No, I'm acting differently
since we're short of a supplier.

282
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,280
You sometimes forget
the pressure I'm under.

283
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,040
The stores, the employees, business,
police, the kids...

284
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,080
How could you think that
after all we've been through?

285
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,560
After everything we fought for together?
I did it all for us.

286
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,000
I swear, on Halil and Emine.

287
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,120
I'm sorry. It's just all so hectic.

288
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,520
I'll talk to them.

289
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,920
- Okay?
- Okay.

290
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,320
I'll go to Halil.

291
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,080
Everything okay?

292
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,520
I'm going to have a chat
with Ferry and Peter.

293
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,760
- And what about the restaurant?
- Just drop it. I don't want to hear it.

294
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,880
Leyla loves me and I love her.

295
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,200
And she was right.
Orlando can't be trusted.

296
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,680
The police are keeping an eye on him.

297
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,880
Just give me the chance
to check one more thing.

298
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,920
- Hasty decisions are the devil's work.
- Enough, I said.

299
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,600
Honey.

300
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,560
Everything okay?

301
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,120
It's going really fast.
I think it won't take too long anymore.

302
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,880
- I'm coming to see you.
- Sure? Can you leave now?

303
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm on my way.

304
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,840
- Is there something wrong?
- I need to go.

305
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,320
- What if Serkan wants to talk?
- Just be creative.

306
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,800
- What's this all of a sudden?
- My girl is having a baby.

307
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,680
Gentlemen, I have good news.
Firstly, I checked. You're safe.

308
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,760
And even better,
Serkan wants to talk to you.

309
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,400
- Now he does?
- He had some time to think. We talked.

310
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,520
That's what you wanted, right?

311
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,840
He's got ten minutes to convince us
this time he's serious.

312
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,120
Ten minutes. Let her push it back.

313
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,880
Guys, will you step outside for a bit?

314
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,640
Don't let anyone in.

315
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,360
Finally prepared to receive us.
Peter, this is Serkan Bulut.

316
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,200
The largest dealer in the Benelux.

317
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,200
He doesn't say a lot, but when
he speaks, he's good for it. Right?

318
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,720
Peter is the best fixer I know,
and he's a master in staying invisible.

319
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,000
In his spare time he likes to visit
soccer matches and likes to eat mussels.

320
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,240
Now we know each other,
we can talk business.

321
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,360
- We need a big shipment in two days.
- How big?

322
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,880
A ton.

323
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,560
- Is that possible?
- No problem.

324
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,280
That's 3.5 million pills. It'll cost you.
The test batch was 30 cents a pill.

325
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,200
But because you slacked off,
we're under pressure.

326
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,440
We take a greater risk,
so 50 cents a pill.

327
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,760
We never pay more than 30.
That's one million for you guys.

328
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,120
Thirty cents is not enough.
I already said that.

329
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,760
Fifty cents a pill. That's 1.75 million.

330
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,680
Let's meet each other in the middle.
1.4 million.

331
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,080
Come on. 1.4 million is a great deal.
For you as well.

332
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,440
What?

333
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,120
- What's that?
- I hurt my hand.

334
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Can we agree on that 1.4 million?

335
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,880
What's wrong?

336
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,320
Hello, old man.

337
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,480
- What are you doing here?
- I have the feeling you weren't honest.

338
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,200
I'll give you one more chance
to spill your guts.

339
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,920
I'm not lying. And I won't be threatened
in my own place.

340
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,920
- Get out or I'll call the cops.
- Why did you delete the security footage?

341
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,400
- I don't know. It goes automatically.
- Why is the older footage still on it?

342
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,200
Why did you delete it?

343
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,760
Where were you
when someone broke into the car?

344
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,720
- You left your seats for a while.
- Are they the police?

345
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,880
You don't think
we've got something to do with that?

346
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,360
I thought you were pretty nervous
just now.

347
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,080
Answer her question.

348
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,960
- I don't know. Maybe it's a mistake.
- I gave you two chances.

349
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,520
It's really cool you can keep up
with modern technology,

350
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,640
but did you know it can be
retrieved pretty easily?

351
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,760
My friend's a wizard.
He'll have it back within two minutes.

352
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,160
We'll take your computer to my friend
so he can check.

353
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,040
Look what I have here.

354
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,400
- What do you want me to say?
- What are you hiding?

355
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,560
- There's nothing to hide.
- You want to know? Shall I say it?

356
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,120
Do you want to know?

357
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:09,440
I punched the wall, because you've
been ignoring us the entire evening.

358
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,200
In need that deal.

359
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,440
I'm not the man I was. That's right.

360
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,320
I've got debts. I'm knee-deep in it.
No one takes me seriously.

361
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,280
But I still produce the best pills
and you know that.

362
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,240
I'm sorry.

363
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,800
I need this deal. And you do too.

364
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,840
So we do what Peter says.
We meet in the middle. 1.4 million.

365
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,960
It's a fair price. Maybe it'll turn into
a long-term thing. Everybody happy.

366
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,800
Your humility is admirable.

367
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,680
- Can you deliver tomorrow?
- Yes.

368
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,440
No problem.

369
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,480
We'll start right away.
Now you get out of here.

370
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,680
Thanks.

371
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,840
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

372
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,640
- ...600, 650.8,650 euros.
- Is that a lot?

373
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,960
You'll be able to buy so much toys.
Just for tonight, you can keep it here.

374
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,080
After that we'll put it in a safe place.
Okay?

375
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,360
Honey... I'm so proud of you.

376
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,640
- Hey.
- Hey. Are you still awake?

377
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,360
Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

378
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,960
I just got home.
Lars is sleeping downstairs.

379
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,320
Thanks for doing this for me.
It's so sweet of you.

380
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,960
It's not going so well with Ingrid.
We're fighting constantly.

381
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,720
- Oh?
- She just left, angry.

382
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,200
She wanted to sleep somewhere else.

383
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,920
- Why?
- She thinks Lars is too much of a burden.

384
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,120
She wants me to ban him from my life.
I can't. He's my brother.

385
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,320
She doesn't understand
how big of a heart you have.

386
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,960
Of course I know
I'm not easy to live with.

387
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,760
With all my shit, my problems
and my emotional moods.

388
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,480
But it just sucks. It sucks
that it's not working out with Ingrid.

389
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,920
I don't know why you're so sweet to me.

390
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,160
You could never hurt me.

391
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,960
- Good night.
- Good night. I'll call you.

392
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,360
Bye.

393
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,000
Will Leyla be gone long?

394
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,960
I think so. She went shopping
with the kids. What's so urgent?

395
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,240
You need to call off the deal
with those guys.

396
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,200
It's decided. Just drop it.

397
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,400
My friend Ben checked the camera
footage from that restaurant.

398
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,680
- I told you I didn't want to hear it.
- Okay.

399
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,560
Just watch then.

400
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,880
She swore to me there was nothing.

401
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,200
She swore on our kids.

402
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,320
Serkan, how many times
will you let that snake fool you?

403
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,040
That Peter has to die.

404
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,560
NEXT TIME

405
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,360
Get Patrick Diericks.
I've got sensitive information.

406
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,800
Patrick, there's something
you should know.

407
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,240
It has to happen.

408
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,680
When it goes wrong, it's on you.

409
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,160
I'm sorry.

410
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,680
I can't trust him. He said so.

411
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,720
Fucking asshole.

412
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,560
