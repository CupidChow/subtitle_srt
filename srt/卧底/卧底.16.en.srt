- Congratulations.

Thank you.

6
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:14,778
Here comes the bride!

7
00:01:17,562 --> 00:01:19,378
You're so pretty. Congratulations.

8
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,178
- I'm so jealous.
- They look good together.

9
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,931
Live happily.

10
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:27,675
Live happily!

11
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,192
Kiss!

12
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:47,907
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

13
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:54,092
Stand side by side.

14
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:59,308
Ms. Bride. Don't smile too broadly.

15
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:04,491
All right. One, two, three.

16
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:23,597
Hi, Mr. Bae.

17
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,948
I'll see you at the office then.

18
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:28,182
Okay, bye.

19
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:31,018

27
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:18,601
It broke down.

28
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:48,916
Mr. Im.

29
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:05,960
All this happened...

30
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,419
because you failed to stop

31
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:09,904
Lee Suk-gyu, you jerk!

32
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,266
Mr. Im.

33
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,081
What are you

34
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,165
going to do with me now?

35
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,402
I trusted you.

36
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,498
Kwang-chul and I...

37
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,548
remained faithful to you,

38
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,081
and did our best to hold out.

39
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,181
But why...

40
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:05,131
<font color="#ffff00">New message</font>

41
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:07,136
I...

42
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:08,218
<font color="#ffff00">I got her</font>

43
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,565
have run out of money.

44
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:13,793
My children and wife
are in the Philippines.

45
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:15,981
I need to return to work,

46
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:17,781
and like before...

47
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,408
Young-geol.

48
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:20,508
Can I...

49
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,915
trust you, Mr. Im?

50
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:29,816
I know.

51
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,649
I know...

52
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:36,314
that you work very hard for me.

53
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,881
I absolutely do.

54
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:47,848
All right.

55
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,366
Get up.

56
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:50,682
Yes, sir.

57
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:55,099
Now get rid of
Choi Yeon-soo and Lee Suk-gyu.

58
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:56,616
Sorry?

59
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,798
<font color="#ffff00">Emergency Medical Center</font>

60
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:16,332

61
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:27,698
<font color="#ffff00">Unknown number</font>

62
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:37,577
Bring me the tablet PC now.

63
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,336
Now there's no reason I shouldn't kill you.

64
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,215
Oh, is that so?

65
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,002
If you've had died there,

66
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:50,115
your woman wouldn't be here.

67
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:51,672
<i><font color="#80ffff">Tell me where you are.</i></font>

68
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:53,431
If you want to see her face,

69
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,481
don't forget to bring my stuff.

70
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,270
<i><font color="#80ffff">Emergency services.</i></font>

71
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,505
In front of the ER of Seongho Hospital,

72
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:26,862
you'll find my brother's dead body.

73
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,348
I promise I'll make Im Hyung-rak
pay for your life.

74
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:48,432
And don't worry

75
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:50,408
about your youngest.

76
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,616
I'm sorry, Pil-jae.

77
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,648
Yeon-soo.

78
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,348
<font color="#ffff00">The Last Episode</font>

79
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,417
Young-geol.

80
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,151
Forget about what happened today,

81
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:02,872
and focus on what you need to do next.

82
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,049
But...

83
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:09,885
the money I lost today--

84
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,969
When you throw bombs in a war,

85
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,815
you're bound to have duds.

86
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:15,615
What matters

87
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,931
is winning the war.

88
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:21,231
Can we...

89
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:25,848
win this war if we find the tablet PC?

90
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,448
If we retrieve it,

91
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,765
we can start again.

92
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,815
But there are...

93
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:37,365
still Choi Yeon-soo and Lee Suk-gyu.

94
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,831
Use your imagination.

95
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,599
Choi Yeon-soo found out
about her husband's real identity.

96
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:46,786
It wouldn't be strange to say

97
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,898
that they killed each
other while arguing.

98
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,215
Lee Suk-gyu...

99
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,565
kills Choi Yeon-soo
while arguing with her

100
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:56,365
about his real identity,

101
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:01,285
and kills himself in the end?

102
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:04,081
That has to be the story
behind this no matter what.

103
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:05,406
Put your life on the line.

104
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:07,465
Yes, sir.

105
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,848
<font color="#ffff00">CIO</font>

106
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,151

107
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:39,148
<i><font color="#80ffff">Please leave a message after the tone.</i></font>

108
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:44,621
Director Choi's phone is turned off.

109
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:45,825
Is it?

110
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:48,332
That's strange.

111
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,165
If you move even a little bit,

112
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:29,466
you'll be shot

113
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:30,999
in the head.

114
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:42,571
Even if you get rid of me,

115
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:46,165
you won't be freed from your crimes.

116
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,289
Crimes?

117
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:49,652
You call it a crime to
protect the country

118
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:50,853
from hypocrites like you?

119
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:53,536
You say it's to protect the country.

120
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,447
But you're just a murderer.

121
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:57,594
How dare you run your mouth?

122
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,599
Director Choi.

123
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,064
Sixty years ago, I was born

124
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,161
to one of the poorest
families in the world.

125
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:09,565
My father, mother,

126
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,382
sisters,

127
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:16,686
and brothers studied and
worked really hard to live well.

128
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,815
When we fell, we got
up and tried to get by.

129
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:20,516
And now,

130
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,871
we're getting by just fine.

131
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,265
I thought the peace would last.

132
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,051
But some rats sneaked into my house,

133
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:30,602
and spread an infectious disease.

134
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:32,002
What would you do if you were me?

135
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,265
Don't you think you should kill them?

136
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:39,116
But...

137
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:43,465
one of the rats, a know-it-all,

138
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,986
brands me an animal abuser or a criminal

139
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:48,098
just because I killed some of the rats.

140
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:50,165
Now she makes a mess in my house,

141
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,698
and lashes out at me.

142
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:53,151
How can you make such an excuse

143
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:54,686
after killing all those people?

144
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:55,951
I'm not making an excuse.

145
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:57,736
I'm just letting you
know that you're wrong

146
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:59,315
about what you think is justice.

147
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:03,181
The Republic of Korea,
our country

148
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:06,781
is our house where
50 million people live in.

149
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,801
It's a precious house

150
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:11,868
that we'll pass down to our descendants.

151
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:13,531
When you don't like someone in your family,

152
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,519
you consider them rats and
kill them. You call it justice?

153
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,881
Those who only damage my house

154
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,265
are just rats who deserve to die.

155
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:25,081
Who are you to decide that?

156
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,915
No wonder.

157
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:33,218
You've lived all your
life surrounded by crooks.

158
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,459
What would you know about it?

159
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,665
Think about the people around you.

160
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:43,048
Kim Tae-yeol, Kim Myung-jae,
and Lee Suk-gyu.

161
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:46,631
They're all rats.

162
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:54,765
Lee Suk-gyu is here.

163
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:56,598
Bring him here.

164
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:44,646
Lee Suk-gyu.

165
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:01,786
- Where's the tablet PC?
- Where's Yeon-soo?

166
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,586
Did you bring the tablet PC?

167
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,265
I can't answer before I see her.

168
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,299
Follow me.

169
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:37,099
Mr. Oh is dead.

170
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:40,915
Im Hyung-rak shot him.

171
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,748
He brought it upon himself.

172
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:45,848
He worried about you a lot

173
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,248
because you were doing
all the nasty things

174
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,869
to get on Im Hyung-rak's good side.

175
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:02,465
Can you afford to worry about me now?

176
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,099
There's a place

177
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:08,788
for your grave right up there.

178
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:38,566
Jung-hyun.

179
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,150
Yeon-soo. Are you okay?

180
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:14,969
Let her go first.

181
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,001
I'm sure it's in his bag.

182
00:19:18,851 --> 00:19:20,202
Just shoot him and check the bag.

183
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:21,798
I need to see it first.

184
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,688
What will happen if it falls from here?

185
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:28,000
Is this tablet PC...

186
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:31,212
more important to you
than a person like me?

187
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:35,661
You're amazing.

188
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:38,462
You're too good to die in vain
because of a woman like that.

189
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,765
- Shut it.
- Lee Suk-gyu.

190
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,147
Watch your mouth, you jerk.

191
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,665
Right, Lee Suk-gyu.

192
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:51,098
Your husband's real name is Lee Suk-gyu.

193
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:53,981
Even though you knew it,

194
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,404
you didn't resign from your post.

195
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,336
You knew that Kim Tae-yeol

196
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,448
intentionally hid the written will,

197
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:06,265
but you didn't say a
thing to Hwang Jung-ho.

198
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:10,836
A hypocrite who airs
the dirty laundry of others,

199
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,731
but hides her own dirty secrets.

200
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:15,565
That's you.

201
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,068
Stop talking crap.

202
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:21,818
Yes, I'm a hypocrite.

203
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:24,581
- Yeon-soo.
- I didn't want people to know

204
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:27,136
that I'd been deluded and wrong,

205
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:28,216
for all those years.

206
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:31,915
Yes.

207
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:35,165
I wanted to look perfect. I'm a hypocrite.

208
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:39,031
But that doesn't mean
what you've done can be forgiven.

209
00:21:39,112 --> 00:21:40,451
I don't need to be forgiven.

210
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,627
I didn't do anything wrong.

211
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,465
You killed Cha Min-ho and Park Won-jong
because of money.

212
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:46,811
Mr. Im didn't bat an eyelid

213
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:49,036
when he wasted 100 billion won

214
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:50,569
trying to save this country.

215
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:52,351
When you lost 100 billion won,

216
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:54,998
did he pat you on the back?

217
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,131
I can't stand it anymore!

218
00:21:58,446 --> 00:21:59,446
You still don't get it?

219
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:01,414
Park Won-jong, Cha Min-ho,

220
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:03,531
and you'll be next, Do Young-geol.

221
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:04,831
Mr. Im.

222
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:07,898
I'll handle these two.

223
00:22:09,732 --> 00:22:10,981
Don't do anything.

224
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:13,101
Put that down.

225
00:22:15,382 --> 00:22:16,382
Jung-hyun.

226
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:17,931
I'm okay.

227
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,981
Just take it to the CIO.

228
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:22,178
Put it down on the ground!

229
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,341
Jung-hyun!

230
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:58,781
What a crazy jerk!

231
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:02,331
You crazy jerk! I told you
not to do anything!

232
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:17,405
Are you okay, Yeon-soo?

233
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:21,482
Mr. Im.

234
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:22,782
Young-geol.

235
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:25,101
Your hand, Young-geol.

236
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,099
Stretch out your hand.

237
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:35,098
You mean, this hand?

238
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:36,866
Yes. Young-geol.

239
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,602
Hey. As long as we have this,

240
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:39,981
we can make a fresh start.

241
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:48,058
Good.

242
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:56,881
Hurry up, you punk!

243
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:02,531
Stretch farther, you punk!

244
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:08,107
Stretch farther.

245
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,466
A bit more.

246
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,515
Yeon-soo. Yeon-soo!

247
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:40,415
Gosh.

248
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:44,558
<i><font color="#80ffff">You still don't get it?</i></font>

249
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:46,936
Park Won-jong, Cha Min-ho,

250
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:49,048
and you'll be next, Do Young-geol.

251
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:57,981
What are you doing?

252
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,498
What a crazy jerk!

253
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:04,098
You crazy jerk! I told
you not to do anything!

254
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,165
Am I also...

255
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,690
a useless rat

256
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:12,451
who deserves to die?

257
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:13,583
You crazy jerk!

258
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,516
This is no time to talk about that!

259
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:19,169
You just treat me like an idiot.

260
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:21,048
Gosh, you crazy jerk.

261
00:26:21,691 --> 00:26:23,091
Hurry up and stretch out your hand!

262
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:27,699
Hey!

263
00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:28,982
Do Young-geol!

264
00:26:30,032 --> 00:26:31,032
You jerk!

265
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,005
Come back!

266
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:37,999
Do Young-geol!

267
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:48,021
Jung-hyun.

268
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:49,816
Jung-hyun.

269
00:28:58,782 --> 00:29:00,048
One, two, three.

270
00:29:00,492 --> 00:29:01,519
Jung-hyun.

271
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,769
Wake up, Jung-hyun.

272
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:05,698
One, two, three, four, five, six...

273
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:07,232
Jung-hyun.

274
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:08,498
You can't die like this.

275
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,082
Jung-hyun.

276
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,148
One, two, three, four, five.

277
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,865
One, two, three, four...

278
00:29:25,482 --> 00:29:28,032
Wake up, Han Jung-hyun!

279
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:32,099
Jung-hyun.

280
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:36,449
Yeon-soo.

281
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:39,325
Are you okay?

282
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,155
Yes.

283
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,097
It's okay. Everything is okay.

284
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:47,331
It's okay.

285
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,781
Jung-hyun.

286
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:58,015
<font color="#ffff00">CIO</font>

287
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:08,499
Director!

288
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:23,099
Here!

289
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:28,419
Mr. Choo! We found him

290
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:29,731
Im Hyung-rak is here!

291
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:31,515
What's going on? Is he dead?

292
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,081
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

293
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:36,115
There's a dead person here.

294
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:37,665
Retrieve his body.

295
00:30:40,497 --> 00:30:41,690
Oh, wait!

296
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:44,019
Call for back-up and report it.

297
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,131
Yes, sir.

298
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,891
Im Hyung-rak abducted Choi Yeon-soo?

299
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:03,966
What are you saying?

300
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:08,995
Tell me in detail.

301
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:11,649
Yes.

302
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,372
Okay.

303
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:16,556
Go back to the Blue House.

304
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:17,896
Yes, sir.

305
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:37,065
- Dad.
- Dad.

306
00:31:39,726 --> 00:31:41,225
Oh. When did you come?

307
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,431
What happened to you?

308
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:47,881
Where's your mom?

309
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:50,481
Mom hurt her head,
so she went to have it tested.

310
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:56,732
You guys were worried, weren't you?

311
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,216
I had...

312
00:32:00,282 --> 00:32:01,431
something to do.

313
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:03,331
There hasn't been a quiet day

314
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:05,447
since Mom became Director of the CIO.

315
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:07,588
Sorry.

316
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:10,654
We're sorry. It's all over now.

317
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,598
It's over when you're hurt like this?

318
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:18,835
Seung-goo.

319
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,934
Did you take good care of

320
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:23,014
Seung-mi and your mom while I was away?

321
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:27,351
Good.

322
00:32:28,566 --> 00:32:30,898
I was away on your birthday.

323
00:32:31,987 --> 00:32:33,270
When I go back home,

324
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:35,814
I'll throw you a proper birthday party.

325
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:37,236
Dad.

326
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:38,598
Get well soon.

327
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:40,165
And come back home.

328
00:32:40,966 --> 00:32:42,726
Even though you were away,
I still did well.

329
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,291
But I like it better when you're home.

330
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:54,637
Mom. Dad has woken up.

331
00:32:57,382 --> 00:32:58,915
Mom. Are you okay?

332
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:01,731
Yes, I am.

333
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:04,066
The doctor said
my head is as hard as a rock.

334
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,319
Right. I take after you,

335
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,648
so I have a rock head too.

336
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:08,932
What?

337
00:33:09,275 --> 00:33:12,030
Right. Seung-mi is a rock head.

338
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:13,293
Mom is a rock head too.

339
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:15,831
Hey, Han Seung-goo. Don't go too far.

340
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:17,606
My head is just slightly hard.

341
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:21,366
But you and Mom have rock-hard heads.

Why?

355
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:49,269
I strained my muscles last night,

356
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:50,781
so they're cramped.

357
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:53,598
What happened? Were you beaten again?

358
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,366
No.

359
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,619
I ran after the wanted
criminals last night.

360
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,186
One of them suddenly popped out,

361
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,015
so I hit him with my wooden sword.

362
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,569
It was no joke.

363
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:06,310
Right. It was no joke.

364
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:11,786
Director Choi got abducted,

365
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:13,898
and went through a lot yesterday.

366
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:16,606
It's no time to tell her
your heroic anecdote.

367
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:17,952
Was just...

368
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:19,819
Director Choi aside,

369
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,968
Mr. Han barely made
it back to this world

370
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:25,919
before meeting the
kings of the underworld.

371
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:26,999
Oh, my.

372
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,202
Is he okay?

373
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:30,315
Yes, fortunately.

374
00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:32,098
Anyway, good job.

375
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,131
You indeed did a good job.

376
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,165
- Right?
- He was better than I thought.

377
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,698
For goodness' sake.

378
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:40,502
By the way, you completely
fooled us, Mr. Choo.

379
00:34:40,582 --> 00:34:42,348
I'm scared that you'll punch me.

380
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:44,165
I wouldn't dare to betray you.

381
00:34:47,325 --> 00:34:49,641
Well... That was...

382
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:53,200
All right. Let me express
my personal feelings.

383
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,699
Oh. gosh.

384
00:34:57,532 --> 00:35:00,315
<i><font color="#80ffff">- Let's not talk about that.</i></font>
- Mr. Bae!

385
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:03,148
It makes me feel like my nose tingles.

386
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:05,355
Let's talk more back at the office.

387
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,660
Are we going back to the CIO right away?

388
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:10,108
Yes. We have a lot of things to do.

389
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:11,954
All right. Let's go home.

390
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:19,799
- Mr. Bae.
- Yes?

391
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:21,565
Let's drink soju tonight.

392
00:35:21,646 --> 00:35:23,432
How about some expensive liquor instead?

393
00:35:23,632 --> 00:35:24,632
Another time, then.

394
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:26,500
For goodness' sake.

395
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:27,916
- Bye.
- Bye.

396
00:35:28,432 --> 00:35:29,698
I'll buy you a drink.

397
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:45,600
Aren't you going home?

398
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:47,850
Let's have dinner together sometime.

399
00:35:48,261 --> 00:35:49,619
Having a drink would be better.

400
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:50,727
Sorry?

401
00:35:50,808 --> 00:35:52,589
- Never mind if you don't want to.
- When?

402
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:56,718
Now.

403
00:35:57,275 --> 00:35:59,141
I-I'm free tonight.

404
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:01,817
- Let's go.
- Okay.

405
00:36:11,966 --> 00:36:14,015
- Oh, there he comes.
- There he comes.

406
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:17,102
Mr. Yoo. Please say a word

407
00:36:17,182 --> 00:36:18,552
about the slush fund scandal

408
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:19,832
that took place last night.

409
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:23,328
The Equality and Harmony Party

410
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:24,986
got caught

411
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:27,286
while they were sharing illegal funds,

412
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:29,131
but they say they're innocent.

413
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:32,481
I can't believe they
did it at their pep rally.

414
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:36,065
They should be ashamed of themselves.

415
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,318
The police had already been tipped off
about the bribery,

416
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,319
which took place at the pep rally.

417
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,948
Some experts said

418
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:45,719
the Justice Party could've won
200 seats at most

419
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:47,331
if the plan had succeeded.

420
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:48,412
What's your opinion?

421
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:53,465
Why are you asking me about it?

422
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:57,015
- Mr. Yoo!
- Mr. Yoo!

423
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:01,881
<i><font color="#80ffff">As some raised the possibility</i></font>

424

429
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,449
Gosh, you startled me.

430
00:37:24,063 --> 00:37:25,702
You were asking questions
on TV just now,

431
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:27,081
and you popped up from nowhere.

432
00:37:27,257 --> 00:37:29,290
When will you give me the last article?

433
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,716
"CIO Director Choi
Yeon-soo's Empty Pledges."

434
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:35,735
We won't publish it.

435
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:36,831
Goodness.

436
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:38,711
Why? Are you curious?

437
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,698
You should've told me earlier then.

438
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:42,168
<font color="#ffff00">Daehan Jeil Daily</font>

439
00:37:42,249 --> 00:37:43,249
Gosh.

440
00:37:58,616 --> 00:38:00,285
Why didn't you tell me

441
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:01,898
that you were preparing for this?

442
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:04,508
You told me to resign

443
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:06,595
because you were scared of Im Hyung-rak.

444
00:38:06,676 --> 00:38:07,798
I'm sorry.

445
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:10,678
What is this regarding?

446
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,248
"Return to the CIO."

447
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:17,298
It's a message from the VIP.

448
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:19,427
I will.

449
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:20,884
I have to finish this work.

450
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,981
<i><font color="#80ffff">Okay. Please do so.
See you soon.</i></font>

451
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:52,598
They said it was a miracle.

452
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,681
Do you believe in miracles?

453
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:59,731
But there's no way
you can get away with this.

454
00:39:00,282 --> 00:39:01,798
Abduction, confinement, and murders.

455
00:39:02,816 --> 00:39:04,786
If I tell what I've gone
through and witnessed,

456
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:06,915
you'll face a heavy sentence.

457
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,731
You're full of confidence.

458
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:12,219
You think you won?

459
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:13,331
Of course.

460
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:14,674
I beat you.

461
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:15,755
Don't flatter yourself.

462
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:18,481
The world won't change
no matter what you do.

463
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:22,072
See you in the interrogation room.

464
00:39:23,382 --> 00:39:24,648
Don't skip meals.

465
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,898
<font color="#ffff00">Recording</font>

466
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:45,329
Hi.

467
00:39:46,472 --> 00:39:48,896
Hi. Im Hyung-rak has woken up too.

468
00:39:49,745 --> 00:39:50,745
How is he?

469
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:52,781
He's totally fine. They say it's a miracle.

470
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:55,798
What about Do Young-geol?

471
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,760
He died at the scene.

472
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:03,867
How about you? Are you okay?

473
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:12,260
When I saw you being held hostage,

474
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,321
I regretted so much.

475
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:19,148
It happened because I had lived
as Han Jung-hyun.

476
00:40:20,392 --> 00:40:21,836
If I hadn't,

477
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:26,064
you wouldn't have gone through all that.

478
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:28,398
Han Jung-hyun.

479
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:30,899
Do you regret using that name?

480
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:32,905
Yes.

481
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:35,221
I do.

482
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,448
I regret it...

483
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,172
over and over.

484
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:44,565
But at the end of it,

485
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:46,165
there are Seung-mi,

486
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:48,716
Seung-goo,

487
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,548
and you.

488
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:57,965
And when I regret regretting it,

489
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,281
there's again the name,

490
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:03,849
Han Jung-hyun.

491
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:11,661
Now that name

492
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:15,148
is too much for me.

493
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:20,065
To get your name back,

494
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:22,865
you'll have to take responsibility.

495
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:26,699
Right.

496
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,891
Oh, I was reinstated.

497
00:41:39,466 --> 00:41:40,881
I told you.

498
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,682
That everything would go well
as you thought.

499
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,599
Thanks.

500
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,398
No problem.

501
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,011
- It's time for an injection.
- I see.

502
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:17,762
I'll be going.

503
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,430
Kang Choong-mo, speaking.

504
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:43,560
<i><font color="#80ffff">This is Im Hyung-rak, Mr. Kang.</i></font>

505
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:53,202
<i><font color="#80ffff">You must be busy,</i></font>

506
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:55,800
so let me get straight to the point.

507
00:42:56,082 --> 00:42:57,881
What is that?

508
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:01,148
The tablet PC
that Choi Yeon-soo took.

509
00:43:01,898 --> 00:43:03,664
It contains a bomb.

510
00:43:04,508 --> 00:43:05,508
<i><font color="#80ffff">Stop her</i></font>

511
00:43:06,632 --> 00:43:08,948
if you don't want
this country to explode.

512
00:43:09,232 --> 00:43:10,498
What are you...

513
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:13,048
talking about?

514
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,019
Attorney Park.

515
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:17,415
Send this picture to him.

516
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,135
Thanks.

517
00:43:19,216 --> 00:43:22,065
I just sent you a picture.

518
00:43:43,449 --> 00:43:45,131
This won't let you get away with it.

519
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,798
You seem to be mistaken.

520
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:51,162
<i><font color="#80ffff">It's not for my sake.</i></font>

521
00:43:51,243 --> 00:43:52,148
What?

522
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,602
I'm worried about the confusion

523
00:43:53,682 --> 00:43:55,215
that the country might fall into.

524
00:43:55,749 --> 00:43:58,015
I'm giving you a warning.

525
00:43:58,283 --> 00:43:59,316
You...

526
00:43:59,397 --> 00:44:01,631
<i><font color="#80ffff">The day I get released,</i></font>

527
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:03,581
let's have makgeolli together.

528
00:44:04,555 --> 00:44:05,787
Attorney Park.

529
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:10,321
Stupid fools.

530
00:44:13,932 --> 00:44:16,874
Darn it.

531
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:27,102
A week before the presidential election.

532
00:44:27,188 --> 00:44:28,885
Im Hyung-rak's tablet PC says,

533
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,781
"5.23 billion won, cash, Kim Myung-jae."

534
00:44:32,059 --> 00:44:34,423
The same thing is written
in Kim Myung-jae's notebook.

535
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:35,630
So,

536
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:37,098
it confirms that Im Hyung-rak

537
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:39,298
bribed Kim Myung-jae with the money.

538
00:44:39,775 --> 00:44:42,041
It's how he stopped
the Budget Transparency Act.

539
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:44,506
What about the deposit
and withdrawal details?

540
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,486
This tablet PC itself

541
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:49,348
is the bankbook of Swiss Center Bank.

542
00:44:49,882 --> 00:44:51,102
On October 17,

543
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:52,782
a hundred million dollars was withdrawn.

544
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:55,048
What, a hundred million dollars?

545
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,569
So they brought the money in,

546
00:44:57,649 --> 00:44:59,698
and bribed people with it this time.

547
00:45:00,232 --> 00:45:01,232
Exactly.

548
00:45:01,482 --> 00:45:02,702
The current balance is

549
00:45:02,782 --> 00:45:04,331
approximately 353 million dollars.

550
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:06,421
It's 390 billion won.

551
00:45:06,502 --> 00:45:08,731
My. Goodness.

552
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:11,549
By the way...

553
00:45:12,332 --> 00:45:14,848
What, is there more?

554
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,448
Go on.

555
00:45:20,732 --> 00:45:22,486
That's not all that's in here.

556
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:24,546
13 members of the ruling party

557
00:45:24,632 --> 00:45:26,102
and 14 members of
the opposition party

558
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,742
including Assemblyman Yoo Sang-dong.

559
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:29,216
What?

560
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:31,936
Senior Secretary for State Affairs,
Senior Secretary of Personnel Affairs,

561
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:34,048
and three secretaries.

562
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:38,115
This is outrageous.

563
00:45:38,475 --> 00:45:42,401
More than 20 governmental officials,
and reporters.

564
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:43,936
The dates and amounts of the money

565
00:45:44,016 --> 00:45:45,202
that these people
received are saved here.

566
00:45:45,282 --> 00:45:47,298
Hold on a second.

567
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:48,848
Director Choi.

568
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:52,198
Before we get started
to bulldoze them out,

569
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:54,781
let's think a little.

570
00:45:55,816 --> 00:45:58,598
They bribed so many people.

571
00:45:58,866 --> 00:45:59,802
Director.

572
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,448
Exposing this will cause a huge impact.

573
00:46:02,732 --> 00:46:03,998
It means

574
00:46:04,282 --> 00:46:06,331
we have to fight a full-scale war

575
00:46:06,412 --> 00:46:08,494
against the high
officials in this country.

576
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:10,952
Even if we investigate all these cases,

577
00:46:11,032 --> 00:46:13,798
a legal fight won't be easy.

578
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:16,098
They are connected to each other for sure.

579
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:19,965
I wonder if we can pull it off.

580
00:46:20,482 --> 00:46:22,685
Director Choi, what should we do?

581
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:24,836
Gosh, you know already.

582
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:27,869
This is like the worst wasp nest

583
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:31,531
which you shouldn't
even bother to touch.

584
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:33,066
Mr. Bae.

585
00:46:34,366 --> 00:46:36,569
What will you do if that wasp nest

586
00:46:36,649 --> 00:46:39,448
is inside your house?

587
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,168
Isn't it obvious?

588
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:43,565
I'll call someone to get rid of it.

589
00:46:45,243 --> 00:46:48,564
Right, I think
we're that someone.

590
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:50,215
Am I wrong?

591
00:46:58,699 --> 00:46:59,699
Aren't we?

592
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:20,948
<font color="#ffff00">Director Choi Yeon-soo</font>

593
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:28,945
Have a seat.

594
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,281
What brings you here?

595
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:45,854
The tablet PC.

596
00:47:47,652 --> 00:47:49,752
- Did you open it?
- Yes.

597
00:47:49,832 --> 00:47:52,573
So you know it's a Pandora's box.

598
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:56,119
You're the only one

599
00:47:56,725 --> 00:47:57,655
who can cover it up.

600
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:02,516
Cover it up?

601
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,398
Do you really not know

602
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:05,869
what's best for this country?

603
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,998
If you have cancer, you don't cover it up.

604
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:10,598
You cut it out.

605
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,181
Let me give you some advice.

606
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:18,798
The world can't be
divided into good and evil.

607
00:48:19,582 --> 00:48:21,052
You open that Pandora's box

608
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,586
with that dichotomous way of thinking,

609
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,448
the world will fall into disorder.

610
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,152
Thanks for the advice.

611
00:48:27,232 --> 00:48:30,160
And you will have to take
The sole responsibility.

612
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,285
Don't you get it?

613
00:48:34,749 --> 00:48:38,081
I've seen my husband get shot.

614
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,115
I've seen people die before me.

615
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:42,965
That's not all.

616
00:48:43,051 --> 00:48:44,817
To save my husband,

617
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:47,307
I even shot someone.

618
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:52,124
I don't fear anything now.

619
00:48:53,466 --> 00:48:55,298
Do you really not know that

620
00:48:56,082 --> 00:48:58,398
your stubbornness
got you into that danger?

621
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:00,215
Let me give you advice.

622
00:49:01,782 --> 00:49:02,986
If you sacrifice

623
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:05,098
the few for the many,

624
00:49:06,132 --> 00:49:08,415
you might end up becoming a monster.

625
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:12,690
Just like Im Hyung-rak.

626
00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:18,960
So be careful.

00:49:37,632 --> 00:49:39,915
<font color="#ffff00">CIO</font>

628
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:46,302
I'm Director Choi Yeon-soo of the CIO.

629
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:49,869
As the result of this investigation,

630
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:51,277
we have indicted

631
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:53,290
Im Hyung-rak, 27 assemblymen,

632
00:49:53,371 --> 00:49:57,384
five senior secretaries of the Blue House
and government secretaries,

633
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:59,493
another 20 people and more

634
00:49:59,578 --> 00:50:03,439
for violating Public Service
Ethics Law, and bribery.

635
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:06,669
In particular, Im Hyung-rak
siphoned away the special budget

636
00:50:06,749 --> 00:50:08,436
provided with
the people's tax money

637
00:50:08,516 --> 00:50:09,986
under the name, Widow's Cruse Project.

638
00:50:10,066 --> 00:50:13,131
By making use of organizations and
information, he invested this money

639
00:50:13,212 --> 00:50:17,248
to create a secret fund
worth hundreds of billions of won.

640
00:50:17,802 --> 00:50:19,218
With that secret fund,

641
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:21,039
he bribed high officials

642
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,848
in order to maintain his vested rights.

643
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,731
He even formed a private group
in an attempt to interfere

644
00:50:26,812 --> 00:50:28,798
with the election.

645
00:50:29,316 --> 00:50:32,019
Moreover, three informants were killed

646
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,518
trying to report this
for the public good

647
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:38,236
which also has to do
with Im Hyung-rak.

648
00:50:38,876 --> 00:50:40,486
I'd like to express

649
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:43,318
my condolences to
those late informants

650
00:50:43,399 --> 00:50:45,181
who tried to report
this for our society.

652
00:50:59,212 --> 00:51:00,228
Dear everyone,

653
00:51:01,466 --> 00:51:03,098
a deep-rooted evil is extensive.

654
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:05,836
Through this investigation,

655
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:08,998
we aim to make everyone believe

656
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:12,801
that whoever
abuses their power and authority,

657
00:51:12,882 --> 00:51:16,465
for their own interest
shall pay the price.

658
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:20,243
Here in this country,

659
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:21,376
we will be a warning sign,

660
00:51:21,457 --> 00:51:23,381
so the same corruption
will never happen.

661
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:26,215
We will not stop

662
00:51:26,732 --> 00:51:29,065
getting rid of corruption.

regarding the accused,

I don't know anything

673
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:55,098
except that it was closed as a suicide.

00:52:55,616 --> 00:52:56,616
Attorney Kim.

675
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:58,352
Kim Kwang-chul made a statement that

676
00:52:58,432 --> 00:52:59,886
he and Do Young-geol
had Park Won-jong

677
00:52:59,966 --> 00:53:01,533
confined in a warehouse in Gyeonggi.

678
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:03,284
I'm sorry I missed your question.

679
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:04,697
Can you say it again?

680
00:53:06,132 --> 00:53:07,336
Kim Kwang-chul made a statement that

681
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:09,136
he and Do Young-geol
had Park Won-jong

682
00:53:09,216 --> 00:53:10,686
confined in a warehouse in Gyeonggi.

683
00:53:10,766 --> 00:53:11,766
Don't you know it?

<font color="#ffff00">Judge stand</font>

685
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:15,569
I don't know.

686
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:16,931
How is it that you don't know?

687
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,514
Kim Kwang-chul also stated

688
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,986
that Park Won-jong and Do Young-geol

689
00:53:21,066 --> 00:53:22,769
frequently met you
to cooperate with you.

690
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:24,115
Do you still not know?

691
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,601
Before Park Won-jong was investigated,

692
00:53:26,682 --> 00:53:28,152
for embezzling public funds,

693
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:31,048
I thought he was competent
and hardworking.

694
00:53:31,316 --> 00:53:32,565
The same for Do Young-geol.

695
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:34,513
Before he went astray,

696
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:36,936
he was my loyal subordinate.

697
00:53:38,811 --> 00:53:40,577
So you don't know?

698
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:42,690
No.

Park Won-jong withdrew
the bonds in Switzerland,

726
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,221
and sent it via the diplomatic pouch.

727
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:08,701
You got your hands on them,

728
00:55:08,782 --> 00:55:10,382
and handed them to Do Young-geol, no?

729
00:55:11,132 --> 00:55:12,052
No.

730
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:13,165
"No."

731
00:55:17,032 --> 00:55:19,048
Then what was in your bag?

732
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:25,169
It's classified information.

733
00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:27,315
The unregistered bonds were in it!

734
00:55:28,712 --> 00:55:29,961
Objection, Your Honor.

735
00:55:30,275 --> 00:55:31,318
The prosecution is distressing

736
00:55:31,399 --> 00:55:33,698
the accused with speculative remarks.

737
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,515
All right, prosecutor.

738
00:55:38,321 --> 00:55:40,394
Refrain from making speculative remarks.

739
00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:50,295
Look at how he's slipping out.

740
00:55:51,012 --> 00:55:53,844
That darn piece of trash.

741
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:57,131
Goodness gracious.

742
00:55:58,468 --> 00:56:01,034
<font color="#ffff00">Oh Pil-jae rests here</font>

743
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:09,696
Don't worry about your youngest.

744
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:11,948
I'll take good care of her.

745
00:56:16,194 --> 00:56:19,227
<font color="#ffff00">Oh Pil-jae rests here</font>

746
00:56:20,382 --> 00:56:21,648
<font color="#ffff00">Emergency Medical Center</font>

747
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:31,245
I promise I'll make Im Hyung-rak
pay for your life.

748
00:56:35,299 --> 00:56:36,831
I'm sorry...

749
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:39,648
I haven't kept my promise yet.

750
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:44,481
You see,

751
00:56:45,266 --> 00:56:46,546
I'm going to make a fresh start.

752
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:49,565
So I won't be able to
come for some time.

753
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:53,416
Bye, Pil-jae.

754
00:56:57,675 --> 00:56:59,240
<font color="#ffff00">Oh Pil-jae rests here</font>

755
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:24,309
Yoon-joo.

756
00:57:25,831 --> 00:57:26,897
You look fine.

757
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:28,315
For someone who got shot.

758
00:57:29,866 --> 00:57:30,866
Yes.

759
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:33,682
Thanks.

760
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:38,938
I think I can see the face

761
00:57:39,019 --> 00:57:40,379
of Im Hyung-rak, that man, now.

762
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,631
Are you doing better?

763
00:57:44,682 --> 00:57:45,698
Thanks to you,

764
00:57:46,908 --> 00:57:47,923
I feel...

765
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:50,348
a little free now.

766
00:57:51,738 --> 00:57:52,768
That's good to hear.

767
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:54,998
It would've been nicer
if he was dead.

768
00:58:01,149 --> 00:58:03,465
Good work. Agent Lee Suk-gyu.

769
00:58:08,032 --> 00:58:09,548
Congrats, Agent Go Yoon-joo.

770
00:58:10,478 --> 00:58:11,761
It's too early for that.

771
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:16,315
Tell Choi Yeon-soo to make sure

772
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:18,142
Im Hyung-rak gets locked up in jail.

773
00:58:18,859 --> 00:58:19,859
All right.

774
00:58:20,362 --> 00:58:21,494
I'll tell her that.

775
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,431
She can do it, right?

776
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:27,131
She will.

777
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:29,998
If he gets released,

778
00:58:30,234 --> 00:58:32,338
I might kill him for real.

779
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,015
Did you instruct to abduct Choi Yeon-soo?

780
00:58:52,816 --> 00:58:53,831
No.

781
00:58:54,225 --> 00:58:56,086
Then why were you at the construction site?

782
00:58:56,182 --> 00:58:58,419
I discovered the lapse
of my old subordinate.

783
00:58:58,499 --> 00:58:59,748
So I went there to stop him.

784
00:59:00,032 --> 00:59:01,536
According to Choi Yeon-soo's statement,

785
00:59:01,616 --> 00:59:03,085
you shot Do Young-geol yourself.

786
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,131
It eventually led him to die.

787
00:59:05,466 --> 00:59:06,715
<font color="#ffff00">Witness stand</font>

788
00:59:07,499 --> 00:59:09,048
Do Young-geol, that man

789
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,965
shot Choi Yeon-soo's civilian husband.

790
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,436
As a civil servant,

791
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:17,459
I made an inevitable choice
to save the civilian.

792
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:20,165
- What...
- Is that true?

793
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:23,381
If you don't have
any more questions,

794
00:59:23,782 --> 00:59:25,031
we will adjourn.

795
00:59:25,549 --> 00:59:26,549
Wait.

796
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:29,848
I'd like Han Jung-hyun,
the victim of this case,

797
00:59:32,432 --> 00:59:34,215
to stand as a witness.

798
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:36,952
- What?
- Her husband?

799
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,581
What's going on?

800
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:45,231
What's he going to say?

801
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,216
"I solemnly swear

802
00:59:56,749 --> 00:59:59,002
that I'll follow my
conscience to tell

803
00:59:59,082 --> 01:00:00,786
the truth without
hiding or adding anything.

804
01:00:00,866 --> 01:00:03,398
If anything I say is a lie,

805
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:05,431
I will take the punishment

806
01:00:05,966 --> 01:00:07,148
for committing perjury."

807
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:15,850
Witness,

808
01:00:16,499 --> 01:00:18,114
you were at the construction site, right?

809
01:00:18,337 --> 01:00:19,380
Yes.

810
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,365
Can you explain what happened?

811
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:26,023
Im Hyung-rak abducted my wife.

812
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,831
He told me to bring the tablet PC.

813
01:00:29,116 --> 01:00:30,365
Objection.

814
01:00:30,649 --> 01:00:32,369
That's his unilateral assertion.

815
01:00:32,449 --> 01:00:34,936
I've submitted the picture he sent me.

816
01:00:35,016 --> 01:00:37,531
The accused has never sent such a picture.

817
01:00:40,492 --> 01:00:42,007
Who was at the construction site?

818
01:00:43,482 --> 01:00:45,298
Do Young-geol and Im Hyung-rak.

819
01:00:45,566 --> 01:00:46,848
And another agent

820
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:48,569
was outside the building.

821
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:50,465
How did you get your
hands on that tablet PC?

822
01:00:53,832 --> 01:00:56,115
I took it from his office.

823
01:00:56,382 --> 01:00:57,382
Objection.

824
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:00,919
That means the tablet PC
was taken illegally.

825
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:04,036
According to Article 308-2
of the Criminal Procedure Code,

826
01:01:04,116 --> 01:01:06,665
it can't be used as evidence.

827
01:01:07,466 --> 01:01:08,748
What is he talking about?

828
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:13,365
Prosecution, didn't you confirm this?

829
01:01:25,632 --> 01:01:26,632
That man

830
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:29,415
was determined to kill
me and Choi Yeon-soo.

831
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:33,065
- What?
- Goodness.

832
01:01:34,616 --> 01:01:37,131
Your Honor, this is
only his assumption too.

833
01:01:37,212 --> 01:01:38,601
Do you have proof?

834
01:01:44,582 --> 01:01:45,552
<font color="#ffff00">Recording</font>

835
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:47,915
Could you listen to this?

836
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:49,199
What is that?

837
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:50,857
It's crucial evidence

838
01:01:50,938 --> 01:01:52,256
that can prove my statement.

839
01:01:52,485 --> 01:01:53,490
Objection.

840
01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:55,758
Hold on. Let's listen to it.

841
01:02:01,299 --> 01:02:02,315
Play it right away.

842
01:02:04,382 --> 01:02:05,681

- is winning the war.
- Then...

854
01:02:36,072 --> 01:02:38,067

still Choi Yeon-soo and Lee Suk-gyu.

860
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:50,848
Use your imagination.

861
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:52,801
Choi Yeon-soo found out

862
01:02:52,882 --> 01:02:54,431
about her husband's real identity.

863
01:02:54,949 --> 01:02:56,186
It wouldn't be strange to say

864
01:02:56,266 --> 01:02:58,685
that they killed each other
while arguing.

865
01:02:58,766 --> 01:02:59,525

01:03:31,832 --> 01:03:32,848
to that man,

879

Im Hyung-rak.

880
01:03:36,432 --> 01:03:38,731
- My goodness.
- Is this true?

881
01:03:39,266 --> 01:03:41,031
- Unbelievable.
- My gosh.

882
01:03:41,316 --> 01:03:43,881

please consider this as evidence.

You see,

889
01:04:14,232 --> 01:04:16,015
I had another name.

890
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:18,365
Another name?

891
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:24,731
Lee Suk-gyu.

892
01:04:25,282 --> 01:04:26,486
What do you mean?

893
01:04:26,566 --> 01:04:27,831
Your name...

894
01:04:28,349 --> 01:04:30,131
is Lee Suk-gyu?

895
01:04:31,095 --> 01:04:33,365
Why do you have two names?

896
01:04:36,652 --> 01:04:38,201
My actual name is...

897
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:40,601
Lee Suk-gyu.

898
01:04:42,732 --> 01:04:44,701
The name I had

899
01:04:44,782 --> 01:04:46,048
since a very long time ago.

900
01:04:46,832 --> 01:04:48,098
I really wanted

901
01:04:48,382 --> 01:04:49,898
to tell you this.

902
01:04:52,211 --> 01:04:53,477
I should've told you sooner.

903
01:04:53,816 --> 01:04:56,126
Then did your father

904
01:04:56,207 --> 01:04:59,022
also call you by that name?

905
01:05:02,802 --> 01:05:03,802
Yes.

906
01:05:07,627 --> 01:05:08,638
<font color="#ffff00">Witness stand</font>

907
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:09,922
Lee Suk-gyu is...

908
01:05:21,923 --> 01:05:22,944
me.

909
01:05:23,232 --> 01:05:25,236
- What?
- What on earth?

910
01:05:25,316 --> 01:05:27,365
- He's Lee Suk-gyu?
- What does he mean?

911
01:05:27,582 --> 01:05:29,398
- I don't understand.
- Goodness.

912
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:32,481
- No way.
- Unbelievable.

913
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:35,127
Quiet down.

914
01:05:35,789 --> 01:05:37,144
Witness,

915
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,852
you made an oath

916
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:41,369
that you were Han Jung-hyun just now.

917
01:05:41,449 --> 01:05:42,731
My actual name...

918
01:05:43,532 --> 01:05:44,815
is Lee Suk-gyu.

919
01:05:45,155 --> 01:05:47,948
680930-1257557.

920
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:49,754
An agent of Team Eight

921
01:05:49,835 --> 01:05:51,788
from the ANSP's Anti-communist Division.

922
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,515
Han Jung-hyun was a fake identity

923
01:05:56,048 --> 01:05:57,813
used to arrest Kim Tae-yeol,

924
01:05:59,149 --> 01:06:00,352
the chairman of the NCSR at that time.

925
01:06:00,432 --> 01:06:04,531
Witness, you are confessing
to your criminal act.

926
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,437
You could be punished for this.

927
01:06:06,518 --> 01:06:09,165
You could go to jail!

928
01:06:22,682 --> 01:06:24,165
I'm prepared for it.

929
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:27,048
- What...
- My.

930
01:06:49,275 --> 01:06:50,898
What is that?

931
01:06:51,768 --> 01:06:53,118
No way.

932
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:54,465
Oh, my.

933
01:06:58,475 --> 01:07:01,881
I'm truly apologetic

934
01:07:02,399 --> 01:07:04,102
for causing you concern

935
01:07:04,182 --> 01:07:05,965
about my husband's issue.

936
01:07:06,749 --> 01:07:09,531
To take responsibility, I will

937
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:13,148
resign from my
position as of this moment.

938
01:07:15,749 --> 01:07:17,281
I sincerely wish

939
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,065
that the CIO becomes

940
01:07:19,582 --> 01:07:21,115
an improved organization

941
01:07:21,899 --> 01:07:23,448
with someone greater.

942
01:07:24,715 --> 01:07:26,030
Thank you.

What about the kids?

962
01:08:38,668 --> 01:08:40,862
Seung-mi is getting
ready to start high school.

963
01:08:41,342 --> 01:08:43,289
Seung-goo is busy running the business.

964
01:08:54,032 --> 01:08:55,298
Why didn't you tell me?

965
01:08:58,182 --> 01:09:00,481
Why didn't you tell me the whole time?

966
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:07,043
I knew how you felt.

967
01:09:07,899 --> 01:09:09,652
None of this would've happened

968
01:09:09,732 --> 01:09:10,998
if you'd told me sooner.

969
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:15,957
Why didn't you tell me?

970
01:09:32,682 --> 01:09:34,231
The day Tae-yeol died...

971
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:39,748
No way.

972
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:43,615
Hwang Jung-ho's second
trial is to be held soon.

973
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:47,136
Witnesses or small clues about the case

974
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,515
could save him.

Mr. Oh, this is Suk-gyu.

979
01:10:07,482 --> 01:10:08,765
Are you standing by?

980
01:10:09,445 --> 01:10:10,744
Now is the time. Push in.

981
01:10:11,179 --> 01:10:13,210
<i><font color="#80ffff">I thought it was over.</i></font>

982
01:10:14,182 --> 01:10:15,182

<i><font color="#80ffff">I found out about his death.</i></font>

984
01:10:17,562 --> 01:10:18,994
Tae-yeol...

985
01:10:27,016 --> 01:10:29,381
I just couldn't tell you the truth.

986
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,992
I'm sorry.

987
01:11:07,049 --> 01:11:08,049
Hey.

988
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:12,381
How did you bear with all that?

989
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,465
Sorry.

990
01:11:16,016 --> 01:11:17,815
I made you find out
about it like that.

991
01:11:19,015 --> 01:11:20,047
You sly wench.

992
01:11:21,216 --> 01:11:22,465
So you know.

993
01:11:23,432 --> 01:11:25,531
Serves you right for liking handsome guys.

994
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:27,865
You evil wench.

995
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,481
You should be comforting me.

996
01:11:32,532 --> 01:11:33,532
Hey.

997
01:11:33,816 --> 01:11:35,268
While I went through three divorces,

998
01:11:35,349 --> 01:11:37,931
you never comforted me properly.

999
01:11:38,012 --> 01:11:39,012
You're right.

1000
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:40,915
But to be honest, they were all

1001
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:42,638
just too ugly.

1002
01:11:46,066 --> 01:11:47,066
I admit that.

1003
01:11:49,132 --> 01:11:50,916
- Ouch.
- You witch.

1004
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:53,365
My goodness.

1005
01:11:53,766 --> 01:11:55,298
So you know.

1006
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:57,467
You knew.

1007
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:00,648
You said they were all right.

1008
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:07,530
<font color="#ffff00">One year later</font>

1009
01:13:21,882 --> 01:13:22,882
Lee Suk-gyu.

1010
01:13:23,516 --> 01:13:25,228
- Dad.
- Dad.

1011
01:13:29,366 --> 01:13:30,493
Hey.

1012
01:13:35,432 --> 01:13:37,415
Suk-gyu, congrats.

1013
01:13:43,116 --> 01:13:44,915
Dad, you should eat it now.

1014
01:13:45,647 --> 01:13:47,067
Right, what are you waiting for?

1015
01:13:47,148 --> 01:13:48,313
They brought it from home.

1016
01:13:49,282 --> 01:13:50,331
Well...

1017
01:13:51,116 --> 01:13:52,381
If you don't feel like it,

1018
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:54,681
have it with spicy stir-fried pork at home.

1019
01:13:55,205 --> 01:13:56,237
Lee Seung-mi.

1020
01:13:56,318 --> 01:13:57,385
That's wrong.

1021
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:59,298
It should be eaten right now.

1022
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:01,066
"Lee Seung-mi"?

1023
01:14:04,254 --> 01:14:05,352
<font color="#ffff00">Lee Seung-mi</font>

1024
01:14:05,432 --> 01:14:06,465
Right.

1025
01:14:06,749 --> 01:14:09,015
Lee Seung-mi, Lee Seung-goo.

1026
01:14:15,332 --> 01:14:16,715
Lee Seung-goo.

1027
01:14:18,532 --> 01:14:19,532
Lee Seung-mi.

<font color="#ffff00">Lee Man-ho rests here</font>

1029
01:14:38,084 --> 01:14:39,850
He's our grandpa, right?

1030
01:14:42,138 --> 01:14:44,316
Is Grandpa resting here?

1031
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:48,166
Yes.

1032
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:51,481
He's resting here.

1033
01:15:00,532 --> 01:15:01,951
<font color="#ffff00">Lee Man-ho rests here</font>

1034
01:15:02,032 --> 01:15:04,064
He likes jawbreakers too, right?

1035
01:15:16,414 --> 01:15:17,794
Thanks, Seung-goo.

1036
01:15:23,182 --> 01:15:24,465
Dad.

1037
01:15:25,266 --> 01:15:26,281
This is...

1038
01:15:26,566 --> 01:15:27,815
Seung-goo.

1039
01:15:28,599 --> 01:15:29,881
This is Seung-mi.

1040
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,182
And this is your daughter-in-law,

1041
01:15:36,316 --> 01:15:37,348
Yeon-soo.

1042
01:15:44,032 --> 01:15:47,381
I'm sorry for introducing them too late.

1043
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:51,281
Grandpa.

1044
01:15:52,082 --> 01:15:53,331
I'm Seung-mi.

1045
01:15:54,366 --> 01:15:55,366
Lee Seung-mi.

1046
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:59,198
Father.

1047
01:16:04,866 --> 01:16:06,931
Dad must be happy.

<font color="#ffff00">Lee Man-ho rests here</font>

1049
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,581
What are you doing here in the cold?

1050
01:16:57,649 --> 01:16:59,215
In jail, I thought about it.

1051
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:06,987
That I'd never be forgiven.

1052
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:44,208
My hand does feel a bit empty.

1053
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:06,965
Seung-mi once said

1054
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:10,475
that we can forgive
one another for anything.

1055
01:18:57,216 --> 01:18:59,281
Let's go home now.

1056
01:19:03,581 --> 01:19:04,581
Okay.

1057
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,081
