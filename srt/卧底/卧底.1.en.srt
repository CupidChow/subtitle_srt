A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,760
HOLIDAY PARK ZONNEDAUW

3
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,240
Hi, Ferry.

4
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,680
ONE WEEK EARLIER

5
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,560
A nightclub?
Do you know how much work that is?

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,040
That doesn't matter. It's about the money.

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,040
Money, money... That money won't go
into your pocket.

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,400
One, it'll go to Serkan.

9
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,280
And two, look at Timur.
The casino he's opening.

10
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,400
Bro, Serkan can shove his club
up his ass.

11
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,760
I'll be behind the decks every weekend.
Resident DJ at my own club. Get it?

12
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,280
In no time, they'll be booking me
everywhere.

13
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,880
- Whatever you say, man.
- Spain, Brazil...

14
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,199
Qatar. Like Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike.

15
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,040
- I'll make my own money.
- Sure, man, sure. Dream on.

16
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,680
I'll give you all a ride
in my private jet.

17
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,560
Music.

18
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,920
Yusuf, what do you even know
about nightclubs and DJ'ing?

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,320
- You've never been into music before.
- I don't have time right now.

20
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,800
Finally. Leyla wants to see you.
You go with them, okay?

21
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,600
Okay.

22
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,640
- Timur.
- Yok, you stay here, okay?

23
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,720
Is everything okay?

24
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,080
We have to go.

25
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,800
What did she say?

26
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,240
We have to take care of something.

27
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
Where are we going?

28
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,600
Some guy who won't listen to Serkan.
We have to send him a message.

29
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,920
- Do you have a gun with you?
- No, man.

30
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
That's okay. I have one in the car.

31
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,680
Who is the guy we're looking for?

32
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,400
You're full of questions again.

33
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Watch out.

34
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,640
Go check if there's any damage.

35
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,960
I don't see anything.

36
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,600
How could you?

37
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
What the hell, man?

38
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,480
You ruined me.

39
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,920
My life is over.

40
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,680
Yusuf, what are you saying?
Please put the gun away.

41
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,320
I know you're a cop.

42
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,040
I thought we were friends.

43
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,040
We are friends.

44
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,280
- Where is this coming from?
- You're a UCA. The cops told me.

45
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
I got you in with Serkan.

46
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,520
Do you realize what'll happen to me?
He'll gut me like a fish.

47
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,320
- Please, calm down.
- My reputation is ruined.

48
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,040
Alright, it's true. I am a cop.

49
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,720
But think, Yusuf. You're not stupid.

50
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,600
You know what will happen
if you shoot a cop.

51
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,720
Every cop in the country
will come after you. And not just you.

52
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,240
They'll come after Timur
and Serkan as well.

53
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,800
It'll be over for you
and your entire gang.

54
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
It's already over.

55
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,040
It's going well.
I just have to plaster those two walls.

56
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,640
Another two days of work, I think.

57
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Yep.

58
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,040
Hold on, about that.
Can't you pay me in cash?

59
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,360
How long will you be in New York?

60
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,640
Are you serious? I can't wait two months.

61
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,560
Alright, we'll see.

62
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,280
If you know anyone else,
have them call me. I need the money.

63
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Thanks, man.

64
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,720
What are you doing here?

65
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,800
I heard I could find you here.

66
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,160
Can we talk? It's important.

67
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,200
Get in. I'm going to put this stuff away.

68
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,960
Are you making any money
working as a handyman?

69
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,960
I have to do something.

70
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,640
There aren't many career options
for ex-cops.

71
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
Yes, I've seen your file.

72
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,640
They've found some heavy ammo
to use against you. That witness?

73
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,080
They had to go to a French prison to find
someone willing to testify against me.

74
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,799
An Albanian, no less.
They must have promised him the world.

75
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,760
Then there's that colleague
who wants to testify.

76
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,720
The higher-ups want to settle a score.

77
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,160
I believe you.
I know what a snake pit it is.

78
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,800
Sure. But I'm the one who might go to jail
for five years.

79
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,280
What are you doing here anyway?

80
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,920
Did you hear about the Turkish guy
they found with a bullet in his head?

81
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,920
- I saw it in the paper, yes.
- He was a UCA.

82
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Fuck, man.

83
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,520
Do they know who did it?

84
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,360
Yes. Yusuf Celik. He was arrested
the next day, but he's not talking.

85
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,440
Celik is an errand boy
for Serkan Bulut's gang.

86
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,480
- Don't know him.
- Largest dealer in the Benelux right now.

87
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,520
But he covers his tracks well.

88
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,480
They tried to liquidate him two years ago
and he's been hiding ever since.

89
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,360
Everything is done through intermediaries.

90
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,880
When we catch one of his errand boys,
they claim they don't know anything.

91
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,760
I haven't slept
since they killed that kid.

92
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,480
- It was my fault. I should have done more.
- Really? In what way?

93
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,840
We suspect there's a mole
in our department.

94
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,600
We find a telephone number, it gets
disconnected before we can start a tap.

95
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,160
Major deals are cancelled
just as we're about to execute a raid.

96
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,880
I sent the UCA to find out
where the leak was.

97
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,240
I thought he was well covered.

98
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,840
I should have known better.

99
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,080
Patrick, don't get me wrong.

100
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,440
I think what happened is awful.
But what does this have to do with me?

101
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,080
I want you to find the mole.

102
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,920
- I'm not a cop anymore.
- That's the point.

103
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,760
You can go off the books.
Stay under the radar.

104
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,040
If no one knows,
no one can blow your cover.

105
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,960
Infiltrate them as a civilian?
No backup, no protection, nothing?

106
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
It's our only option.

107
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm paying through the nose for lawyers
because you guys are suing me.

108
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,400
And now you want me to help you?

109
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,240
Bob, this isn't about you or me
or the system.

110
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,200
This is about colleagues,
people who are at risk.

111
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,360
I've stuck my neck out enough.

112
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,520
I promise you, I'll use my full network

113
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,800
and all my clout to stop the lawsuit
against you if you help me.

114
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,560
And what guarantees do I have?

115
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,680
My word.

116
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,200
That won't put bread on the table
for my family.

117
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,520
And if you go to jail? How much bread
will you be able to put on the table then?

118
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,920
I'm not doing it. Find someone else.

119
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
Yes, yes...

120
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
- Surprise!
- You guys.

121
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
What is this?

122
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,120
It's your birthday next week, isn't it?

123
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,760
And we figured:
if we do a party a week in advance

124
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,760
he won't suspect anything. Right?

125
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,720
I baked a cake.

126
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,320
You did? All on your own?

127
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
- Yes.
- Surprise.

128
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,440
Polly.

129
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,360
- Hi there.
- How come you're in the country?

130
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,920
I have no classes this week

131
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,920
and Nathalie invited me
to join the celebration, so...

132
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
Happy birthday.

133
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,880
You arranged this behind my back?

134
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,720
Hey, come here you.

135
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,320
- You know I don't like surprises.
- Don't. Be careful with little Franky.

136
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,080
- Little Franky?
- Hold on, that's a working title.

137
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,840
Alright. Jackson, come on.

138
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,840
- Oh, honey. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

139
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,400
<i>- I see you found a job.
- As an industrial dishwasher.</i>

140
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,880
<i>- That was at the top of my list.
- Do you have experience?</i>

141
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,920
<i>I've done dishes before, yes.</i>

142
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,840
<i>- What about housing?
- Housing?</i>

143
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,640
My cousin Sonja has a room for me
for the first few weeks.

144
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,920
After that, we'll see.

145
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,840
<i>- And then there's your payment plan.
- What about it?</i>

146
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,360
<i>Look, this is what will be docked
every month until all your fines are paid.</i>

147
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,240
<i>The state took everything.
I have nothing left.</i>

148
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,480
<i>- How am I supposed to pay those?
- It'll be deducted from your wages.</i>

149
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,560
<i>So I have to work,
but I won't get any money?</i>

150
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,280
<i>A job is one of the conditions
for early release.</i>

151
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,280
<i>If you violate those terms,
you'll be in trouble.</i>

152
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,800
Jezebel, feet off the sofa.

153
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,200
Look who's here. Uncle Ferry.

154
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Come on, give your uncle a kiss. Be nice.

155
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
You've grown.

156
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,200
- Do you want a drink, Fer? A beer?
- In a minute.

157
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,360
I'll put my stuff away first.
Where's my room?

158
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,920
We've cleared out Jezebel's room for you.

159
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,880
Wait, before I forget...

160
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,720
Daan was able to set these aside
before they confiscated everything.

161
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,120
But she didn't have much time.
And this is from your lawyer.

162
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,760
It's all that was left after the expenses,
she said.

163
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,480
<i>So, no contact with ex-prisoners.
No drugs, no violence.</i>

164
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,720
<i>You can't miss any appointments
with me. If you don't stick to the rules</i>

165
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,200
<i>you'll have to sit out
the rest of your term.</i>

166
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,000
<i>One more thing, Mr. Bouman.
Keep your head in the game.</i>

167
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,920
<i>Try not to fall into the same pitfalls
as last time.</i>

168
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,600
<i>I've learned my lesson.</i>

169
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,440
- Do you have Danielle's new address?
- Yes.

170
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
I'm borrowing your car.

171
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

172
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,280
Just give me the address.

173
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
Hey, Tony.

174
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,040
Here we go, a round for everyone.

175
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,920
Ferry is back.
You know he's cheating, right?

176
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,600
Holy shit, Andre, you've grown fat.
You old coot.

177
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
How are you?

178
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,000
Lil, you look good. How are you?

179
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,520
Good. Do you want a drink?

180
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,200
- No, thanks, Ferry. We're not thirsty.
- Not thirsty, he says.

181
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,880
The biggest boozer in Western Europe
says he's not thirsty.

182
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,080
Come on, what are you drinking?
Party time.

183
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,280
No, thank you.

184
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,800
I'll tell you what everyone's thinking
but no one has the guts to say.

185
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
No one here is happy to see you again.

186
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,880
My daughter and her kids had to flee
after everything that happened here.

187
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
No one will buy her chalet
because you were all over the papers.

188
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,240
- Any more complaints?
- I'd rather you leave

189
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,680
before you start shooting machine guns
at our holiday park again.

190
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,480
I still have a bullet hole in my car
from last time.

191
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,360
So this is about money.
Why didn't you just say so? Here you go.

192
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,400
Here, take it,
and we'll forget about the whole thing.

193
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,320
Old grumbler.

194
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,480
Here you go, you swindler.

195
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Hey, hurry up, man.

196
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,760
You're slowing things down here.
And we're not even halfway.

197
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,080
There's another batch coming soon
from a fair with 500 visitors.

198
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,880
- Stop bitching.
- Excuse me?

199
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,760
If you talk to me like that again,
you're fired.

200
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,360
Hey, you can shove those plates
up your ass.

201
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Three hours?

202
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,600
You lasted only three hours?

203
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,520
I've never had a job before.
I don't know how to do it.

204
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,200
So learn.
I understand it's not easy for you.

205
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,520
You have to rebuild your life,
step by step.

206
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,680
And that caterer was obviously
not a good match.

207
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm going to enroll you in a course
on writing cover letters.

208
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,400
- Come on.
- It's mandatory.

209
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,840
And you need to think
about what you want to do with your life.

210
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,480
What are you good at?
What talents do you have?

211
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,600
Goddamnit.

212
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,160
- Honey? I'm home.
- Hey.

213
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,480
- You're late today.
- I know. I had to finish something.

214
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,760
- Two more days and I'll be done.
- Alright.

215
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,880
- Jackson is already in bed.
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

216
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,120
It's okay.
There are worse things in the world.

217
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,440
How have things been here?

218
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,800
- Has this little one been good?
- No, not at all.

219
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,880
Every time I fall asleep
he starts kicking.

220
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,840
Here, you feel that?

221
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,080
Good. We'll finally have
a professional soccer player.

222
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Yeah, right.

223
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,440
An official letter came for you.
It's on the table.

224
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,080
Thirty-two thousand
and five hundred euros.

225
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,920
We haven't even had the first hearing yet.
Lawyers, man. Fucking leeches.

226
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
Unbelievable.

227
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,480
Thierry will pay me next week.

228
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,800
Yes, 5,000 euros.

229
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,560
It's a start.

230
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,760
I'll deal with it.

231
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm going to bed, I'm exhausted.
Are you coming?

232
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,720
I'm going to install that range hood.

233
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,280
- Just to clear my head.
- Okay.

234
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,200
Honey...

235
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,640
It'll be okay.

236
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,160
I know. Good night.

237
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,920
TURKS AT THE BORDER

238
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,240
TURKS AT THE BORDER
EXECUTIONS, HOSTAGE TAKINGS

239
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,920
I've restarted my business.
I'll be able to deliver again soon.

240
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,800
You know I have nothing but respect
for you, Fer.

241
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,760
But I have to say no.
It just wasn't working anymore.

242
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
What do you mean?

243
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,880
I have a new supplier.

244
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,880
Excellent quality. Never any problems.

245
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,200
I can ask for as much as I want.
It gets delivered immediately.

246
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,000
On the same day if I want.
It's faster than Amazon.

247
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,040
- Sabrina, ice blocks.
- Who is it?

248
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,120
Serkan Bulut.

249
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,120
Serkan Bulut?
He couldn't even deliver a bag of candy.

250
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,080
He's a major player now.

251
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,200
He's everywhere, man. Like a virus.

252
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,240
His guys buy up all the ecstasy
in Limburg and Brabant

253
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,080
and he sells it at the lowest price.

254
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,400
He doesn't even produce it himself.
You're better off ordering from me.

255
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,840
Cut out the middle man.

256
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,680
It's not like it used to be.

257
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,200
I have a deal with Serkan.

258
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,000
And if he finds out
I'm doing business with you...

259
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,840
there'll be hell to pay.
He doesn't kid around.

260
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,840
So that's it?

261
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,440
You sell your soul to a bunch of Turks?
I made you, man.

262
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,080
You're in my house.

263
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,400
With my family.

264
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,600
You're not going to stand there
shouting at me.

265
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,480
Just once.

266
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,320
So I can restart my business.
After that, I'll find my own clients.

267
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,280
You owe me that much, man.

268
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,880
Just once, to help you.

269
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,400
A hundred thousand pills.
But nobody can know about it.

270
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,800
And I won't pay you a cent more
than I pay Serkan.

271
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Thanks.

272
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,400
Have you found a cook yet?

273
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,400
The very best.

274
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,200
I figured that money came from you.

275
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,800
Why didn't you just ring the doorbell?

276
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,720
You weren't home.

277
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,360
It's really sweet of you,
but I can't accept that money.

278
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,480
You probably need it more than I do.

279
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,800
Listen, everything I had,
we built together.

280
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,200
So half of that is yours.

281
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,960
Put it in the bank,
buy something nice, whatever.

282
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
It's yours.

283
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
That's really sweet of you. Thank you.

284
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,120
How are you?

285
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
I'm good.

286
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,960
I'm in my new house. I'm super happy.

287
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,760
And I have a girlfriend.

288
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,040
Can I show you something cool?

289
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,880
It's really cool.

290
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,280
- Did you see the van outside?
- Yes.

291
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,080
Yes? Look.

292
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,520
It's my mobile dog grooming salon.

293
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,600
It's going really well.
I have more than 23 customers.

294
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,240
This is the future of dog grooming.

295
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,960
None of the hassle and stress
of driving to the salon.

296
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,400
No, I go to them.

297
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,920
With the best shampoos, the best combs,
the best lotions...

298
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Here, look. Isn't that adorable?

299
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,120
I'm proud of you, Daan.

300
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
- How's your brother?
- He's doing well.

301
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,120
I've been back in touch with Lars
for a few months now, which is wonderful.

302
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,800
He's no longer at that rehab center,
but at De Boei.

303
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
A kind of group home.

304
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,600
Things are finally moving
in the right direction.

305
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Why do you ask?

306
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
What do you mean?

307
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,240
- Are you trying to restart your business?
- No, of course not.

308
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,360
Fer, do whatever you want,
but don't involve Lars in this.

309
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,880
- I mean it. He's finally doing better.
- Yeah, yeah.

310
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,920
Fer, promise me.

311
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,800
And if I were you, I'd be very careful.

312
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,680
I don't want you to end up in jail again.

313
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,720
Ricky.

314
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,200
- Fuck.
- Open up, loser.

315
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,480
Hey, Ferry Bouman.

316
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,440
- You notice everything.
- How are you?

317
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,440
- We need to talk.
- Sure. Come in, we'll talk.

318
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,760
It's been a long time.

319
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,760
Does your mum let you play
with that thing?

320
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,640
Business is going well.

321
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,200
- I need to be able to protect myself.
- Against who?

322
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,640
- Damn, look.
- Hey, I have a visitor.

323
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,120
Go and have a smoke. Off you go.

324
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Put the fryer on. I'm getting hungry.

325
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,120
Listen, I need 100,000 pills by next week.

326
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,280
- No can do, Ferry.
- Why not?

327
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,440
I have a big order.

328
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,360
- Come back next week and we'll see.
- We'll see?

329
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,760
You can cancel the other order.

330
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,520
Don't forget, without me you'd still be
messing around in your mom's basement.

331
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,200
Chill, Ferry. It's nothing personal, okay?
It's just business.

332
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,400
The customer is king. You taught me that.

333
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,240
These aren't guys
you want to keep waiting.

334
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm not someone you want to keep waiting.

335
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,880
- Ferry, chill.
- Who is this other customer?

336
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,720
Just other people. Turks.

337
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,880
Serkan Bulut?

338
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,880
No idea, I don't know that name.

339
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,760
Then think a little harder.

340
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,040
Get the fuck out. Get out.

341
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,600
Fuck off.

342
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,320
I'll tell you what's going to happen.
Starting tomorrow, you cook for me.

343
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,400
What you tell those Turks is up to you.
Can you get precursors?

344
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,480
- From where?
- The Festival Shop.

345
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,480
- The what?
- The Festival Shop in Bilzen.

346
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Festival Shop?

347
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,200
Yes, they sell carnival crap

348
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,800
but their warehouse is full of shit
to make MDMA and ecstasy.

349
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,000
Everyone goes there.

350
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,840
Can I get an advance?

351
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,360
- An advance?
- I'm broke, Ferry.

352
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,760
Goddamnit.

353
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,240
What can you make for 3,000?

354
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,360
If I'm careful, 20,000 pills max.

355
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,480
Goddamnit.

356
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,280
If I go any lower on the MDMA,
you might as well sell them M&Ms.

357
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,400
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,760
Here.
Next week. Twenty thousand pills. Got it?

359
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,840
Got it? Yes?

360
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,600
- If I do this, I want guarantees.
- I told you, I can't give you guarantees.

361
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,600
And I told you
that your word isn't enough.

362
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,000
What did you think?

363
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,640
That I'm going to risk my life
without any kind of insurance?

364
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,600
What I'm doing is just as illegal.

365
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,000
All I can do is tie my fate to yours.

366
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,880
I can create a document that states
in black and white what we're doing.

367
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,640
So you know I can't abandon you.

368
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Thanks.

369
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,480
I'm not doing this for you.

370
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,960
I'm doing it for my family.

371
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,680
Does Nathalie know about this?

372
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,440
Not yet. But...

373
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,880
I've already destroyed one marriage
by keeping everything a secret.

374
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,120
The less she knows, the better.

375
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
If you have to call me, use this cell.

376
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,400
And only call my private number,
never the station.

377
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,679
I've booked a rental car.
Out of my own pocket.

378
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Here.

379
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,120
Peter Bogaert?

380
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,520
We can use it again.
Qualistone has closed down

381
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,920
but we can say that you're now leasing
and renting out storage units.

382
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,480
Our UCA told us
Serkan has two lieutenants under him.

383
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:04,360
This is the most important one. Timur.

384
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,720
We only know that he's the uncle
of the guy who murdered our guy.

385
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,920
He's opening a new casino tonight.
We can try to get in touch with him there.

386
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Ferry Bouman, right?

387
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,600
That depends.

388
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,400
Get in, please.

389
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,200
What if I don't want to?

390
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Honey, do you mind
if I go have a drink with Kris?

391
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,680
I just got a message from him.
Trouble with his wife again.

392
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,160
Oh, dear. Sure, go ahead.

393
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,480
- Bye, sweety.
- Bye.

394
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,120
- You'll be back late, I suppose?
- I'll try to keep it short.

395
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,880
Go and enjoy yourself.

396
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,200
- Mr. Bouman. It's an honor.
- That remains to be seen.

397
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,320
I'm Timur.

398
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,160
I take it you're one of Serkan's?

399
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,400
That's correct.
He says hello, <i>salam aleikum.</i>

400
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,480
Come, have a seat, please.

401
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,040
It's already fucked up,
and we haven't even started yet.

402
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,280
Ferry Bouman is here with that Timur guy.

403
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,280
<i>- Can't you wait until he's left?</i>
- Patrick, don't you get it?

404
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,280
If Ferry knows this guy,
I'll run into him sooner or later.

405
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,560
And then what? I'll be fucked.
I'm not taking that risk. Sorry.

406
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,840
Mr. Bouman, we have a problem.

407
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,240
That's unfortunate.

408
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,640
You're trespassing on our territory.
And my boss doesn't like that very much.

409
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,080
It's a free country.
I can do whatever I want.

410
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,880
Yes, that's true.
But not if you try to poach our suppliers.

411
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,200
Ricky is a buddy of mine. He owes me one.

412
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,520
Besides, I trained him,
and that's why he can now deliver to you.

413
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,280
So I'd be thankful if I were you.

414
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,960
- When did Ferry get out?
<i>- I don't know. I can check.</i>

415
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,200
Check where he lives, as well.

416
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,200
Ricky said you need 100,000 pills.
Who are they for?

417
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,880
For me.
I've been feeling a little down lately.

418
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,000
Look, Mr. Bouman...

419
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,000
The rules have changed a bit, alright?

420
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,360
We can forgive that little slip-up
with Ricky.

421
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,760
But if you try to steal our customers,
we've got a big problem.

422
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,480
We won't give you a second warning.

423
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,120
Serkan's calling the shots now.

424
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,760
So if you want to relive your glory days

425
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,840
as a pill pusher from Brabant,
that's fine.

426
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,040
But you'll do it through us.
Is that clear?

427
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,840
Are you done?

428
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,200
That's for Ricky. To cover expenses. Okay?

429
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,400
- We'll be seeing each other.
- I hope so.

430
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Hi, Ferry.

431
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,040
You've got some goddamn nerve
coming here, you fucking pig.

432
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,480
- I just want to talk.
- I'll kill you.

433
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,360
Goddamnit.

434
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,320
I just want to talk to you. Come on.

435
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,240
Stop it, Ferry.

436
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,160
Now can we talk? Please.

437
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,400
- About what?
- I'm working on a case. Serkan Bulut.

438
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,040
You have to help us.

439
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,160
You're insane.

440
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,240
You know him, Ferry.
We know you've worked with him before.

441
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
Fuck off, man. I'm not a rat.

442
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,480
Timur, Serkan's lieutenant.
You've violated your terms.

443
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,760
If I forward this video clip,
you'll be sent back to jail.

444
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,760
And I suppose that if I help you,
that video will disappear? Fuck off.

445
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
You have no choice.

446
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,040
I could shoot you.

447
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,880
You think I'm the only one
who has that video?

448
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,920
Exactly. Why should I trust you?

449
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,280
We don't care what you do.
Serkan has a mole inside with the cops.

450
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,600
I have to find them.
And then we can roll up the entire gang.

451
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,480
So if I help you...

452
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,200
Serkan goes to jail.

453
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,280
- Gentlemen, thank you for coming.
- Thanks for nothing.

454
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,200
Thanks to your idiot nephew,
we're in deep shit.

455
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,080
He was supposed to follow the cop,
not kill him.

456
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,720
Forgive me, Serkan.

457
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,080
Forgive you for what, Timur?

458
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,000
My nephew got carried away,
didn't use his head.

459
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,800
On behalf of my nephew, I apologize.

460
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,280
He made a big mistake,
but he realizes that.

461
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,760
He's not going to talk.

462
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320
We know.

463
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,200
But that's not why I asked you to come.

464
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,800
I want to warn you.

465
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,680
The cops still haven't learned
their lesson.

466
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,480
They have a new plan.

467
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,400
Hey, sleeping beauty.

468
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,960
Had so much fun you couldn't find
your way to your bed anymore?

469
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,600
I didn't want to wake you, that's all.

470
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,120
- Here, have some coffee.
- Ah, thanks.

471
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,160
How are things going
between Kris and his wife?

472
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,200
Not well.

473
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,480
Honey, I have to tell you something.

474
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,480
I've found a solution
for our money problems.

475
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,320
But it's going to be dangerous.

476
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,200
- Ferry.
- Your favorite brother-in-law.

477
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,920
These days I have a sister-in-law.

478
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,760
Yes, I know.

479
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,320
How are you?

480
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,600
Yeah, well, I'm okay.

481
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,400
I've been clean for seven months.

482
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,040
I've beaten all my addictions,
except for coffee and cigarettes.

483
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,440
Nice stockpile.

484
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,880
Yeah, it's cheaper that way.

485
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,200
- Why are you here?
- To see how you're doing.

486
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,240
Does Daan know you're here?

487
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
No.

488
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,840
Planning to get your face renovated?

489
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,800
Once I have the money for it.

490
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,000
I'll never get a decent girl
with this rotten druggie mouth of mine.

491
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,520
I know how you can get the money.

492
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,480
Why don't you start cooking again?

493
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,480
- I don't know if that's a good idea.
- You have a talent. You should use it.

494
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,480
Thank you. But that didn't end well
last time, did it?

495
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,080
This time we're going to take care of you.

496
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,960
We'll make sure you stay away
from that shit.

497
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,600
Hey, let's make some money together.

498
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,280
You'll have new teeth, a new car,
and a new house in no time.

499
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,600
You'll be irresistible to girls.

500
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,880
A new house?

501
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,760
Of course. What were you going to do,
bring those girls here?

502
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,240
No, I know.
I just don't want to go to jail.

503
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:30,040
That's the beauty of it.
This time we're working with the cops.

504
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,480
This time we're going to pull one over
on them.

505
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,720
NEXT TIME

506
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,480
- Ferry knows what your cover is?
- He sure does.

507
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,760
Fer, this is Ingrid. Ingrid, Ferry.

508
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,360
What can we do for you, Ferry?

509
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,000
Put that phone down.

510
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,600
- I said no weapons.
- Shut up.

511
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,480
- Patrick, they've been tipped off.
- What?

512
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,040
If you want to play with the big boys,
you have to make sure they notice you.

513
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,040
It's a good plan, Patrick.

514
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,040
I'd like to meet him.

515
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,160
- I don't know if that...
- Make it happen.

516
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,280
