00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,320
I asked you to text Maggie

176
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
and tell her not to come today.

177
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,050
Did you do it?

178
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,080
Yes, I did.

179
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,440
Anything wrong?

180
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,950
She still came today.

181
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,920
Mo Yuanzhi must have called her.

182
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,030

mainly for biological programs.

In theory,

186
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,500
they don't have to
partner with companies like Moma.

187

An Lan,

188
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,150
I need you to find out

189
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,170
what exactly Volly wants from Moma.

190
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,910
Okay.

191
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,080

No, lives matter more.

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,000
Seriously?

338

Mo Yuanzhi filed a complaint against us
for abuse of power.

339

He said

340
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,650
that you treated the person
who should be protected

341
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,650
as a suspect without clear evidence.

342
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,780
You mean Mo Yuanzhi?

343
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,070
Ding Qi,

344
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,030
withdraw immediately.

345
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,770
T-The reception's poor here.

346
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,430
Chief,

347
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,650
I-I'll call you back in a bit.

348
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,190
Now, you have one minute

349
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,210
to halt the operation.

350
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,810
If not, you'll be dismissed.

351
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,200
Hello, Maggie.

352
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,030
Welcome to Moma.

353
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,230
How was your journey?

354
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,370
Welcome, Maggie.

355
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,300
Nice to meet you.

356
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,410
Nice to meet you.

357
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,960
Please.

358
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,110
How are you? Tired from the trip?

359
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,020
I'm all fine.

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,550
We see Volly's choice of investing in Moma

361
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,640
an honor for us.

362
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,770
This way.

363
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,160
I believe

364
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,640
this cooperation will be a real pleasure.

365
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,240
Who is that man?

366
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,790
Do I know him?

367
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,920
He just has

368
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,850
an average face.

369
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,750
Okay.

370
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,660
Ding Qi,

371
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,810
you must explain everything to me today.

372
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,200
Why does An Lan have the information

373
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,860
that even we the police don't?

374
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,480
Also,

375
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,070
what makes you conclude

376
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,980
that Mo Yuanzhi instructed Feng Qiming
to commit the murders?

377
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,040
Who is your informant?

378
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,500
Where did he get the intel?

379
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,270
Just wait till I finish the investigation.

380
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,160
When I figure everything out,

381
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,880
I'll tell you

382
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,750
the whole story in detail.

383
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,680
Are you negotiating terms with me?

384
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,720
You have to give me an explanation today,

385
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,380
or I won't let you go anywhere.

386
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,920
We've all retreated to the office now.

387
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,160
What if Mo Yuanzhi runs away?

388
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,960
If he kills again...

389
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,720
Any proof?

390
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,700
Greetings, Mr. Mo.

391
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,120
My visit here

392
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,250
is not only for

393
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,510
the due diligence on Moma's
tangible and intangible strengths,

394
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,790
but also for a review

395
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,810
on Moma's financial records
in the past 5 years.

396
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,720
Do you mind?

397
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,720
Of course not.

398
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,240
Mr. Mo,

399
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,030
you'll deliver a speech

400
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,720
at Ivy Bay University at 2 p.m..

401
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,000
Here is the script.

402
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,680
Don't you see

403
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,880
I'm with an important guest now?

404
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,120
Cancel the speech.

405
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:16,830
Got it.

406
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,060
About the wedding at the Zhao's tonight...

407
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,800
Cancel it too.

408
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,400
Mr. Mo,

409
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,960
I'd hate for my visit

410
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,430
to upset your plans for the day.

411
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,430
Your secretary can keep me company.

412
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,770
Nothing is more important than

413
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,030
the cooperation between Volly and Moma.

414
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,170
[Ivy Bay University]
[Cancellation Notice]

415
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,160
From the video we just saw,

416
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,890
Jiang Yuwen didn't die years ago.

417
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,690
He fled.

418
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,960
Mo Yuanzhi used his two daughters

419
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,440
to lure him out.

420
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,090
Feng Qiming's sister, Feng Wanqing,
didn't die either.

421
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,750
Mo Yuanzhi hid her somewhere.

422
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,500
Now, the fact is,

423
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,990
Mo Yuanzhi used Feng Qiming
to kill Han Song

424
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,050
and Tang Shaorong.

425
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,030
Next,

426
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,960
he will go after Tang Xin,

427
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,640
Maggie,

428
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,720
and Jiang Yuwen.

429
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,750
He won't spare anyone

430
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,640
who covets Moma.

431
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,880
He'll kill them all.

432
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,070
Okay.

433
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,990
Some

434
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:14,970
of your speculations

435
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,280
became true,

436
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,540
and some are theoretically possible.

437
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,310
Just now, you said

438
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,110
Jiang Yuwen

439
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,410
would show up,

440
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,920
and that Mo Yuanzhi would kill him.

441
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,140
But you only ventured a guess.

442
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,400
There's no evidence at all.

443
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,510
Besides, Mo Yuanzhi

444
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,240
doesn't have a solid motive.

445
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,170
Evidence, evidence, evidence...

446
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,240
I can't show you any evidence

447
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,480
if you don't let me
conduct an investigation, right?

448
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,510
You made me come back here.

449
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,570
How am I supposed to

450
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,320
investigate and find proof?

451
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,310
Look.

452
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,830
You've spoiled your direct report.

453
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,920
Hear me out, Chief.

454
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,130
Qi is right

455
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,960
about Ye Kun being connected

456
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,920
to the Squid case.

457
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,400
Why don't you give him the liberty

458
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,150
to investigate it?

459
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,180
Investigate?

460
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,240
Do you have any idea

461
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,880
how much pressure
the brass has put me under?

462
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,940
Investigate, huh?

463
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,270
Chief,

464
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,660
I've been working on this case
for a long time.

465
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,260
Do you have to bet against me?

466
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,480
Should anything go wrong,

467
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,720
will you take full responsibility?

468
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,680
I can quit my job.

469
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,160
Will you bear all the consequences?

470
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,170
Fine. I'll relieve you from your post now.

471
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:10,720
Chief...

472
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,350
Shut up!

473
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,920
Hand it over.

474
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,550
Your gun!

475
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,210
Chief...

476
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,980
Zip it!

477
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,680
Your badge!

478
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,040
Listen up,

479
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,080
keep close watch

480
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,590
on him 24/7.

481
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,840
Do not let him leave this place.

482
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,330
Chief...

483
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,220
And you!

484
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,160
If you cover for him again,

485
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
I'll fire you too.

486
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,830
Chief...

487
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,550
Chief...

488
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,640
You guys, listen!

489
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,510
If he ever takes so much as
a step out of this place,

490
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,110
I'll have you all suspended.

491
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,480
Please, Chief,

492
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,790
just give him a chance...

493
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,030
Give him a chance to investigate the case.

494
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,400
Chief.

495
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,000
Chief!

496
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,400
Watch Ding Qi!

497
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,820
What right do you have to lock me up?

498
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,020
How can you lock me up?

499
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,570
I'm calling the police!

500
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,430
My stomach hurts.

501
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,820
I need to use the bathroom.

502
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,750
Fang Lu,

503
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,950
doesn't your stomach hurt?

504
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,500
It hurts badly.

505
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,310
Why are you looking at me?

506
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,960
Chief told us

507
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,350
to never leave this room.

508
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,890
Read a book if you have spare time.

509
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,890
Stop watching...

510
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,670
me.

511
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,630
Where's that book,
"A Brief History of Time"?

512
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,090
I'm feeling a bit thirsty.

513
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,740
Where's "A Brief History of Time"?

514
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,200
Ding Qi.

515
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,500
Do you trust me?

516
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,830
Make sure you catch the Squid.

517
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,840
Once you find evidence,

518
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,780
let me know.

519
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,540
We'll back you up.

520
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,560
An Lan.

521
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,070
Qi,

522
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,750
[An Lan]

523
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,200
I have a finding.

524
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,920
Maggie's company Volly

525
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,030
has been in quest of

526
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,510
the early data of RAN reagent,

527
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,370
which can date back to 8 years ago.

528
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,960
Why don't they collect the latest data

529
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,920
i-instead of that from 8 years ago?

530
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,860
Given Maggie's professionalism,

531
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,980
such data

532
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,570
must be highly valuable.

533
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,150
It's the only reason
that she's taking a risk.

534
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,110
But finding the early RAN data

535
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,430
is extremely difficult.

536
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,540
Mo Yuanzhi

537
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,800
is very protective of
this classified information.

538
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,460
Even I don't have access to it.

539
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,550
This explains

540
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,220
why Maggie decided to visit Moma.

541
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,280
Mo Yuanzhi is taking advantage of it.

542
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,900
Then...

543
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,110
Then his next target is Maggie.

544
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,110
Qi.

545
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,300
I want to ask you a question.

546
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,280
You must answer it candidly.

547
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:05,870
What is it?

548
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,830
As a time loop participant,

549
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,910
have you experienced

550
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,770
the side effect yet?

551
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,140
Those who underwent early RAN tests

552
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,970
would experience a side effect

553
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,130
that manifests as

554
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,280
an attack on the weakest part
of the test subject's body.

555
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,230
It could be an organ

556
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,590
or the entire body

557
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,310
that gets attacked,

558
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,370
causing a rapid decline in health.

559
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,400
You,

560
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,560
Mo Yuanzhi,

561
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,790
Jiang Yuwen,

562
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,680
and RN356

563
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,740
would suffer from the same aftereffects.

564
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,480
I...

565
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,370
I died once

566
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,070
in a loop day.

567
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,640
My heart suddenly stopped beating.

568
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,000
A cardiac arrest?

569
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,110
I need to do more experiments

570
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,230
to verify some theories.

571
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,630
Nonetheless,

572
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,730
Qi, don't be afraid.

573
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,530
An Lan.

574
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,790
I've braced myself

575
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,610
for a sudden death.

576
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,980
Maybe it's my fate.

577
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,570
I refuse to accept it.

578
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,780
I won't let that happen.

579
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,470
If...

580
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,440
If my hypothesis is proven true,

581
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,880
I can prevent

582
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,300
the side effect from occurring.

583
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,200
I can also...

584
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,000
Anyway,

585
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,880
Qi,

586
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,760
you must trust me.

587
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,150
An Lan.

588
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,050
I trust you.

589
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,730
If the side effect is hurting me
more and more,

590
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,100
the case with Mo Yuanzhi must be the same.

591
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,230
This explains why

592
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,310
he insisted Maggie visit Moma today.

593
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,140
Hey, Qi.

594
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,360
Boss.

595
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,890
Apart from killing Jiang Yuwen,

596
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,480
Mo Yuanzhi has other plans.

597
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,480
What plans?

598
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,940
[Duan Zheng]

599
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,030
I'm not sure yet.

600
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,400
To figure out what he's up to,

601
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,360
I have to find Jiang Yuwen
and Maggie first.

602
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,790
Now, Han Yufei and Tang Xin

603
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,890
might also be in danger.

604
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,750
Make sure you keep them both safe.

and Han Yufei
to come to the police office.

610
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,440
Have you caught the Squid?

611
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,170
We will soon.

612
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,110
This concerns your personal safety.

613
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,070
I hope you two can come here right away.

614
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,670
Okay.

615
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,920

This way, Maggie.

617
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,520
This is the test site

of our biotech R&D center.

Come on in.

620
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,630
This is a controlled area

621
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,920
and a classified location

622
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,550
regarding biosecurity.

623
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,400
So, usually,

624
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,060
outsiders are not allowed in.

625
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,050

How about I arrange lunch for you first?

627
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,790
In the interest of time,

628
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,710
I'd like to look around
and gather more information.

629
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,190
Okay.

630
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,780
Let's not waste any time.

631
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,170
I'll go check on
Volly's investment agreement.

632
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,700
You give Maggie a tour.

633
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,660
She has access to every area

634

she'd like to see.

635
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,110
No problem.

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,800
See you later.

639

This way, please.

640
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,280
On our right-hand side
is the biology gene bank.

641
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,400
We store all the materials here,

642
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,460
at minus 80 degrees Celsius.

643
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,480
Yufei, I'm out now.

644
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,920
I'm in the underground parking lot.

645
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,640
I'll be waiting for you in my car.

646
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,710
And this is our biology gene bank.

647
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,280
We normally store

648
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,610
all the chemicals here.

649
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,150
So we call this stop "barred area."

No fire, of course.

651

for our chief scientist,

653
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,590
which is our boss.

654
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,840
Can I have a look?

655

I'm afraid I don't have authorization.

656

00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,350
Yufei,

691
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,930
I owe you an apology.

692
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,230
I always thought of you

693
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,400
as unambitious,

694
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,880
eccentric,

695
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,830
and weird.

696
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,080
But now I think I was wrong.

697
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,890
I'm sorry.

698
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,230
In fact,

699
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,630
you're quite ambitious.

700
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,940
Letting you take over Moma

701
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,600
will truly put my mind at ease.

702
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,500
Show me mercy,

703
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,330
as I'm about to go down.

704
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,740
Tell me if you have

705
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,670
dug up other dirt on me.

706
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,950
I sure have.

707
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,430
I know what happened in your lab.

708
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,430
All's on this cellphone.

709
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,560
Now, answer my question directly.

710
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,390
Did you or did you not

711
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,960
kill my father, Mo Yuanzhi?

712
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,840
I...

713
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,030
I'm telling you,

714
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,110
there are surveillance cameras here.

715
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,630
You can't get away!

716
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,240
Why do all of you have to defy me?

717
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:09,700
You,

718
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,230
your father,

719
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,840
Jiang Yuwen,

720
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,370
Tang Shaorong,

721
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,110
and Maggie...

722
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,580
You guys are a pain in the neck!

723
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,930
A pain in the neck!

724
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,960
I hate you all.

725
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,790
I hate all of you!
