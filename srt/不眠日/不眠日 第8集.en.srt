In Guatemala, South America,
there's a bird

46
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,720
called the Hoopoe.

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,030
It chirps once every 30 minutes.

48
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,540
The interval is accurate to the second.

49
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,310
That's why people call it the bird clock.

50

In the dense forests of Africa,

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,040
there's a time-telling insect.

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,430
It changes color once every hour.

53

The South African large-leaf tree

57

Trees record time
with rings in their roots.

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,430
These are called annual rings.

59
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,680
Turtle shells record the cycle of seasons.

60

Paleontologists have discovered that

64
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,030
the calcium carbonate
secreted daily by coral polyps

65
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,360
forms a tiny daily ring.

66
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,630
These daily rings accumulate into

67
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,030
a growth belt distinctly different
from other years.

68
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,240
Based on the number of daily rings

69
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,590
in these growth belts,

70
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,590
we can determine

71
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,120
how many days were in a year.

72
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,470
And the number of daily rings in a coral

73
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,240
is exactly

74
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,190
365.

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,840
Why?

175
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,960
Why does Fu Jun have to die?

176
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,050
He was just an ordinary person.

177
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,750
He only showed angry behavior

178
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,000
in the first loop.

179
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,390
Why is it that the more I try to help him,

180
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,910
the more his fate

181
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,840
moves toward extremes in the loop?

182
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,530
Looking for me?

183
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,150
What does he mean by the same kind?

184
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,030
It's really exhausting.

185
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,960
There were smoke bombs

186
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,000
and hostage situations today.

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,400
I haven't even eaten yet.

188
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,910
You were inside.

189
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,650
You knew what they were planning.

190
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,580
How did you know?

191
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,400
I don't know.

192
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,790
I was just asking.

193
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,670
You don't know?

194
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,270
I don't know.

195
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,930
Then why wait until midnight?

196
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,800
Midnight?

197
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,080
Midnight is still far away.

198
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,880
What's wrong?

199
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
Then what does the loop mean?

200
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,130
What does the loop mean?

201
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,510
I told you before I had a special power,

202
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,790
and you said I was talking nonsense.

203
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,600
So this time I said it,

204
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,270
and he believed it.

205
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,670
Didn't this trick reveal

206
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,070
that someone's behind all this?

207
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,300
Don't I know if someone's behind this?

208
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,890
Well,

209
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,600
if I knew that
you knew someone was behind this,

210
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
I wouldn't have asked like that.

211
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,840
Nonsense.

212
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,790
It's hard to explain this right now.

213
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,440
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

214
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Tomorrow?

215
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,910
I feel like I've heard that

216
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,400
many times from you before.

217
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,110
Impossible.

218
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,960
I've definitely never said that.

219
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,630
Are you sure?

220
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,360
Of course.

221
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,970
Think about it carefully.

222
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,510
I haven't even eaten,

223
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,240
and I still have interrogations to do.

224
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,500
What kind of questions is he even asking?

225
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,590
He's never said that?

226
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,750
Boss.

227
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,150
Duan Zheng just told me

228
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,910
not to give you

229
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,600
any more information about Ye Kun.

230
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,910
What's going on?

231
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,170
I don't know either.

232
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,060
Just keep investigating for now.

233
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,910
How did it go?

234
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,510
I finished the questioning.

235
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,720
That teacher's eyes

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,860
don't look like those of a killer.

237
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,270
His movements

238
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,870
are abnormal.

239
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,130
It's probably a sign of epilepsy.

240
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,050
He doesn't want to kill anyone.

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,670
But as police officers,

242
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,930
we have to take action.

243
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,570
We can't gamble with the hostages' lives.

244
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,510
I have a question for you.

245
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,160
It's not an interrogation.

246
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,930
You also graduated from
Ivy Bay's biology department.

247
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,720
Do you know

248
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,720
about the relationship
between Jiang Yuwen and Mo Yuanzhi?

249
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,050
I've heard some rumors.

250
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,320
Before Jiang Yuwen disappeared,

251
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,000
he had established himself

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,720
in the field of genetic biology.

253
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,390
I've read many of his papers.

254
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,840
Their viewpoints and methods

255
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,290
had some differences.

256
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,760
I've also heard that

257
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,150
in academic circles,

258
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,030
the explanation for his disappearance

259
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,080
was suicide.

260
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,690
They just couldn't find his body.

261
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,530
And that he set fire to the lab himself

262
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,510
with the purpose

263
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,640
of destroying his experimental data.

264
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Well...

265
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,480
I have another question.

266
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,670
That is,

267
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,800
why did you attend
the Zhao's wedding?

268
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,690
The company required
all executives to attend.

269
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,400
As the chief assistant,

270
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,660
I'm considered half an executive.

271
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,310
But with everything that happened today,

272
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,310
I suppose

273
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,490
I won't need to go anymore.

274
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,829
Finally,

275
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,160
take another careful look at this person.

276
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,020
Do you know him?

277
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,080
The person you arrested today?

278
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,330
I don't know him.

279
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,200
But I feel like I've seen him
somewhere before.

280
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,160
Where?

281
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,960
Then again, maybe I haven't.

282
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,350
It's okay.

283
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,750
You haven't answered the question

284
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,880
I asked you earlier.

285
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,680
Which question?

286
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,440
This morning,

287
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,400
Highway 1–

288
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,440
how did you know in advance

289
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,240
that there would be an accident?

290
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,200
I didn't know.

291
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,240
You didn't know?

292
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,040
I didn't know.

293
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,640
If you didn't know, why were you so urgent

294
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,270
about making me change routes?

295
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,310
Have the driver change the route

296
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,640
and exit the highway early
at the M16 Exit.

297
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,790
Driver, exit the highway at
the next junction.

298
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,350
But taking this route
will add a lot of extra distance.

299
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,610
Reroute immediately!

300
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,310
Because I...

301
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,270
I checked

302
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,200
the news this morning,

303
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,350
and looked at the traffic conditions,

304
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,240
so...

305
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,550
Well, I have a traffic police colleague

306
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,440
who told me

307
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,680
there was an accident ahead.

308
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,960
So I deduced,

309
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
if you took that route, you might

310
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,070
be in danger.

311
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,790
This is just

312
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,550
a reflection of my professional skills.

313
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,510
You're so busy,

314
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,910
why would you be paying attention
to the traffic conditions?

315
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,160
B-Because...

316
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,920
you were on the road.

317
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,150
How did you know I was on the road?

318
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,840
Sorry, could you repeat that?

319
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,720
Okay.

320
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,270
Alright, I'll be right there.

321
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,070
Just a moment.

322
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,830
Okay.

323
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,830
All right.

324
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,350
Okay.

325
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,070
Got it.

326
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,110
Officer Ding,

327
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,550
can I leave now?

328
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,160
What You Yuxiang said isn't true.

329
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,490
You can investigate it.

330
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
We'll definitely investigate
what needs to be investigated,

331
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,800
but I'd still like to hear

332
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,940
your side of the story.

333
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,440
You Yuxiang,

334
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,920
to reopen Jiang Yuwen's case,

335
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,490
did something like this.

336
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,120
Why...

337
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,350
Why is he convinced

338
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,440
that you're the one
who killed Jiang Yuwen?

339
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,480
Why he thinks so

340
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,590
is something you should ask him,

341
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,110
not me.

342
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,910
Because I'd like to know why too.

343
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,880
Besides,

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,350
Professor You Yuxiang's mental state
has never been stable.

345
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,240
This is something everyone

346
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
at Ivy Bay University knows.

347
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,550
Are you sure

348
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,200
you shouldn't first investigate
his mental wellness

349
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,930
before deciding
whether to believe what he says?

350
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,960
We'll definitely investigate
what needs to be investigated.

351
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,640
Mr. Mo,

352
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,350
it's still necessary

353
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,350
for you to tell us

354
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,750
about your relationship with Jiang Yuwen.

355
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,550
Please.

356
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,720
Jiang Yuwen

357
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,550
was my PhD supervisor.

358
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,640
He was also

359
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,720
once my idol.

360
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,940
In my final year of doctoral studies,

361
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,920
he was basically treating me

362
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,790
as a partner,

363
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,320
not just a student anymore.

364
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,310
I was very grateful for that.

365
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,750
But I still

366
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,680
couldn't understand

367
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,280
his eccentric personality.

368
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,040
Thank you, Professor Jiang.

369
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,790
In everyone's eyes,

370
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,520
Jiang Yuwen is a strange man.

371
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,920
So,

372
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,960
when I was choosing my PhD supervisor,

373
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
everyone around me

374
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,720
was against me choosing him.

375
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,430
But I didn't care.

376
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,550
In the field of science,

377
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,270
every successful person
is more or less a little eccentric.

378
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,160
I admired him.

379
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,290
I wanted to learn from him.

380
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,610
I wanted to become as excellent as he was.

381
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,120
I just never expected

382
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,770
our relationship would turn out that way.

383
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Professor Jiang,

384
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,410
I've contacted an academic journal.

385
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,310
They said it has passed expert review.

386
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,710
Now it's in the editor-in-chief's
final review stage.

387
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,640
They think

388
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,000
the research findings are cutting-edge

389
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,920
and valuable.

390
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,000
I hope

391
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,390
you can publish it with me.

392

[Author: Mo Yuanzhi]

00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,550
You can leave.

394
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,350
I got it.

395
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,470
Professor Jiang.

396
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Professor Jiang.

397
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,810
Professor Jiang, why?

398
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,980
You're very smart,

399
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,520
but that has become your downfall.

400
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,680
You know,

401
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,480
there are no shortcuts in science.

402
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,350
You're too focused
on your so-called shortcuts.

403
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,440
Sooner or later,

404
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,490
you'll trip on that shortcut.

405
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,200
At that moment,

406
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,560
I was absolutely certain

407
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,960
my idol was jealous of me.

408
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:41,920
Qi.

409
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,270
If one day

410
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,410
someone you look up to
becomes jealous of you,

411
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,680
it can only mean

412
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,400
you've truly succeeded.

413
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,450
Later,
I applied to have my supervisor changed,

414
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,530
but the incident happened
before I got a response.

415
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,440
Even the police couldn't find

416
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,590
Jiang Yuwen's body.

417
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,080
He just vanished into thin air.

418
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,720
I won't say more about the rest.

419
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,400
You can investigate it yourselves.

420
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,110
Anyway,

421
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,920
it seems that whatever I say,

422
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,520
you don't really believe me.

423
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,510
Look.

424
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,350
At Ivy Bay University,

425
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,200
I only attended
a few of Professor You Yuxiang's classes.

426
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,640
We weren't even close.

427
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,830
We had no conflicts,

428
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,290
nor any mutual interests.

429
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,070
Besides,

430
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,440
on the day of Jiang Yuwen's incident,

431
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,880
whether it's the timeline,
witness testimony

432
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,160
or the surveillance footage,

433
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,400
everything is out there.

434
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,160
I never entered that laboratory.

435
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,000
This Professor You Yuxiang

436
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,720
is still making these baseless accusations.

437
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,440
Why?

438
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,510
What is he trying to do?

439
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,070
Also,

440
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,110
You Yuxiang claimed

441
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,000
I killed Jiang Yuwen,

442
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,640
right?

443
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,480
Where is Jiang Yuwen's body?

444
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,810
We need to prove
Jiang Yuwen is dead first.

446
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,150
I've wasted too much time today.

447
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,070
Can I leave now?

448
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,100
I'll have someone escort you.

449
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,640
Later,
the police and firefighters arrived.

452
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,550
The students suffered the most.

453
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,680
All their experimental data was lost.

454
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,070
Many studies had to start over.

455
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,070
Were those students

456
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,510
including Mo Yuanzhi?

457
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,550
Of course.

458
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,110
But he was really clever.

459
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,440
He just changed his research topic

460
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,840
and graduated smoothly.

461
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,490
It was quite successful too.

462
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,850
It later became the foundation
of Moma Biotechnology.

463
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,920
So Jiang Yuwen

464
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,520
just disappeared like that?

465
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,720
Later there were rumors that he

466
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,920
jumped into a river and killed himself.

467
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,720
We only found out later

468
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,200
that he had depression.

469
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,550

470
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,110
What was Professor You doing today?

471
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,920
He's not usually like this.

472
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,830
How could he kill in public–

473
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,560

We just made a breakthrough.

518
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,960
There was a girl at the hall

519
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,000
who got injured when leaving.

520
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,200
She claimed to be a student from Ivy Bay,

521
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,130
but we later found out she wasn't.

522
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,350
Are you okay?

523
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,770
I'm fine.

524
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,590
What's in the bag?

525
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,240
Open the bag.

526
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,200
Open it!

527
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,640
We found hidden camera equipment
in her bag.

528
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,500
This is what she secretly filmed.

529
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,510
And this is her phone.

[A murder happened at Ivy Bay University
this afternoon. Are you okay?]

531
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:11,200
[Huang Yuan]

532
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,040
Hello, Boss.

533
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,120
Peishan,

534
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,240
how's your cooperation with them?

535
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,680
It's going well.

536
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,010
Has Ding Qi shown any unusual behavior?

537
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,000
No.

538
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,680
I haven't noticed

539
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,110
anything unusual

540
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,310
about Ding Qi.

541
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,200
How is he doing?

542
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,340
He's working really hard.

543
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,210
Keep a close eye on him.

544
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,240
If he acts strange,

545
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,440
tell me immediately.

546
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,190
Okay.

547
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,219
Why didn't you respond to my messages?

548
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,740
[Criminal Investigation Bureau]

549
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,760
Officer Ding.

550
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,960
What exactly do you suspect me of?

551
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,020
I suspect you want to kill Mo Yuanzhi.

552
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,070
I just hired someone to take a few photos.

553
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,640
How does that make me a murderer?

554
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,770
What about Han Song and Tang Shaorong?

555
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,510
What do they have to do with me?

556
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,550
Your private investigator said

557
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,630
you used the same methods

558
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,480
to monitor both of them.

559
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,070
Why?

560
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,370
They both died in accidents.

561
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,070
Your police department closed the cases.

562
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,800
What I'm asking is

563
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,480
why were you monitoring them?

564
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,110
I admit,

565
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,150
I did monitor them.

566
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,760
In recent years,

567
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,230
they've been working with Mo Yuanzhi

568
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,090
to eat away at my family's shares.

569
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,000
These three people

570
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,070
wear the mask of a scientist,

571
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,270
yet they're all ruthless businessmen.

572
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,920
Of course, what exactly they did

573
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,880
is not my concern,

574
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,280
but if they harm
the Yu family's interests,

575
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,700
that's unacceptable.

576
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,030
So what did you find out?

577
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,150
I discovered
the three of them don't get along.

578
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,080
Don't get along?

579
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,570
But that's actually good.

580
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,880
To keep a company

581
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,630
fundamentally fair,

582
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,290
you need checks and balances.

583
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,810
But I never expected that within a month,

584
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,610
both of them would be dead.

585
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,960
So what do you think

586
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,630
about their deaths?

587
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,070
With the balance gone,

588
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,730
don't you suspect Mo Yuanzhi?

589
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,710
Of course I do.

590
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,280
On the mornings when

591
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,250
Han Song and Tang Shaorong died,

592
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,030
Mo Yuanzhi

593
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,280
did strange things.

594
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,430
Today morning,

595
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,570
he did the same thing again.

596
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,590
So I decided to follow him.

597
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,590
But I never expected

598
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,350
that he went to Moma.

599
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,360
I don't know what he was doing

600
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,590
when he snuck out all those nights.

601
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,030
Was he out on a date with An Lan?

602
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,440
I'm not sure.

603
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,190
So, Officer Ding,

604
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,070
if you find anything,

605
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,740
please let me know.

606
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,030
You suspect I want to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

607
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:56,920
Yes.

608
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,070
I want to kill him.

609
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,510
Have you ever heard this saying?

610
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,710
Every married couple in this world

611
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,340
has countless moments

612
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,280
when they want to kill each other.
