that the lives of people
like Wanqing and me

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,750
Right?

176
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,150
Yes.

177
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,750
How are they doing?

178
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,430
They were indeed kidnapped by Mo Yuanzhi,

179
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,230
but we've got them back safe now.

180
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,230
They're fine.

181
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,390
And Maggie is upstairs right now.

182
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,670
If you detonate it,
everything will be over.

183
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,800
I don't believe you.

184
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,350
You're deceiving me.

185
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,430
Calm down.

186
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,840
Hold on a second.

187
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,590
Tang Xin,

188
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,450
say something to your father.

189
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,750
Say something to him.

190
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,080
Dad.

191
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,550
Xin.

192
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,800
What did you call me?

193
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,950
Dad.

194
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,960
I heard you.

195
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,030
I don't want you to die.

196
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,320
This police officer is trustworthy.

197
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,480
Maggie is here too.

198
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,760
We're both safe and sound.

199
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,599
Okay.

200
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,010
I want you to stay alive, Dad.

201
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,609
I'll do as you say, dear.

202
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,720
I'll do whatever you say.

203
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,190
Thank you.

204
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't move.

205
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,350
Stay still.

206
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,450
I leave it to you.

207
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,990
Leave them behind. Let's go!

208
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,120
Have you found Mo Yuanzhi?

209
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,990
It's too crowded

210
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,920
to identify him.

211
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,990
Hurry up! Get down!

212
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,080
Come down!

213
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,320
Get down!

214
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,120
Come down now!

215
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,860
What are you doing?

216
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,300
Stop shouting, Mr. Mo.

217
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,840
This time, you can neither run away

218
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,080
nor escape by air.

219
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,360
You're such a clingy pain in the neck!

220
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,960
It's so hard to get rid of you!

221
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,690
You forced me to do this.

222
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,670
Qiming!

223
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,120
Kill An Lan and her mother!

224
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,580
Kill An Lan and her mother!

225
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,430
Hello?

226
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,230
Hello?

227
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,040
Go ahead.

228
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,760
Go ahead.

229
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,390
Yes.

230
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,020
I really can't get away this time.

231
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,080
Qi.

232
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
The first day I met you,

233
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,910
I had a bad feeling.

234
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,620
I felt that one day,

235
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,380
you might really get me.

236
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,710
It's fine.

237
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,150
I'm tired.

238
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Really worn out.

239
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,990
How did you

240
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,390
end up having our condition?

241
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,470
I have no idea.

242
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,200
You should be the one to tell me.

243
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,050
Well, like me...

244
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,950
I was trying to find

245
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,540
a cure for Wanqing.

246
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,720
I experimented on myself with the drug.

247
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,210
After I gave myself that injection,

248
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,930
I lost consciousness completely.

249
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,590
I must have died temporarily.

250
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,760
But the next day,

251
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,820
I came back to life.

252
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,080
At that moment,

253
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,280
it struck me that Wanqing was suffering

254
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,240
five times the torment

255
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,130
during the time she was very sick.

256
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,590
And Jiang Yuwen was the one
who put her through all this.

257
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,240
Mo Yuanzhi.

258
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,480
No matter what you've been through,

259
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,680
it doesn't justify you killing others.

260
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,560
Yes.

261
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,610
Haven't you been dying to know

262
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,210
what my side effect is?

263
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,090
I've gone blind several times already.

264
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,480
Next time,

265
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,800
I might lose my sight completely.

266
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,760
So tell me.

267
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,210
What's the point of having this power?

268
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm in pain every single day.

269
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,580
What about you, Qi?

270
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,780
Do you feel pain?

271
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,650
I do, indeed.

272
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,450
I haven't slept for 5 days, Mr. Mo.

273
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,960
Let's get this over with.

274
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,940
Will you do it yourself,

275
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,370
or should I help you?

276
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,480
Come on.

277
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,690
I haven't slept well either.

278
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,150
We'll both
get a good night's sleep tonight.

279
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,760
I knew it.

280
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,760
All those build-ups

281
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,240
are just for this moment, right?

282
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,800
Yeah,

283
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,520
I couldn't beat you fair and square,

284
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,720
so I had to play dirty.

285
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,970
Yet I still failed.

286
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
You're indeed my nemesis.

287
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,170
Are you a jinx?

288
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,580
Yeah, a jinx for you.

289
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
You talk too much.

290
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,970
Go easy on me.

291
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,210
Not bad, Qi.

292
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,210
You've worked out quite a lot
in the loop days.

293
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,650
Were it not for your research,

294
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,040
I wouldn't have come this far.

295
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
And if I hadn't come this far,

296
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,900
no one would have discovered you.

297
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,040
See? That's fate.

298
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,710
I've accepted my fate.

299
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,050
I notice you're also way too talkative.

300
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,730
The side effect.

301
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,520
This is your side effect.

302
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,560
Qi,

303
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,580
you stand no chance against me.

304
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,650
