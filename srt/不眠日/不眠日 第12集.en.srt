00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,770
Can I ask you a question?

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,390
Are you unable to draw

3
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,000
without shaking that hand?

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm strengthening my arm.

5

Wanqing.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,360
I'm being serious.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,710
I really want to know why.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,270
My mom checks my step count
on her phone every day.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,320
I can't tell her about my illness.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,570
If she found out,

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,720
she would just cry secretly every day.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,000
So,

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,350
I'll tell her later,

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,590
so she won't have to cry as much.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,890
Do you know about body donation?

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,670
Can you ask about it for me?

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,710
What for?

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,390
If I can donate my body,

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,620
then I can stay in this world forever.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,410
Actually, I'm really afraid of dying.

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,220
If I die,

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,730
my mom,

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,400
my brother, and Lan

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,880
will be in so much pain.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,039
I've been wondering if there's a way

26
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,760
to erase memories

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,070
so they won't remember me anymore.

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,520
Then they wouldn't be sad for me.

These are...

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,550
all loop days.

45
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,240
So,

46
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,110
RN356 could predict danger in advance

47
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,800
because it retained memories

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,710
during loop days,

49
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,760
which is equivalent to

50
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,820
having rehearsed in advance, right?

51
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,200
It was like me.

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,079
Before the final loop comes,

53
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,210
we get four rehearsal opportunities.

54
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,230
So, you often

55
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,930
can guess what I'm thinking

56
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,920
and what I want.

57
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,070
How long have you been like this?

58
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,000
Seven years.

59
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,000
RN356, Wanqing, and you...

60
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,200
Have you been exposed to RAN drugs?

61
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,470
Do you remember

62
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,880
when you first became aware

63
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,909
of the loop?

64
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,470
December 24, 2017.

65
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,790
That day,

66
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,790
I fell into the lake five times in a row,

67
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,190
so I remember it clearly.

68
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,040
Everything changed after that.

69
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,220
Where is that lake?

70
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,190
Near Ivy Bay University.

71
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,760
So it seems

72
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,680
you might also be infected with RAN drugs.

73
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,870
How many times will the loop day repeat?

74
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,810
Each loop day has five loops.

75
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Whatever happens

76
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,610
on the fifth loop is

77
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,030
final and irreversible.

78
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,660
Is today a loop day?

79
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,160
Which loop is it today?

80
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,400
The fourth loop.

81
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,450
Will I forget what happens today?

82
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,830
But early this morning,

83
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,690
a lab mouse with nerve damage
regained its mobility

84
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,000
after being injected with
the fifth generation

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,640
of RAN-Y reagent.

86
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,850
Will this reaction

87
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,560
happen again?

88
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,460
If nothing goes wrong,

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,470
it will.

90
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,760
Was your experiment a success?

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
I don't know,

92
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,300
and I don't dare to confirm it.

93
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,520
But I hope so.

94
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,590
How did RN356 die?

95
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,960
From sudden organ aging—

96
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,410
its skin, nervous system,

97
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,850
heart, and eyes.

98
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,500
When it was ten months old,

99
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,640
it went through

100
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,070
the entire aging process
in just one month.

101
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,510
Have you experienced
any adverse reactions?

102
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:00,880
No.

An Lan.

104
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,150
In the first loop,

105
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,830
there was an explosion
at the Zhaos' wedding.

106
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,830
Many people died,

107
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,610
including Mo Yuanzhi.

108
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,380
So, before midnight,

109
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,200
I must know

110
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,060
the core secrets of Moma Biotech.

111
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,470
What does this have to do

112
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,530
with Moma Biotech?

113
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,340
In my previous investigation,

114
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
I discovered a coincidence.

115
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,120
Both Han Yufei and Tang Xin brought up

116
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,830
that their fathers both mentioned

117
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,030
Mo Yuanzhi's laboratory

118
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,150
before they died.

119
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,520
Officer Ding.

120
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,090
The day before my father died, he said...

121
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,900
that Mo Yuanzhi's laboratory

122
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,290
contains too many secrets.

123
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,640
My father told me

124
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,680
not to tell anyone about Mo Yuanzhi's

125
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,810
secret laboratory.

126
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,340
I don't know what was with him.

127
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
I'd never seen my father so nervous.

128
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,880
Mo Yuanzhi does have a sealed laboratory.

129
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,610
I've seen the building blueprint.

130
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,410
It shouldn't be a very large lab.

131
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,590
Based on my experience,

132
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,350
it's not possible

133
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,710
to conduct large-scale experiments there.

134
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,560
So,

135
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,490
you've noticed it too?

136
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,120
He spends a lot of time

137
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,760
in his private lab.

138
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,230
I also want to know

139
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,640
what he's doing in there.

140
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,760
But how can we

141
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,590
get into his lab?

142
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,480
Only he has the access code.

143
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,300
I have the code.

144
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,470
How did you get it?

145
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,870
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,350
I used you.

147
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,020
In the previous loops, I found out

148
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,630
that at noon today,

149
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,200
Han Yufei would share the code
with Yu Shiya

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,860
through equity transaction.

151
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,190
But in the previous loops,

152
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,690
Yu Shiya never succeeded.

153
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,750
This time,

154
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,990
by changing your route,

155
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,640
I gave her a hand.

156
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,830
Mr. Mo!

157
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,410
Why are you still here so late?

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,090
I sent you the text
to check the surveillance footage

159
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,260
of your mother.

160
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,510
Our deal can end now.

161
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,960
But

162
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,560
you need to tell me the lab code.

163
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,560
Tonight,

164
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,870
Mo Yuanzhi will attend
the Zhaos' wedding.

165
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,200
This is our best chance.

166
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
Some things

167
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,930
should be left to the police.

168
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,920
I can't even begin to imagine

169
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,580
how disastrous it'd be

170
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,160
if such a power

171
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,990
falls into evil hands.

172
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,710
With this power,

173
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,100
you could kill someone
without leaving a trace.

174
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200

Was the day my mother had the accident

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,920
a loop day?

215
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,110
I wish it was.

238
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,359
doing research in this field.

239

What research?

240
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,579
Primary spinal cord cancers;

241
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,220
cell proliferation
caused by genetic mutations.

242
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,310
This disease is

243
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,359
related to Wanqing.

244
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,510
What's wrong?

245
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,510
I mentioned before

246
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,470
that I carefully deduced

247
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,470
the area of Mo Yuanzhi's lab.

248
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,990
Its actual space should be
much larger than what we see here.

249
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,390
I've seen the blueprint.

250
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,710
It's a rectangle,

251
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,510
but what we're seeing now is a square.

252
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,160
So,

253
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,070
there must be another area.

254
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,690
[Note: Door B of the lab is open.]

256
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,700
A nitrogen tank.

257
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,040
In experiments,

258
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,310
we often use it to

259
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,200
freeze specimens or organs.

260
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,070
But a nitrogen tank of this shape

261
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,270
and this volume

262
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,440
could easily be used to preserve

Then...

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,010
who could be inside?

267
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,310

00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,750
and take the escalator up.

351
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,080
I'll meet you upstairs.

352
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,070
Okay.

353
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,050
An Lan.

354
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,160
An Lan.

355
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Have you left yet?

356
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,470
Not yet.

357
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,420
I still have something important to do.

358
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
I'll be done soon.

359
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,400
At 12:15,

360
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Maggie will text you to set up

361
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,130
a meeting with you and Mo Yuanzhi

362
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,610
about investing in Moma.

363
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,130
Tell her to meet

364
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,990
tomorrow instead,

365
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,340
and that you'll explain why later.

366
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:27,930
Okay.

367
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,990
[An Lan, I'm at Xinggang. I can
discuss cooperation in Hua'ao today.]

368
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,460
Have you left yet?

369
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,260
Just a moment.

370
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,110
[Let's meet tomorrow instead.]

371
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,220
[I'll explain why later.]

372
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,690
I think someone's coming up.

373
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:02,980
Hurry.

374
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,400
Take the fire exit.

Your heart is racing.

392
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,700
Are you trying to work yourself to death?

393
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,280
No, I'm really not tired.

394
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,240
I...

395
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,880
I'm just running out of time.

396
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,440
Look,

397
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,240
just leave me alone.

398
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,840
Let me continue my research.

399
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,750
I've changed my mind.

400
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,500
I want to try that drug.

401
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:58,440
No.

402
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,920
Absolutely not.

403
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,810
We know how dangerous that drug is.

404
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,540
No way.

405
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,650
Don't joke about this with me.

406
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,720
You and I both know

407
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,610
what the outcome of my illness will be.

408
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,190
It's just trying a drug.

409
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,400
It's not that scary.

410
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,990
Still no.

411
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,550
No way.

412
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,320
Absolutely not.

413
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,910
How much worse could it get for me?

414
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,580
No way!

415
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,470
No, Wanqing,

416
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,620
you mustn't do that!

417
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,290
Anyone else can try it,

418
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,650
but not you.

419
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,470
You cannot take any risks.

420
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:27,920
Just...

421
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,070
Just give me some time.

422
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,190
Let me do more research,

423
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:30,760
okay?

424
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,310
Let me keep working on this.

425
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:40,850
Yuanzhi.

426
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,190
All these years,

427
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,070
the excruciating pain from my illness

428
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,840
has never daunted me.

429
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,330
But I really

430
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,250
can't bear seeing you

431
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,550
in such distress.

432
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,670
Look at yourself.

433
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,320
To research this drug,

434
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,650
how many days have you gone without sleep?

435
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,650
If you keep going like this,

436
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,950
you'll really collapse.

437
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,940
Don't worry about me.

438
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,740
You don't have to worry about me.

439
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,480
This drug is too risky.

440
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,000
Yuanzhi.

441
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,950
If you...

442
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,970
if anything happens to you,

443
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,320
it'll kill me,

444
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,030
you know?

445
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,070
I can't take it.

446
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,110
Please don't, okay?

447
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,550
It's fine.

448
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,640
We should be bold and give it a try.

449
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,740
Even if it fails,

450
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,030
I... I can still leave you

451
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,030
some valuable clinical data.

452
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,550
I don't want those data.

453
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,010
They're useless. Tell me,

454
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,730
are they useful?

455
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,440
Are they?

456
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,530
What good are they?

457
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,460
These darn data...

458
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,550
If you're gone,

459
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,360
what would I need the data for?

460
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,410
Yuanzhi.

461
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,790
This is the last thing I can do for you.

462
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,540
Don't cry.

463
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,850
Don't cry, okay?

464
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,520
It'll be fine.
