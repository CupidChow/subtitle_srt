00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,390
I've learned how to make

3
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,650
your favorite stir-fried crab noodles.

4
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,240
I tried making them the other day.

5
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,950
They were delicious.

An Lan.

12
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,030
We can't rush this.

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,470
I know your current research

14
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,870
is somewhat related to
your mother's condition.

15
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,790
I've read many

16
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,760
of your papers.

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,150
But from my clinical experience,

18
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,200
miracles

19
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,920
don't happen that easily.

20
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,510
The results of genetic research

21
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,370
might take generations to achieve.

22
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,980
You need to face reality.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,000
I understand.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,350
The 24-hour EEG monitoring

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,850
is really unnecessary in my opinion.

26
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,160
Let's change it to once every two weeks.

27
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,600
That would be easier on your mother
as well.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,590
I hope you can accept the fact that

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,470
she has long since

30
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,450
lost all higher brain function.

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,000
Give me more time.

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,170
This is what my mother would want too.

33
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,900
I know that.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,860

why not cancel the speech?

There are some things that,

as long as

42
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm still alive,

43
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,280
must go on.

44
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,560
An executive of a company

45
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,520
that's seeking to go public was killed,

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,030
almost all the potential investors

47
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,310
pulled out overnight,

I can still stand on the stage,

if I can still crack a joke,

52
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,960
then it shows that Moma hasn't fallen yet.

53
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,580
I have to carry on as usual.

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,360
that all this chaos

60
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,480
might be a trap set by Squid to kill you,

61

in which case by insisting on
giving the speech,

62
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,870
it might end up involving
many innocent lives?

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,880
Then what should I do?

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,600
Should I just not come to the company,

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,510
hide at home,

66
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,430
and just let Moma Group collapse?

67
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,500
Is that what you suggest?

68
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,480
What about all those Moma employees?

69
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,830
Aren't they innocent too?

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,390
sometimes I died in explosions.

129

136
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,870
Why do you say that?

137
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,190
Don't you think he keeps giving

138
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,830
bizarre orders?

139
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,560
Like what?

140
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,830
Like early this morning,

141
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,360
he suddenly called an emergency meeting.

142
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,870
During my recent investigation,

143
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,810
I found someone named Ye Kun

144
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,920
who is very suspicious.

145
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,430

147
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,070
There were three Ye Kuns,

148
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,430
but he identified the right one
immediately.

149

Which one?

150
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,520
This one.

151
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,159
It's him.

152
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,050
And he even

153
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,950
pulled out a photo of Ye Kun

154
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,600
directly from his pocket.

155
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,920
Find this person for me today.

156
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,750
How did he do that?

157
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,720
Does he have a printer in his pocket,

158
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,240
or can he plug wires into
the back of his head?

159
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,750
Doesn't that happen all the time?

Does he have that ability?

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,070
I think Ye Kun...

185
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,900
What ability?

186
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,670
Boss!

187
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,240
Have a seat.

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,200
Boss! Boss.

Boss.

191
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,720
Not inviting me to dinner is bad enough,

192
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,750
and now you even hit me?

193
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,750
I didn't mean that.

194
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,960
You walk so quietly.

195
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,620
You almost scared me to death.

196
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:28,870
Tell me.

197
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,140
What ability does Ye Kun have?

198
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,440
Through dreams,

199
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,010
he can predict the future.

200
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,380
That's not accurate enough.

201
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,930
He has a a supernatural power.

202
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,630
He can enter the loop.

203
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,110
That's nonsense.

204
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,360
I told you.

205
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,720
No one would believe it.

206
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,840

208
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,540
Help me look up someone named You Yuxiang.

209
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,270
He's a professor at Ivy Bay University.

210
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,130
I need details.

211
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,630
Got it.

212
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:07,840
Look.

213
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,750
Now it's You Yuxiang.

214
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,370
But every time he investigates someone,

215
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,750
there's always something off with them.

216
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,910
It's so weird.

217
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,000
Whatever.

218
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,510
I'll just look up whatever he asks for.

219
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,440
No matter what,

220
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,390
we need to stay united

221
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,550
and trust Ding Qi,

222
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,510
okay?

223
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,990
Alright. It's about time.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,860

225
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,470
is about to start.

Let's move, everyone.

227

228
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,960
Thank you, Boss.

229
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,820
Don't touch me.

230
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,600
Take it.

231
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,360
Hello.

232
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,200
Could you help me access
the test site?

233
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,000
The test site?

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,360
Yes.

235
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
May I ask who you're looking for?

236
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,030
Dr. An Lan.

237
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,440
Dr. An Lan...

238
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,840
I don't have permission for that.

239
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,790
Please wait a moment.

240
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,320
I'll make a call to ask about it.

241
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,250

242
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,250
I'll take you there.

243
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,350
Thank you.

244
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:07,960
Officer Ding.

245
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,910
I won't go in.

246
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,000
Walk to the end of the corridor
and turn right,

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,260
and you'll find Dr. An.

248
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,750
Okay.

Qi?

252
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,470
Why are you here?

253
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,270
I'm here to see you.

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,930
Outsiders are not allowed in here.

255
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,560
Let's go

256
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,590
and talk outside.

257
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,510
As the CEO's assistant,

258
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,070
can't I look around?

259
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,000
How am I an outsider?

260
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,360
Do you want me to get in trouble?

261
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,950
What secrets are you hiding in this lab?

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,390
Besides, I wouldn't understand
anything anyway.

263
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,350
Why be so guarded against me?

264
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,830
That's exactly the point.

265
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,890
Everything here is a trade secret.

266
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,120
Alright, alright.

267
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,120
Go ahead.

268
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,890
What do you need me for?

269
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,720
Just need a brief statement.

270
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,090
Early this morning,

271
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,390
what were you doing?

272
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,520
Early this morning?

273
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,390
I was in the lab.

274
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,840
Working till that hour?

275
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,080
A special drug

276
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,030
is in the animal testing phase.

277
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,000
I encountered some problems.

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,720
What problems?

279
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,630
Some data

280
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,090
suddenly showed changes.

281
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,200
I can't tell you

282
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,910
the details.

283
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,480
What happened?

284
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,180
It's about awakening PVS patients,
isn't it?

285
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,790
So when did you leave the lab?

286
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,080
At 2:15.

287
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,130
And then?

288
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,540
I went to see my mother.

289
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,960
Why did you suddenly go there?

290
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Because

291
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,930
I discovered something

292
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,440
unexpected.

293
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,670
Something

294
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,420
I'd long awaited.

295
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,410
It regained mobility.

296
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,110
My mother is about to wake up.

297
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,550
My medicine is working.

298
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,510
Dr. An, why are you here?

299
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,110
My mother is about to wake up.

300
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,240
Dr. Chen.

301
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,670
Mom.

302
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,120
Mom.

303
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,320
Dr. Chen,

304
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,200
my mother's EEG

305
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,600
changed an hour ago,

306
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,840
but the change disappeared.

307
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,910
Did you notice anything before?

308
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,870
What changes?

309
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,760
We didn't notice anything.

310
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,080
An Lan.

311
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,560
Could you be mistaken?

312
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,750
I can't be.

313
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,570
Dr. Chen,

314
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,840
is it possible

315
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,750
that her brain has awakened

316
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,910
but her body hasn't?

317
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,460
Have you encountered such cases before?

318
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,150
Five years ago,

319
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,000
I did have such a patient.

320
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,560
Do you remember?

321
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,870
I do.

322
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,700
He was in great pain.

323
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,960
His consciousness was clear,

324
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,270
but his body was rigid,

325
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,210
unable to move.

326
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,510
I'm sure I can find a way

327
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,480
to awaken

328
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,440
her body too.

329
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,720
What way?

330
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,490
I can't tell you

331
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,030
about that yet.

332
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Go back now.

333
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,600
I have other things to do.

334
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,620
Maybe you should take a break.

335
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
You haven't slept since yesterday.

336
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,330
There's no time to rest.

337
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
I need to go now.

338
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,250
Where to?

339
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,720
Ivy Bay University.

340
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,600
You're going there too?

341
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,130
The university invited me.

342
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,600
They probably learned

343
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,860
about my appointment.

344
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,640
Who told them?

345
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,440
No idea.

346
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,380
But does it matter?

347
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,280
Since I accepted this position,

348
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,090
I have to take on

349
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,770
responsibilities

00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,670
he had two months to live,

523
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,790
which means

524
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,660
he only has one month left now.

525
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,030
A life for a life.

526
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,390
Is it worth it?

527
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,750
Where would a man

528
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,350
who isn't afraid of death go?

529
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,030
Tang Xin.

530
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,800
Pretending not to see me?

531
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,750
Mr. Han.

532
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,880
Mr. Han?

533
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,480
So formal?

534
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,100
Talk properly.

535
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,590
Yufei.

536
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,480
Why would I pretend not to know you?

537
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,350
Right.

538
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,920
You used to come to my house often
when we were kids.

539
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,790
Remember?

540
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,880
Our families used to get together
all the time.

541
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,110
And now, in the blink of an eye...

542
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,720
We've both lost our fathers.

543
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,000
Tang Xin.

544
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,110
Your father and mine
were lifelong best friends.

545
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,830
Even though our generation
hasn't had much contact,

546
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,070
now that we're both at Moma Group,

547
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,480
we should stand together.

548
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,270
There are many things

549
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,530
you don't understand.

550
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,560
During hand raising in the meeting
this morning...

551
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,510
Fang Lu.

552
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,590
Have you found You Yuxiang?

553
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,350
Not yet.

554
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,480
We'll keep looking.

555
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,080
I'll go protect Mo Yuanzhi.

556
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,640
Next,

557
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,700
I'd like to introduce a friend to you.

558
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,270
She's also an outstanding alumna

559
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,440
of our Ivy Bay University,

560
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,880
and my partner.

561
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,480
Please give a warm welcome to

562
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,750
the Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of Moma Biotechnology,

563
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,680
Dr. An Lan.

564
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,590
Hello everyone, I'm An Lan.

565
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,640
I'm honored to be here to share with you

566
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,970
the developments in genetic technology.

567
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,000
Are you upset

568
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,130
because I said you didn't understand?

569
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,810
I do understand.

570
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,960
Moma is like a scale.

571
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,920
Once it loses balance,

572
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,030
everything will fall into chaos.

573
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,480
We all need to pick a side.

574
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,070
Those stuck in between

575
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,480
never get their share.

576
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,640
I'll never be able to reach

577
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,280
the top of the core technology pyramid,

578
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,200
right?

579
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,200
Seems someone has already talked to you.

580
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,830
Tell me.

581
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,680
Which side do you want me to take?

582
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,890
Mo Yuanzhi's side.

583
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,920
I'm serious.

584
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,640
You need to side with the tech faction.

585
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,770
The technology pyramid you just mentioned,

586
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,140
you don't need to be at the top.

587
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,720
You just need

588
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,100
an access card to the base of the pyramid.

589
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,070
Thank you, everyone.

590
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,960
I'm An Lan.

591
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,960
Thank you, Dr. An Lan,
for your excellent speech.

592
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,180
Please welcome Dr. Mo Yuanzhi.

593
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,720
Now we'll open the floor for questions.

594
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,030
If you have any questions
for your senior brother,

595
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,550
feel free to speak up.

596
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,420
That young man over there.

597
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,400
Hello, Dr. Mo.

598
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,070
As far as I know,

599
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,880
RAN technology has existed
for less than 10 years.

600
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,750
By medical industry standards,

601
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,240
it hasn't been tested
for a sufficient period of time.

602
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,270
How can we be sure of its safety?

603
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,970
He asked a different question
than in the last loop.

604
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,310
As RAN technology develops,

605
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,550
will there be more and more diseases

606
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,110
that can be cured through it?

607
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,180
In that case,

608
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,270
will traditional pharmaceutical factories
go bust?

609
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,350
That's a profound question.

610
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,030
Thank you.

611
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,510
However,

612
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,510
efficacy and side effects

613
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,200
have always been contradictory.

614
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,720
This has also been a topic

615
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,790
of endless research

616
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,920
and debate in the medical field
for centuries.

617
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,480
Whether RAN technology has safety risks

618
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,070
cannot be explained in just a few words.

619
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,070
But I can assure you that

620
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,240
my team and I

621
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,960
have used

622
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,000
the world's most advanced
technical methods

623
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,720
and the most rigorous testing standards

624
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,550
to verify the safety of RAN technology.

625
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,310
So far,

626
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,110
there have been no safety issues.

627
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,150
Although Moma Biotechnology

628
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,030
hasn't detected any safety risks,

629
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,070
over the past two years,

630
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,550
many experts have

631
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,550
pointed out RAN's technical flaws.

632
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,750
But their statements
have all been suppressed.

633
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,480
Isn't that a sign
that Moma has something to hide?

634
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,000
Young man,

635
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,200
you're giving us too much credit.

636
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,750
First of all, Moma has never
suppressed

637
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,350
any expert or statement.

638
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,790
We don't have that capability.

639
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,350
Secondly,

640
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,550
those so-called "statements" you mentioned

641
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,640
seem to be just

642
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,070
your own imagination.

643
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,070
Do you have any facts to support that?

644
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,510
Or perhaps

645
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,110
you're asking questions this way

646
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,270
just to show off?

647
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,200
Are you suggesting

648
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,610
that as long as no one dies, it's safe?

649
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,000
Your question

650
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,110
is just like asking which came first,

651
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,160
the chicken or the egg.

652
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
Then can you talk about

653
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,920
the academic disagreements

654
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,070
between you and your mentor back then?

655
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,430
You're being a bit unreasonable,
young man.

656
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,230
But it's fine.

657
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,280
You have the right to speak freely.

658
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,270
But I believe

659
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,200
if you want to prove that RAN technology

660
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,110
is unsafe,

661
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,480
please provide data
to support your argument.

662
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,210
RAN has already gotten people killed,
hasn't it?

663
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,000
Otherwise, why would
your company's executives,

664
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Han Song and Tang Shaorong,

665
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,110
have been killed?

666
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,590
Yet you're still here joking
as if nothing happened.

667
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,750
What are you hiding?

668
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,070
Everyone, please be quiet.

669
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,830
Students.

670
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,690
Be quiet.

671
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,680
Be quiet!

672
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,790
Mo Yuanzhi.

673
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,310
Do you remember what this place is?

674
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,270
You know where I am,

675
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,110
Mo Yuanzhi.

676
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,410
What is this place?

677
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,110
Speak!

678
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,550
I'm not entirely sure,

679
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,000
but it might be

680
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,940
an underground laboratory.

681
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,840
Is that Mr. You?

682
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,020
Mr. You, what do you want to do?

683
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,130
Are you going to hurt this girl?

684
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,380
If you have something to ask me,

685
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,010
let her go,

686
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,760
and we can talk properly. Okay?

687
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,170
Talk properly?

688
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,570
Haven't you said enough already?

689
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,030
Have you had any remorse?

690
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,960
Say it out loud.

691
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,510
Where am I!

692
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,900
You're in an underground laboratory.

693
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,150
No.

694
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,420
This is where you destroyed evidence

695
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,870
and killed your mentor Jiang Yuwen.

696
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,570
Do you want to save this girl?

697
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,230
Then confess

698
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,710
all your crimes in detail!

699
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,550
Mr. You, what on earth
are you talking about?

700
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,410
What exactly are you trying to do?

701
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,170
Have you been having issues again...

702
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,360
Everyone's been saying

703
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,760
that there might be something wrong
with your brain,

704
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,280
but I've always had great respect for you.

705
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,070
Mr. You.

706
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,690
Many people here today are your students.

707
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,440
They admire and respect you,

708
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,480
including me.

709
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,550
Please don't become a murderer
right in front of us,

710
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,320
Mr. You, okay?

711
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,440
You're the murderer!

712
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,960
Still acting, huh?

713
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,400
Don't hurt that girl!

714
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,550
Fine!

715
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,320
I'm a murderer, okay?

716
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,360
I'll be whatever you say I am.

717
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,400
Let her go.

718
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,190
I'll come to you,

719
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,150
and we'll go to the police station
together.

720
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,880
Is that okay?

721
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,330
Don't move!

722
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,480
Freeze!

723
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,880
You Yuxiang!

724
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,850
Put the knife down!

725
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,800
You cops don't care
whether the hostage lives or dies, do you?

726
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,540
Put your guns down.

727
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,070
Put them down!

728
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,840
Mr. You.

729
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,590
Mr. You.

730
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,460
I don't have any weapons on me,

731
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,210
and they won't hurt you either.

732
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,060
Let's talk.

733
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,850
I think I've seen you before,

734
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,750
but I don't seem to know you.

735
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,800
Whatever you need,

736
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,230
or whatever conditions you have,

737
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,230
you can tell me.

738
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,700
Go investigate

739
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,970
Jiang Yuwen's disappearance case
from 8 years ago.

740
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,760
That wasn't a disappearance case.

741
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,030
It was a murder!

742
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,550
And the murderer is...

743
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,280
Mo Yuanzhi!

744
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,440
Mr. You,

745
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,170
I really don't understand
why you're doing this.

746
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,000
I just can't figure out

747
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,630
what benefit you'll get

748
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,280
from destroying me.

749
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,070
But if you insist on doing this,

750
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:16,800
Mr. You,

751
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,550
that's fine.

752
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,880
I'll fully cooperate with you.

753
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,320
Let that girl go,

754
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,280
and I'll come to you.

755
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,510
The police are right over there.

756
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,670
We can let them investigate
and find out the truth.

757
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,880
Is that okay, Mr. You?

758
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,760
You're such a hypocrite.

759
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,550
I promise you

760
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,430
I will definitely
get to the bottom of this.

761
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,570
But I need you to cooperate with me

762
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,940
and put the knife down.

763
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,400
I had a dream last night.

764
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,600
In that dream, someone asked me,

765
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,670
a life for a life,

766
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,350
is it worth it?

767
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,760
When I woke up this morning,

768
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,030
I realized

769
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,150
it's not worth it.

770
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,480
Killing Mo Yuanzhi

771
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,800
is not my goal.

772
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,840
My goal is

773
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,930
to let the whole world know about
Mo Yuanzhi's crimes!

774
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,030
If Mo Yuanzhi is guilty,

775
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,920
I'll definitely bring him to justice.

776
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,440
But Mr. You,
I need you to cooperate with me

777
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,370
so we can figure this out together.

778
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,030
This girl is innocent.

779
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,840
I believe you don't want to
hurt your own student, either,

780
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,400
do you?

781
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,400
Mr. You.

782
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,980
Put down the knife.

783
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,420
Put it down.

784
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,230
I can't give you much.

785
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,200
You'll have to
find the evidence yourself.

786
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,910
You're different from
other police officers I've met.

787
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,570
You're different.

788
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,280
I beg you.

789
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,210
I beg you!

790
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,960
Freeze!
