Wasn't it clear in the notice?

212
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,370
The company found
that you violated the rules.

213
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,310
We can't pay the compensation for now.

has achieved some success,

350
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,000
we've also offended many people.

351
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,640
To be honest,

352
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,200
it's a miracle that I'm standing here

353
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,270
and interacting with you

354
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,800
with all four limbs intact.

355
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,790
Because

356
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,590
just a few days ago,
I received a death threat.

357
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,680
It's not some prank

358
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,950
but an official death notice.

359
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,290
I was working in front of the computer,

360
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,270
when suddenly

361
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,070
a huge squid flashed onto my screen.

362
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,530
It was very scary looking.

363
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,260
It looked at me and said,

364
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,310
"I'll kill you."

365
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,030
I asked why.

366
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,900
It replied, "Uh..."

367
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,490
And then my antivirus software killed it.

368
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,320
So I thought

369
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,200
I don't have to worry

370
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,570
with such shabby skills of theirs.

371
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,830
But this matter

372
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,480
has indeed been bothering me.

373
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,350
Right that night,

374
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,550
I had a nightmare.

375
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,480
In my nightmare,

376
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,630
a bunch of squids were chasing me.

377
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,550
While chasing me, they kept yelling

378
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,830
"Yuanzhi! Yuanzhi!"

379
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,750
When I turned around,

380
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,720
they sprayed ink on my face

381
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,590
and yelled,

382
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,990
"Mo Yuanzhi! Mo Yuanzhi!"
["Mo" means ink]

383
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,350
Calm down!

384
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,410
Calm down, please!

385
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,680
What's that noise?

386
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,840
There's a group of protesters here

387
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,920
seemingly against genetic engineering.

388
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,640
Boycott Moma Biotechnology!

389
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,160
Keep them in check.

390
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,030
Don't let them in.

391
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,670
Roger!

392
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,920
Calm down!

393
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,980
Calm down, please!

394
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,230
Everyone.

395
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,880
You hear that, yeah?

396
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,270
It's so lively outside.

397
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,110
Yes.

398
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,510
I know

399
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,880
many people

400
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,440
oppose Moma

401
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,200
and our genetic research.

402
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Because they say

403
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,440
we're violating the laws of nature.

404
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,810
We won't stop those

405
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,120
who say those things.

406
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,960
They're free to go up to the mountains

407
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,510
and go down to the seas.

408
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,200
They can

409
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,160
go back to the nature they extol.

410
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
And we will

411
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,790
continue to challenge the laws of nature.

412
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,680
Why?

413
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,440
Because in today's state
of tech advancement,

414
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,110
why should we

415
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,880
give the right of
deciding our life and death

416
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,960
to nature?

417
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,700
It doesn't make sense!

418
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,270
The reason we humans can keep improving

419
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,000
for generations

420
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,440
is because we keep going against fate.

421
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,160
Okay.

422
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,160
Someone must think

423
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,000
that the notion of

424
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,640
going against fate sounds sacrilegious.

425
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
It doesn't matter.

426
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,680
Let me and my team

427
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,350
do this sacrilegious deed.

428
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,920
We'll take the blame.

429
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,750
I just hope

430
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,110
that when we succeed,

431
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,070
all of us

432
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,160
can experience,

433
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,640
feel, and receive

434
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,920
the medical benefits

435
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,350
in this technological era!

436
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,070
If...

437
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,480
If...

438
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,350
this is considered a sacrilege,

439
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,510
then I, Mo Yuanzhi, am sacrilegious.

440
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,400
So what?

441
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,160
Bravo!

442
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Nice!

443
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,440
Kai.

444
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,320
Watch the girl

445
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,340
with the bouquet.

446
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,260
Genetic engineering

447
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,700
is going against fate.

448
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,880
I believe our RAN technology

449
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,080
will someday help you

450
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,160
and all of humanity

451
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,350
to go against fate.

452
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,480
Flowers from the school council.

453
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,160
Thank you.

454
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,960
This has been your student and alumnus,

455
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,750
Mo Yuanzhi.

456
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,160
Bravo!

457
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,920
Dr. Mo.

458
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,130
These are for you.

459
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,000
Thank you.

460
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,930
Kai!

461
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,550
I just want an autograph.

462
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,160
I'm sorry.

463
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,190
It's okay.

464
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,790
Are you okay?

465
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,400
Yes.

466
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,790
Let me sign it for you.

467
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,240
Sorry.

468
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,400
Thank you.

469
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,110
Thank you.

470
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,270
This way.

471
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,400
Sorry.

472
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,860
This little episode

473
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,070
truly showed

474
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,610
how popular

475
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,050
Dr. Mo really is.

476
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,170
Alright.

477
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,690
Now, it's time for the Q&A.

478
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,990
Not just limited to academic questions,

479
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,240
feel free to ask anything

480
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,070
you want.

481
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,470
Alright,

482
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,680
let's get started.

483
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,170
That male student over there.

484
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:54,960
Yes.

485
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,350
Hello, Dr. Mo.

486
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,000
As RAN technology develops,

487
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,880
will there be more and more diseases

488
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,470
that can be cured through it?

489
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,510
In that case,

490
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,530
will traditional pharmaceutical factories
go bust?

491
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,160
Thank you for

492
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,350
your astute question.

493
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,010
Please sit.

494
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,310
Actually, I really hope RAN technology

495
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,750
will make greater contributions

496
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,920
for mankind in the future.

497
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,510
This has always been a prime goal

498
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,350
of Moma.

499
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,030
As for your second question,

500
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,290
I've thought about it.

501
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,030
In the future,

502
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,240
there might be
better and more novel technology

503
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,640
replacing RAN.

504
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,790
It's not a bad thing.

505
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,110
Being replaced

506
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,000
is a concern of every business.

507
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,480
Not being replaced is

508
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,610
the motivation for Moma to keep going.

509
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,280
That female student there.

510
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,030
Hello, Dr. Mo.

511
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,750
I'm a sophomore.

512
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,590
If I'm interested

513
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,160
in joining Moma after graduation,

514
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,090
what's the most important factor?

515
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,550
The most important factor is that...

516
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,790
when you graduate in two years,

517
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,240
Moma hasn't gone bust.

518
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,790
We value three qualities

519
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,950
when hiring:

520
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,800
confidence,

521
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,720
honesty,

522
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,070
and persistence.

523
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,350
I believe these are

524
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,080
also the qualities of science.

525
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,160
Let's barge in.

526
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,750
Go inside!

527
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,720
Hurry! Go in!

528
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,110
Mo Yuanzhi!

529
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,650
Get out, Mo Yuanzhi!

530
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,120
Boycott Mo Yuanzhi!

531
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,970
Is this what you want?

532
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,440
Protect human genes!

533
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,190
Boycott Moma Biotechnology!

534
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,480
Kai!

535
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,270
Call the car over!

536
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:57,880
Roger!

537
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,440
Sorry!

538
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,420
Yuanzhi.

539
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,130
It's our fault. Our security was too lax.

540
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,270
Step back!

541
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,540
Back off! Back off!

542
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,990
Back off!

543
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,830
Back off!

544
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,480
Calm down!

545
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,650
Silence! Everyone, step back!

546
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,880
Back off! Silence!

547
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,830
Mr. Mo! Mr. Mo!

548
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,350
Freeze!

549
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,350
Mr. Mo!

550
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,460
Is it wrong for me to get my money back?

551
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,670
Let go of me!

552
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,200
Freeze!

553
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,130
Step back!

554
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,900
[Boycott Moma Biotechnology]

555
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,450
Freeze!

556
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,520
Thank you.

557
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,730
Thank you.

558
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,400
Thank you.

559
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,950
Mr. Mo, please get in.

560
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,350
Follow Mo Yuanzhi.

561
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,070
I'll interrogate those two.

562
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,590
Leave it to us.

563
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,310
Yes, Boss.

564
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,530
Yay, I caught the Squid.

565
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,050
Boss caught him, no?

566
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,800
I mean I handcuffed him.

567
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,080
You get some merit too.

568
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,170
Stop bragging and get a move on.

569
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,000
What's the hurry?

570
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,880
Squid has been caught.

571
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,750
Relax.

572
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,270
Based on initial analysis,

573
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,970
the liquid in the syringe is a neurotoxin.

574
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,310
The injected will soon
die of organ failure.

575
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,960
This is an experimental drug

576
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,290
from You Yuxiang's lab.

577
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,960
You Yuxiang,

578
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,630
a lab researcher
and former associate professor

579
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,960
at Ivy Bay University.

580
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,880
You were stripped of

581
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,070
your professorship

582
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,320
after being reported

583
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,040
for attacking others online
due to academic issues.

584
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,250
Long time no see.

585
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,510
Congratulations, Mr. Zhao.

586
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,570
Congratulations.

587
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,760
Long time no see.

588
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,400
Yes.

589
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,550
Hello.

590
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,960
Congratulations.

591
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,880
Welcome.

592
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,510
You're Fu Jun,

593
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,150
a former Moma technician

594
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,670
fired three months ago,

595
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,630
and you've yet to receive compensation.

596
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,230
Right?

597
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,590
Yes.

598
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,440
I hate them.

599
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,670
I hate their company

600
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,130
and their top management.

601
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,230
A group of people

602
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,710
under the cloak of being scientists

603
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,110
when they're actually
bloodsucking profiteers.

604
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,440
I abhor them.

605
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,930
Why do you want to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

606
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,840
What?

607
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,070
Kill him?

608
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,440
That's not true.

609
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,770
What do you mean? What murder?

610
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,070
I was taking a syringe to the lab.

611
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,470
The crowd squeezed me in.

612
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,960
Once I was in,

613
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,420
-you pressed me to the ground.
-You Yuxiang!

614
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,320
We have the witness and evidence.

615
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,250
Saying all this is meaningless.

616
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,460
Did you think no one would find out
if you killed in the chaos?

617
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,280
Fine.

618
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,550
Sure. Okay.

619
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,360
Convict me.

620
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,100
Sentence me.

621
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,670
F-Finish the procedure.

622
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm not afraid of anything.

623
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,840
Did you organize that student protest too?

624
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,840
They didn't go against the law.

625
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,480
They followed my instructions.

626
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,080
Kill me or ruin me as you wish.

627
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,970
Leave them out of it.

628
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
What did you want?

629
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,130
Your salary?

630
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,950
Officer,

631
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,880
I was at my wit's end.

632
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,820
I went to HR,

633
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,350
but they ignored me.

634
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,810
So I could only go to Mr. Mo.

635
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,870
I can no longer pay my mortgage.

636
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
My whole family depends on me.

637
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,020
I'm completely broke.

638
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,090
How many times
did you simulate the murders

639
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,690
of Han Song and Tang Shaorong?

640
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,760
Why did you

641
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,320
switch to such a direct method?

642
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,480
Why?

643
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,030
Why today?

644
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,860
When Tang Shaorong and Han Song died,

645
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,280
You Yuxiang wasn't in Hua'ao.

646
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,880
He does have an alibi.

647
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,400
Also,

648
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,630
in his house and office,

649
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,490
there's no residual reaction
from any explosives.

650
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,430
Kai.

651
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,430
Kai!

652
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,920
What's wrong, Boss?

653
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,150
Neither of them is Squid.

654
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,150
All of you,

655
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,280
protect Mo Yuanzhi!

656
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,320
Roger.

657
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,070
Roger.

658
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,540
This morning,

659
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,320
celebrity Fang Zhou appeared in a cafe

660
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,440
and was surrounded by fans,

661
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,630
resulting in a stampede.

662
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,030
The injured have been
sent to the hospital.

663
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,030
Next,

664
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,360
let's welcome the newlyweds

665
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
to share their sweet happiness

666
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,880
with every one of the guests here.

667
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,360
Bride and groom, please.

668
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,710
I'm here.

669
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,510
Where are you?

670
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,480
On the lawn.

671
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,400
Where is Mo Yuanzhi?

672
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,230
With us.

673
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,420
Kai!

674
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,590
Kai!

675
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,880
Kai.

676
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,070
Kai!

677
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,360
Fang Lu.

678
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,510
Fang Lu!

679
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,090
Please wait outside.

680
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:28,800
Sorry.

681
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,590
Only staff allowed.

682
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,850
You can't go in, sorry.

683
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,810
Do you regret it?

684
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,690
I told you not to come.

685
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,110
You're the one...

686
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,900
who insisted on bringing them here!

687
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,220
Why did you accept this mission?

688
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,510
Kai...

689
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,550
He is an only son.

690
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,190
His 70-year-old parents are
waiting at home for him.

691
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,770
Fang Lu

692
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,010
joined our team less than three years ago.

693
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,780
She's inexperienced.

694
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,680
I told you

695
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,550
to take good care of them.

696
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,360
But what have you done?

697
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,030
How will you explain to their families?

698
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,400
How will you explain to them?

699
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,630
