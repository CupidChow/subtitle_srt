00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,760
I'm patronizing your business,
so could you give me a discount?

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,930
It's only 50 yuan.

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,830
How dare you haggle with me?

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,990
I just want you to feel

5
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,010
how exhausting it is to be an artist.

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,160
Why do you sound just like my mom today?

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,810
It's like you two are of one mind.

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,680
I don't want to be your mother.

9
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,810
I just think that dreams and reality

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,740
are two different things.

11
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,200
So we must not be impulsive.

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,720
We need to think carefully
before making our choice.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,560
Who was it that told me

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,440
to always hold fast to my dreams?

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,320
Why the change of attitude today?

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,760
Just the other day,
you were so excited telling me

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,850
you were going to Stanford.

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,480
Why are you feeling so down today?

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,880
Stanford Medical School

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,120

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,870
Why?

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,560
My exchange student spot

23
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,330
was taken by someone else.

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,789
Stanford says

25
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,200
I can go only if I pay for myself.

26
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,160
You are a top-performing medical student.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,270
That paper of yours

28
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,180
was even published in SCI.

29
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,280
You have to believe

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,789
that you are the best.

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,250
To us, fate has never been

32

33

It's multiple choice.

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,500
You can still choose to study abroad.

35
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,310
Let me ask you one question.

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,130
Do you truly love this field?

37
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,770
Of course.

38
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,009
Between love, passion and devotion,

39
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:45,940
what do you really feel?

40
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,270
What's the difference?

41
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,979
Loving it means
you can live with or without it.

42
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,310
Being passionate means

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,370
it's great to have it,
but you could live without it for a while.

44
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,620
Being devoted means

45
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,570
you can't live without it
for even a minute.

46
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,340
Then I must be...

47
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,420
devoted.

48
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,550
Then what are you waiting for?

49
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,460
What are you doing?

50
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,650
If you can't go as an exchange student,

51
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,130
then let's send you over as
a self-funded student.

56
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,140
Take it back.

57
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,090
But I will definitely get

58
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,780
my spot back.

almost everything inside was burned.

There are no casualties,

and there are no bodies either.

a teacher was inside.

We've confirmed multiple times.

entered at exactly 8:05 PM.

112
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,420
Besides the cameras,

113
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,860
at the basement exit outside,

114
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,620
there were many students around.

115
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,500
Many saw Jiang Yuwen enter,

116
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,980
but no one saw him leave.

117
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,180
Among the student witnesses

118
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,300
was Mo Yuanzhi.

Half a minute later,

120
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,460
the sudden explosion
broke out in the laboratory.

121
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,370
So Mo Yuanzhi

122
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,940
has a complete alibi.

After that,

124
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,330
did you ever look for Jiang Yuwen again?

125
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,860
We did. We searched for a long time,

126
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,540
but couldn't find him.

127

Is he connected to this case?

130

You Yuxiang came to make a report
after the incident.

131
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,010
He claimed he saw

132
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,810
Mo Yuanzhi kill Jiang Yuwen
with his own eyes.

133
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,030
He said there was blood everywhere,

134
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,830
and the weapon used was a dagger.

135
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,660
But I didn't believe it.

136
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,980
Because we couldn't find any evidence
to support it.

137
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
No suspect, no blood,

138
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,440
and no body was ever found.

139
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,260
So you're saying...

140
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,400
Mo Yuanzhi had a motive for murder, right?

141
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,910
No.

142

143
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,370
the one who suffered
the greatest loss in the fire

144
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,420
wasn't Jiang Yuwen,

145
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
it was Mo Yuanzhi.

146
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,860
He had a groundbreaking dataset
that was nearly complete,

147
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,980
but because of the fire,

148
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,580
it was all burned to nothing.

149
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,510
Burned to nothing?

150
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,270

151

But given the patient's
level of suffering,

200
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,570
0.5 mg doesn't seem sufficient.

Who do you want to investigate?

342
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,370
Come outside, I'll tell you.

343
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,250
Okay.

344
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,660
Mom.

345
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,660
Mom.

346
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,970
You're awake.

347
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,660
Mom?

348
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,940
Can you hear me?

349
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,770
Mom.

350
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,210
Mom!

351
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:21,940
Mom.

352
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,580
If you can hear me,

353
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,730
blink your eyes.

354
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,080
Mom.

355
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:58,940
Mom?

356
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,250
Mom?

357
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,050
Mom.

358
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,210
Mom... Mom.

359
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,350
Peishan.

360
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,940
Please look up information
on these three individuals.

361
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,870
Especially him.

362
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Whatever it takes,

363
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,490
you must find out where he's living now.

364
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,340
Not his registered address,

365
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,450
but where he's actually staying.

366
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,780
I've sent you his usual areas of activity.

367
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:32,940
Wait.

368
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,290
Who is this?

369
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:42,860
Squid.

370
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,380
Squid?

371
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,580
You found him so quickly.

372
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,250
Who are these two?

373
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,050
Accomplices.

374
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,420
When did you find out?

375
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,290
Just hurry up with the search

376
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,820
and stop asking questions!

377
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,050
Squid?

378
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,290
Accomplices?

00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,050
I've sent you the location

382
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,310
you asked me to look up.

383
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,000
Kai, keep a close eye on Ye Kun

384
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,650
and update me immediately
if anything happens.

385
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,380
Understood.

386
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,190
This cold is killing me.

387
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,940
Boss.

388
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,800
Ye Kun is awake.

389
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
You need to hurry.

390

392
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,740
Ye Kun is on his way back.
