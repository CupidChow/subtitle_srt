the chief scientist position,

171

00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,670
I want

181
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,000
you to step up.

182
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,270
You think I can do it?

183
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,190
Just tell me your honest thoughts.

184
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,750
I do have such ambition,

185
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,320
but now...

186
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,030
I was afraid you

187
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,560
didn't have such ambition.

188
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,090
It's good that you do.

189
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,070
To be honest...

190
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,080
I might not have much time left.

191
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,580
Han and Tang are both gone.

192
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,960
At any moment, I could also...

193
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,960
Also what?

194
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,720
Nothing.

195
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,140
It doesn't matter.

196
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,150
Even the Moma Group doesn't matter.

197
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,550
Even if all these buildings

198
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,790
were razed to the ground before my eyes,

199
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,390
I wouldn't feel a thing.

200
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,160
But the genetic research cannot stop.

201
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,180
Only you would understand

202
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,410
what I'm feeling.

203
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,720
From the first day

204
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,840
you walked into my office,

205
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,550
I knew

206
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,450
we were the same kind of people.

207
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,080
No matter how much profit

208
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,550
genetic research brings,

209
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,390
we are scientists first.

210
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,510
I was thinking...

211
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,630
If I appoint you directly
as chief scientist,

212
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,910
people might not accept it.

213
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,790
It's better to leave that position
vacant for now.

214
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,120
I'll temporarily appoint you as

215
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,150
Assistant to the Chief Scientist.

216
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,120
This way, the entire research team

217
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,650
will be under your control.

218
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,320
If that works for you,

219
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,630
I'll announce your appointment

220
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,890
at the upcoming shareholders' meeting,

221
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,240
Will the shareholders agree?

222
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
I'll handle them.

223
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,830
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Mo.

224
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,870
I'll work hard on my research.

225
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,600
I believe in you.

226
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,930
Let's go.

227
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,200
An Lan.

228
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,840
Come in during the second half

229
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,720
of the meeting.

230
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,740
Wait for me in the rest area.

231
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,650
A multi-vehicle collision occurred

232
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,480
at M15 Junction

233
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,150
near Highway 1,

234
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,720
resulting in three deaths

235
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,960
and many seriously injured.

236
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,550
Currently,

237
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,600
paramedics have rushed to the scene

238
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,670
for rescue.

239
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,550
Do you know Mr. Mo's wife?

240
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,030
Mrs. Mo rarely comes to the company.

241
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,360
She only appears

242
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
during shareholder meetings.

243
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,660
How's their relationship?

244
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,860
How would I know that?

245
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,790
That's between them as a couple.

246
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,440
Police.

247
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,830
Temporarily relinquish
control of the group?

248
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,980
What exactly are you all suggesting?

249
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,560
Mr. Mo, you're currently

250
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,400
facing death threats.

251
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,160
This is not only for

252
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,420
the company's future.

253
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,960
It's also for

254
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,610
your personal safety.

255
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,200
If you choose to

256
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,790
temporarily step down
from managing the company now,

257
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,640
perhaps

258
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,350
Squid will spare you too.

259
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,070
But I have two questions.

260
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,640
First,

261
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,350
how long is "temporarily?"

262
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,000
Second,

263
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,400
if I step down,

264
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
who will take over
the company's daily operations?

265
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,680
You?

266
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,820
That's not your concern anymore.

267
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,990
When the time comes,

268
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,550
the general shareholders' meeting

269
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,880
will elect someone new.

270
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,550
But whether

271
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,750
to terminate your management rights
over the group or not

272
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,200
can be voted on today.

273
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,960
You inherited shares,

274
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,550
not the position.

275
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,480
You're sitting in

276
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,510
your father's office

277
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,750
and attending this

278
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,680
internal management meeting

279
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,110
because I respected
your father Han Song,

280
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,510
not you.

281
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,130
Since I've inherited the shares,

282
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,930
I have the right to vote.

283
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,790
I approve of

284
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,200
removing Mo Yuanzhi's

285
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,160
management rights at Moma Biotechnology.

286
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,590
My vote

287
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,670
represents my father.

288
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,680
Actually, I can give up

289
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,280
all the business interests.

290
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,750
But I don't want to lose you.

291
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,920
I want you to be safe.

292
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,260
What they just said

293
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,380
makes some sense.

294
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,790
This is only temporary.

295
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,200
It's not forever.

296
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,160
Yuanzhi.

297
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,590
I believe that someday,

298
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,550
you will

299
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,270
thank me for this.

300
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,750
My father spent

301
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,880
his entire life dedicated to research.

302
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,400
Moma's genetic research

303
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,550
was more important to him than his life.

304
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,440
I believe

305
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,470
if he were here today,

306
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,850
he would want
Moma Biotechnology's authority

307
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,910
to be in the hands of someone
who understands research.

308
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,030
Therefore,

309
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,680
I vote for Mr. Mo.

310
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,590
The voting is over.

311
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,680
But don't forget

312
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,110
I also have a vote myself.

313
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,590
If I'm not mistaken,

314
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,510
whether by vote count or share percentage,

315
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,550
I will continue to be in charge of Moma.

316
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,170
I have an announcement.

317
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,000
This morning,

318
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,350
I finalized the selection for

319
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,680
the Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of the R&D Department.

320
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,550
Who is it?

321
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,240
Who is it?

322
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,530
An Lan.

323
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,000
See?

324
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,030
Mo Yuanzhi

325
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,160
just keeps appointing his own people.

326
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,510
These researchers...

327
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,060
Who knows what they're doing all day.

328
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,110
An Lan has only been with
the company for a short while.

329
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,920
Moma itself has only been established
for a few years.

330
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,750
Let's not forget

331
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,070
we are a biotech R&D company.

332
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,160
Without the dedication
of our R&D Department,

333
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,830
what would our future depend on?

334
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,630
Today, I want you all to know that

335
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,070
for Moma,

336
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,790
the most valuable assets
will always be those

337
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,720
who master our core technologies.

338
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,170
So that's how the glass broke.

339
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,970
According to company bylaws,

340
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,110
I hereby officially appoint

341
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,200
An Lan

342
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,350
as Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of the R&D Department.

343
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,310
Until a Chief Scientist is appointed,

344
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,550
she will temporarily oversee
the R&D Department's daily operations.

345
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,270
Mr. Mo,

346
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,150
may I say a few words?

347
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,720
Thank you to the company and Mr. Mo

348
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,240
for entrusting me
with such an important position.

349
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,680
I understand the significance of this role

350
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,350
and I'm well aware

351
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,880
that accepting this position

352
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,220
during this critical time

353
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,440
means stepping up
in a challenging situation.

354
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,550
Since I dare to accept it,

355
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,510
I dare to take responsibility.

356
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,640
I promise you

357
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,960
that since Ms. Tang and Mr. Mo
haven't been afraid,

358
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,620
then I won't be afraid either.

359
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,350
I sincerely hope

360
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,960
to gain everyone's support,

361
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,440
so that Moma Group's research work

362
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,900
can get back on track soon.

363
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,590
I believe

364
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,800
this is what
everyone wants to see as well.

365
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,160
If no one has any other objections,

366
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,690
we can conclude this topic.

367
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,310
An Lan,

368
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,240
go to the R&D Department
and make preparations.

369
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,070
Regarding the position transfer,

370
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,680
I'll have HR handle it
as soon as possible.

371
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,240
Okay.

372
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,710
I have nothing else to discuss.

373
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,400
Then,

374
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,510
meeting adjourned.

375
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,170
Dismissed.

376
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,550
Boss,

377
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,110
there's a traffic jam ahead.

378
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,570
We can't pass through now.

379
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,680
We can't be late.

380
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,160
Let's take another route.

381
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,890
Got it, Boss.

382
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,070
Around 11 o'clock today,

383
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,510
someone tried to jump from

384
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,590
the top floor of Yuehai Building,

385
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,880
the tallest building
on Paris Middle Street.

386
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,400
The jumper was in a standoff
with the police for hours,

387
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,480
causing large-scale congestion.

388
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Currently, the jumper has been rescued
by the police.

389
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,400
Hello.

390
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,320
Hi there.

391
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,460
Let's go inside.

392
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,090
Let's talk inside.

393
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,540
See you in a bit.

394
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,510
You promised me

395
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,830
that the shareholder meeting
would go perfectly,

396
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,660
which is why I agreed to take the risk.

397
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,720
But what happened?

398
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,030
If you had worked with me,

399
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,690
it would have been foolproof.

400
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,880
I'm worried that Yuanzhi

401
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,000
is getting suspicious of me.

402
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,070
So what?

403
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,000
If Mo Yuanzhi

404
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,350
doesn't let go of Moma,

405
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,570
Squid will make a move against him.

406
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,420
What's your relationship

407
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,920
with Moma?

408
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,110
I used to work

409
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,550
in their technical department.

410
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,480
But three months ago,

411
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,400
I quit.

412
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,310
Do I still need to be questioned?

413
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,830
I've already left the company.

414
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,400
Well,

415
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,750
what's your attitude toward them?

416
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,920
Attitude?

417
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,480
The power at Moma

418
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,070
is in the hands of those researchers.

419
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,270
How could it come down to us?

420
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,030
That's why

421
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,270
we need to figure out

422
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,830
what exactly they're researching.

423
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,760
I just went there to ask for my money

424
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,590
and you brought me here instead.

425
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,510
They owe me money.

426
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,910
Is it wrong to ask
for what's mine, officer?

427
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,610
Officer, I need to take this call.

428
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,510
-It's a client.
-Sit down!

429
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:56,960
The client is urging...

430
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,510
Sit down!

431
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,470
You wouldn't want your husband

432
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,530
to end up like my father and Ms. Tang,

433
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,170
and give up his life, would you?

434
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,070
I'm just a delivery guy.

435
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,590
I only make a few yuan per order,

436
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,720
but if I'm late by a few minutes,

437
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,520
I have to pay a 100-yuan penalty.

438
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,790
A few minutes

439
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,120
don't affect you at all.

440
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,350
But people will still report me.

441
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,680
One hundred yuan

442
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,490
might not mean much to you,

443
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,680
but 100 yuan

444
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,270
is money for a whole day's worth of food
for my family,

445
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,030
Officer.

446
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,750
So,

447
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,030
you hate Moma

448
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,510
because they didn't pay you,

449
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,140
so you want to
kill their CEO Mo Yuanzhi,

450
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,700
right?

451
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,270
Why would I kill anyone?

452
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,920
Officer,

453
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,240
I didn't do it!

454
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,880
I need money.

455
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,110
I went there

456
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,200
to confront them.

457
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,110
I went to Moma

458
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,200
to make them give me the severance pay

459
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,350
that I deserve!

460
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,480
I just want them to give me the money.

461
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
That's it!

462
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,000
If he died, who would pay me?

463
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,830
I didn't do it.

464
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,310
Don't wrongfully accuse me,

465
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,110
Officer.

466
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,590
Your delivery order has timed out.

467
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,340
I'll say it again.

468
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,980
If there's any danger,

469
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,000
don't get others involved.

470
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,510
I know why you agreed.

471
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,030
If you protect me too well,

472
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,930
Squid will never appear again.

473
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,310
Then you'll have to

474
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,770
keep guarding me forever.

475
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,200
You and your team

476
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,530
are already exhausted.

477
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
To be honest,

478
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,060
I'm exhausted too.

Hello, Qi.

That delivery guy

486
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,550
didn't do anything.

487
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,030
What basis did you arrest him on?

488
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,560
You need to give me a reason.

489
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,810
I really can't figure out
who's in charge here.

490
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,200
You've probably seen the news lately.

491
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,070
Yes.

has achieved some success,

494
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,200
we've also offended many people.

495
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,790
To be honest,

496

00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,000
I received a death threat.

501
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,960
Keep an eye on Mo Yuanzhi.

502

Understood.

503
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,640
It wasn't some prank.

504
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,780
It was a very formal death threat.

how important time is.

00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,200
Like him,

523
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,680
I'm also a biologist.

524
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,920
But my control of time

525
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,110
is far inferior to his.

526
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,350
So how do you want to...

527
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,360
How do you want to control time?

528
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,920
Lyubishchev

529
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,630
could very clearly record

530
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,710
the time he spent on each activity,

531
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,420
so he could cherish
every minute and second.

532
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,280
Therefore, his time

533
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,550
could be doubled.

534
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,360
But I can't.

535
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Isn't that a pity?

536
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,520
What's the benefit of doubling your time?

537
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,840
With doubled time, you can do

538
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,550
many meaningful things.

539
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,790
Like what?

540
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,230
Like...

541
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,710
I have to go.

542
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,040
What do you want?

543
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,030
Mr. You.

544
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,360
A life for a life.

545
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,760
Is it worth it?

546
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,280
What do you mean?

547
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,510
Suddenly, a huge squid

548
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,670
appeared on my screen.

549
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,130
It was very scary looking.

550
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,920
It looked at me and said,

551
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,800
"I'll kill you."

552
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,070
I asked why.

553
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,050
It replied, "Uh..."

554
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,710
Then it was

555
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,570
killed by my antivirus software.

556
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,370
Why do you want to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

557
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,100
Have we

558
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,960
met somewhere before?

559
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,590
Take him away.

560
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,720
In this loop,

561
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,800
I've already changed too much.

562
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,800
But I must

563
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,530
restrain Fu Jun and You Yuxiang

564
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,120
to make the real Squid

565
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,180
show itself.

566
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,550
Who reported me?

567
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,370
Nobody reported me, right?

568
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,800
Why aren't you saying anything?

569
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,330
What is all this?

570
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,150
Yes.

571
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,710
I know.

572
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,230
Many people oppose Moma.

573
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,000
How are things outside?

574
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,460
And our genetic research.

575
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,280
There was a small group

576
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,000
of protesters with banners earlier.

577
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,960
They've all left now.

578
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,590
They think we've violated
the laws of nature.

579
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,760
Can someone explain to me

580
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,290
what the laws of nature are?

581
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,550
The sun sets

582
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,840
and it gets dark.

583
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,110
So naturally, we should go to sleep,

584
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,630
right?

585
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,520
Then why did we invent lights

586
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,440
and the TV?

587
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,670
Why do we stay up late?

588
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,220
How unnatural is that?

589
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,070
The sun rises

590
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,960
and it gets bright.

591
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,280
So naturally, we should get up,

592
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:58,960
right?

593
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:00,960
Right?

594
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Is my lecture boring?

595
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,630
Look at you.

596
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,590
I stayed up late last night.

597
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,520
What did you say?

598
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,000
You stayed up late last night?

599
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,030
Are you crazy?

600
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,480
Do you not want to be natural?

601
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,440
You're not following the law,

602
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,920
are you?

603
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,710
Is that so?

604
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,040
Boss.

605
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,670
Qi,

606
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,510
the delivery guy

607
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,110
really doesn't have

608
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,770
any motive to kill Mo Yuanzhi.

609
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,000
I've checked all of his

610
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,670
chat history.

611
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,870
Nothing suspicious.

612
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,440
As for Professor You Yuxiang?

613
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,620
Even though the syringe in his hand
contained poison,

614
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,950
it doesn't prove he's guilty.

615
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,510
Can you stall for another half hour,

616
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,340
just to be safe?

617
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,040
Stall some more?

618
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,510
I'll say it again.

619
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,690
Give me a reason.

620
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Young people these days are so rude.

621
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,800
Do I really owe him my life?

622
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,190
A life for a life.

623
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,200
Is it worth it?

624
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,480
It's worth it.

625
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,400
You have no evidence.

626
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,290
You should let me go now.

627
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,230
Why?

628
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,960
Because in today's state
of tech advancement,

629
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,630
why should we

630
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,280
give the right of
deciding our life and death

631
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,360
to nature?

632
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,220
It doesn't make sense!

633
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,320
The reason why humans can

634
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,920
continue to develop and progress

635
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,400
generation after generation

636
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,030
is because

637
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,670
we keep defying nature.

638
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,080
[Kai, bring a few people
to the cake shop.]

639
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,360
Okay.

640
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,190
Someone must think

641
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,360
that the phrase "defying nature"

642
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,070
[Got it]

643
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,710
sounds somewhat sacrilegious.

644
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,630
It doesn't matter.

645
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,760
Let me and my team...

646
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:04,800
Wang Haoxin,

647
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,510
come up here.

648
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,030
We'll take the blame.

649
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,040
I just hope

650
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,510
that when we succeed,

651
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,920
each one of us

652
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,280
can enjoy this technological era.

653
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,320
Keep an eye on Mo Yuanzhi

654
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,800
and take him back when it's over.

655
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,530
Understood.

656
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,980
If this is considered a sacrilege,

657
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,280
then I, Mo Yuanzhi, am sacrilegious.

658
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,070
So what?

659
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,110
Bravo!

660
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,400
Nice!

661
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,280
Fang Lu.

662
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,260
What did Tang Xin do this morning?

663
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,840
She was in the experiment area
most of the time.

664
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,840
I couldn't get in.

665
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,190
Now she's having coffee with colleagues.

666
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,070
What are they talking about?

667
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,670
Just typical girl talk.

668
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,030
They seem to be discussing

669
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,880
what to wear

670
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,010
to the Zhao family's wedding tonight.

671
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,150
Who is she with?

672
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,510
I think it's someone called

673
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,840
An Lan, Assistant to the Chief Scientist.

674
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,920
What?

675
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,000
Is she also attending
the Zhao family's wedding?

676
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,230
Not just her.

677
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,800
I heard

678
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
all of Moma's executives are going.

679
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,510
Keep a close eye on An Lan.

680
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,240
Don't let her out of your sight.

681
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,190
Watch her?

682
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,000
She

683
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,840
just took over Tang Shaorong's position.

684
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,280
She might have become

685
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,150
Squid's target now.

686
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,320
Watch her carefully.

687
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,050
Understood.

688
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,510
Who exactly is Squid?

689
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,280
Why are there so many changes?
