a sense of familiarity.

531
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,920
Excuse me.

532
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,850
I'm getting off.

533
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,000
Beautiful,

534
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,490
give me your number.

535
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,360
Take a photo with me.

536
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,110
Come on.

537
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,960
No thanks.

538
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,440
Come on! It's just a photo!

539
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,300
Don't touch me!

540
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,710
What are you doing?

541
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,630
Get him!

542
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,530
Stop there!

543
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,320
Stop running!

544
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,360
Freeze!

545
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:03,750
Thank you.

546
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,240
With this power,

547
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,840
I'm sure I can make a change in the world.

548
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,760
So,

549
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,550
I want to do something more meaningful.

550
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,800
Come in.

551
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,630
Sir.

552
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,960
Intern Officer 2254,

553
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,090
reporting for duty.

554
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,110
Name?

555
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,440
Ding Qi.
