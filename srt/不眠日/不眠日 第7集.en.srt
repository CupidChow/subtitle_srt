00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,390
I've learned how to make

3
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,650
your favorite stir-fried crab noodles.

4
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,240
I tried making them the other day.

5
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,950
They were delicious.

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,860

An Lan.

12
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,030
We can't rush this.

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,470
I know your current research

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,870
is somewhat related to
your mother's condition.

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,790
I've read many

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,760
of your papers.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,150
But from my clinical experience,

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,200
miracles

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,920
don't happen that easily.

20
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,510
The results of genetic research

21
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,370
might take generations to achieve.

22
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,980
You need to face reality.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,000
I understand.

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,350
The 24-hour EEG monitoring

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,850
is really unnecessary in my opinion.

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,160
Let's change it to once every two weeks.

27
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,600
That would be easier on your mother
as well.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,590
I hope you can accept the fact that

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,470
she has long since

30
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,450
lost all higher brain function.

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
Give me more time.

32
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,170
This is what my mother would want too.

33
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,900
I know that.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,860
All right then.

why not cancel the speech?

40

There are some things that,

as long as

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm still alive,

43
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,280
must go on.

44
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,560
An executive of a company

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,520
that's seeking to go public was killed,

46
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,030
almost all the potential investors

47
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,310
pulled out overnight,

if I can still crack a joke,

52
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,960
then it shows that Moma hasn't fallen yet.

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
that all this chaos

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,480
might be a trap set by Squid to kill you,

61

in which case by insisting on
giving the speech,

62
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,870
it might end up involving
many innocent lives?

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,880
Then what should I do?

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,600
Should I just not come to the company,

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,510
hide at home,

66
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,430
and just let Moma Group collapse?

67
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,500
Is that what you suggest?

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,480
What about all those Moma employees?

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,830
Aren't they innocent too?

70
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,630

71
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,390

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,390
sometimes I died in explosions.

129

136
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,870
Why do you say that?

137
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,190
Don't you think he keeps giving

138
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,830
bizarre orders?

139
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,560
Like what?

140
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,830
Like early this morning,

141
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,360
he suddenly called an emergency meeting.

142
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,870
During my recent investigation,

143
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,810
I found someone named Ye Kun

144
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,920
who is very suspicious.

145
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,430

147
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,070
There were three Ye Kuns,

148
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,430
but he identified the right one
immediately.

149
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,030
Which one?

150
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,520
This one.

151
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,159
It's him.

152
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,050
And he even

153
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,950
pulled out a photo of Ye Kun

154
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,600
directly from his pocket.

155
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,920
Find this person for me today.

156
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,750
How did he do that?

157
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,720
Does he have a printer in his pocket,

158
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
or can he plug wires into
the back of his head?

159
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,750
Doesn't that happen all the time?

you're investigating.

Does he have that ability?

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,070
I think Ye Kun...

185
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,900
What ability?

186
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,670
Boss!

187
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,240
Have a seat.

Boss! Boss.

Boss.

191
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,720
Not inviting me to dinner is bad enough,

192
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,750
and now you even hit me?

193
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,750
I didn't mean that.

194
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,960
You walk so quietly.

195
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,620
You almost scared me to death.

196
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,870
Tell me.

197
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,140
What ability does Ye Kun have?

198
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,440
Through dreams,

199
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,010
he can predict the future.

200
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,380
That's not accurate enough.

201
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,930
He has a a supernatural power.

202
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,630
He can enter the loop.

203
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,110
That's nonsense.

204
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,360
I told you.

205
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,720
No one would believe it.

206
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,840

208
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,540
Help me look up someone named You Yuxiang.

209
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,270
He's a professor at Ivy Bay University.

210
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,130
I need details.

211
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,630
Got it.

212
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:52,840
Look.

213
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,750
Now it's You Yuxiang.

214
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,370
But every time he investigates someone,

215
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,750
there's always something off with them.

216
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,910
It's so weird.

217
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,000
Whatever.

218
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,510
I'll just look up whatever he asks for.

219
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,440
No matter what,

220
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,390
we need to stay united

221
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,550
and trust Ding Qi,

222
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,510
okay?

223
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,990
Alright. It's about time.

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,860

225
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,470
is about to start.

Let's move, everyone.

227

228
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,960
Thank you, Boss.

229
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,820
Don't touch me.

230
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,600
Take it.

231
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,360
Hello.

232
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
Could you help me access
the test site?

233
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
The test site?

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,360
Yes.

235
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,320
May I ask who you're looking for?

236
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,030
Dr. An Lan.

237
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,440
Dr. An Lan...

238
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
I don't have permission for that.

239
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,790
Please wait a moment.

240
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,320
I'll make a call to ask about it.

241
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,250

242
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,250
I'll take you there.

243
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,350
Thank you.

244
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:52,960
Officer Ding.

245
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,910
I won't go in.

246
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
Walk to the end of the corridor
and turn right,

247
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,260
and you'll find Dr. An.

248
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,750
Okay.

Qi?

252
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,470
Why are you here?

253
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,270
I'm here to see you.

254
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,930
Outsiders are not allowed in here.

255
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,560
Let's go

256
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,590
and talk outside.

257
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,510
As the CEO's assistant,

258
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,070
can't I look around?

259
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,000
How am I an outsider?

260
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,360
Do you want me to get in trouble?

261
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,950
What secrets are you hiding in this lab?

262
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,390
Besides, I wouldn't understand
anything anyway.

263
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,350
Why be so guarded against me?

264
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,830
That's exactly the point.

265
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,890
Everything here is a trade secret.

266
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,120
Alright, alright.

267
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,120
Go ahead.

268
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,890
What do you need me for?

269
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,720
Just need a brief statement.

270
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,090
Early this morning,

271
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,390
what were you doing?

272
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,520
Early this morning?

273
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,390
I was in the lab.

274
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,840
Working till that hour?

275
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,080
A special drug

276
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,030
is in the animal testing phase.

277
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,000
I encountered some problems.

278
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,720
What problems?

279
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,630
Some data

280
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,090
suddenly showed changes.

281
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,200
I can't tell you

282
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,910
the details.

283
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,480
What happened?

284
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,180
It's about awakening PVS patients,
isn't it?

285
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,790
So when did you leave the lab?

286
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,080
At 2:15.

287
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,130
And then?

288
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,540
I went to see my mother.

289
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,960
Why did you suddenly go there?

290
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Because

291
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,930
I discovered something

292
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,440
unexpected.

293
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,670
Something

294
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,420
I'd long awaited.

295
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,410
It regained mobility.

296
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,110
My mother is about to wake up.

297
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,550
My medicine is working.

298
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,510
Dr. An, why are you here?

299
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,110
My mother is about to wake up.

300
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,240
Dr. Chen.

301
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,670
Mom.

302
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,120
Mom.

303
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,320
Dr. Chen,

304
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,200
my mother's EEG

305
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,600
changed an hour ago,

306
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,840
but the change disappeared.

307
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,910
Did you notice anything before?

308
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,870
What changes?

309
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,760
We didn't notice anything.

310
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,080
An Lan.

311
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,560
Could you be mistaken?

312
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,750
I can't be.

313
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,570
Dr. Chen,

314
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,840
is it possible

315
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,750
that her brain has awakened

316
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,910
but her body hasn't?

317
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,460
Have you encountered such cases before?

318
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,150
Five years ago,

319
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,000
I did have such a patient.

320
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,560
Do you remember?

321
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,870
I do.

322
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,700
He was in great pain.

323
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,960
His consciousness was clear,

324
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,270
but his body was rigid,

325
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,210
unable to move.

326
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,510
I'm sure I can find a way

327
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,480
to awaken

328
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,440
her body too.

329
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,720
What way?

330
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,490
I can't tell you

331
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,030
about that yet.

332
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Go back now.

333
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,600
I have other things to do.

334
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,620
Maybe you should take a break.

335
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
You haven't slept since yesterday.

336
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,330
There's no time to rest.

337
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
I need to go now.

338
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,250
Where to?

339
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
Ivy Bay University.

340
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,600
You're going there too?

341
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,130
The university invited me.

342
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,600
They probably learned

343
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,860
about my appointment.

344
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,640
Who told them?

345
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,440
No idea.

346
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,380
But does it matter?

347
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,280
Since I accepted this position,

348
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,090
I have to take on

349
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,770
responsibilities

00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,670
he had two months to live,

523
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,790
which means

524
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,660
he only has one month left now.

525
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,030
A life for a life.

526
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,390
Is it worth it?

527
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,750
Where would a man

528
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,350
who isn't afraid of death go?

529
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,030
Tang Xin.

530
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,800
Pretending not to see me?

531
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,750
Mr. Han.

532
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,880
Mr. Han?

533
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,480
So formal?

534
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,100
Talk properly.

535
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,590
Yufei.

536
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,480
Why would I pretend not to know you?

537
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,350
Right.

538
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,920
You used to come to my house often
when we were kids.

539
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,790
Remember?

540
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,880
Our families used to get together
all the time.

541
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,110
And now, in the blink of an eye...

542
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,720
We've both lost our fathers.

543
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,000
Tang Xin.

544
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,110
Your father and mine
were lifelong best friends.

545
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,830
Even though our generation
hasn't had much contact,

546
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,070
now that we're both at Moma Group,

547
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,480
we should stand together.

548
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,270
There are many things

549
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,530
you don't understand.

550
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,560
During hand raising in the meeting
this morning...

551
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,510
Fang Lu.

552
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,590
Have you found You Yuxiang?

553
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,350
Not yet.

554
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,480
We'll keep looking.

555
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,080
I'll go protect Mo Yuanzhi.

556
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,640
Next,

557
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,700
I'd like to introduce a friend to you.

558
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,270
She's also an outstanding alumna

559
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,440
of our Ivy Bay University,

560
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,880
and my partner.

561
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
Please give a warm welcome to

562
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,750
the Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of Moma Biotechnology,

563
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,680
Dr. An Lan.

564
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,590
Hello everyone, I'm An Lan.

565
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,640
I'm honored to be here to share with you

566
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,970
the developments in genetic technology.

567
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,000
Are you upset

568
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,130
because I said you didn't understand?

569
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,810
I do understand.

570
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,960
Moma is like a scale.

571
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,920
Once it loses balance,

572
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,030
everything will fall into chaos.

573
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,480
We all need to pick a side.

574
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,070
Those stuck in between

575
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,480
never get their share.

576
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
I'll never be able to reach

577
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,280
the top of the core technology pyramid,

578
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,200
right?

579
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,200
Seems someone has already talked to you.

580
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,830
Tell me.

581
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,680
Which side do you want me to take?

582
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,890
Mo Yuanzhi's side.

583
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,920
I'm serious.

584
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,640
You need to side with the tech faction.

585
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,770
The technology pyramid you just mentioned,

586
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,140
you don't need to be at the top.

587
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,720
You just need

588
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,100
an access card to the base of the pyramid.

589
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,070
Thank you, everyone.

590
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,960
I'm An Lan.

591
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,960
Thank you, Dr. An Lan,
for your excellent speech.

592
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,180
Please welcome Dr. Mo Yuanzhi.

593
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,720
Now we'll open the floor for questions.

594
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,030
If you have any questions
for your senior brother,

595
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,550
feel free to speak up.

596
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,420
That young man over there.

597
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,400
Hello, Dr. Mo.

598
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,070
As far as I know,

599
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,880
RAN technology has existed
for less than 10 years.

600
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,750
By medical industry standards,

601
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,240
it hasn't been tested
for a sufficient period of time.

602
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,270
How can we be sure of its safety?

603
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,970
He asked a different question
than in the last loop.

604
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,310
As RAN technology develops,

605
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,550
will there be more and more diseases

606
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,110
that can be cured through it?

607
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,180
In that case,

608
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,270
will traditional pharmaceutical factories
go bust?

609
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,350
That's a profound question.

610
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,030
Thank you.

611
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,510
However,

612
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,510
efficacy and side effects

613
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,200
have always been contradictory.

614
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,720
This has also been a topic

615
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,790
of endless research

616
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,920
and debate in the medical field
for centuries.

617
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,480
Whether RAN technology has safety risks

618
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,070
cannot be explained in just a few words.

619
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,070
But I can assure you that

620
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,240
my team and I

621
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,960
have used

622
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,000
the world's most advanced
technical methods

623
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,720
and the most rigorous testing standards

624
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,550
to verify the safety of RAN technology.

625
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,310
So far,

626
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,110
there have been no safety issues.

627
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,150
Although Moma Biotechnology

628
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,030
hasn't detected any safety risks,

629
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,070
over the past two years,

630
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,550
many experts have

631
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,550
pointed out RAN's technical flaws.

632
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,750
But their statements
have all been suppressed.

633
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,480
Isn't that a sign
that Moma has something to hide?

634
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,000
Young man,

635
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,200
you're giving us too much credit.

636
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,750
First of all, Moma has never
suppressed

637
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,350
any expert or statement.

638
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,790
We don't have that capability.

639
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,350
Secondly,

640
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,550
those so-called "statements" you mentioned

641
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,640
seem to be just

642
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,070
your own imagination.

643
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,070
Do you have any facts to support that?

644
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,510
Or perhaps

645
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,110
you're asking questions this way

646
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,270
just to show off?

647
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,200
Are you suggesting

648
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,610
that as long as no one dies, it's safe?

649
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,000
Your question

650
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,110
is just like asking which came first,

651
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,160
the chicken or the egg.

652
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,440
Then can you talk about

653
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,920
the academic disagreements

654
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,070
between you and your mentor back then?

655
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,430
You're being a bit unreasonable,
young man.

656
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,230
But it's fine.

657
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,280
You have the right to speak freely.

658
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,270
But I believe

659
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,200
if you want to prove that RAN technology

660
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,110
is unsafe,

661
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,480
please provide data
to support your argument.

662
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,210
RAN has already gotten people killed,
hasn't it?

663
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,000
Otherwise, why would
your company's executives,

664
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Han Song and Tang Shaorong,

665
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,110
have been killed?

666
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,590
Yet you're still here joking
as if nothing happened.

667
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,750
What are you hiding?

668
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,070
Everyone, please be quiet.

669
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,830
Students.

670
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:01,690
Be quiet.

671
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,680
Be quiet!

672
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,790
Mo Yuanzhi.

673
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,310
Do you remember what this place is?

674
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,270
You know where I am,

675
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,110
Mo Yuanzhi.

676
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,410
What is this place?

677
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,110
Speak!

678
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,550
I'm not entirely sure,

679
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,000
but it might be

680
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,940
an underground laboratory.

681
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,840
Is that Mr. You?

682
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,020
Mr. You, what do you want to do?

683
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,130
Are you going to hurt this girl?

684
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,380
If you have something to ask me,

685
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:27,010
let her go,

686
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,760
and we can talk properly. Okay?

687
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,170
Talk properly?

688
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,570
Haven't you said enough already?

689
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,030
Have you had any remorse?

690
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,960
Say it out loud.

691
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,510
Where am I!

692
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,900
You're in an underground laboratory.

693
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,150
No.

694
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,420
This is where you destroyed evidence

695
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,870
and killed your mentor Jiang Yuwen.

696
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,570
Do you want to save this girl?

697
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,230
Then confess

698
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,710
all your crimes in detail!

699
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,550
Mr. You, what on earth
are you talking about?

700
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,410
What exactly are you trying to do?

701
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,170
Have you been having issues again...

702
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,360
Everyone's been saying

703
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,760
that there might be something wrong
with your brain,

704
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,280
but I've always had great respect for you.

705
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,070
Mr. You.

706
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,690
Many people here today are your students.

707
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,440
They admire and respect you,

708
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,480
including me.

709
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,550
Please don't become a murderer
right in front of us,

710
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,320
Mr. You, okay?

711
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,440
You're the murderer!

712
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,960
Still acting, huh?

713
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,400
Don't hurt that girl!

714
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,550
Fine!

715
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,320
I'm a murderer, okay?

716
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,360
I'll be whatever you say I am.

717
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,400
Let her go.

718
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,190
I'll come to you,

719
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,150
and we'll go to the police station
together.

720
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,880
Is that okay?

721
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,330
Don't move!

722
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,480
Freeze!

723
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,880
You Yuxiang!

724
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,850
Put the knife down!

725
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,800
You cops don't care
whether the hostage lives or dies, do you?

726
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,540
Put your guns down.

727
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,070
Put them down!

728
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,840
Mr. You.

729
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,590
Mr. You.

730
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,460
I don't have any weapons on me,

731
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,210
and they won't hurt you either.

732
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,060
Let's talk.

733
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,850
I think I've seen you before,

734
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,750
but I don't seem to know you.

735
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,800
Whatever you need,

736
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,230
or whatever conditions you have,

737
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,230
you can tell me.

738
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,700
Go investigate

739
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,970
Jiang Yuwen's disappearance case
from 8 years ago.

740
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,760
That wasn't a disappearance case.

741
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,030
It was a murder!

742
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,550
And the murderer is...

743
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,280
Mo Yuanzhi!

744
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,440
Mr. You,

745
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,170
I really don't understand
why you're doing this.

746
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,000
I just can't figure out

747
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,630
what benefit you'll get

748
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,280
from destroying me.

749
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,070
But if you insist on doing this,

750
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,800
Mr. You,

751
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,550
that's fine.

752
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,880
I'll fully cooperate with you.

753
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,320
Let that girl go,

754
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,280
and I'll come to you.

755
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,510
The police are right over there.

756
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,670
We can let them investigate
and find out the truth.

757
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,880
Is that okay, Mr. You?

758
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,760
You're such a hypocrite.

759
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,550
I promise you

760
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,430
I will definitely
get to the bottom of this.

761
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,570
But I need you to cooperate with me

762
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,940
and put the knife down.

763
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,400
I had a dream last night.

764
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,600
In that dream, someone asked me,

765
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,670
a life for a life,

766
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,350
is it worth it?

767
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,760
When I woke up this morning,

768
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,030
I realized

769
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,150
it's not worth it.

770
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,480
Killing Mo Yuanzhi

771
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,800
is not my goal.

772
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,840
My goal is

773
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,930
to let the whole world know about
Mo Yuanzhi's crimes!

774
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,030
If Mo Yuanzhi is guilty,

775
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,920
I'll definitely bring him to justice.

776
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,440
But Mr. You,
I need you to cooperate with me

777
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,370
so we can figure this out together.

778
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,030
This girl is innocent.

779
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,840
I believe you don't want to
hurt your own student, either,

780
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,400
do you?

781
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,400
Mr. You.

782
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,980
Put down the knife.

783
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,420
Put it down.

784
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,230
I can't give you much.

785
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,200
You'll have to
find the evidence yourself.

786
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,910
You're different from
other police officers I've met.

787
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,570
You're different.

788
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,280
I beg you.

789
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,210
I beg you!

790
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:52,960
Freeze!
