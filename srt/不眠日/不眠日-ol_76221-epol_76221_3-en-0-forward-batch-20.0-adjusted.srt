Wasn't it clear in the notice?

212
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,370
The company found
that you violated the rules.

213
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,310
We can't pay the compensation for now.

For Moma,

has achieved some success,

350
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,000
we've also offended many people.

351
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,640
To be honest,

352
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,200
it's a miracle that I'm standing here

353
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,270
and interacting with you

354
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,800
with all four limbs intact.

355
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,790
Because

356
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,590
just a few days ago,
I received a death threat.

357
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,680
It's not some prank

358
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,950
but an official death notice.

359
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,290
I was working in front of the computer,

360
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,270
when suddenly

361
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,070
a huge squid flashed onto my screen.

362
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,530
It was very scary looking.

363
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,260
It looked at me and said,

364
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,310
"I'll kill you."

365
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,030
I asked why.

366
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,900
It replied, "Uh..."

367
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,490
And then my antivirus software killed it.

368
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,320
So I thought

369
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,200
I don't have to worry

370
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,570
with such shabby skills of theirs.

371
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,830
But this matter

372
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,480
has indeed been bothering me.

373
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,350
Right that night,

374
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,550
I had a nightmare.

375
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,480
In my nightmare,

376
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,630
a bunch of squids were chasing me.

377
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,550
While chasing me, they kept yelling

378
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,830
"Yuanzhi! Yuanzhi!"

379
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,750
When I turned around,

380
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,720
they sprayed ink on my face

381
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,590
and yelled,

382
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,990
"Mo Yuanzhi! Mo Yuanzhi!"
["Mo" means ink]

383
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,350
Calm down!

384
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,410
Calm down, please!

385
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,680
What's that noise?

386
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,840
There's a group of protesters here

387
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,920
seemingly against genetic engineering.

388
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,640
Boycott Moma Biotechnology!

389
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,160
Keep them in check.

390
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,030
Don't let them in.

391
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,670
Roger!

392
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,920
Calm down!

393
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,980
Calm down, please!

394
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,230
Everyone.

395
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,880
You hear that, yeah?

396
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,270
It's so lively outside.

397
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,110
Yes.

398
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,510
I know

399
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,880
many people

400
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,440
oppose Moma

401
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,200
and our genetic research.

402
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Because they say

403
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,440
we're violating the laws of nature.

404
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,810
We won't stop those

405
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,120
who say those things.

406
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,960
They're free to go up to the mountains

407
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,510
and go down to the seas.

408
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,200
They can

409
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,160
go back to the nature they extol.

410
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
And we will

411
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,790
continue to challenge the laws of nature.

412
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,680
Why?

413
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,440
Because in today's state
of tech advancement,

414
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,110
why should we

415
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,880
give the right of
deciding our life and death

416
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,960
to nature?

417
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,700
It doesn't make sense!

418
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,270
The reason we humans can keep improving

419
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,000
for generations

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,440
is because we keep going against fate.

421
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,160
Okay.

422
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,160
Someone must think

423
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,000
that the notion of

424
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,640
going against fate sounds sacrilegious.

425
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
It doesn't matter.

426
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,680
Let me and my team

427
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,350
do this sacrilegious deed.

428
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,920
We'll take the blame.

429
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,750
I just hope

430
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,110
that when we succeed,

431
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,070
all of us

432
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,160
can experience,

433
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,640
feel, and receive

434
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,920
the medical benefits

435
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,350
in this technological era!

436
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,070
If...

437
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,480
If...

438
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,350
this is considered a sacrilege,

439
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,510
then I, Mo Yuanzhi, am sacrilegious.

440
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,400
So what?

441
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,160
Bravo!

442
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Nice!

443
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,440
Kai.

444
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,320
Watch the girl

445
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
with the bouquet.

446
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,260
Genetic engineering

447
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,700
is going against fate.

448
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,880
I believe our RAN technology

449
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,080
will someday help you

450
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,160
and all of humanity

451
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,350
to go against fate.

452
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,480
Flowers from the school council.

453
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,160
Thank you.

454
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,960
This has been your student and alumnus,

455
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,750
Mo Yuanzhi.

456
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,160
Bravo!

457
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,920
Dr. Mo.

458
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,130
These are for you.

459
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,000
Thank you.

460
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,930
Kai!

461
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,550
I just want an autograph.

462
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,160
I'm sorry.

463
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,190
It's okay.

464
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:32,790
Are you okay?

465
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,400
Yes.

466
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,790
Let me sign it for you.

467
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,240
Sorry.

468
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,400
Thank you.

469
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,110
Thank you.

470
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,270
This way.

471
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,400
Sorry.

472
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,860
This little episode

473
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,070
truly showed

474
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,610
how popular

475
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,050
Dr. Mo really is.

476
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,170
Alright.

477
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,690
Now, it's time for the Q&A.

478
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,990
Not just limited to academic questions,

479
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,240
feel free to ask anything

480
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,070
you want.

481
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,470
Alright,

482
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,680
let's get started.

483
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,170
That male student over there.

484
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:14,960
Yes.

485
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,350
Hello, Dr. Mo.

486
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,000
As RAN technology develops,

487
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
will there be more and more diseases

488
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,470
that can be cured through it?

489
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,510
In that case,

490
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,530
will traditional pharmaceutical factories
go bust?

491
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,160
Thank you for

492
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,350
your astute question.

493
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,010
Please sit.

494
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,310
Actually, I really hope RAN technology

495
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,750
will make greater contributions

496
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,920
for mankind in the future.

497
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,510
This has always been a prime goal

498
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,350
of Moma.

499
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,030
As for your second question,

500
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,290
I've thought about it.

501
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,030
In the future,

502
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,240
there might be
better and more novel technology

503
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,640
replacing RAN.

504
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,790
It's not a bad thing.

505
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,110
Being replaced

506
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,000
is a concern of every business.

507
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,480
Not being replaced is

508
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,610
the motivation for Moma to keep going.

509
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,280
That female student there.

510
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,030
Hello, Dr. Mo.

511
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,750
I'm a sophomore.

512
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,590
If I'm interested

513
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,160
in joining Moma after graduation,

514
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,090
what's the most important factor?

515
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,550
The most important factor is that...

516
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,790
when you graduate in two years,

517
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,240
Moma hasn't gone bust.

518
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,790
We value three qualities

519
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,950
when hiring:

520
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,800
confidence,

521
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,720
honesty,

522
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,070
and persistence.

523
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,350
I believe these are

524
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,080
also the qualities of science.

525
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,160
Let's barge in.

526
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,750
Go inside!

527
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,720
Hurry! Go in!

528
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,110
Mo Yuanzhi!

529
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,650
Get out, Mo Yuanzhi!

530
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,120
Boycott Mo Yuanzhi!

531
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,970
Is this what you want?

532
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,440
Protect human genes!

533
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,190
Boycott Moma Biotechnology!

534
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,480
Kai!

535
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,270
Call the car over!

536
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,880
Roger!

537
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,440
Sorry!

538
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,420
Yuanzhi.

539
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,130
It's our fault. Our security was too lax.

540
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,270
Step back!

541
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,540
Back off! Back off!

542
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,990
Back off!

543
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,830
Back off!

544
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,480
Calm down!

545
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,650
Silence! Everyone, step back!

546
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,880
Back off! Silence!

547
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,830
Mr. Mo! Mr. Mo!

548
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,350
Freeze!

549
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,350
Mr. Mo!

550
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,460
Is it wrong for me to get my money back?

551
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,670
Let go of me!

552
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,200
Freeze!

553
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,130
Step back!

554
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,900
[Boycott Moma Biotechnology]

555
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,450
Freeze!

556
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,520
Thank you.

557
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,730
Thank you.

558
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,400
Thank you.

559
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,950
Mr. Mo, please get in.

560
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,350
Follow Mo Yuanzhi.

561
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,070
I'll interrogate those two.

562
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,590
Leave it to us.

563
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,310
Yes, Boss.

564
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,530
Yay, I caught the Squid.

565
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,050
Boss caught him, no?

566
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,800
I mean I handcuffed him.

567
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,080
You get some merit too.

568
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,170
Stop bragging and get a move on.

569
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,000
What's the hurry?

570
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,880
Squid has been caught.

571
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,750
Relax.

572
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,270
Based on initial analysis,

573
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,970
the liquid in the syringe is a neurotoxin.

574
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,310
The injected will soon
die of organ failure.

575
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,960
This is an experimental drug

576
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,290
from You Yuxiang's lab.

577
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,960
You Yuxiang,

578
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,630
a lab researcher
and former associate professor

579
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,960
at Ivy Bay University.

580
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,880
You were stripped of

581
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,070
your professorship

582
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,320
after being reported

583
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,040
for attacking others online
due to academic issues.

584
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,250
Long time no see.

585
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,510
Congratulations, Mr. Zhao.

586
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,570
Congratulations.

587
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,760
Long time no see.

588
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,400
Yes.

589
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,550
Hello.

590
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,960
Congratulations.

591
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,880
Welcome.

592
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,510
You're Fu Jun,

593
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,150
a former Moma technician

594
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,670
fired three months ago,

595
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,630
and you've yet to receive compensation.

596
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,230
Right?

597
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:11,590
Yes.

598
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,440
I hate them.

599
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,670
I hate their company

600
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,130
and their top management.

601
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,230
A group of people

602
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,710
under the cloak of being scientists

603
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,110
when they're actually
bloodsucking profiteers.

604
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,440
I abhor them.

605
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,930
Why do you want to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

606
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,840
What?

607
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,070
Kill him?

608
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,440
That's not true.

609
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,770
What do you mean? What murder?

610
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,070
I was taking a syringe to the lab.

611
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,470
The crowd squeezed me in.

612
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:39,960
Once I was in,

613
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,420
-you pressed me to the ground.
-You Yuxiang!

614
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,320
We have the witness and evidence.

615
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,250
Saying all this is meaningless.

616
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,460
Did you think no one would find out
if you killed in the chaos?

617
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,280
Fine.

618
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,550
Sure. Okay.

619
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,360
Convict me.

620
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,100
Sentence me.

621
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,670
F-Finish the procedure.

622
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,480
I'm not afraid of anything.

623
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,840
Did you organize that student protest too?

624
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,840
They didn't go against the law.

625
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,480
They followed my instructions.

626
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,080
Kill me or ruin me as you wish.

627
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,970
Leave them out of it.

628
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
What did you want?

629
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,130
Your salary?

630
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,950
Officer,

631
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,880
I was at my wit's end.

632
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,820
I went to HR,

633
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,350
but they ignored me.

634
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,810
So I could only go to Mr. Mo.

635
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,870
I can no longer pay my mortgage.

636
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
My whole family depends on me.

637
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,020
I'm completely broke.

638
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,090
How many times
did you simulate the murders

639
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,690
of Han Song and Tang Shaorong?

640
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,760
Why did you

641
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,320
switch to such a direct method?

642
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,480
Why?

643
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,030
Why today?

644
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,860
When Tang Shaorong and Han Song died,

645
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,280
You Yuxiang wasn't in Hua'ao.

646
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,880
He does have an alibi.

647
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,400
Also,

648
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,630
in his house and office,

649
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,490
there's no residual reaction
from any explosives.

650
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,430
Kai.

651
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,430
Kai!

652
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,920
What's wrong, Boss?

653
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,150
Neither of them is Squid.

654
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,150
All of you,

655
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,280
protect Mo Yuanzhi!

656
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,320
Roger.

657
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,070
Roger.

658
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,540
This morning,

659
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,320
celebrity Fang Zhou appeared in a cafe

660
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,440
and was surrounded by fans,

661
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,630
resulting in a stampede.

662
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,030
The injured have been
sent to the hospital.

663
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,030
Next,

664
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,360
let's welcome the newlyweds

665
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,840
to share their sweet happiness

666
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,880
with every one of the guests here.

667
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,360
Bride and groom, please.

668
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,710
I'm here.

669
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,510
Where are you?

670
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,480
On the lawn.

671
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,400
Where is Mo Yuanzhi?

672
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,230
With us.

673
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,420
Kai!

674
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,590
Kai!

675
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,880
Kai.

676
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,070
Kai!

677
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,360
Fang Lu.

678
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,510
Fang Lu!

679
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,090
Please wait outside.

680
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:48,800
Sorry.

681
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,590
Only staff allowed.

682
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,850
You can't go in, sorry.

683
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,810
Do you regret it?

684
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,690
I told you not to come.

685
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,110
You're the one...

686
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
who insisted on bringing them here!

687
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,220
Why did you accept this mission?

688
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,510
Kai...

689
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,550
He is an only son.

690
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,190
His 70-year-old parents are
waiting at home for him.

691
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,770
Fang Lu

692
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,010
joined our team less than three years ago.

693
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,780
She's inexperienced.

694
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,680
I told you

695
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,550
to take good care of them.

696
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,360
But what have you done?

697
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,030
How will you explain to their families?

698
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,400
How will you explain to them?

699
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,630
