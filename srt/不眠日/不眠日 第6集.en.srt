Hello, Ms. Cai.

59
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,680
I signed the resignation agreement
three months ago,

60
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,920
but I still haven't received
the compensation.

I've made it very clear in the message.

64
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,190
The company found that
you had violated regulations,

65
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,830
so the compensation payment
cannot be made for now.

70
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,070
how I violated the regulations exactly.

handling the connection this time.

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,440
This morning,

176
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,750
I finalized the selection for

177
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,080
the Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of the R&D Department.

178
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,650
Who is it?

179
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,250
Who is it?

180
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,000
An Lan.

181
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,960
Today, I want you all to know that

182
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,320
for Moma,

183
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,720
the most valuable people

184
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,450
are always those
who hold the core technologies.

185
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,120
We are very sincere

186
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,180
and I hope you guys can work together.

187
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,900
After meeting the president,

188
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,360
then we shall see.

189
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,390
Cool.

190
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,150
An Lan is currently at the immigration
checkpoint picking up the investor.

191
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,240
They'll arrive here soon.

192
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Get ready immediately.

193
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,720
Around what time will they arrive?

194
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,870
They are on the highway right now,

195
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,870
so they should be here soon.

196
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,270
Hurry up.

197
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:57,670
Got it.

198
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,600
At 10:15 a.m. on December 12,

199
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,840
a multi-vehicle collision took place

200
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,770
near the M15 Junction on Highway 1.

201
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,750
Hello?

202
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,730
An Lan.

203
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,560
Where are you?

204
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,550
On my way back to the company.

205
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,150
What's your exact location?

206
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,200
M17 Junction

207
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,750
on Highway 1.

208
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,860
Have the driver change the route

209
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,190
and exit the highway early
at the M16 Exit.

210
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,240
What?

211
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,750
Trust me. Do it now.

212
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,390
Sir.

213
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,210
Please take the next exit ahead.

214
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,570
But taking this route
will add a lot of extra distance.

215
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,230
Give your phone to the driver.

216
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,970
Reroute immediately!

217
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,950
The route has been successfully
recalculated for you.

218
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,480
Who is he?

219
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,920
Just... One of my friends.

220
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,200
Excuse me.

221
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,660
Have you seen this person?

222
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,360
No.

223
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,000
Excuse me.

224
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,460
Have you seen this person?

225
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,240
No.

226
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,510
We should be able to reach

227
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,480
Moma headquarters in about 10 minutes.

228
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,550
Although we're a bit late,

229
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,320
we should still be on time.

230
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,910
Yeah.

231
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,480
What is going on over there?

232
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,720
Why are there so many people?

233
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,080
I'll go check.

234
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,700
Never seen him.

235
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,870
He looks a bit familiar.

236
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,660
Take a closer look.

237
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,270
I can't quite remember.

238
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,750
Got it.

239
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,560
Come here.

240
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,610
Do you remember him now?

241
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,780
Police, huh?

242
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,820
I remember now.

243
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,790
Ye Kun.

244
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,390
We worked as extras together
for a few days.

245
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,150
This guy

246
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,120
is good at martial arts,

247
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
so he played quite a lot of
those flying-around roles,

248
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,440
while we only got to play the roles
walking on the ground.

249
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,360
Where is he now?

250
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,510
I don't know where he is.

251
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,390
But if he's still flying through the air,

252
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,790
he must be in the studios.

253
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,750
Someone's trying to jump off
a building ahead.

254
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,350
It seems they lost heavily
in the stock market.

255
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,720
Shall we walk over?

256
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,550
Yes.

257
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,960
I still have to catch a flight
a little later this afternoon.

258
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,790
Give me one sec.

259
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,320
Okay.

260
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,960
Get ready for shooting!

261
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,290
Costume team, hurry up!

262
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,320
Do you know him?

263
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,510
Oh, Kun.

264
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,870
He's a stunt extra
from the martial arts team.

265
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,600
He's on leave today.

266
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,730
He said he was going to pick someone up.

267
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,320
Okay.

268
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,250
I'll send you the location.

269
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,810
So there's a café nearby.

270
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,470
We'll meet Mr. Mo over there.

271
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,440
He's on his way now.

272
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,320
Okay, sure.

273
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,750
Sir, we'll get off here.

274
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,820
Have you seen this person?

275
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,500
Yes.

276
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,650
He's a regular here.

277
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,180
Do you know where he lives?

278
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,270
He lives

279
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,790
in that building nearby.

280
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,790
Which building?

281
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,089
We go this way?

282
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,359
Yes, this way.

283
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,440
Qi.

284
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,160
Let's go to a café.

285
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,920
We'll meet the investors there instead.

286
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,829
Which café?

287
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,510
Not far. Super Coffee.

288
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,280
[Fang Lu, find the Super Coffee nearby,
go set up early, and stay undercover.]

289
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,550
Ye Kun is on leave today
to pick someone up,

290
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,680
but he didn't say where.

291
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,310
But I've found the area

292
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,790
where he usually hangs out.

293
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,190
I'll go look there again.

294
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,490
Why change the location?

295
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,000
They're stuck on Paris Middle Street.

296
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,930
Apparently, someone is about to
jump off a building.

297
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,550
Around 11 o'clock today,

298
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,960
someone tried to jump off the rooftop
of Yuehai Building,

299
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,490
the highest building
on Paris Middle Street.

300
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,160
The jumper has been in a standoff
with the police for hours,

301
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,350
causing major traffic jams

302
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,350
and gridlock in the nearby streets.

303
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,590
Tang Xin.

304
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,350
Let's talk.

305
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,160
Go ahead.

306
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,400
Moma is divided into two factions:

307
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
the tech faction and the finance faction.

308
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
Which one do you think you belong to?

309
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,560
I don't belong to either.

310
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,160
I don't like picking sides.

311
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,400
There's no middle ground.

312
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,920
Those stuck in between

313
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,440
never get any bread.

314
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,030
Then just take me

315
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,350
as my dad's shadow.

316
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,790
The tech faction.

317
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,880
You're just an intern,

318
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,470
a junior technician.

319
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,000
When do you think you'll be able to

320
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,800
climb to the top of the pyramid
of core technology?

321
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,310
Ms. Yu,

322
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,200
what exactly are you trying to say?

323
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,400
You're not as simple as you appear to be.

324
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,480
Although you seem like

325
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,720
an innocent little rabbit,

326
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,520
you've never stopped scouting.

327
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,690
Sniffing around, exploring,

328
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,180
always searching for someone to rely on.

329
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,300
If you haven't found that person yet,

330
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,400
come to me.

331
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,400
I really don't like picking sides.

332
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,310
And I believe

333
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,110
my dad didn't like picking sides

334
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
back when he was working in Moma, either.

335
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,430
Everyone is in their own faction,

336
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,270
and your dad was no exception.

337
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,000
You seem to be

338
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
quite close to An Lan recently.

339
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,640
But what's the use of her?

340
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,310
Although Mr. Mo gave her
some minor authority,

341
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,790
high-level tech executives
without significant shares

342
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,030
are still just employees.

343
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,030
I'm sorry, Ms. Yu.

344
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,590
An Lan and I are just colleagues,

345
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,110
merely working together.

346
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Our relationship

347
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,960
is simply that of a junior technician

348
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,160
and a senior technician.

349
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,310
Ms. Yu.

350
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,400
I've voted today.

351
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,240
It can't be changed.

352
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,920
But I don't understand

353
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,030
why you want to oppose your husband.

354
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
I'm actually just like you.

355
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,640
You came to Moma

356
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,350
to preserve your father's legacy.

357
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,010
My situation is no different.

358
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,440
Do you like the current situation?

359
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,960
You don't.

360
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,310
Neither do I.

361
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,360
But we have no choice.

362
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,920
We have to preserve our business.

363
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,440
Moma is like a weighing scale.

364
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,830
Once it's out of balance,

365
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,110
everything will be in chaos.

366
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,840
This also applies to my family.

367
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,110
So I'm not opposing Mr. Mo.

368
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,030
I'm just maintaining balance.

369
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,350
Did my action today

370
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,790
make your scale lose balance?

371
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,510
Not yet.

372
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,030
But if you stand on my side,

373
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,240
you can stand more firmly.

374
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,300
Stop trying to get credit from Mr. Mo.

375
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,980
He won't be able to give you anything.

376
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,510
You're not An Lan.

377
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,530
You're of no use to him.

378
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,820
Think about it carefully.

379
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Come over next time.

380
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,920
I'll show you around.

381
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,640
Thanks.

382
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,070
Are we there yet?

383
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,130
We're almost here.

384
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,830
This way.

385
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,310
Two Americanos.

386
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,630
Thank you.

387
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,510
What do you wanna drink?

388
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,110
I'd like a dark roast flat white with ice.

389
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,750
Okay.

390
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,960
One hot Americano, please.

391
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,490
Okay, please wait a moment.

392
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,600
Let's sit over there?

393
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,310
Okay.

394
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,790
Thank you.

395
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,370
Two Americanos.

396
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,560
Send them over there please.

397
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Mr. Mo is here.

398
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,270
Okay.

399
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,960
Mr. Mo, please allow me to introduce.

400
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,830
This is Maggie.

401
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,350
Mr. Mo.

402
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,790
Nice to meet you.

403
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,070
Nice to meet you, Maggie.

404
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,960
I'm sorry for the rush.

405
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,590
It's okay.

406
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,000
Please have a seat.

407
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,640
Okay.

408
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,830
It's our honor that Volly is interested

409
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,000
in this investment.

410
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,110
Maggie said that

411
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,310
regarding the cooperation,

412
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,310
she'd like to make a decision
after meeting you in person.

413
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,880
Okay.

414
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,860
You'll see Moma's sincerity.

415
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,490
I'm looking forward to it.

416
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,350
So let's...

417
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,880
Dark roast flat white with ice.

418
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,440
Thank you.

419
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,350
Your Americano.

420
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,950
Thank you.

421
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,750
Sir,

422
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,350
would you like anything else?

423
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,610
Not for now. Thank you.

424
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,000
Now, let's talk about the details.

425
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay.

426
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,240
Volly is willing to sign

427
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,790
a bet agreement with Moma,

428
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,440
with the investment amount
about $200 million.

429
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,240
According to the bet agreement,

430
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,350
if Moma's performance grew
by more than 50%

431
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,680
in the first three years
after receiving the investment...

432
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,620
Boss, the one in red
is the celebrity, Fang Zhou.

433
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,270
This morning,

434
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,960
celebrity Fang Zhou appeared at a café

435
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,070
and was surrounded by fans,

436
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,310
causing a stampede at the scene.

437
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,710
The injured have been sent
to the hospital.

438
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,640
Mr. Mo.

439
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560
Can we go somewhere else?

440
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,330
Put on your mask.

441
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,670
Fang Zhou!

442
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,590
Fang Zhou!

443
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,070
Sign for me, Fang Zhou!

444
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,920
Fang Zhou, give me your signature!

445
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,120
Keep it down, please!

446
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,830
Don't push!

447
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,510
Fang Zhou, look at me!

448
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,110
Fang Zhou, I love you!

449
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,810
Please keep it down!

450
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,590
One by one!

451
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,680
Fire!

452
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,880
This place is on fire!

453
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,070
Move!

454
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,480
Make way!

455
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,070
Make way!

456
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,480
Move!

457
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,710
Duck down and bend over
as you head outside!

458
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,710
Duck down and bend over! Be careful!

459
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,550
Go!

460
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,680
Go!

461
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,920
Watch your head!

462
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,590
Go!

463
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,500
Stop there!

464
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,200
Make way! Make way!

465
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,830
Move!

466
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,750
Move!

467
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,580
Move aside!

468
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,160
Make way!

469
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,790
Watch out!

470
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,320
Are you okay?

471
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,270
What happened?

472
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,600
Go support Boss! Hurry!

473
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,510
Move! Move!

474
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,200
Afraid of death?

475
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,400
Of course.

476
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,080
Who doesn't fear death?

477
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,000
People like us don't fear death.

478
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,720
What do you mean?

479
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,690
Don't move!

480
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,100
He's not a time loop perceiver.

481
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,050
Where's your phone?

482
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,640
Boss.

483
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,510
Why did you shoot?

484
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,750
In five minutes,

485
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,510
take him past

486
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,680
Mo Yuanzhi.

487
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,880
Make sure Mo Yuanzhi sees him.

488
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,850
In five minutes.

489
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,270
How do you feel?

490
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,750
Not that bad.

491
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,880
I still can move.

492
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,960
Which area?

493
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,550
The ankle.

494
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,590
The ankle.

495
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,750
How are you?

496
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,550
Are you hurt?

497
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,680
Thank you for saving me.

498
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,350
You're welcome. It's what I should do.

499
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,410
I'll remember you.

500
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,410
I'd like to be friends with you.

501
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,440
Ms. An, I think I saved you too.

502
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,110
Do you want to

503
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,440
be friends with me too?

504
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,790
I'll remember you too.

505
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,110
Thank you.

506
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
How did you know about the accident?

507
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,960
Maggie.

508
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,310
If you feel okay,

509
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,440
I have a suggestion.

510
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,510
You could say
we've been through hardships together.

511
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,400
How about we finish

512
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,330
our discussion?

513
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,680
What I'm about to say
is from the bottom of my heart.

514
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,960
Qi is here.

515
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,240
I won't lie in front of the police.

516
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,590
Moma's current financial situation
is very poor.

517
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,590
You know that.

518
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,460
Within a month,

519
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,790
two of our executives were killed
one after another.

520
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,580
The reason behind it is very ironic.

521
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,640
All just because
we encroached on someone else's turf.

522
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,830
Once the research on
the RAN gene-based drug

523
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,880
succeeds,

524
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,590
at least more than half of
the traditional pharmaceutical companies

525
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,350
will be affected.

526
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,920
So,

527
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,920
they don't want Moma to survive.

528
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,030
They don't want me to survive, either.

529
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,750
But it's precisely
because of their actions

530
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,510
that I realized

531
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,920
how outstanding our RAN technology is.

532
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,030
But as long as Moma survives,

533
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,590
the research on gene-based drugs

534
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,000
will definitely succeed.

535
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,750
RAN-X's development

536
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,350
has reached the final stage.

537
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,720
Volly will be the biggest winner.

538
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,440
No matter what,

539
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,680
I will lead the team

540
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,200
to continue the research.

541
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,240
Volly stepped in
during our time of crisis.

542
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,310
We'll definitely honor our promise.

543
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Whether you

544
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,190
want to invest or not

545
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,710
will test both your judgment

546
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,840
and your courage.

547
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,840
Okay.

548
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,230
I'll report to the headquarters

549
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,190
and give you an answer
as soon as possible.

550
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,920
Okay.

551
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,030
Is he Squid?

552
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,320
We don't know yet.

553
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,739
Do you know him?

554
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,150
Do they really not know Ye Kun,

555
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,030
or

556
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,740
is there a skilled performer
hidden in here?

557
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,360
Sorry, Officer Ding.

558
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,360
I need to leave the country immediately

559
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,670
to catch the afternoon flight
from Xinggang to New York.

560
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,190
If you need my cooperation with anything,

561
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,440
you can contact me via email

562
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,880
or video call.

563
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,670
Okay.

564
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,590
I'll get someone to give you a ride.

565
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,590
Thank you so much.

566
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,220
Give her a ride.

567
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,510
As for this investment,

568
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,320
I'm very optimistic.

569
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
I'll give you an answer
as soon as possible.

570
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,920
I'll wait for your good news.

571
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,920
He's cute.

572
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,080
Take care.

573
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,320
You too.

574
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,520
After midnight,

575
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,920
you'll still return to Hua'ao.

576
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
What's your name?

577
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,050
Can't you understand Cantonese?

578
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,880
What's your name?

579
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,710
Speak.

580
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,840
Okay.

581
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,280
There are surveillance cameras
all around the square.

582
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,880
I don't need your testimony.

583
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,440
I didn't do anything.

584
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,770
You didn't do anything?

585
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,470
Then who threw the smoke bomb?

586
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,430
What smoke bomb?

587
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,400
Fine.

588
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,750
If you don't admit it,

589
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,590
I'll show you
the surveillance footage later.

590
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,760
It wasn't me who threw it anyway.

591
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,890
Then why did you run?

592
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,030
He chased me. Of course I had to run.

593
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,960
I didn't know who he was.

594
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,360
I had told you we're the police,
yet you kept running.

595
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,820
The police even shot at me?

596
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,670
He also said that
people like us aren't afraid of death.

597
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,400
Don't talk nonsense!

598
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,320
I'm not.

599
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,600
What does "people like us" mean?

600
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,630
What does "people like us" refer to?

601
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,030
I have my own difficulties.

602
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,110
Besides,

603
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,510
was it really necessary

604
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,510
for you to write to Mr. Mo about this?

605
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,190
Watch where you're going!

606
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,440
If you have a death wish,
stay away from me!

607
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,280
How could you be so careless?

608
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,190
I'm sorry.

609
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,670
Fortunately, the incident

610
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,590
didn't cause serious casualties.

611
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,400
According to statistics,

612
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,460
all those sent to the hospital so far
have only sustained minor injuries.

613
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:42,910
[News Information]

614
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:47,430
[The lecture at Ivy Bay University
this afternoon may be postponed.]

615
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,870
I know you have questions to ask.

616
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,400
Go ahead.

617
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,880
Do you think Squid's motive for murder

618
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,250
was really business competition?

619
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,400
First it was Han, then Tang.

620
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,090
And now it's my turn.

621
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,800
Obviously,

622
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,680
Squid just wants
to destroy Moma Technology.

623
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,160
Isn't that motive clear enough?

624
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,760
Then why did you suddenly reach out to

625
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,710
Volly Group

626
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,440
and Maggie?

627
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,480
I met Maggie

628
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,670
when I was an exchange student

629
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,590
in the U.S.

630
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,800
After graduation,

631
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,550
she joined Volly.

632
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,550
She told me a long time ago

633
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,750
that she wanted Volly to invest in Moma.

634
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,510
But to be honest,

635
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,510
at that time

636
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,030
I didn't have a say.

637
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,030
And at that time,

638
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,510
Moma didn't need Volly.

639
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,100
These past few days...

640
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,040
It's okay.

641
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,110
Tell Qi the truth.

642
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,510
At this point,

643
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,260
we don't deserve to
keep any secrets anymore.

644
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,510
During this period,

645
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,970
which is after
the executives' murder cases,

646
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,300
I got in contact with Maggie again

647
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,400
according to Mr. Mo's instructions.

648
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,760
I didn't expect that

649
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,550
Volly's interest in investing in Moma

650
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,670
actually increased instead of decreasing.

651
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,670
Early this morning,

652
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,710
Maggie texted me.

653
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,000
She said

654
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,230
she was in Xinggang,

655
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,360
and she was willing to come to Hua'ao

656
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,760
to visit Mr. Mo in person.

657
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,610
Early this morning?

658
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,070
When exactly?

659
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,880
At 0:15 a.m.

660
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,510
Maggie is actually the first person
to break the loop.

661
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,320
An Lan.

662
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,960
Have you got the materials
that Volly requested ready?

663
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,620
Right away.

664
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,190
Okay.

665
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,920
How is it?

666
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,880
There seems to be nothing off
with this Maggie.

667
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,480
Her identity seems genuine.

668
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,630
There are two and a half hours

669
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,400
until the university lecture.

670
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,030
I'm in the open,

671
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,250
while Squid is in the shadows.

672
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,000
In the first four loops,

673
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,800
nothing counts.

674
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,640
He could simply obstruct my sight,

675
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,150
making it impossible for me
to judge the direction

676
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,480
from which danger comes in the final loop.

677
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,710
Who exactly is he?
