the chief scientist position,

171

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,670
I want

181
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,000
you to step up.

182
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,270
You think I can do it?

183
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,190
Just tell me your honest thoughts.

184
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,750
I do have such ambition,

185
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,320
but now...

186
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,030
I was afraid you

187
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,560
didn't have such ambition.

188
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,090
It's good that you do.

189
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,070
To be honest...

190
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,080
I might not have much time left.

191
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,580
Han and Tang are both gone.

192
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,960
At any moment, I could also...

193
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,960
Also what?

194
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,720
Nothing.

195
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,140
It doesn't matter.

196
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,150
Even the Moma Group doesn't matter.

197
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,550
Even if all these buildings

198
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,790
were razed to the ground before my eyes,

199
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,390
I wouldn't feel a thing.

200
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,160
But the genetic research cannot stop.

201
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,180
Only you would understand

202
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,410
what I'm feeling.

203
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,720
From the first day

204
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
you walked into my office,

205
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,550
I knew

206
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,450
we were the same kind of people.

207
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,080
No matter how much profit

208
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,550
genetic research brings,

209
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,390
we are scientists first.

210
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,510
I was thinking...

211
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,630
If I appoint you directly
as chief scientist,

212
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,910
people might not accept it.

213
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,790
It's better to leave that position
vacant for now.

214
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,120
I'll temporarily appoint you as

215
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,150
Assistant to the Chief Scientist.

216
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,120
This way, the entire research team

217
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,650
will be under your control.

218
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
If that works for you,

219
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,630
I'll announce your appointment

220
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,890
at the upcoming shareholders' meeting,

221
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,240
Will the shareholders agree?

222
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
I'll handle them.

223
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,830
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Mo.

224
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,870
I'll work hard on my research.

225
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,600
I believe in you.

226
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:36,930
Let's go.

227
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,200
An Lan.

228
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,840
Come in during the second half

229
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,720
of the meeting.

230
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,740
Wait for me in the rest area.

231
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,650
A multi-vehicle collision occurred

232
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,480
at M15 Junction

233
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,150
near Highway 1,

234
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,720
resulting in three deaths

235
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,960
and many seriously injured.

236
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,550
Currently,

237
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,600
paramedics have rushed to the scene

238
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,670
for rescue.

239
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,550
Do you know Mr. Mo's wife?

240
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,030
Mrs. Mo rarely comes to the company.

241
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,360
She only appears

242
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,320
during shareholder meetings.

243
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,660
How's their relationship?

244
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,860
How would I know that?

245
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,790
That's between them as a couple.

246
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,440
Police.

247
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,830
Temporarily relinquish
control of the group?

248
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,980
What exactly are you all suggesting?

249
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,560
Mr. Mo, you're currently

250
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,400
facing death threats.

251
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,160
This is not only for

252
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,420
the company's future.

253
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,960
It's also for

254
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,610
your personal safety.

255
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,200
If you choose to

256
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,790
temporarily step down
from managing the company now,

257
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,640
perhaps

258
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,350
Squid will spare you too.

259
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,070
But I have two questions.

260
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,640
First,

261
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,350
how long is "temporarily?"

262
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,000
Second,

263
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,400
if I step down,

264
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,200
who will take over
the company's daily operations?

265
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,680
You?

266
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,820
That's not your concern anymore.

267
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,990
When the time comes,

268
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,550
the general shareholders' meeting

269
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,880
will elect someone new.

270
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,550
But whether

271
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,750
to terminate your management rights
over the group or not

272
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,200
can be voted on today.

273
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,960
You inherited shares,

274
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,550
not the position.

275
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,480
You're sitting in

276
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,510
your father's office

277
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,750
and attending this

278
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,680
internal management meeting

279
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,110
because I respected
your father Han Song,

280
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,510
not you.

281
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,130
Since I've inherited the shares,

282
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,930
I have the right to vote.

283
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,790
I approve of

284
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,200
removing Mo Yuanzhi's

285
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,160
management rights at Moma Biotechnology.

286
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,590
My vote

287
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,670
represents my father.

288
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,680
Actually, I can give up

289
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,280
all the business interests.

290
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,750
But I don't want to lose you.

291
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,920
I want you to be safe.

292
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,260
What they just said

293
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,380
makes some sense.

294
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,790
This is only temporary.

295
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,200
It's not forever.

296
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,160
Yuanzhi.

297
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,590
I believe that someday,

298
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,550
you will

299
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,270
thank me for this.

300
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,750
My father spent

301
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,880
his entire life dedicated to research.

302
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,400
Moma's genetic research

303
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,550
was more important to him than his life.

304
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,440
I believe

305
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,470
if he were here today,

306
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,850
he would want
Moma Biotechnology's authority

307
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,910
to be in the hands of someone
who understands research.

308
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,030
Therefore,

309
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,680
I vote for Mr. Mo.

310
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,590
The voting is over.

311
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,680
But don't forget

312
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,110
I also have a vote myself.

313
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,590
If I'm not mistaken,

314
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,510
whether by vote count or share percentage,

315
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,550
I will continue to be in charge of Moma.

316
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,170
I have an announcement.

317
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,000
This morning,

318
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,350
I finalized the selection for

319
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,680
the Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of the R&D Department.

320
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,550
Who is it?

321
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,240
Who is it?

322
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,530
An Lan.

323
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,000
See?

324
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,030
Mo Yuanzhi

325
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,160
just keeps appointing his own people.

326
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,510
These researchers...

327
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,060
Who knows what they're doing all day.

328
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,110
An Lan has only been with
the company for a short while.

329
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,920
Moma itself has only been established
for a few years.

330
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,750
Let's not forget

331
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,070
we are a biotech R&D company.

332
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,160
Without the dedication
of our R&D Department,

333
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,830
what would our future depend on?

334
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,630
Today, I want you all to know that

335
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,070
for Moma,

336
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,790
the most valuable assets
will always be those

337
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,720
who master our core technologies.

338
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,170
So that's how the glass broke.

339
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,970
According to company bylaws,

340
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,110
I hereby officially appoint

341
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,200
An Lan

342
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,350
as Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of the R&D Department.

343
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,310
Until a Chief Scientist is appointed,

344
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,550
she will temporarily oversee
the R&D Department's daily operations.

345
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,270
Mr. Mo,

346
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,150
may I say a few words?

347
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,720
Thank you to the company and Mr. Mo

348
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,240
for entrusting me
with such an important position.

349
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,680
I understand the significance of this role

350
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,350
and I'm well aware

351
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,880
that accepting this position

352
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,220
during this critical time

353
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,440
means stepping up
in a challenging situation.

354
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,550
Since I dare to accept it,

355
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,510
I dare to take responsibility.

356
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,640
I promise you

357
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,960
that since Ms. Tang and Mr. Mo
haven't been afraid,

358
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,620
then I won't be afraid either.

359
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,350
I sincerely hope

360
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,960
to gain everyone's support,

361
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,440
so that Moma Group's research work

362
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,900
can get back on track soon.

363
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,590
I believe

364
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,800
this is what
everyone wants to see as well.

365
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,160
If no one has any other objections,

366
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,690
we can conclude this topic.

367
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,310
An Lan,

368
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,240
go to the R&D Department
and make preparations.

369
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,070
Regarding the position transfer,

370
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,680
I'll have HR handle it
as soon as possible.

371
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,240
Okay.

372
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,710
I have nothing else to discuss.

373
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,400
Then,

374
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,510
meeting adjourned.

375
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,170
Dismissed.

376
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,550
Boss,

377
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,110
there's a traffic jam ahead.

378
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,570
We can't pass through now.

379
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,680
We can't be late.

380
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,160
Let's take another route.

381
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,890
Got it, Boss.

382
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,070
Around 11 o'clock today,

383
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,510
someone tried to jump from

384
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,590
the top floor of Yuehai Building,

385
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,880
the tallest building
on Paris Middle Street.

386
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,400
The jumper was in a standoff
with the police for hours,

387
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,480
causing large-scale congestion.

388
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Currently, the jumper has been rescued
by the police.

389
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,400
Hello.

390
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,320
Hi there.

391
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,460
Let's go inside.

392
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,090
Let's talk inside.

393
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,540
See you in a bit.

394
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,510
You promised me

395
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,830
that the shareholder meeting
would go perfectly,

396
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,660
which is why I agreed to take the risk.

397
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,720
But what happened?

398
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,030
If you had worked with me,

399
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,690
it would have been foolproof.

400
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,880
I'm worried that Yuanzhi

401
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,000
is getting suspicious of me.

402
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,070
So what?

403
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,000
If Mo Yuanzhi

404
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,350
doesn't let go of Moma,

405
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,570
Squid will make a move against him.

406
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,420
What's your relationship

407
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,920
with Moma?

408
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,110
I used to work

409
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,550
in their technical department.

410
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,480
But three months ago,

411
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,400
I quit.

412
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,310
Do I still need to be questioned?

413
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,830
I've already left the company.

414
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,400
Well,

415
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,750
what's your attitude toward them?

416
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,920
Attitude?

417
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,480
The power at Moma

418
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,070
is in the hands of those researchers.

419
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,270
How could it come down to us?

420
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,030
That's why

421
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,270
we need to figure out

422
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,830
what exactly they're researching.

423
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,760
I just went there to ask for my money

424
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,590
and you brought me here instead.

425
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,510
They owe me money.

426
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,910
Is it wrong to ask
for what's mine, officer?

427
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,610
Officer, I need to take this call.

428
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,510
-It's a client.
-Sit down!

429
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:16,960
The client is urging...

430
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,510
Sit down!

431
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,470
You wouldn't want your husband

432
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,530
to end up like my father and Ms. Tang,

433
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,170
and give up his life, would you?

434
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,070
I'm just a delivery guy.

435
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,590
I only make a few yuan per order,

436
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,720
but if I'm late by a few minutes,

437
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,520
I have to pay a 100-yuan penalty.

438
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,790
A few minutes

439
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,120
don't affect you at all.

440
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,350
But people will still report me.

441
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,680
One hundred yuan

442
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,490
might not mean much to you,

443
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,680
but 100 yuan

444
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,270
is money for a whole day's worth of food
for my family,

445
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,030
Officer.

446
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,750
So,

447
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,030
you hate Moma

448
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,510
because they didn't pay you,

449
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,140
so you want to
kill their CEO Mo Yuanzhi,

450
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,700
right?

451
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,270
Why would I kill anyone?

452
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,920
Officer,

453
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,240
I didn't do it!

454
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,880
I need money.

455
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,110
I went there

456
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,200
to confront them.

457
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,110
I went to Moma

458
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,200
to make them give me the severance pay

459
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,350
that I deserve!

460
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,480
I just want them to give me the money.

461
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
That's it!

462
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,000
If he died, who would pay me?

463
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,830
I didn't do it.

464
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,310
Don't wrongfully accuse me,

465
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,110
Officer.

466
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,590
Your delivery order has timed out.

467
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,340
I'll say it again.

468
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,980
If there's any danger,

469
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,000
don't get others involved.

470
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,510
I know why you agreed.

471
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,030
If you protect me too well,

472
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,930
Squid will never appear again.

473
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,310
Then you'll have to

474
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,770
keep guarding me forever.

475
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,200
You and your team

476
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,530
are already exhausted.

477

To be honest,

478
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,060
I'm exhausted too.

Hello, Qi.

That delivery guy

486
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,550
didn't do anything.

487
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,030
What basis did you arrest him on?

488
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,560
You need to give me a reason.

489
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,810
I really can't figure out
who's in charge here.

490
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,200
You've probably seen the news lately.

491

Yes.

has achieved some success,

494
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,200
we've also offended many people.

495
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,790
To be honest,

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,000
I received a death threat.

501
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,960
Keep an eye on Mo Yuanzhi.

502

Understood.

503
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,640
It wasn't some prank.

504
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,780
It was a very formal death threat.

00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,200
Like him,

523
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,680
I'm also a biologist.

524
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,920
But my control of time

525
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,110
is far inferior to his.

526
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,350
So how do you want to...

527
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,360
How do you want to control time?

528
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,920
Lyubishchev

529
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,630
could very clearly record

530
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,710
the time he spent on each activity,

531
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,420
so he could cherish
every minute and second.

532
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,280
Therefore, his time

533
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,550
could be doubled.

534
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,360
But I can't.

535
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Isn't that a pity?

536
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,520
What's the benefit of doubling your time?

537
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,840
With doubled time, you can do

538
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,550
many meaningful things.

539
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,790
Like what?

540
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,230
Like...

541
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,710
I have to go.

542
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,040
What do you want?

543
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,030
Mr. You.

544
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,360
A life for a life.

545
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,760
Is it worth it?

546
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,280
What do you mean?

547
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,510
Suddenly, a huge squid

548
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,670
appeared on my screen.

549
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,130
It was very scary looking.

550
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,920
It looked at me and said,

551
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,800
"I'll kill you."

552
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,070
I asked why.

553
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,050
It replied, "Uh..."

554
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,710
Then it was

555
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,570
killed by my antivirus software.

556
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,370
Why do you want to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

557
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,100
Have we

558
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,960
met somewhere before?

559
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,590
Take him away.

560
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,720
In this loop,

561
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,800
I've already changed too much.

562
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,800
But I must

563
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,530
restrain Fu Jun and You Yuxiang

564
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,120
to make the real Squid

565
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,180
show itself.

566
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,550
Who reported me?

567
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,370
Nobody reported me, right?

568
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,800
Why aren't you saying anything?

569
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,330
What is all this?

570
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,150
Yes.

571
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,710
I know.

572
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,230
Many people oppose Moma.

573
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,000
How are things outside?

574
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,460
And our genetic research.

575
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,280
There was a small group

576
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,000
of protesters with banners earlier.

577
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,960
They've all left now.

578
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,590
They think we've violated
the laws of nature.

579
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,760
Can someone explain to me

580
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,290
what the laws of nature are?

581
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,550
The sun sets

582
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,840
and it gets dark.

583
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,110
So naturally, we should go to sleep,

584
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,630
right?

585
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,520
Then why did we invent lights

586
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,440
and the TV?

587
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,670
Why do we stay up late?

588
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,220
How unnatural is that?

589
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,070
The sun rises

590
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,960
and it gets bright.

591
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,280
So naturally, we should get up,

592
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,960
right?

593
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:20,960
Right?

594
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Is my lecture boring?

595
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,630
Look at you.

596
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,590
I stayed up late last night.

597
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,520
What did you say?

598
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,000
You stayed up late last night?

599
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,030
Are you crazy?

600
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,480
Do you not want to be natural?

601
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,440
You're not following the law,

602
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,920
are you?

603
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,710
Is that so?

604
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,040
Boss.

605
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,670
Qi,

606
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,510
the delivery guy

607
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,110
really doesn't have

608
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,770
any motive to kill Mo Yuanzhi.

609
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,000
I've checked all of his

610
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,670
chat history.

611
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,870
Nothing suspicious.

612
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,440
As for Professor You Yuxiang?

613
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,620
Even though the syringe in his hand
contained poison,

614
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,950
it doesn't prove he's guilty.

615
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,510
Can you stall for another half hour,

616
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,340
just to be safe?

617
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,040
Stall some more?

618
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,510
I'll say it again.

619
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,690
Give me a reason.

620
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Young people these days are so rude.

621
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,800
Do I really owe him my life?

622
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,190
A life for a life.

623
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,200
Is it worth it?

624
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,480
It's worth it.

625
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,400
You have no evidence.

626
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,290
You should let me go now.

627
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,230
Why?

628
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,960
Because in today's state
of tech advancement,

629
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,630
why should we

630
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,280
give the right of
deciding our life and death

631
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,360
to nature?

632
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,220
It doesn't make sense!

633
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,320
The reason why humans can

634
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,920
continue to develop and progress

635
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,400
generation after generation

636
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,030
is because

637
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,670
we keep defying nature.

638
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
[Kai, bring a few people
to the cake shop.]

639
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,360
Okay.

640
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,190
Someone must think

641
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,360
that the phrase "defying nature"

642
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,070
[Got it]

643
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,710
sounds somewhat sacrilegious.

644
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,630
It doesn't matter.

645
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,760
Let me and my team...

646
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,800
Wang Haoxin,

647
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,510
come up here.

648
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,030
We'll take the blame.

649
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,040
I just hope

650
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,510
that when we succeed,

651
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,920
each one of us

652
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,280
can enjoy this technological era.

653
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,320
Keep an eye on Mo Yuanzhi

654
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,800
and take him back when it's over.

655
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,530
Understood.

656
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,980
If this is considered a sacrilege,

657
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,280
then I, Mo Yuanzhi, am sacrilegious.

658
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,070
So what?

659
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,110
Bravo!

660
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,400
Nice!

661
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,280
Fang Lu.

662
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,260
What did Tang Xin do this morning?

663
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,840
She was in the experiment area
most of the time.

664
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
I couldn't get in.

665
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,190
Now she's having coffee with colleagues.

666
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,070
What are they talking about?

667
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,670
Just typical girl talk.

668
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,030
They seem to be discussing

669
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,880
what to wear

670
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,010
to the Zhao family's wedding tonight.

671
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,150
Who is she with?

672
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,510
I think it's someone called

673
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,840
An Lan, Assistant to the Chief Scientist.

674
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,920
What?

675
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,000
Is she also attending
the Zhao family's wedding?

676
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,230
Not just her.

677
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,800
I heard

678
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
all of Moma's executives are going.

679
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,510
Keep a close eye on An Lan.

680
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,240
Don't let her out of your sight.

681
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,190
Watch her?

682
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,000
She

683
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,840
just took over Tang Shaorong's position.

684
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,280
She might have become

685
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,150
Squid's target now.

686
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,320
Watch her carefully.

687
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,050
Understood.

688
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,510
Who exactly is Squid?

689
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,280
Why are there so many changes?
