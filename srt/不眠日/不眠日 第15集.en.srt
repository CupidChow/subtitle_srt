the space-time we exist in has changed.

175
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,430
But my father meant well.

176
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,820
He wanted to save lives.

177
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,580
Really?

178
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,520
Did he want to save lives

179
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,360
or did he want to experiment
on living patients?

180
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,850
In her final moments,

181
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,700
Wanqing suffered five times the agony.

182
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,620
Was she saved?

183
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,869
Mo Yuanzhi.

184
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,109
It's not about your Wanqing.

185
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,349
You just want Moma all to yourself!

186
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,740
Don't try to cover up

187
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,270
your disgusting behavior.

188
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,190
Then,

189
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,300
how noble do you think

190
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,500
your dear father is?

191
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,260
Do you know

192
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
that to steal my RAN data,

193
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,460
he planned that explosion

194
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,830
which killed so many...

195
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,350
No, wait.

196
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,990
That never happened in the end.

197
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,680
Let me tell you something.

198
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,910
The reason I've been looking
for Jiang Yuwen

199
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,190
is because I want

200
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,590
the portion of RAN data

201
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,950
he took away back then.

202
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,780
Because

203
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,390
I need to save Wanqing.

204
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,430
I need to find a way to save her.

205
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,300
I'll kill

206
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
whoever stops me.

207
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,870
Han Song.

208
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,250
Tang Shaorong.

209
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,430
Han Yufei.

210
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,630
And you.

211
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,350
If you kill me,

212
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,070
my father will never let you go.

213
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,980
Let me put it this way.

214
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,460
The reason I'm telling you all this

215
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,300
is because

216
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,840
I want to express my apologies.

217
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,140
Sorry, Maggie.

218
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,770
You're actually quite innocent.

219
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,150
If you want to blame someone,

220
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,610
blame yourself
for not having a good father.

221
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,500
Mo Yuanzhi!

222
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,500
I can't believe Jiang Yuwen's side effect

223
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,460
is rapid aging.

224
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,260
Wanqing,

225
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,360
as long as I get

226
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,260
Jiang Yuwen's other half
of the RAN data today,

227
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,970
I can immediately create a new drug

228
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,300
to stop my side effects.

229
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,060
At the same time,

230
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,630
it can also save your life.

231
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,780
Wanqing,

232
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,780
do you see?

233
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,700
Even heaven is on our side.

234
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,920
Maggie!

235
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,150
Maggie!

236
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,120
Don't go in there.

237
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,100
Don't trigger the self-destruct mechanism.

238
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,940
What are you mixing there?

239
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,940
Aqua regia.

240
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,420
That's reverse aqua regia.

241
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,320
What's reverse aqua regia?

242
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,260
You got it mixed up.

243
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,780
Here.

244
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,320
Show him how it's done.

245
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,400
Three parts
concentrated hydrochloric acid.

246
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,670
One part concentrated nitric acid.

247
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,300
That's it.

248
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,600
It can be used to dissolve metals.

249
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,540
[Hydrochloric acid]

250
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,060
[Nitric acid]

251
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,960
[Jiang Yuwen,
I have both of your daughters.]

252
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,190
The transfer must be done today.

253
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,220
Maggie.

254
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,350
Maggie!

255
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,020
Maggie.

256
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:16,910
Maggie!

257
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,220
Wake up!

258
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,950
Maggie!

259
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,930
Everyone, go home.

260
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,520
Now?

261
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,070
What?

262
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,910
Go home.

263
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,310
Hello?

264
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,350
Boss,

265
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,760
I found Jiang Yuwen.

266
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,610
I sent the photo to your phone.

267
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,460
Maggie.

268
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,560
Maggie.

269
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,210
Look at me.

270
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,700
Where is Jiang Yuwen?

271
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,310
Boss.

272
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,280
Mo Yuanzhi kidnapped Maggie,

273
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,680
but I've rescued her now.

274
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,750
What about Tang Xin and Han Yufei?

275
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,080
Haven't found them yet.

276
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,540
I suspect they've

277
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,470
also been kidnapped by Mo Yuanzhi.

278
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,430
Peishan.

279
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,020
Track Mo Yuanzhi's location.

280
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,460
Wang Haoxin, go find Jiang Yuwen.

281
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,710
I've sent you the address.

282
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,430
Everyone else,

283
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,100
come search Moma Building immediately.

284
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Copy that.

285
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,500
Mo Yuanzhi!

286
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,900
What are you doing?

287
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,590
Get lost!

288
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,250
Mo Yuanzhi has escaped.

289
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:01,990
His own car,

290
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,950
a black Alphard.

291
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,310
Look at this route here.

292
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,980
Pull up the previous one.

293
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:07,690
Right.

294
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,520
Around here.

295
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,500
Pay close attention to this area.

296
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,270
Be careful.

297
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,060
Watch this spot.

298
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,540
Okay?

299
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,660
Pull up those two previous feeds as well.

300
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,060
Got it.

301
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,310
Look here.

302
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,160
Yes.

303
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,220
Make it bigger.

304
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:24,910
Enlarge this.

305
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,110
Stop. Pause. Zoom in.

306
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,920
Here?

307
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,950
Yes, right there.

308
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,710
I see Mo Yuanzhi
heading toward the checkpoint.

309
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,310
Got it.

310
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,710
Boss,

311
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,670
I think you need to see this.

312
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,470
Mo Yuanzhi must be
going after Jiang Yuwen,

313
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,200
but Jiang Yuwen has a bomb.

314
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,100
Alright,

315
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,830
you go find Tang Xin and Han Yufei.

316
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,750
I'll go after Mo Yuanzhi.

317
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,230
Okay.

318
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,740
Are you feeling okay?

319
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,140
Have some water.

320
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,920
Don't move.

321
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:27,650
Open the door.

322
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,520
Where's Mo Yuanzhi?

323
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,840
Boss got out in the parking garage.

324
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,000
Stop the car.

325
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,900
I need to get something.

326
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,790
You go to the checkpoint first.

327
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,840
I'll message you later.

328
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,590
Got it, Boss.

329
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,830
Boss,

330
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,390
Mo Yuanzhi got out in the parking garage.

331
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,980
What?

332
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,110
[Duan Zheng]

333
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,280
Hey, Qi.

334

Boss.

335
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,270
Kai said

336
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,460
Mo Yuanzhi hasn't left.

337
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,790
Lock down the Moma Building immediately!

338
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,350
Got it.

00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,310

340

00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,420
take your team over there.

Copy that.

What's happening with all these police?

345
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,670
