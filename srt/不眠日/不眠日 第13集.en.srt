then please make one

120
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,870

122
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,200
Okay.

123
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,360
You used the time loops

124
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,180
to map out Tang Shaorong's route

125
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,940
and orchestrated an accident.

126
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,320
You even had a backup plan

127
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,120
to make sure nothing went wrong.

128
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,190
However,

129
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,840
you still left two pieces of evidence.

130
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,240
What evidence?

131
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,700
Fingerprints on the bomb.

132
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,270
Your story doesn't add up, does it?

133
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,510
That time bomb already exploded.

134
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,270
How could there be fingerprints?

135
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,730

Eyes on the road.

Alright, Qi.

If you really had evidence,

you wouldn't be talking with me here.

140
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,290
You would have taken me to
the interrogation room already.

141
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,440
Bringing you to the interrogation room
would be a waste of time.

142
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,500
After all, you only have 28 days left.

143
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,430
Nitrogen tanks have
limited storage periods.

144
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,840
Based on the timing,

145
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,750
the number 28 on Mo Yuanzhi's desk

146
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,750
should be the remaining time

147
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,840
to save Wanqing's life.

148
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,110
To complete this plan,

149
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,310
you still need one more person.

150
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,470
At first, I thought he was the Squid,

151
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,430
but in the end, I realized

152
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,670
that he didn't know about
the loops at all.

153
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,510
Of course.

154
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,120
Who isn't afraid of death?

155
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,840
People like us don't fear death.

156
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,030
What do you mean?

157
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,120
Where...

158
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,100
did you send him today?

159
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,270
If you were the Squid,

160
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,440
where would you send him?

161
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,100
I would have him stay in a tank—

162
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,720
a tank in the laboratory.

163
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,790
With a little purple light shining on him.

164
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,850
Are you talking about my laboratory?

165
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,750
What's so strange about that?

166
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,630
Do you know how many squids

167
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,960
Moma's laboratory has?

168
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,720
Do you know how many squids there are

169
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,010
in biology labs nationwide?

170
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,230
And did you know that in a squid's genome,

171
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,820
a single gene cluster contains 5 genes

172
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,020
related to neural system development?

173
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,000
You don't know anything.

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,730
I just know they're delicious.

175
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,550
Fine.

176

Next time, I'll take you

177
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,480
to Moma's other biological research base

178
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,150
to have a look.

179
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,870
There are hundreds of thousands of
squids there.

180
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,790
You can eat as many as you want.

181

My treat.

182
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,780
Most importantly,

183
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,750
that place is now

184
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,960
managed by An Lan.

185
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,730
Sorry about that.

186
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,130
You should work on your driving skills.

187
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,570
But when it comes to deduction, Qi,

188
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,900
you're still too green.

189
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,750
There is a writer,

190
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,840
Edward D. Hoch.

191
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,000
The best parts

192
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,410
of his detective novels are

193
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,290
twist after twist after twist.

194
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,360
You can never guess

195
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,600
what will happen next.

196
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,390
In a world full of mysteries,

197
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,350
time seems to stand still.

199
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,600
I've read books too.

200
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
My apologies.

201
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,070
So we're all Edward's fans.

202
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,160
I have an iQIYI subscription.

203
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,550
I like Detective Conan.

204
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,950
Want one?

205
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,780
No, thanks.

206
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,720
I know.

207
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,600
You killed Han Song too.

208
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
I have a friend

209
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,560
who really loves jogging,

210
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,210
especially in the morning.

211
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,390
He runs every day,

212
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,600
rain or shine.

213
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,950
Typical Conan fan.

214
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,230
You're making me sound all mysterious.

215
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,030
Go on.

216
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,440
On the day of the incident...

217
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,420
Ye Kun was also at the scene.

218
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,790
There was indeed an electrical leak.

219
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:55,960
Me, Zhang!

220
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,270
I'm telling you, this railing...

221
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,000
My phone!

222
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,960
You! Stop! You...

223
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,480
You made me drop my phone!

224
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,050
For heaven's sake.

225
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,670
So that's how Han died.

226
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,600
The person wearing a raincoat

227
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,220
who deliberately bumped into someone
and made them drop their phone...

228
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,060
was Ye Kun.

229
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,410
Even if that man

230
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,790
is the Ye Kun you mentioned,

231
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,480
what can you do if you catch him?

232
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,830
Make him pay for a new phone?

233
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,880
Besides...

234
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,520
have you caught him?

[Already taken care of An's mother]

240

Thank you, Qi,

241
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,360
for saving my mother.

242
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,920
How did you know

243
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,800
my mother and I would be in danger?

244
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,240
An Lan.

245
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,790
There are some things

246
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,030
no one would believe except you.

247
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,310
This phrase...

248
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,960
Why does it sound so familiar?

249
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,590
What I'm about to say

250
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,320
will sound completely absurd,

251
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,110
but it's what really happened.

252
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,350
This world enters a loop

253
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,720
every once in a while.

254
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,000
People relive the same day over and over

255
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,130
until the loop ends.

256
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,200
During this process,

257
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,460
no human or creature retains any memory.

258
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,350
If nobody remembers,

259
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,310
who can prove

260
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,880
the loops exist?

261
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,710
I can.

262
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,430
[If nobody remembers,
who can prove the loops exist?]

263
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,510
You might think I'm like RN356,

264
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,460
with the ability to predict the future.

265
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,790
But that's not the case.

266
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,550
We simply retain memories

267
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,130
of everything that happened
during the loops.

268
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,890
You know RN356?

269
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,590
You told me that yourself

270
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,240
in a previous loop.

271
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,270
So,

272
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,000
it's because of

273
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,460
your memories of the loops

274
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,450
that you know

275
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,080
what Mo Yuanzhi and Feng Qiming

276
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,210
were planning to do?

277
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,980
But this loop is

278
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,470
the most difficult one for me.

279
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,920
I've just discovered

280
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,780
that there are others
with the same ability as mine.

281
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,620
Mo Yuanzhi is one of them.

282
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,700
He also exploited this ability

283
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,830
and killed Tang Shaorong and Han Song

284
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,050
during the loop days.

285
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,230
Which loop is this?

286
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,010
The 5th.

287
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,690

Feng Qiming

342
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,200
would become Mo Yuanzhi's accomplice.

00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,840
He just won't say a word.

347
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,110
What should we do?

348
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,750
I need to go watch Mo Yuanzhi.

349
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,440
No matter what happens,

350
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,860
protect her.

351
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,480
Got it.

352
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,590
Be careful.

353
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,740
Would you like a drink?

354
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,430
We can't drink while on duty.

355
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,920
You really have strong nerves.

356
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,030
Having to face Han Yufei and Tang Xin

357
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,480
up close every day,

358
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,630
aren't you nervous at all?

359
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,950
Why did you kill both of them?

360
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,230
It wasn't just for control of Moma, right?

361
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,950
Three bosses in total—

362
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,070
if both of them are dead,

363
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,870
you'd become the prime suspect.

364
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,830
So you came up with

365
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,550
this whole Squid story

366
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,790
to clear your name.

367
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,600
Is that it?

368
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,480
Now, the fact is,

369
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,790
I

370
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,170
didn't kill anyone.

371
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,340
But someone is trying to kill me.

372
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,450
You did die once.

373
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,290
And it's true
that before the loop happened,

374
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,710
no one knew it was a loop day.

375
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,240
So after your death,

376
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,170
I also dropped my suspicion of you.

377
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,510
But there's one thing

378
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,910
I can't quite figure out.

379
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,180
Why did you have Ye Kun

380
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,930
create chaos

381
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,700
at the Zhao family wedding
on the 2nd loop day?

382
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Help!

383
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,750
Help me!

384
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,550
Someone help!

385
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,680
To find someone.

386
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,160
I wanted to use the chaos

387
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,440
to find the person who wants to kill me.

388
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
That logic makes sense, doesn't it?

389
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,880
I just didn't expect

390
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,570
that I would accidentally discover

391
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,650
your secret.

392
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,350
The very next day,

393
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,000
when you went to investigate the bakery,

394
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,310
I was almost certain that among you

395
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,590
there was another time loop perceiver.

396
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,480
Because only time loop perceivers

397
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,540
would know the cake would explode,

398
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,710
having that memory.

399
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,240
So after that,

400
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,750
you kept testing me,

401
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,790
putting up a smokescreen to confuse me,

402
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,320
while also testing Maggie?

403
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,250
Don't move!

404
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,510
Yes.

405
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,550
Because I couldn't be certain who it was.

406
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,350
Until the 3rd day,

407
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,550
you used your memory of the Highway 1

408
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,750
traffic accident news

409
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,350
to help An Lan accurately avoid

410
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,210
that accident.

411
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,490
Reroute immediately!

412
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,170
How did you know about the accident?

413
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,740
That's when I knew

414
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,310
it was you.

415
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,520
What about you?

416
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,250
When did you discover me?

417
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,510
On the evening of the third loop day,

418
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,920
Yu Shiya told me you often

419
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,850
went out in the early morning.

420
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,280
And the dates you went out

421
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,470
happened to be the loop days.

422
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,680
Mo Yuanzhi.

423
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,020
I know exactly what you did.

424
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,770
I also know exactly...

425
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,920
what you plan to do.

426
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,420
In Ivy Bay University's lab,

427
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,420
you did kill Jiang Yuwen.

428
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,100
But that day was a loop day.

429
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,780
Why, after rehearsing 4 times,

430
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,970
did you ultimately not go through with it?

431
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,270
Strictly speaking,

432
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,960
I didn't subjectively participate in

433
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,270
that loop.

434
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,750
Because at that time, I wasn't

435
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,200
a time loop perceiver.

436
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
I had no memory of that matter at all.

437
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,000
So I don't understand

438
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,480
why You Yuxiang kept coming after me.

439
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,550
Until later,

440
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,590
when I actually became a perceiver,

441
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,480
I thought back

442
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,810
and suddenly realized

443
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,160
that You Yuxiang seemed to have...

444
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,550
have some fragments

445
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,790
of memories

446
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,030
about the loop days.

447
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,070
Of course,

448
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,670
none of that matters anymore.

449
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,670
The loop days.

450
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,240
After all, they aren't reality.

451
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,510
The reality is,

452
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,920
on the 5th loop day,

453
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,960
Jiang Yuwen

454
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,200
successfully escaped

455
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,590
and vanished for a full 8 years.

456
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,410
Why did you want to kill him?

457
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,070
We must move into clinical trials
as soon as possible.

the European and American teams
are progressing?

461
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,580
If they beat us to it,

462
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,710
then all our years of research

463

will be completely worthless.

464

Fortunately, we're one step ahead.

465
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,900
We have the advantage.

466

are you sure?

468

We haven't even accumulated enough

469
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,240
animal experiment data.

470
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,790
We'd be

471
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,920
committing a crime

472
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,240
if we conducted human experiments

473
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,300
without approval.

474
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,070
To put it more seriously,

475
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,590
we could be killing people.

476

Falling in love with a test subject?

519
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,110
Do you know how difficult it is for us

520
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,000
to find a perfect test subject

521
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,070
these days?

522
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,070
You have a PhD in medicine!

523
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,380
You know Feng Wanqing can't survive!

524
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,550
Are you lacking confidence

525
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,610
in our experiment?

526
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,280
After following me for so long,

527
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,150
-you still have no faith?
-I only know...

528
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,960
I only know our drug isn't mature enough,

529
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,800
Professor Jiang!

530
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
You just need a test subject!

531
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,710
I won't let her be our test subject!

532
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,110
Put it down!

533
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,920
I absolutely won't let you!

534
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,280
Put it down!

535
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,710
I won't let her become our test subject!

536
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,440
Listen to me!

537
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,230
Even if our experiment on her fails,

538
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,190
I can still ensure

539
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,360
she lives longer than she would now,

540
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,670
with a better quality of life!

541
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,630
I can do it!

542
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,580
I can do it.

543
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,510
Listen.

544
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,230
If you truly love her,

545
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,880
give her a chance,

546
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,550
a chance to survive.

547
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,860
You and I both know

548
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,820
what the outcome of my disease will be.

549
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,610
It's just a drug trial.
It's not that scary.

550
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,960
If something bad really happens to you...

551
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,000
I can't bear it,

552
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,630
you know?

553
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,800
I can't bear it.

554
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,020
Please don't do it, okay?

555
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,590
Why did you give Feng Wanqing

556
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,040
the trial medication
without my permission?

557
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,080
Why should I ask your permission?

558
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,340
The patient has started eating again,

559
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,470
and all her indicators are improving.

560
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,670
Do you know you could kill her this way?

561
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,490
She signed the form herself.

562
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,450
She agreed to it.

563
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,960
Get out.

564
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,360
We're still trying to save her.

565
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,280
Then save her!

566
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,760
Save her!

567
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,510
Save her!

568
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,440
What kind of doctor are you?

569
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,470
You can't even save a life!

570
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,560
What kind of doctor are you?

571
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,450
What kind of doctor are you?

572
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,200
So many loops already.

573
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,040
Have you ever seen Jiang Yuwen?

574
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,920
Jiang Yuwen is already dead.

575
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,120
Your police closed that case years ago.

576
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,280
If I were you,

577
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,190
I wouldn't waste my energy

578
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,880
on a dead person.

579
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,340
You should pay more attention to
the living.

580
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,590
Who?

581
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,480
An Lan.

582
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,340
She must be

583
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,450
overwhelmed with work by now.

584
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,490
Won't you go help her?

585
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,080
I heard that your

586
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,390
RAN drug has side effects.

587
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,370
Do you experience any?

588
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,840
Tell me about yours first.

589
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,440
I don't experience any.

590
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Then neither do I.

591
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,370
You just won't admit it, will you?

592
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,150
Mr. Mo,

593
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,630
Maggie from Volly replied, saying

594
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,190
she can arrive in Hua'ao this morning.

595
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,840
Got it.

596
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,280
This is a

597
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,530
high-risk area

598
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,490
and also a classified zone.

599
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,500
Your job is to protect me,

600
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,330
not interfere with my work.

601
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,030
See you later.

602
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,170
Didn't An Lan politely decline Maggie?

603
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,500
Why is she still coming?

604
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Is this the CIB?

605
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,070
I'd like to file

606
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,110
a complaint about something.
