Take a look at this video.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,170
The victim seems ordinary,

12
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,120
But after checking his identity,

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
he's the principal scientist

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,450
of the largest biochemical company here.

15
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,510
His net worth is over 100 million.

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,120
Look.

17
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,000
It looks like an accident, doesn't it?

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,510
When we were done with
Fortune Bank's case,

19
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,200
Division 1's Huang Yuan
checked this billboard.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,130
It hasn't been repaired for years.

21
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,430
After this happened,

22
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,950
all the shops nearby

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,000
checked their signboards immediately.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,710
And it turned out

25
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,039
they were all faulty.

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,390
Since it was an accident,

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,590
why did you come to us?

28
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,229
The family refuse to accept that.

29
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,070
This is the victim's daughter.

30
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,039
She doesn't believe it was an accident.

31
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,590
She's escalated it to our chief,

32
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,590
and has been sitting here
for hours.

33
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,870
We've checked the surveillance cameras

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,840
on the scene.

35
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,560
The Criminal Division 1 has also done
the preliminary investigation.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,680
Judging from the video,

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,710
it really isâ€“

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,920
I know you're going to say
it was an accident,

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,400
but I know it wasn't.

40
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,950
This is a murder.

41
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,490
Why do you say that?

42
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,430
I have a hunch.

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,280
A hunch?

44
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,240
Before my dad left,

45
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,230
he kept saying he had a hunch.

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,079
My dad is a scientist.

47
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,520
He never believed in
ghosts nor gods.

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,720
He has never been afraid of them either.

49

But he kept saying he had a hunch.

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,430
What kind of...

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
hunch was it?

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,870
Or rather,

53
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,370
did he receive death threats?

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,400
Does he have enemies?

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,130
Or disputes?

56
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,560
None?

Nope...

he had a hunch that someone
was going to kill him.

Chief.

174

Chief!

175
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,550
We're in a meeting.

176
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,630
We received a report.

177
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,290
It may be related to this case.

178
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,910
Come.

179
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,320
You are criminals!

180
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,170
You're killing people!

181
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,910
You are pushing this world

182
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,000
to destruction!

183
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,110
You are evil!

184
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,050
You are greedy!

185
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,960
You must be judged!

Mo Yuanzhi.

187
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,440
I will let you

188
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,240
reunite with your friends soon.

189
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,720
I'll destroy Moma

190
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,390
in an instant.

191
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,910
Who is Mo Yuanzhi?

192
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,840
Mo Yuanzhi is the CEO of Moma Group.

193
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,000
Moma again?

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,600
How is he going to make them destroy
in an instant?

195
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,480
Who is

196
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,630
this squid?

197
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,960
Moma is a pharmaceutical company.

198
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,870
Could it be that someone died of medicine?

199
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,630
And they've come to seek revenge now?

200
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,510
Is it possible that they are competitors?

201
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,310
After all, two executives died.

202
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,790
What's their...

203
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,910
share ratio?

204
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,240
Look it up.

205
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,440
The shares the three of them have combined

206
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,080
is 61%.

207
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,550
Tang Shaorong and Han Song

208
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,790
have 20% each.

209
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,360
Mo Yuanzhi has 21%.

210
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,270
The three of them come together

211
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,400
to make key decisions for the company.

212
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,200
Merge the cases.

213
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,270
Han Song from a month ago.

214
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,120
Tang Shaorong from yesterday.

215
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,720
And Mo Yuanzhi from just now.

216
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
We'll investigate
these three cases together

217
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
and find out who this squid is.

225
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,030
Mr. Mo received a death threat.

226
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,480
A death threat?

227
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,440
Really?

228
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,440
It's has to be a prank, right?

229
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,960
I think its real.

230
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,320
That's so scary.

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,580
I don't even dare to come to work anymore.

What does it have to do
with small fry like us?

233
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,630
This threat

234
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,000
isn't a threat to us.

235
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,600

plants a bomb in the company?

237

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,070
Don't talk nonsense.

244
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,010
promise me something?

245
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,350

You may not be worried
but I am.

Mo Yuanzhi is the only one left

and he also received death threats.

260
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,290
It's not like I received the death threat.

261
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,080
Must you go to work?

262
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,240
You know it.

I know what you're afraid of.

that person

268
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,360

my mom came out earlier or later?

What if she walked faster or slower?

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,060
He is young and promising.

346
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,130
Ding Qi, come here.

347
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,310
Good.

348
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,400
Okay.

349
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,200
Let's split the team.

350
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160
Yu Peishan and Gu Song

351
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,270
will join your team.

352
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,640
Kai and Fang Lu

353
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,030
will join your team.

354
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,070
Okay?

355
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,790
Chief.

356
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,830
Why do they have two and us three?

357
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,090
Kai, no need to join us.

358
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,180
One more for your team.

359
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,640
Haoxin.

360
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,550
You go.

361
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,510
No, Chiefâ€“

362
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,240
Wait.

363
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,810
Listen to me. Sit down.

364
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,680
Now,

365
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,440
you form a task force.

366
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,510
Ding Qi will be the team leader.

367
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,400
You will pretend to be employees

368
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,590
and personal bodyguards

369
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,640
to investigate secretly

370
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,680
and find Squid.

371
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,270
Okay?

372
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,200
Okay.

373
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,500
Why is he the only one saying okay?

374
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,030
Call me Boss!

375
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,510
Boss!

376
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,640
Not me.

377
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,070
Boss!

378
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,790
Okay.

379
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,170
Boss.

380
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,480
You're old.

381
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,310
Don't call me that.

382
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,920
I-I didn't mean that.

383
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,290
Division 1 come to us

384
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,790
when they have cases

385
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,790
they can't solve.

386
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,320
Why are you trying to

387
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,380
show off this time?

388
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,790
Well...

389
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,310
I think I can solve this case.

390
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,480
Besides, if I solve it,

391
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,610
you'll be promoted.

392
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,030
That makes sense.

393
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,790
But this time,

394
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,000
you're taking away all the people

395
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,880
in our department.

396
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,960
Only I'm left behind.

397
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,490
Besides,

398
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,830
can you handle

399
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,790
Huang Yuan and the others?

400
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,790
Do you trust me?

401
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,240
Do you?

402
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,030
[November 28, 2024]

403
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,960
I heard from them that

404
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,160
if you get the authorization,

405
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,550
you can tap the whole world?

406
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,550
Do you have the authorization?

407
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,400
I do.

408
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,130
I can too, then.

409
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,750
Who can have that much authority?

410
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,950
What do you have then?

411
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,590
Monitoring equipment?

412
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,790
Where did you get it?

413
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,480
I bought it.

414
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,510
Seven years ago,

415
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,590
Mo Yuanzhi, a doctor,

416
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,590
announced that he developed

417
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,650
a new genetic technology called RAN,

418
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,050
making him his first huge amount
of money.

419
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,000
One year later,

420
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,270
Moma Biotechnology announced

421
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,720
the initial development of
RAN-2 is successful.

422
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,160
In the same year, he married

423
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,880
the daughter of
the famous investor Yu Yinghua,

424
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,920
Yu Shiya.

425
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,830
Officer Ding, right?

426
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm Mo Yuanzhi.

427
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,200
Hello.

428
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,480
Don't call me

429
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,440
Office for now.

430
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,350
Call me Qi.

431
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,270
Sorry for the trouble.

432
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,680
Can I go take a look at your office?

433
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,350
Of course.

434
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,270
Here.

435
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:08,970
Please.

436
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,640
Would you like something to drink?

437
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,440
Coffee or tea?

438
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,550
No, thanks.

439
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,720
Based on your experience,

440
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,640
when do you think Squid

441
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,880
will take action?

442
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
It's hard to say.

443
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
I also want to ask you.

444
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,440
From your point of view,

445
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,590
why do you think Squid

446
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,750
is targeting Moma?

447
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,160
The production of our genetic medication

448
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,790
has greatly affected
traditional pharmaceutical companies.

449
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,240
Even a few years back,

450
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,370
we'd already made countless enemies.

451
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,200
And this year,

452
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,160
we have a project
called RAN-X

453
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,400
that's about to enter
the clinical trial stage.

454
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,110
Once the experiment succeeds,

455
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,000
and it enters the market,

456
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,310
this is no exaggeration,

457
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,550
but at least half
of these companies

458
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,590
will be affected.

459
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,640
Moma has affected too many people.

460
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,750
People like Squid

461
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,550
who wants to make Moma disappear

462
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,450
are plenty.

463
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,330
Please don't mind.

464
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,780
I'm sorry. This is embarrassing.

465
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,160
I can only

466
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,010
commemorate them in this way.

467
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,880
After all, according to your requirements,

468
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,030
I can't attend

469
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,160
Tang's funeral.

470
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,110
Of course, I know

471
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,970
you're doing this for my own good.

472
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,790
In the building,

473
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,310
there will be other colleagues of mine
protecting you round the clock.

474
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,880
But...

475
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,830
let's work together.

476
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,960
I hope you don't hide anything from us.

477
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,150
For your safety.

478
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,750
Okay.

479
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,610
Let my secretary show you around.

480
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,200
Can I take a walk by myself?

481
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,750
Sure.

482
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,070
Mr. Ding.

483
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,510
This is the staff pass you requested.

484
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,440
Okay, thank you.

485
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,790
Who are you?

486
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,230
The CEO's assistant?

487
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,920
A bodyguard?

488
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,470
The president cherishes his life, huh.

489
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,720
Why are you here

490
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,760
instead of being around the CEO.

491
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,030
I just joined today.

492
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,690
I'm just taking a look around.

493
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,510
Han Yufei.

494
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,440
He's the son of the executive
that was murdered, Han Song.

495
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,880
He's a playboy that does nothing all day.

496
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,680
He dresses gaudily all day long.

497
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,790
After his father died,

498
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,200
he joined Moma Group.

499
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,070
He has no position,

500
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,070
but he has shares.

501
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,890
He is now
the second largest shareholder of Moma.

502
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,680
Officer Ding?

503
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,920
Mr. Ding.

504
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,920
You're starting work so soon?

505
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,250
Not going to take a rest?

506
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,590
I can be calmer

507
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,450
when I have something to do.

508
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,160
Thank you for what you did before.

509
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,360
It's what I should do.

510
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,550
Ms. Tang.

511
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,710
I'm getting back to work.

512
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,960
Tang Xin.

513
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,820
You've met her.

514
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,270
She's the daughter of
the principal scientist,

515
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,270
Tang Shaorong.

516
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,030
She just graduated from university.

517
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,960
Three months ago,
she joined Moma Biotechnology

518
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,090

â™ª Five chances back to the start â™ª

684
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,040
â™ª I can heal â™ª

685
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,850
â™ª I can witness â™ª

686
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,360
December 11.

687
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,830
â™ª I can also recur â™ª

688
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,630
While protecting Mo Yuanzhi,

689
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
â™ª Five chances â™ª

690
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,080
â™ª Save the world â™ª

691
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,190
nothing happened.

692
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,170
â™ª Five chances â™ª

693
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,290
â™ª Save the world,
yes, I have â™ª

694
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,600
â™ª Yes, I have â™ª

695
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,520
â™ª Five chances back to the start â™ª

696
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,350
â™ª I can heal â™ª

697
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,070
Let's call it a day

698
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:14,850
â™ª I can witness â™ª

699
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,630
Gather at the food stall.

700
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,200
â™ª I can also recur â™ª

701
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,600
â™ª Five chances â™ª

702
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,100
â™ª Save the world â™ª

703
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,180
â™ª Five chances â™ª

704
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,240
â™ª Save the world â™ª

705
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,360
Have this beef. It's really tender.

706
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,000
Really?

707
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,800
Come on, eat.

708
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,510
Eat up.

709
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,290
Who ordered this squid?

710
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,800
Any problem?

711
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,630
We're now bodyguards instead of policemen

712
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,000
thanks to Squid.

713
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,030
Why did you order it?

714
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,840
I think

715
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,400
catching Squid too quickly

716
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,670
wouldn't be a good thing too.

717
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,070
Why?

718
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,760
Why?

719
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,230
After catching him,

720
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,000
we have to return to Huang Yuan.

721
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,090
That's boring.

722
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,230
Captain Duan doesn't want to leave you.

723
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,190
Come to Division 4.

724
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,880
We're like a family.

725
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,440
It's warm in there.

726
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,400
Anyway,

727
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,800
when you go back to Huang Yuan,

728
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,670
you have to see him

729
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,920
with a sullen face all the time,

730
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,510
right?

731
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,960
What do you mean?

732
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,820
Means he looks pissed off.

733
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,150
Come on.

734
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,400
Let's have a drink.

735
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,360
Welcome to Division 4.

736
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,820
Come on!

737
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,980
It's a deal!

738
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,920
Deal!

739
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,670
Let's drink!

740
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,980
Speaking of which,

741
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,760
you've heard about what happened

742
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,030
at Dafa Bank, right?

743
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,110
Yes.

744
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,670
I fought six thieves singlehandedly.

745
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,710
Five, five.

746
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,440
Five.

747
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,230
Five.

748
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,110
With one gun,

749
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,630
I faced six of them with 12 bullets.

750
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,880
When I was about to shoot,

751
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,760
I went left and right,

752
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,670
and turned aroundâ€“

753
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,440
I've paid the bill.

754
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,110
I can't stand it anymore.

755
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,760
I'm leaving.

756
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,030
Thank you, Boss.

757
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,510
What?

758
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,150
You're leaving?

759
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,070
Can't stand it anymore?

760
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,150
Listen a little longer.

761
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,280
Don't let him dance.

762
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,230
How about I sing?

763
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,840
No need.

764
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,880
Sure!

765
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,440
Come on.

766
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,920
I've known you for so long.

767
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,360
I've never seen you working.

768
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,960
You look different.

769
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,320
What's different?

770
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,440
It feels like

771
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,930
you're holding some energies in.

772
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,880
I've mentioned my research to you before.

773
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,660
-Genetic experiment on nerve growth.
-Genetic experiment on nerve growth.

774
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,160
You remember?

775
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,880
I remember every word you said.

776
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,630
I-I mean...

777
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,800
the Moma case is not over yet.

778
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,360
Don't...

779
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,760
talk to strangers

780
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,640
or walk alone at night.

781
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,110
Is this an order

782
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,400
from you to me?

783
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,800
It's not an order.

784
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,800
It's a personal request.

785
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
Actually,

786
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,040
I want to ask you a question.

787
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,230
Are you kind to me

788
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,200
because of the guilt
you feel towards my mom

789
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,070
or

790
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,590
is there another reason?

791
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,800
What reason?

792
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,520
Do you really not understand

793
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,030
or do you dare not understand?
