then please make one

120
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,870

and doesn't fall apart at the end.

122
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,200
Okay.

123
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,360
You used the time loops

124
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,180
to map out Tang Shaorong's route

125
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,940
and orchestrated an accident.

126
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,320
You even had a backup plan

127
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,120
to make sure nothing went wrong.

128
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,190
However,

129
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,840
you still left two pieces of evidence.

130
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,240
What evidence?

131
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,700
Fingerprints on the bomb.

132
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,270
Your story doesn't add up, does it?

133
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,510
That time bomb already exploded.

134
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,270
How could there be fingerprints?

135
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,730

Eyes on the road.

Alright, Qi.

If you really had evidence,

you wouldn't be talking with me here.

140
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,290
You would have taken me to
the interrogation room already.

141
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,440
Bringing you to the interrogation room
would be a waste of time.

142
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,500
After all, you only have 28 days left.

143
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,430
Nitrogen tanks have
limited storage periods.

144
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,840
Based on the timing,

145
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,750
the number 28 on Mo Yuanzhi's desk

146
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,750
should be the remaining time

147
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,840
to save Wanqing's life.

148
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,110
To complete this plan,

149
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,310
you still need one more person.

150
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,470
At first, I thought he was the Squid,

151
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,430
but in the end, I realized

152
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,670
that he didn't know about
the loops at all.

153
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,510
Of course.

154
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,120
Who isn't afraid of death?

155
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,840
People like us don't fear death.

156
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,030
What do you mean?

157
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,120
Where...

158
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,100
did you send him today?

159
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,270
If you were the Squid,

160
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,440
where would you send him?

161
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,100
I would have him stay in a tank—

162
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,720
a tank in the laboratory.

163
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,790
With a little purple light shining on him.

164
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,850
Are you talking about my laboratory?

165
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,750
What's so strange about that?

166
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,630
Do you know how many squids

167
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,960
Moma's laboratory has?

168
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,720
Do you know how many squids there are

169
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,010
in biology labs nationwide?

170
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,230
And did you know that in a squid's genome,

171
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,820
a single gene cluster contains 5 genes

172
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,020
related to neural system development?

173
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,000
You don't know anything.

00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,730
I just know they're delicious.

175
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,550
Fine.

176

Next time, I'll take you

177
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,480
to Moma's other biological research base

178
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,150
to have a look.

179
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,870
There are hundreds of thousands of
squids there.

180
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,790
You can eat as many as you want.

181

My treat.

182
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,780
Most importantly,

183
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,750
that place is now

184
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,960
managed by An Lan.

185
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,730
Sorry about that.

186
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,130
You should work on your driving skills.

187
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,570
But when it comes to deduction, Qi,

188
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,900
you're still too green.

189
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,750
There is a writer,

190
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,840
Edward D. Hoch.

191
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,000
The best parts

192
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,410
of his detective novels are

193
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,290
twist after twist after twist.

194
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,360
You can never guess

195
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,600
what will happen next.

196
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,390
In a world full of mysteries,

197
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,350

199
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,600
I've read books too.

200
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
My apologies.

201
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,070
So we're all Edward's fans.

202
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,160
I have an iQIYI subscription.

203
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,550
I like Detective Conan.

204
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,950
Want one?

205
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,780
No, thanks.

206
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,720
I know.

207
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,600
You killed Han Song too.

208
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
I have a friend

209
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,560
who really loves jogging,

210
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,210
especially in the morning.

211
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,390
He runs every day,

212
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,600
rain or shine.

213
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,950
Typical Conan fan.

214
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,230
You're making me sound all mysterious.

215
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,030
Go on.

216
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,440
On the day of the incident...

217
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,420
Ye Kun was also at the scene.

218
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,790
There was indeed an electrical leak.

219
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:00,960
Me, Zhang!

220
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,270
I'm telling you, this railing...

221
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,000
My phone!

222
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:06,960
You! Stop! You...

223
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
You made me drop my phone!

224
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,050
For heaven's sake.

225
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,670
So that's how Han died.

226
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,600
The person wearing a raincoat

227
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,220
who deliberately bumped into someone
and made them drop their phone...

228
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,060
was Ye Kun.

229
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,410
Even if that man

230
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,790
is the Ye Kun you mentioned,

231
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,480
what can you do if you catch him?

232
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,830
Make him pay for a new phone?

233
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
Besides...

234
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,520
have you caught him?

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,450

[Already taken care of An's mother]

240

Thank you, Qi,

241
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,360
for saving my mother.

242
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,920
How did you know

243
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,800
my mother and I would be in danger?

244
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,240
An Lan.

245
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,790
There are some things

246
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,030
no one would believe except you.

247
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,310
This phrase...

248
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,960
Why does it sound so familiar?

249
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,590
What I'm about to say

250
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,320
will sound completely absurd,

251
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,110
but it's what really happened.

252
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,350
This world enters a loop

253
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,720
every once in a while.

254
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,000
People relive the same day over and over

255
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,130
until the loop ends.

256
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,200
During this process,

257
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,460
no human or creature retains any memory.

258
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,350
If nobody remembers,

259
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,310
who can prove

260
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,880
the loops exist?

261
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,710
I can.

262
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,430
[If nobody remembers,
who can prove the loops exist?]

263
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,510
You might think I'm like RN356,

264
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,460
with the ability to predict the future.

265
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,790
But that's not the case.

266
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,550
We simply retain memories

267
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,130
of everything that happened
during the loops.

268
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,890
You know RN356?

269
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,590
You told me that yourself

270
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,240
in a previous loop.

271
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,270
So,

272
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,000
it's because of

273
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,460
your memories of the loops

274
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,450
that you know

275
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,080
what Mo Yuanzhi and Feng Qiming

276
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,210
were planning to do?

277
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,980
But this loop is

278
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,470
the most difficult one for me.

279
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,920
I've just discovered

280
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,780
that there are others
with the same ability as mine.

281
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,620
Mo Yuanzhi is one of them.

282
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,700
He also exploited this ability

283
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,830
and killed Tang Shaorong and Han Song

284
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,050
during the loop days.

285
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,230
Which loop is this?

286
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,010
The 5th.

287
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,690

Feng Qiming

342
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,200
would become Mo Yuanzhi's accomplice.

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,840
He just won't say a word.

347
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,110
What should we do?

348
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,750
I need to go watch Mo Yuanzhi.

349
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,440
No matter what happens,

350
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,860
protect her.

351
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,480
Got it.

352
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,590
Be careful.

353
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,740
Would you like a drink?

354
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,430
We can't drink while on duty.

355
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,920
You really have strong nerves.

356
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,030
Having to face Han Yufei and Tang Xin

357
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,480
up close every day,

358
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,630
aren't you nervous at all?

359
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,950
Why did you kill both of them?

360
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,230
It wasn't just for control of Moma, right?

361
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,950
Three bosses in total—

362
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,070
if both of them are dead,

363
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,870
you'd become the prime suspect.

364
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,830
So you came up with

365
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,550
this whole Squid story

366
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,790
to clear your name.

367
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,600
Is that it?

368
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,480
Now, the fact is,

369
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,790
I

370
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,170
didn't kill anyone.

371
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,340
But someone is trying to kill me.

372
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,450
You did die once.

373
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,290
And it's true
that before the loop happened,

374
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,710
no one knew it was a loop day.

375
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,240
So after your death,

376
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,170
I also dropped my suspicion of you.

377
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,510
But there's one thing

378
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,910
I can't quite figure out.

379
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,180
Why did you have Ye Kun

380
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,930
create chaos

381
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,700
at the Zhao family wedding
on the 2nd loop day?

382
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Help!

383
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,750
Help me!

384
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,550
Someone help!

385
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,680
To find someone.

386
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,160
I wanted to use the chaos

387
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,440
to find the person who wants to kill me.

388
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
That logic makes sense, doesn't it?

389
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,880
I just didn't expect

390
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,570
that I would accidentally discover

391
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,650
your secret.

392
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,350
The very next day,

393
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,000
when you went to investigate the bakery,

394
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,310
I was almost certain that among you

395
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,590
there was another time loop perceiver.

396
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,480
Because only time loop perceivers

397
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,540
would know the cake would explode,

398
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,710
having that memory.

399
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,240
So after that,

400
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,750
you kept testing me,

401
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,790
putting up a smokescreen to confuse me,

402
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,320
while also testing Maggie?

403
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,250
Don't move!

404
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,510
Yes.

405
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,550
Because I couldn't be certain who it was.

406
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,350
Until the 3rd day,

407
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,550
you used your memory of the Highway 1

408
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,750
traffic accident news

409
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,350
to help An Lan accurately avoid

410
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,210
that accident.

411
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,490
Reroute immediately!

412
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,170
How did you know about the accident?

413
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,740
That's when I knew

414
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,310
it was you.

415
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,520
What about you?

416
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,250
When did you discover me?

417
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,510
On the evening of the third loop day,

418
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,920
Yu Shiya told me you often

419
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,850
went out in the early morning.

420
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,280
And the dates you went out

421
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,470
happened to be the loop days.

422
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,680
Mo Yuanzhi.

423
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,020
I know exactly what you did.

424
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,770
I also know exactly...

425
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,920
what you plan to do.

426
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,420
In Ivy Bay University's lab,

427
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,420
you did kill Jiang Yuwen.

428
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,100
But that day was a loop day.

429
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,780
Why, after rehearsing 4 times,

430
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,970
did you ultimately not go through with it?

431
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,270
Strictly speaking,

432
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,960
I didn't subjectively participate in

433
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,270
that loop.

434
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,750
Because at that time, I wasn't

435
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,200
a time loop perceiver.

436
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
I had no memory of that matter at all.

437
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,000
So I don't understand

438
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,480
why You Yuxiang kept coming after me.

439
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,550
Until later,

440
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,590
when I actually became a perceiver,

441
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,480
I thought back

442
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,810
and suddenly realized

443
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,160
that You Yuxiang seemed to have...

444
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,550
have some fragments

445
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,790
of memories

446
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,030
about the loop days.

447
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,070
Of course,

448
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,670
none of that matters anymore.

449
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,670
The loop days.

450
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,240
After all, they aren't reality.

451
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,510
The reality is,

452
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,920
on the 5th loop day,

453
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,960
Jiang Yuwen

454
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,200
successfully escaped

455
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,590
and vanished for a full 8 years.

456
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,410
Why did you want to kill him?

457
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,070
We must move into clinical trials
as soon as possible.

the European and American teams
are progressing?

461
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,580
If they beat us to it,

462
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,710
then all our years of research

463

will be completely worthless.

464

Fortunately, we're one step ahead.

465
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,900
We have the advantage.

466
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,000

are you sure?

468
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,110
We haven't even accumulated enough

469
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,240
animal experiment data.

470
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,790
We'd be

471
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,920
committing a crime

472
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,240
if we conducted human experiments

473
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,300
without approval.

474
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,070
To put it more seriously,

475
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,590
we could be killing people.

476

480
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,070

Falling in love with a test subject?

519
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,110
Do you know how difficult it is for us

520
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,000
to find a perfect test subject

521
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,070
these days?

522
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,070
You have a PhD in medicine!

523
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,380
You know Feng Wanqing can't survive!

524
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,550
Are you lacking confidence

525
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,610
in our experiment?

526
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,280
After following me for so long,

527
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,150
-you still have no faith?
-I only know...

528
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,960
I only know our drug isn't mature enough,

529
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,800
Professor Jiang!

530
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,400
You just need a test subject!

531
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,710
I won't let her be our test subject!

532
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,110
Put it down!

533
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,920
I absolutely won't let you!

534
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,280
Put it down!

535
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,710
I won't let her become our test subject!

536
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,440
Listen to me!

537
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,230
Even if our experiment on her fails,

538
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,190
I can still ensure

539
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,360
she lives longer than she would now,

540
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,670
with a better quality of life!

541
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,630
I can do it!

542
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,580
I can do it.

543
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,510
Listen.

544
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,230
If you truly love her,

545
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,880
give her a chance,

546
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,550
a chance to survive.

547
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,860
You and I both know

548
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,820
what the outcome of my disease will be.

549
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,610
It's just a drug trial.
It's not that scary.

550
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,960
If something bad really happens to you...

551
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,000
I can't bear it,

552
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,630
you know?

553
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,800
I can't bear it.

554
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,020
Please don't do it, okay?

555
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,590
Why did you give Feng Wanqing

556
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,040
the trial medication
without my permission?

557
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,080
Why should I ask your permission?

558
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,340
The patient has started eating again,

559
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,470
and all her indicators are improving.

560
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,670
Do you know you could kill her this way?

561
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,490
She signed the form herself.

562
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,450
She agreed to it.

563
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,960
Get out.

564
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,360
We're still trying to save her.

565
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,280
Then save her!

566
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,760
Save her!

567
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,510
Save her!

568
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,440
What kind of doctor are you?

569
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,470
You can't even save a life!

570
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,560
What kind of doctor are you?

571
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,450
What kind of doctor are you?

572
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,200
So many loops already.

573
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,040
Have you ever seen Jiang Yuwen?

574
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,920
Jiang Yuwen is already dead.

575
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,120
Your police closed that case years ago.

576
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,280
If I were you,

577
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,190
I wouldn't waste my energy

578
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,880
on a dead person.

579
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,340
You should pay more attention to
the living.

580
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,590
Who?

581
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,480
An Lan.

582
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,340
She must be

583
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,450
overwhelmed with work by now.

584
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,490
Won't you go help her?

585
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,080
I heard that your

586
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,390
RAN drug has side effects.

587
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,370
Do you experience any?

588
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,840
Tell me about yours first.

589
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,440
I don't experience any.

590
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Then neither do I.

591
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,370
You just won't admit it, will you?

592
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,150
Mr. Mo,

593
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,630
Maggie from Volly replied, saying

594
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,190
she can arrive in Hua'ao this morning.

595
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,840
Got it.

596
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,280
This is a

597
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,530
high-risk area

598
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,490
and also a classified zone.

599
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,500
Your job is to protect me,

600
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,330
not interfere with my work.

601
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,030
See you later.

602
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,170
Didn't An Lan politely decline Maggie?

603
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,500
Why is she still coming?

604
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
Is this the CIB?

605
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,070
I'd like to file

606
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,110
a complaint about something.
