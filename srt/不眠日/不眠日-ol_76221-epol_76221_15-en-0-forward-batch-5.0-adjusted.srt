the space-time we exist in has changed.

175
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,430
But my father meant well.

176
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,820
He wanted to save lives.

177
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,580
Really?

178
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,520
Did he want to save lives

179
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,360
or did he want to experiment
on living patients?

180
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,850
In her final moments,

181
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,700
Wanqing suffered five times the agony.

182
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,620
Was she saved?

183
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,869
Mo Yuanzhi.

184
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,109
It's not about your Wanqing.

185
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,349
You just want Moma all to yourself!

186
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,740
Don't try to cover up

187
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,270
your disgusting behavior.

188
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,190
Then,

189
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,300
how noble do you think

190
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,500
your dear father is?

191
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,260
Do you know

192
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,260
that to steal my RAN data,

193
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,460
he planned that explosion

194
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,830
which killed so many...

195
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,350
No, wait.

196
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,990
That never happened in the end.

197
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,680
Let me tell you something.

198
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,910
The reason I've been looking
for Jiang Yuwen

199
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,190
is because I want

200
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,590
the portion of RAN data

201
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,950
he took away back then.

202
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,780
Because

203
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,390
I need to save Wanqing.

204
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,430
I need to find a way to save her.

205
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,300
I'll kill

206
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,300
whoever stops me.

207
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,870
Han Song.

208
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,250
Tang Shaorong.

209
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,430
Han Yufei.

210
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,630
And you.

211
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,350
If you kill me,

212
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,070
my father will never let you go.

213
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,980
Let me put it this way.

214
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,460
The reason I'm telling you all this

215
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,300
is because

216
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,840
I want to express my apologies.

217
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,140
Sorry, Maggie.

218
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,770
You're actually quite innocent.

219
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,150
If you want to blame someone,

220
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,610
blame yourself
for not having a good father.

221
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,500
Mo Yuanzhi!

222
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,500
I can't believe Jiang Yuwen's side effect

223
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,460
is rapid aging.

224
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,260
Wanqing,

225
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,360
as long as I get

226
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,260
Jiang Yuwen's other half
of the RAN data today,

227
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,970
I can immediately create a new drug

228
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,300
to stop my side effects.

229
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,060
At the same time,

230
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,630
it can also save your life.

231
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,780
Wanqing,

232
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,780
do you see?

233
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,700
Even heaven is on our side.

234
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,920
Maggie!

235
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,150
Maggie!

236
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,120
Don't go in there.

237
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,100
Don't trigger the self-destruct mechanism.

238
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,940
What are you mixing there?

239
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,940
Aqua regia.

240
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,420
That's reverse aqua regia.

241
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,320
What's reverse aqua regia?

242
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,260
You got it mixed up.

243
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,780
Here.

244
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,320
Show him how it's done.

245
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,400
Three parts
concentrated hydrochloric acid.

246
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,670
One part concentrated nitric acid.

247
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,300
That's it.

248
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,600
It can be used to dissolve metals.

249
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,540
[Hydrochloric acid]

250
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,060
[Nitric acid]

251
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,960
[Jiang Yuwen,
I have both of your daughters.]

252
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,190
The transfer must be done today.

253
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,220
Maggie.

254
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,350
Maggie!

255
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,020
Maggie.

256
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,910
Maggie!

257
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,220
Wake up!

258
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,950
Maggie!

259
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,930
Everyone, go home.

260
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,520
Now?

261
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,070
What?

262
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,910
Go home.

263
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,310
Hello?

264
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,350
Boss,

265
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,760
I found Jiang Yuwen.

266
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,610
I sent the photo to your phone.

267
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,460
Maggie.

268
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,560
Maggie.

269
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,210
Look at me.

270
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,700
Where is Jiang Yuwen?

271
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,310
Boss.

272
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,280
Mo Yuanzhi kidnapped Maggie,

273
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,680
but I've rescued her now.

274
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,750
What about Tang Xin and Han Yufei?

275
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,080
Haven't found them yet.

276
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,540
I suspect they've

277
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,470
also been kidnapped by Mo Yuanzhi.

278
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,430
Peishan.

279
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,020
Track Mo Yuanzhi's location.

280
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,460
Wang Haoxin, go find Jiang Yuwen.

281
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,710
I've sent you the address.

282
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,430
Everyone else,

283
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,100
come search Moma Building immediately.

284
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Copy that.

285
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,500
Mo Yuanzhi!

286
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,900
What are you doing?

287
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,590
Get lost!

288
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,250
Mo Yuanzhi has escaped.

289
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:06,990
His own car,

290
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,950
a black Alphard.

291
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,310
Look at this route here.

292
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,980
Pull up the previous one.

293
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:12,690
Right.

294
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,520
Around here.

295
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,500
Pay close attention to this area.

296
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,270
Be careful.

297
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,060
Watch this spot.

298
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,540
Okay?

299
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,660
Pull up those two previous feeds as well.

300
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,060
Got it.

301
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,310
Look here.

302
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,160
Yes.

303
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,220
Make it bigger.

304
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:29,910
Enlarge this.

305
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,110
Stop. Pause. Zoom in.

306
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:31,920
Here?

307
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,950
Yes, right there.

308
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,710
I see Mo Yuanzhi
heading toward the checkpoint.

309
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,310
Got it.

310
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,710
Boss,

311
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,670
I think you need to see this.

312
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,470
Mo Yuanzhi must be
going after Jiang Yuwen,

313
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,200
but Jiang Yuwen has a bomb.

314
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,100
Alright,

315
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,830
you go find Tang Xin and Han Yufei.

316
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,750
I'll go after Mo Yuanzhi.

317
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,230
Okay.

318
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,740
Are you feeling okay?

319
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,140
Have some water.

320
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,920
Don't move.

321
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,650
Open the door.

322
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,520
Where's Mo Yuanzhi?

323
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,840
Boss got out in the parking garage.

324
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,000
Stop the car.

325
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,900
I need to get something.

326
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,790
You go to the checkpoint first.

327
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,840
I'll message you later.

328
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,590
Got it, Boss.

329
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,830
Boss,

330
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,390
Mo Yuanzhi got out in the parking garage.

331
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:23,980
What?

332
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,110
[Duan Zheng]

333
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,280
Hey, Qi.

334

Boss.

335
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,270
Kai said

336
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,460
Mo Yuanzhi hasn't left.

337
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,790
Lock down the Moma Building immediately!

338
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,350
Got it.

00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,310

340

342
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,420
take your team over there.

Copy that.

344

What's happening with all these police?

345
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,670
