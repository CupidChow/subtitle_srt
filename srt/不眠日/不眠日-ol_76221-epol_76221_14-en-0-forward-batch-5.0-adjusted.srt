00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,320
I asked you to text Maggie

176
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
and tell her not to come today.

177
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,050
Did you do it?

178
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,080
Yes, I did.

179
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,440
Anything wrong?

180
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,950
She still came today.

181
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,920
Mo Yuanzhi must have called her.

182
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,030

mainly for biological programs.

In theory,

186
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,500
they don't have to
partner with companies like Moma.

187

An Lan,

188
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,150
I need you to find out

189
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,170
what exactly Volly wants from Moma.

190
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,910
Okay.

191
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,080

No, lives matter more.

337
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,000
Seriously?

338

Mo Yuanzhi filed a complaint against us
for abuse of power.

339

He said

340
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,650
that you treated the person
who should be protected

341
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,650
as a suspect without clear evidence.

342
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,780
You mean Mo Yuanzhi?

343
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,070
Ding Qi,

344
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,030
withdraw immediately.

345
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,770
T-The reception's poor here.

346
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,430
Chief,

347
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,650
I-I'll call you back in a bit.

348
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,190
Now, you have one minute

349
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,210
to halt the operation.

350
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,810
If not, you'll be dismissed.

351
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,200
Hello, Maggie.

352
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,030
Welcome to Moma.

353
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,230
How was your journey?

354
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,370
Welcome, Maggie.

355
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,300
Nice to meet you.

356
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,410
Nice to meet you.

357
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,960
Please.

358
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,110
How are you? Tired from the trip?

359
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,020
I'm all fine.

360
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,550
We see Volly's choice of investing in Moma

361
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,640
an honor for us.

362
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,770
This way.

363
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,160
I believe

364
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,640
this cooperation will be a real pleasure.

365
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,240
Who is that man?

366
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,790
Do I know him?

367
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,920
He just has

368
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,850
an average face.

369
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,750
Okay.

370
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,660
Ding Qi,

371
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,810
you must explain everything to me today.

372
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,200
Why does An Lan have the information

373
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,860
that even we the police don't?

374
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,480
Also,

375
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,070
what makes you conclude

376
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,980
that Mo Yuanzhi instructed Feng Qiming
to commit the murders?

377
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,040
Who is your informant?

378
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,500
Where did he get the intel?

379
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,270
Just wait till I finish the investigation.

380
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,160
When I figure everything out,

381
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,880
I'll tell you

382
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,750
the whole story in detail.

383
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,680
Are you negotiating terms with me?

384
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,720
You have to give me an explanation today,

385
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,380
or I won't let you go anywhere.

386
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,920
We've all retreated to the office now.

387
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,160
What if Mo Yuanzhi runs away?

388
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,960
If he kills again...

389
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,720
Any proof?

390
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,700
Greetings, Mr. Mo.

391
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,120
My visit here

392
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,250
is not only for

393
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,510
the due diligence on Moma's
tangible and intangible strengths,

394
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,790
but also for a review

395
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,810
on Moma's financial records
in the past 5 years.

396
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,720
Do you mind?

397
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,720
Of course not.

398
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,240
Mr. Mo,

399
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,030
you'll deliver a speech

400
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,720
at Ivy Bay University at 2 p.m..

401
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,000
Here is the script.

402
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,680
Don't you see

403
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,880
I'm with an important guest now?

404
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,120
Cancel the speech.

405
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:21,830
Got it.

406
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,060
About the wedding at the Zhao's tonight...

407
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,800
Cancel it too.

408
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,400
Mr. Mo,

409
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,960
I'd hate for my visit

410
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,430
to upset your plans for the day.

411
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,430
Your secretary can keep me company.

412
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,770
Nothing is more important than

413
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,030
the cooperation between Volly and Moma.

414
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,170
[Ivy Bay University]
[Cancellation Notice]

415
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,160
From the video we just saw,

416
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,890
Jiang Yuwen didn't die years ago.

417
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,690
He fled.

418
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,960
Mo Yuanzhi used his two daughters

419
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,440
to lure him out.

420
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,090
Feng Qiming's sister, Feng Wanqing,
didn't die either.

421
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,750
Mo Yuanzhi hid her somewhere.

422
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,500
Now, the fact is,

423
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,990
Mo Yuanzhi used Feng Qiming
to kill Han Song

424
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,050
and Tang Shaorong.

425
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,030
Next,

426
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,960
he will go after Tang Xin,

427
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,640
Maggie,

428
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,720
and Jiang Yuwen.

429
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,750
He won't spare anyone

430
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,640
who covets Moma.

431
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,880
He'll kill them all.

432
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,070
Okay.

433
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,990
Some

434
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,970
of your speculations

435
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,280
became true,

436
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,540
and some are theoretically possible.

437
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,310
Just now, you said

438
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,110
Jiang Yuwen

439
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,410
would show up,

440
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,920
and that Mo Yuanzhi would kill him.

441
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,140
But you only ventured a guess.

442
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,400
There's no evidence at all.

443
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,510
Besides, Mo Yuanzhi

444
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,240
doesn't have a solid motive.

445
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,170
Evidence, evidence, evidence...

446
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,240
I can't show you any evidence

447
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,480
if you don't let me
conduct an investigation, right?

448
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,510
You made me come back here.

449
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,570
How am I supposed to

450
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,320
investigate and find proof?

451
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,310
Look.

452
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,830
You've spoiled your direct report.

453
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,920
Hear me out, Chief.

454
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,130
Qi is right

455
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,960
about Ye Kun being connected

456
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,920
to the Squid case.

457
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,400
Why don't you give him the liberty

458
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,150
to investigate it?

459
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,180
Investigate?

460
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,240
Do you have any idea

461
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,880
how much pressure
the brass has put me under?

462
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,940
Investigate, huh?

463
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,270
Chief,

464
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,660
I've been working on this case
for a long time.

465
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,260
Do you have to bet against me?

466
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,480
Should anything go wrong,

467
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,720
will you take full responsibility?

468
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,680
I can quit my job.

469
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,160
Will you bear all the consequences?

470
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,170
Fine. I'll relieve you from your post now.

471
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:15,720
Chief...

472
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,350
Shut up!

473
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,920
Hand it over.

474
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,550
Your gun!

475
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,210
Chief...

476
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,980
Zip it!

477
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,680
Your badge!

478
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,040
Listen up,

479
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,080
keep close watch

480
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,590
on him 24/7.

481
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,840
Do not let him leave this place.

482
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,330
Chief...

483
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,220
And you!

484
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,160
If you cover for him again,

485
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
I'll fire you too.

486
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,830
Chief...

487
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,550
Chief...

488
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,640
You guys, listen!

489
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,510
If he ever takes so much as
a step out of this place,

490
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,110
I'll have you all suspended.

491
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,480
Please, Chief,

492
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,790
just give him a chance...

493
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,030
Give him a chance to investigate the case.

494
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,400
Chief.

495
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,000
Chief!

496
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,400
Watch Ding Qi!

497
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,820
What right do you have to lock me up?

498
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,020
How can you lock me up?

499
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,570
I'm calling the police!

500
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,430
My stomach hurts.

501
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,820
I need to use the bathroom.

502
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,750
Fang Lu,

503
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,950
doesn't your stomach hurt?

504
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,500
It hurts badly.

505
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,310
Why are you looking at me?

506
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,960
Chief told us

507
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,350
to never leave this room.

508
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,890
Read a book if you have spare time.

509
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,890
Stop watching...

510
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,670
me.

511
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,630
Where's that book,
"A Brief History of Time"?

512
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,090
I'm feeling a bit thirsty.

513
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,740
Where's "A Brief History of Time"?

514
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,200
Ding Qi.

515
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,500
Do you trust me?

516
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,830
Make sure you catch the Squid.

517
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,840
Once you find evidence,

518
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,780
let me know.

519
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,540
We'll back you up.

520
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,560
An Lan.

521
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,070
Qi,

522
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:24,750
[An Lan]

523
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,200
I have a finding.

524
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,920
Maggie's company Volly

525
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,030
has been in quest of

526
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,510
the early data of RAN reagent,

527
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,370
which can date back to 8 years ago.

528
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,960
Why don't they collect the latest data

529
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,920
i-instead of that from 8 years ago?

530
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,860
Given Maggie's professionalism,

531
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,980
such data

532
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,570
must be highly valuable.

533
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,150
It's the only reason
that she's taking a risk.

534
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,110
But finding the early RAN data

535
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,430
is extremely difficult.

536
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,540
Mo Yuanzhi

537
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,800
is very protective of
this classified information.

538
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,460
Even I don't have access to it.

539
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,550
This explains

540
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,220
why Maggie decided to visit Moma.

541
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,280
Mo Yuanzhi is taking advantage of it.

542
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:54,900
Then...

543
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,110
Then his next target is Maggie.

544
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,110
Qi.

545
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,300
I want to ask you a question.

546
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,280
You must answer it candidly.

547
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:10,870
What is it?

548
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,830
As a time loop participant,

549
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,910
have you experienced

550
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,770
the side effect yet?

551
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,140
Those who underwent early RAN tests

552
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,970
would experience a side effect

553
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,130
that manifests as

554
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,280
an attack on the weakest part
of the test subject's body.

555
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,230
It could be an organ

556
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,590
or the entire body

557
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,310
that gets attacked,

558
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,370
causing a rapid decline in health.

559
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,400
You,

560
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,560
Mo Yuanzhi,

561
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,790
Jiang Yuwen,

562
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,680
and RN356

563
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,740
would suffer from the same aftereffects.

564
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,480
I...

565
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,370
I died once

566
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,070
in a loop day.

567
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
My heart suddenly stopped beating.

568
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,000
A cardiac arrest?

569
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,110
I need to do more experiments

570
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,230
to verify some theories.

571
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,630
Nonetheless,

572
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,730
Qi, don't be afraid.

573
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,530
An Lan.

574
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,790
I've braced myself

575
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,610
for a sudden death.

576
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,980
Maybe it's my fate.

577
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,570
I refuse to accept it.

578
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,780
I won't let that happen.

579
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,470
If...

580
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,440
If my hypothesis is proven true,

581
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,880
I can prevent

582
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,300
the side effect from occurring.

583
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,200
I can also...

584
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,000
Anyway,

585
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,880
Qi,

586
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,760
you must trust me.

587
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,150
An Lan.

588
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,050
I trust you.

589
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,730
If the side effect is hurting me
more and more,

590
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,100
the case with Mo Yuanzhi must be the same.

591
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,230
This explains why

592
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,310
he insisted Maggie visit Moma today.

593
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,140
Hey, Qi.

594
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,360
Boss.

595
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,890
Apart from killing Jiang Yuwen,

596
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,480
Mo Yuanzhi has other plans.

597
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,480
What plans?

598
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,940
[Duan Zheng]

599
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,030
I'm not sure yet.

600
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,400
To figure out what he's up to,

601
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,360
I have to find Jiang Yuwen
and Maggie first.

602
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,790
Now, Han Yufei and Tang Xin

603
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,890
might also be in danger.

604
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,750
Make sure you keep them both safe.

I'd like you

609
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,830
and Han Yufei
to come to the police office.

610
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,440
Have you caught the Squid?

611
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,170
We will soon.

612
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,110
This concerns your personal safety.

613
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,070
I hope you two can come here right away.

614
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,670
Okay.

615
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,920
Set out now.

616

This way, Maggie.

617
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,520
This is the test site

618

of our biotech R&D center.

619
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,070
Come on in.

620
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,630
This is a controlled area

621
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,920
and a classified location

622
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,550
regarding biosecurity.

623
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,400
So, usually,

624
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,060
outsiders are not allowed in.

625
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,050

626
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,280
How about I arrange lunch for you first?

627
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,790
In the interest of time,

628
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,710
I'd like to look around
and gather more information.

629
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,190
Okay.

630
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,780
Let's not waste any time.

631
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,170
I'll go check on
Volly's investment agreement.

632
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,700
You give Maggie a tour.

633
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,660
She has access to every area

634
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,280
she'd like to see.

635
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,110
No problem.

636
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,320
Thank you.

637

00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,800
See you later.

639
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
This way, please.

640
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,280
On our right-hand side
is the biology gene bank.

641
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,400
We store all the materials here,

642
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,460
at minus 80 degrees Celsius.

643
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,480
Yufei, I'm out now.

644
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
I'm in the underground parking lot.

645
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,640
I'll be waiting for you in my car.

646
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,710
And this is our biology gene bank.

647
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,280
We normally store

648
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,610
all the chemicals here.

649
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,150
So we call this stop "barred area."

650

No fire, of course.

651

for our chief scientist,

653
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,590
which is our boss.

654
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,840
Can I have a look?

655
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,910
I'm afraid I don't have authorization.

656

00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,350
Yufei,

691
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,930
I owe you an apology.

692
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,230
I always thought of you

693
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,400
as unambitious,

694
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,880
eccentric,

695
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,830
and weird.

696
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,080
But now I think I was wrong.

697
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,890
I'm sorry.

698
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,230
In fact,

699
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,630
you're quite ambitious.

700
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,940
Letting you take over Moma

701
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,600
will truly put my mind at ease.

702
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,500
Show me mercy,

703
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,330
as I'm about to go down.

704
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,740
Tell me if you have

705
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,670
dug up other dirt on me.

706
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,950
I sure have.

707
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,430
I know what happened in your lab.

708
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,430
All's on this cellphone.

709
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,560
Now, answer my question directly.

710
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,390
Did you or did you not

711
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,960
kill my father, Mo Yuanzhi?

712
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:50,840
I...

713
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,030
I'm telling you,

714
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,110
there are surveillance cameras here.

715
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,630
You can't get away!

716
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,240
Why do all of you have to defy me?

717
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:14,700
You,

718
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,230
your father,

719
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,840
Jiang Yuwen,

720
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,370
Tang Shaorong,

721
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,110
and Maggie...

722
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,580
You guys are a pain in the neck!

723
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,930
A pain in the neck!

724
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,960
I hate you all.

725
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,790
I hate all of you!
