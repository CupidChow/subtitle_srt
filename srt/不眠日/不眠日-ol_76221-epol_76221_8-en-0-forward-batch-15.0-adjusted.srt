In Guatemala, South America,
there's a bird

46
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,720
called the Hoopoe.

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,030
It chirps once every 30 minutes.

48
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,540
The interval is accurate to the second.

49
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,310
That's why people call it the bird clock.

50

In the dense forests of Africa,

51
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,040
there's a time-telling insect.

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,430
It changes color once every hour.

53

The South African large-leaf tree

57

Trees record time
with rings in their roots.

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,430
These are called annual rings.

59
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,680

Paleontologists have discovered that

64
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,030
the calcium carbonate
secreted daily by coral polyps

65
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,360
forms a tiny daily ring.

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,630
These daily rings accumulate into

67
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,030
a growth belt distinctly different
from other years.

68
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,240
Based on the number of daily rings

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,590
in these growth belts,

70
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,590
we can determine

71
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,120
how many days were in a year.

72
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,470
And the number of daily rings in a coral

73
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,240
is exactly

74
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,190

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,840
Why?

175
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,960
Why does Fu Jun have to die?

176
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,050
He was just an ordinary person.

177
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,750
He only showed angry behavior

178
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,000
in the first loop.

179
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,390
Why is it that the more I try to help him,

180
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,910
the more his fate

181
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,840
moves toward extremes in the loop?

182
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,530
Looking for me?

183
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,150
What does he mean by the same kind?

184
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,030
It's really exhausting.

185
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,960
There were smoke bombs

186
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
and hostage situations today.

187
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,400
I haven't even eaten yet.

188
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,910
You were inside.

189
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,650
You knew what they were planning.

190
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,580
How did you know?

191
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,400
I don't know.

192
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,790
I was just asking.

193
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,670
You don't know?

194
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,270
I don't know.

195
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,930
Then why wait until midnight?

196
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,800
Midnight?

197
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,080
Midnight is still far away.

198
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,880
What's wrong?

199
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,800
Then what does the loop mean?

200
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,130
What does the loop mean?

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,510
I told you before I had a special power,

202
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,790
and you said I was talking nonsense.

203
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,600
So this time I said it,

204
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,270
and he believed it.

205
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,670
Didn't this trick reveal

206
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,070
that someone's behind all this?

207
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,300
Don't I know if someone's behind this?

208
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,890
Well,

209
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,600
if I knew that
you knew someone was behind this,

210
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,400
I wouldn't have asked like that.

211
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,840
Nonsense.

212
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,790
It's hard to explain this right now.

213
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,440
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

214
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Tomorrow?

215
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,910
I feel like I've heard that

216
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,400
many times from you before.

217
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,110
Impossible.

218
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,960
I've definitely never said that.

219
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,630
Are you sure?

220
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,360
Of course.

221
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,970
Think about it carefully.

222
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,510
I haven't even eaten,

223
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,240
and I still have interrogations to do.

224
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,500
What kind of questions is he even asking?

225
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,590
He's never said that?

226
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,750
Boss.

227
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,150
Duan Zheng just told me

228
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,910
not to give you

229
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,600
any more information about Ye Kun.

230
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,910
What's going on?

231
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,170
I don't know either.

232
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,060
Just keep investigating for now.

233
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:47,910
How did it go?

234
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,510
I finished the questioning.

235
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
That teacher's eyes

236
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,860
don't look like those of a killer.

237
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,270
His movements

238
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,870
are abnormal.

239
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,130
It's probably a sign of epilepsy.

240
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,050
He doesn't want to kill anyone.

241
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,670
But as police officers,

242
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,930
we have to take action.

243
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,570
We can't gamble with the hostages' lives.

244
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,510
I have a question for you.

245
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,160
It's not an interrogation.

246
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,930
You also graduated from
Ivy Bay's biology department.

247
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,720
Do you know

248
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,720
about the relationship
between Jiang Yuwen and Mo Yuanzhi?

249
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,050
I've heard some rumors.

250
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,320
Before Jiang Yuwen disappeared,

251
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,000
he had established himself

252
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,720
in the field of genetic biology.

253
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,390
I've read many of his papers.

254
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,840
Their viewpoints and methods

255
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,290
had some differences.

256
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,760
I've also heard that

257
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,150
in academic circles,

258
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,030
the explanation for his disappearance

259
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,080
was suicide.

260
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,690
They just couldn't find his body.

261
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,530
And that he set fire to the lab himself

262
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,510
with the purpose

263
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,640
of destroying his experimental data.

264
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Well...

265
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,480
I have another question.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,670
That is,

267
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,800
why did you attend
the Zhao's wedding?

268
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,690
The company required
all executives to attend.

269
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,400
As the chief assistant,

270
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,660
I'm considered half an executive.

271
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,310
But with everything that happened today,

272
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,310
I suppose

273
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,490
I won't need to go anymore.

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,829
Finally,

275
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,160
take another careful look at this person.

276
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,020
Do you know him?

277
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,080
The person you arrested today?

278
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,330
I don't know him.

279
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,200
But I feel like I've seen him
somewhere before.

280
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,160
Where?

281
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,960
Then again, maybe I haven't.

282
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,350
It's okay.

283
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,750
You haven't answered the question

284
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,880
I asked you earlier.

285
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,680
Which question?

286
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,440
This morning,

287
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,400
Highway 1–

288
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,440
how did you know in advance

289
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,240
that there would be an accident?

290
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,200
I didn't know.

291
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,240
You didn't know?

292
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,040
I didn't know.

293
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,640
If you didn't know, why were you so urgent

294
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,270
about making me change routes?

295
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,310
Have the driver change the route

296
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,640
and exit the highway early
at the M16 Exit.

297
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,790
Driver, exit the highway at
the next junction.

298
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,350
But taking this route
will add a lot of extra distance.

299
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,610
Reroute immediately!

300
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,310
Because I...

301
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,270
I checked

302
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,200
the news this morning,

303
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,350
and looked at the traffic conditions,

304
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,240
so...

305
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,550
Well, I have a traffic police colleague

306
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,440
who told me

307
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,680
there was an accident ahead.

308
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,960
So I deduced,

309
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,200
if you took that route, you might

310
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,070
be in danger.

311
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,790
This is just

312
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,550
a reflection of my professional skills.

313
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,510
You're so busy,

314
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,910
why would you be paying attention
to the traffic conditions?

315
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
B-Because...

316
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,920
you were on the road.

317
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,150
How did you know I was on the road?

318
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,840
Sorry, could you repeat that?

319
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,720
Okay.

320
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,270
Alright, I'll be right there.

321
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,070
Just a moment.

322
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,830
Okay.

323
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,830
All right.

324
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,350
Okay.

325
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,070
Got it.

326
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,110
Officer Ding,

327
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,550
can I leave now?

328
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,160
What You Yuxiang said isn't true.

329
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,490
You can investigate it.

330
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,400
We'll definitely investigate
what needs to be investigated,

331
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
but I'd still like to hear

332
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,940
your side of the story.

333
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,440
You Yuxiang,

334
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,920
to reopen Jiang Yuwen's case,

335
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,490
did something like this.

336
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,120
Why...

337
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,350
Why is he convinced

338
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,440
that you're the one
who killed Jiang Yuwen?

339
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
Why he thinks so

340
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,590
is something you should ask him,

341
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,110
not me.

342
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,910
Because I'd like to know why too.

343
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,880
Besides,

344
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,350
Professor You Yuxiang's mental state
has never been stable.

345
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,240
This is something everyone

346
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,840
at Ivy Bay University knows.

347
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,550
Are you sure

348
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,200
you shouldn't first investigate
his mental wellness

349
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,930
before deciding
whether to believe what he says?

350
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,960
We'll definitely investigate
what needs to be investigated.

351
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,640
Mr. Mo,

352
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,350
it's still necessary

353
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,350
for you to tell us

354
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,750
about your relationship with Jiang Yuwen.

355
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,550
Please.

356
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,720
Jiang Yuwen

357
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,550
was my PhD supervisor.

358
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,640
He was also

359
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,720
once my idol.

360
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,940
In my final year of doctoral studies,

361
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,920
he was basically treating me

362
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,790
as a partner,

363
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,320
not just a student anymore.

364
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,310
I was very grateful for that.

365
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,750
But I still

366
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,680
couldn't understand

367
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,280
his eccentric personality.

368
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,040
Thank you, Professor Jiang.

369
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,790
In everyone's eyes,

370
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,520
Jiang Yuwen is a strange man.

371
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,920
So,

372
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,960
when I was choosing my PhD supervisor,

373
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
everyone around me

374
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,720
was against me choosing him.

375
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,430
But I didn't care.

376
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,550
In the field of science,

377
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,270
every successful person
is more or less a little eccentric.

378
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,160
I admired him.

379
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,290
I wanted to learn from him.

380
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,610
I wanted to become as excellent as he was.

381
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,120
I just never expected

382
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,770
our relationship would turn out that way.

383
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Professor Jiang,

384
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,410
I've contacted an academic journal.

385
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,310
They said it has passed expert review.

386
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,710
Now it's in the editor-in-chief's
final review stage.

387
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,640
They think

388
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,000
the research findings are cutting-edge

389
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,920
and valuable.

390
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,000
I hope

391
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,390
you can publish it with me.

392

[Author: Mo Yuanzhi]

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,550
You can leave.

394
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,350
I got it.

395
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,470
Professor Jiang.

396
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Professor Jiang.

397
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,810
Professor Jiang, why?

398
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,980
You're very smart,

399
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,520
but that has become your downfall.

400
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,680
You know,

401
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,480
there are no shortcuts in science.

402
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,350
You're too focused
on your so-called shortcuts.

403
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,440
Sooner or later,

404
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,490
you'll trip on that shortcut.

405
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,200
At that moment,

406
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,560
I was absolutely certain

407
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,960
my idol was jealous of me.

408
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:56,920
Qi.

409
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,270
If one day

410
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,410
someone you look up to
becomes jealous of you,

411
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,680
it can only mean

412
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,400
you've truly succeeded.

413
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,450
Later,
I applied to have my supervisor changed,

414
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,530
but the incident happened
before I got a response.

415
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,440
Even the police couldn't find

416
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,590
Jiang Yuwen's body.

417
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,080
He just vanished into thin air.

418
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,720
I won't say more about the rest.

419
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,400
You can investigate it yourselves.

420
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,110
Anyway,

421
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,920
it seems that whatever I say,

422
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,520
you don't really believe me.

423
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,510
Look.

424
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,350
At Ivy Bay University,

425
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,200
I only attended
a few of Professor You Yuxiang's classes.

426
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,640
We weren't even close.

427
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,830
We had no conflicts,

428
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,290
nor any mutual interests.

429
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,070
Besides,

430
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,440
on the day of Jiang Yuwen's incident,

431
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,880
whether it's the timeline,
witness testimony

432
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,160
or the surveillance footage,

433
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,400
everything is out there.

434
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,160
I never entered that laboratory.

435
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,000
This Professor You Yuxiang

436
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,720
is still making these baseless accusations.

437
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,440
Why?

438
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,510
What is he trying to do?

439
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,070
Also,

440
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,110
You Yuxiang claimed

441
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,000
I killed Jiang Yuwen,

442
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,640
right?

443
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,480
Where is Jiang Yuwen's body?

444
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,810
We need to prove
Jiang Yuwen is dead first.

446
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,150

447
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,070
Can I leave now?

448
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,100
I'll have someone escort you.

449
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,640
Later,
the police and firefighters arrived.

[Ivy Bay University]

452
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,550
The students suffered the most.

453
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,680
All their experimental data was lost.

454
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,070
Many studies had to start over.

455
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,070
Were those students

456
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,510
including Mo Yuanzhi?

457
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,550
Of course.

458
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,110
But he was really clever.

459
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,440
He just changed his research topic

460
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,840
and graduated smoothly.

461
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,490
It was quite successful too.

462
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,850
It later became the foundation
of Moma Biotechnology.

463
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,920
So Jiang Yuwen

464
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,520
just disappeared like that?

465
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,720
Later there were rumors that he

466
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,920
jumped into a river and killed himself.

467
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,720
We only found out later

468
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,200
that he had depression.

469
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,550

470
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,110

471
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,920
He's not usually like this.

472
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,830
How could he kill in public–

473

We just made a breakthrough.

518
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,960
There was a girl at the hall

519
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,000
who got injured when leaving.

520
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,200
She claimed to be a student from Ivy Bay,

521
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,130
but we later found out she wasn't.

522
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,350
Are you okay?

523
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,770
I'm fine.

524
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,590
What's in the bag?

525
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,240
Open the bag.

526
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,200
Open it!

527
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,640
We found hidden camera equipment
in her bag.

528
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,500
This is what she secretly filmed.

529
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,510
And this is her phone.

this afternoon. Are you okay?]

531
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:26,200
[Huang Yuan]

532
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,040
Hello, Boss.

533
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,120
Peishan,

534
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,240
how's your cooperation with them?

535
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,680
It's going well.

536
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,010
Has Ding Qi shown any unusual behavior?

537
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,000
No.

538
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,680
I haven't noticed

539
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,110
anything unusual

540
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,310
about Ding Qi.

541
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,200
How is he doing?

542
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,340
He's working really hard.

543
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,210
Keep a close eye on him.

544
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,240
If he acts strange,

545
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,440
tell me immediately.

546
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,190
Okay.

547
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,219
Why didn't you respond to my messages?

548
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,740
[Criminal Investigation Bureau]

549
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,760
Officer Ding.

550
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,960
What exactly do you suspect me of?

551
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,020
I suspect you want to kill Mo Yuanzhi.

552
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,070
I just hired someone to take a few photos.

553
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,640
How does that make me a murderer?

554
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,770
What about Han Song and Tang Shaorong?

555
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,510
What do they have to do with me?

556
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,550
Your private investigator said

557
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,630
you used the same methods

558
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,480
to monitor both of them.

559
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,070
Why?

560
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,370
They both died in accidents.

561
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,070
Your police department closed the cases.

562
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,800
What I'm asking is

563
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,480
why were you monitoring them?

564
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,110
I admit,

565
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,150
I did monitor them.

566
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,760
In recent years,

567
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,230
they've been working with Mo Yuanzhi

568
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,090
to eat away at my family's shares.

569
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,000
These three people

570
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,070
wear the mask of a scientist,

571
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,270
yet they're all ruthless businessmen.

572
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,920
Of course, what exactly they did

573
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
is not my concern,

574
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,280
but if they harm
the Yu family's interests,

575
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,700
that's unacceptable.

576
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,030
So what did you find out?

577
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,150
I discovered
the three of them don't get along.

578
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,080
Don't get along?

579
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,570
But that's actually good.

580
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,880
To keep a company

581
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,630
fundamentally fair,

582
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,290
you need checks and balances.

583
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,810
But I never expected that within a month,

584
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,610
both of them would be dead.

585
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,960
So what do you think

586
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,630
about their deaths?

587
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,070
With the balance gone,

588
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,730
don't you suspect Mo Yuanzhi?

589
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,710
Of course I do.

590
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,280
On the mornings when

591
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,250
Han Song and Tang Shaorong died,

592
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,030
Mo Yuanzhi

593
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,280
did strange things.

594
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,430
Today morning,

595
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,570
he did the same thing again.

596
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,590
So I decided to follow him.

597
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,590
But I never expected

598
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,350
that he went to Moma.

599
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,360
I don't know what he was doing

600
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,590
when he snuck out all those nights.

601
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,030
Was he out on a date with An Lan?

602
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,440
I'm not sure.

603
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,190
So, Officer Ding,

604
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,070
if you find anything,

605
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,740
please let me know.

606
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,030
You suspect I want to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

607
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:11,920
Yes.

608
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,070
I want to kill him.

609
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,510
Have you ever heard this saying?

610
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,710
Every married couple in this world

611
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,340
has countless moments

612
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,280
when they want to kill each other.
