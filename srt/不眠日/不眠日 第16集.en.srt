The patient has passed away.

that the lives of people
like Wanqing and me

00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,750
Right?

176
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,150
Yes.

177
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,750
How are they doing?

178
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,430
They were indeed kidnapped by Mo Yuanzhi,

179
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,230
but we've got them back safe now.

180
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,230
They're fine.

181
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,390
And Maggie is upstairs right now.

182
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,670
If you detonate it,
everything will be over.

183
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,800
I don't believe you.

184
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,350
You're deceiving me.

185
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,430
Calm down.

186
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,840
Hold on a second.

187
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,590
Tang Xin,

188
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,450
say something to your father.

189
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,750
Say something to him.

190
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,080
Dad.

191
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,550
Xin.

192
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,800
What did you call me?

193
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,950
Dad.

194
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,960
I heard you.

195
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,030
I don't want you to die.

196
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
This police officer is trustworthy.

197
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,480
Maggie is here too.

198
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,760
We're both safe and sound.

199
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,599
Okay.

200
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,010
I want you to stay alive, Dad.

201
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,609
I'll do as you say, dear.

202
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,720
I'll do whatever you say.

203
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,190
Thank you.

204
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't move.

205
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,350
Stay still.

206
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,450
I leave it to you.

207
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,990
Leave them behind. Let's go!

208
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,120
Have you found Mo Yuanzhi?

209
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:26,990
It's too crowded

210
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,920
to identify him.

211
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,990
Hurry up! Get down!

212
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,080
Come down!

213
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,320
Get down!

214
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,120
Come down now!

215
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,860
What are you doing?

216
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,300
Stop shouting, Mr. Mo.

217
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,840
This time, you can neither run away

218
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,080
nor escape by air.

219
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,360
You're such a clingy pain in the neck!

220
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
It's so hard to get rid of you!

221
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,690
You forced me to do this.

222
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,670
Qiming!

223
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,120
Kill An Lan and her mother!

224
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,580
Kill An Lan and her mother!

225
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,430
Hello?

226
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,230
Hello?

227
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,040
Go ahead.

228
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,760
Go ahead.

229
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,390
Yes.

230
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,020
I really can't get away this time.

231
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,080
Qi.

232
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
The first day I met you,

233
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,910
I had a bad feeling.

234
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,620
I felt that one day,

235
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,380
you might really get me.

236
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,710
It's fine.

237
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,150
I'm tired.

238
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Really worn out.

239
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,990
How did you

240
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,390
end up having our condition?

241
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,470
I have no idea.

242
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,200
You should be the one to tell me.

243
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,050
Well, like me...

244
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,950
I was trying to find

245
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,540
a cure for Wanqing.

246
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,720
I experimented on myself with the drug.

247
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,210
After I gave myself that injection,

248
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,930
I lost consciousness completely.

249
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,590
I must have died temporarily.

250
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,760
But the next day,

251
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,820
I came back to life.

252
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,080
At that moment,

253
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,280
it struck me that Wanqing was suffering

254
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,240
five times the torment

255
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,130
during the time she was very sick.

256
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,590
And Jiang Yuwen was the one
who put her through all this.

257
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,240
Mo Yuanzhi.

258
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,480
No matter what you've been through,

259
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,680
it doesn't justify you killing others.

260
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,560
Yes.

261
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,610
Haven't you been dying to know

262
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,210
what my side effect is?

263
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,090
I've gone blind several times already.

264
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,480
Next time,

265
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,800
I might lose my sight completely.

266
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,760
So tell me.

267
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,210
What's the point of having this power?

268
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm in pain every single day.

269
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,580
What about you, Qi?

270
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,780
Do you feel pain?

271
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,650
I do, indeed.

272
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,450
I haven't slept for 5 days, Mr. Mo.

273
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,960
Let's get this over with.

274
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,940
Will you do it yourself,

275
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,370
or should I help you?

276
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,480
Come on.

277
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,690
I haven't slept well either.

278
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,150
We'll both
get a good night's sleep tonight.

279
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,760
I knew it.

280
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,760
All those build-ups

281
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,240
are just for this moment, right?

282
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,800
Yeah,

283
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,520
I couldn't beat you fair and square,

284
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,720
so I had to play dirty.

285
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,970
Yet I still failed.

286
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
You're indeed my nemesis.

287
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,170
Are you a jinx?

288
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,580
Yeah, a jinx for you.

289
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
You talk too much.

290
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,970
Go easy on me.

291
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,210
Not bad, Qi.

292
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,210
You've worked out quite a lot
in the loop days.

293
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,650
Were it not for your research,

294
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,040
I wouldn't have come this far.

295
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
And if I hadn't come this far,

296
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,900
no one would have discovered you.

297
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,040
See? That's fate.

298
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,710
I've accepted my fate.

299
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,050
I notice you're also way too talkative.

300
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,730
The side effect.

301
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,520
This is your side effect.

302
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,560
Qi,

303
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,580
you stand no chance against me.

304
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,650
