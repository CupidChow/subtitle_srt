Step back!

7

Take a look at this video.

11
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,170
The victim seems ordinary,

12
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,120
But after checking his identity,

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
he's the principal scientist

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,450
of the largest biochemical company here.

15
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,510
His net worth is over 100 million.

16
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,120
Look.

17
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,000
It looks like an accident, doesn't it?

18
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,510
When we were done with
Fortune Bank's case,

19
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,200
Division 1's Huang Yuan
checked this billboard.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,130
It hasn't been repaired for years.

21
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,430
After this happened,

22
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,950
all the shops nearby

23
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,000
checked their signboards immediately.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,710
And it turned out

25
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,039
they were all faulty.

26
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,390
Since it was an accident,

27
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,590
why did you come to us?

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,229
The family refuse to accept that.

29
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,070
This is the victim's daughter.

30
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,039
She doesn't believe it was an accident.

31
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,590
She's escalated it to our chief,

32
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,590
and has been sitting here
for hours.

33
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,870
We've checked the surveillance cameras

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,840
on the scene.

35
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:23,560
The Criminal Division 1 has also done
the preliminary investigation.

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,680
Judging from the video,

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,710
it really is–

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,920
I know you're going to say
it was an accident,

39
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,400
but I know it wasn't.

40
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,950
This is a murder.

41
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,490
Why do you say that?

42
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,430
I have a hunch.

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,280
A hunch?

44
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,240
Before my dad left,

45
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,230
he kept saying he had a hunch.

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,079
My dad is a scientist.

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,520
He never believed in
ghosts nor gods.

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,720
He has never been afraid of them either.

49
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,829
But he kept saying he had a hunch.

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,430
What kind of...

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
hunch was it?

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,870
Or rather,

53
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,370
did he receive death threats?

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,400
Does he have enemies?

55
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,130
Or disputes?

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,560
None?

57

Nope...

after Uncle Han died,

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,710
he had a hunch that someone
was going to kill him.

I'm sorry.

62

00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,630
Chief.

174

Chief!

175
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,550
We're in a meeting.

176
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,630
We received a report.

177
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,290
It may be related to this case.

178
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,910
Come.

179
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
You are criminals!

180
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,170
You're killing people!

181
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,910
You are pushing this world

182
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,000
to destruction!

183
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,110
You are evil!

184
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,050
You are greedy!

185
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,960
You must be judged!

186

Mo Yuanzhi.

187
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,440
I will let you

188
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,240
reunite with your friends soon.

189
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,720
I'll destroy Moma

190
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,390
in an instant.

191
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,910
Who is Mo Yuanzhi?

192
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,840
Mo Yuanzhi is the CEO of Moma Group.

193
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,000
Moma again?

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,600
How is he going to make them destroy
in an instant?

195
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,480
Who is

196
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,630
this squid?

197
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,960
Moma is a pharmaceutical company.

198
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,870
Could it be that someone died of medicine?

199
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,630
And they've come to seek revenge now?

200
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,510
Is it possible that they are competitors?

201
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,310
After all, two executives died.

202
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,790
What's their...

203
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,910
share ratio?

204
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,240
Look it up.

205
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,440
The shares the three of them have combined

206
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,080
is 61%.

207
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,550
Tang Shaorong and Han Song

208
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,790
have 20% each.

209
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,360
Mo Yuanzhi has 21%.

210
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,270
The three of them come together

211
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,400
to make key decisions for the company.

212
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,200
Merge the cases.

213
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,270
Han Song from a month ago.

214
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,120
Tang Shaorong from yesterday.

215
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
And Mo Yuanzhi from just now.

216
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,440
We'll investigate
these three cases together

217
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
and find out who this squid is.

218
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,360

-Yes!

What's up?

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,550
Have you heard?

225
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,030
Mr. Mo received a death threat.

226
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,480
A death threat?

227
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,440
Really?

228
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,440
It's has to be a prank, right?

229
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,960
I think its real.

230
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,320
That's so scary.

231
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,580
I don't even dare to come to work anymore.

232

What does it have to do
with small fry like us?

233
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,630
This threat

234
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,000
isn't a threat to us.

235
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,600
What if

236
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,670

plants a bomb in the company?

237

A bomb?

238
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,070
Don't talk nonsense.

Officer Ding?

243
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,080
Can you

244
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,010
promise me something?

245
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,350
Can you work from home

I've heard of it.

You may not be worried
but I am.

How can I slack off?

Mo Yuanzhi is the only one left

259
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,960
and he also received death threats.

260
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,290
It's not like I received the death threat.

261
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,080
Must you go to work?

262
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,240
You know it.

263

I know what you're afraid of.

264

to go to the graduation ceremony.

266

that person

268
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,360

my mom came out earlier or later?

272

What if she walked faster or slower?

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,060
He is young and promising.

346
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,130
Ding Qi, come here.

347
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,310
Good.

348
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,400
Okay.

349
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,200
Let's split the team.

350
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
Yu Peishan and Gu Song

351
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,270
will join your team.

352
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,640
Kai and Fang Lu

353
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,030
will join your team.

354
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,070
Okay?

355
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,790
Chief.

356
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,830
Why do they have two and us three?

357
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,090
Kai, no need to join us.

358
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,180
One more for your team.

359
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,640
Haoxin.

360
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,550
You go.

361
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,510
No, Chief–

362
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,240
Wait.

363
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,810
Listen to me. Sit down.

364
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,680
Now,

365
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,440
you form a task force.

366
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,510
Ding Qi will be the team leader.

367
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,400
You will pretend to be employees

368
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,590
and personal bodyguards

369
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,640
to investigate secretly

370
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,680
and find Squid.

371
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,270
Okay?

372
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,200
Okay.

373
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,500
Why is he the only one saying okay?

374
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,030
Call me Boss!

375
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,510
Boss!

376
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,640
Not me.

377
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,070
Boss!

378
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,790
Okay.

379
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,170
Boss.

380
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,480
You're old.

381
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,310
Don't call me that.

382
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,920
I-I didn't mean that.

383
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,290
Division 1 come to us

384
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,790
when they have cases

385
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,790
they can't solve.

386
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,320
Why are you trying to

387
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,380
show off this time?

388
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,790
Well...

389
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,310
I think I can solve this case.

390
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,480
Besides, if I solve it,

391
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,610
you'll be promoted.

392
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,030
That makes sense.

393
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,790
But this time,

394
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,000
you're taking away all the people

395
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,880
in our department.

396
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,960
Only I'm left behind.

397
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,490
Besides,

398
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,830
can you handle

399
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,790
Huang Yuan and the others?

400
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,790
Do you trust me?

401
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,240
Do you?

402
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,030
[November 28, 2024]

403
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,960
I heard from them that

404
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,160
if you get the authorization,

405
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,550
you can tap the whole world?

406
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,550
Do you have the authorization?

407
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,400
I do.

408
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,130
I can too, then.

409
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,750
Who can have that much authority?

410
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,950
What do you have then?

411
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,590
Monitoring equipment?

412
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,790
Where did you get it?

413
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,480
I bought it.

414
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,510
Seven years ago,

415
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,590
Mo Yuanzhi, a doctor,

416
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,590
announced that he developed

417
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,650
a new genetic technology called RAN,

418
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,050
making him his first huge amount
of money.

419
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,000
One year later,

420
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,270
Moma Biotechnology announced

421
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,720
the initial development of
RAN-2 is successful.

422
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,160
In the same year, he married

423
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,880
the daughter of
the famous investor Yu Yinghua,

424
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,920
Yu Shiya.

425
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,830
Officer Ding, right?

426
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,680
I'm Mo Yuanzhi.

427
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,200
Hello.

428
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,480
Don't call me

429
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,440
Office for now.

430
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,350
Call me Qi.

431
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,270
Sorry for the trouble.

432
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,680
Can I go take a look at your office?

433
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,350
Of course.

434
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,270
Here.

435
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,970
Please.

436
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,640
Would you like something to drink?

437
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,440
Coffee or tea?

438
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,550
No, thanks.

439
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,720
Based on your experience,

440
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,640
when do you think Squid

441
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,880
will take action?

442
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
It's hard to say.

443
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,200
I also want to ask you.

444
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,440
From your point of view,

445
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,590
why do you think Squid

446
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,750
is targeting Moma?

447
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,160
The production of our genetic medication

448
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,790
has greatly affected
traditional pharmaceutical companies.

449
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,240
Even a few years back,

450
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,370
we'd already made countless enemies.

451
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,200
And this year,

452
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,160
we have a project
called RAN-X

453
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,400
that's about to enter
the clinical trial stage.

454
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,110
Once the experiment succeeds,

455
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,000
and it enters the market,

456
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,310
this is no exaggeration,

457
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,550
but at least half
of these companies

458
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,590
will be affected.

459
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,640
Moma has affected too many people.

460
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,750
People like Squid

461
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,550
who wants to make Moma disappear

462
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,450
are plenty.

463
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,330
Please don't mind.

464
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,780
I'm sorry. This is embarrassing.

465
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,160
I can only

466
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,010
commemorate them in this way.

467
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,880
After all, according to your requirements,

468
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,030
I can't attend

469
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,160
Tang's funeral.

470
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,110
Of course, I know

471
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,970
you're doing this for my own good.

472
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,790
In the building,

473
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,310
there will be other colleagues of mine
protecting you round the clock.

474
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,880
But...

475
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,830
let's work together.

476
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,960
I hope you don't hide anything from us.

477
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,150
For your safety.

478
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:57,750
Okay.

479
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,610
Let my secretary show you around.

480
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,200
Can I take a walk by myself?

481
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,750
Sure.

482
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,070
Mr. Ding.

483
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,510
This is the staff pass you requested.

484
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,440
Okay, thank you.

485
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,790
Who are you?

486
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,230
The CEO's assistant?

487
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,920
A bodyguard?

488
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,470
The president cherishes his life, huh.

489
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,720
Why are you here

490
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,760
instead of being around the CEO.

491
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,030
I just joined today.

492
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,690
I'm just taking a look around.

493
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,510
Han Yufei.

494
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,440
He's the son of the executive
that was murdered, Han Song.

495
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,880
He's a playboy that does nothing all day.

496
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,680
He dresses gaudily all day long.

497
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,790
After his father died,

498
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,200
he joined Moma Group.

499
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,070
He has no position,

500
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,070
but he has shares.

501
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,890
He is now
the second largest shareholder of Moma.

502
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,680
Officer Ding?

503
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,920
Mr. Ding.

504
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,920
You're starting work so soon?

505
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,250
Not going to take a rest?

506
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,590
I can be calmer

507
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,450
when I have something to do.

508
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,160
Thank you for what you did before.

509
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,360
It's what I should do.

510
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,550
Ms. Tang.

511
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,710
I'm getting back to work.

512
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,960
Tang Xin.

513
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,820
You've met her.

514
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,270
She's the daughter of
the principal scientist,

515
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,270
Tang Shaorong.

516
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,030
She just graduated from university.

517
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,960
Three months ago,
she joined Moma Biotechnology

518
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,090
and started at the bottom as an intern.

519
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,920
But her father unexpectedly died.

520
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,790
Her identity right now is very special.

521
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,240
While she's also at the lowest level,
an intern researcher,

522
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,070
at the same time.,

523
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,730

the third large shareholder of Moma.

524

525
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,750

528
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,950
Any floor is fine.

529
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,250

530

531
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,590
Not bad.

532
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,810
Don't I look like a CEO?

533

534
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,310

535
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,440

536
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,960

537
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,720

538
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,040

539
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,090

540
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,790

542
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,860

543

544
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,720

545
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,590
This is Officer Ding,
sent by the police to protect me.

546
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,650
This is my wife, Ya.

547
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,920
Thank you, Officer Ding.

548
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,120
It's what I should do.

549
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,040
Let's go, honey.

550
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,590
Okay.

551
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,280
Officer Ding.

552

Take my car.

553
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,200
Mo Yuanzhi's wife, Yu Shiya,

554
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,240
is the daughter of a famous investor.

555
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,720
She's married to Mo Yuanzhi for six years.

556
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,960
They don't have any kids.

557
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,790
If anything happens to Mo Yuanzhi,

558
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,160
most of his assets

559
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,240
and shares worth billions

560
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,240
will be hers.

561
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,830
Besides,

562
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,400
with the two special treatments

563
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,160
that Moma Biotechnology has,

564
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,970
they can continue to profit

565
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,200
for another 20 years.

566
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,600
Thank you.

567
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,590
Is this your cars?

568
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,400
Yes.

569
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,390
We usually drive them
when we go out ourselves.

570
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,680
Officer Ding.

571
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,880
Take this key card

572
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,640
for now.

573
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,830
Okay, thank you.

574
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,960
Sir, I'm leaving first.

575

576
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,110
Mr. Mo.

577
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,010
Can you show me around?

578
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,480
Okay.

579
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,070
I'll accompany you.

580

582
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,000
Take a look.

583
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,400
Do you want some water, Officer Ding?

584
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,350
No, thanks.

585
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,730
Can I take a look upstairs?

586
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,270
Yes.

587
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,360

588
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,070

705

Have this beef. It's really tender.

706
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,000
Really?

707
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,800
Come on, eat.

708
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,510
Eat up.

709
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,290
Who ordered this squid?

710
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,800
Any problem?

711
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,630
We're now bodyguards instead of policemen

712
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,000
thanks to Squid.

713
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,030
Why did you order it?

714
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,840
I think

715
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,400
catching Squid too quickly

716
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,670
wouldn't be a good thing too.

717
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,070
Why?

718
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,760
Why?

719
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,230
After catching him,

720
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,000
we have to return to Huang Yuan.

721
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,090
That's boring.

722
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,230
Captain Duan doesn't want to leave you.

723
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,190
Come to Division 4.

724
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,880
We're like a family.

725
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,440
It's warm in there.

726
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,400
Anyway,

727
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,800
when you go back to Huang Yuan,

728
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,670
you have to see him

729
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,920
with a sullen face all the time,

730
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,510
right?

731
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,960
What do you mean?

732
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,820
Means he looks pissed off.

733
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,150
Come on.

734
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,400
Let's have a drink.

735
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,360
Welcome to Division 4.

736
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:30,820
Come on!

737
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,980
It's a deal!

738
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,920
Deal!

739
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,670
Let's drink!

740
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,980
Speaking of which,

741
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,760
you've heard about what happened

742
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,030
at Dafa Bank, right?

743
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,110
Yes.

744
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,670
I fought six thieves singlehandedly.

745
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,710
Five, five.

746
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,440
Five.

747
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,230
Five.

748
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,110
With one gun,

749
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,630
I faced six of them with 12 bullets.

750
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,880
When I was about to shoot,

751
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,760
I went left and right,

752
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,670
and turned around–

753
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,440
I've paid the bill.

754
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,110
I can't stand it anymore.

755
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm leaving.

756
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,030
Thank you, Boss.

757
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,510
What?

758
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,150
You're leaving?

759
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,070
Can't stand it anymore?

760
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,150
Listen a little longer.

761
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,280
Don't let him dance.

762
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,230
How about I sing?

763
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,840
No need.

764
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,880
Sure!

765
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,440
Come on.

766
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,920
I've known you for so long.

767
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,360
I've never seen you working.

768
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,960
You look different.

769
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,320
What's different?

770
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,440
It feels like

771
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,930
you're holding some energies in.

772
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,880
I've mentioned my research to you before.

773
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,660
-Genetic experiment on nerve growth.
-Genetic experiment on nerve growth.

774
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,160
You remember?

775
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,880
I remember every word you said.

776
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,630
I-I mean...

777
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,800
the Moma case is not over yet.

778
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,360
Don't...

779
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,760
talk to strangers

780
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,640
or walk alone at night.

781
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,110
Is this an order

782
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,400
from you to me?

783
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,800
It's not an order.

784
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,800
It's a personal request.

785
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Actually,

786
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,040
I want to ask you a question.

787
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,230
Are you kind to me

788
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,200
because of the guilt
you feel towards my mom

789
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,070
or

790
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,590
is there another reason?

791
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,800
What reason?

792
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,520
Do you really not understand

793
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,030
or do you dare not understand?
