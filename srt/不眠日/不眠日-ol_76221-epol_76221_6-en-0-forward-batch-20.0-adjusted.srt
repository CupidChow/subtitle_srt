00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,680
I signed the resignation agreement
three months ago,

60
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,920
but I still haven't received
the compensation.

I've made it very clear in the message.

64
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,190
The company found that
you had violated regulations,

65
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,830
so the compensation payment
cannot be made for now.

handling the connection this time.

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,440
This morning,

176
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,750
I finalized the selection for

177
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,080
the Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of the R&D Department.

178
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,650
Who is it?

179
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,250
Who is it?

180
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,000
An Lan.

181
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,960
Today, I want you all to know that

182
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,320
for Moma,

183
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,720
the most valuable people

184
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,450
are always those
who hold the core technologies.

185
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,120
We are very sincere

186
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,180
and I hope you guys can work together.

187
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,900
After meeting the president,

188
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,360
then we shall see.

189
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,390
Cool.

190
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,150
An Lan is currently at the immigration
checkpoint picking up the investor.

191
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,240
They'll arrive here soon.

192
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Get ready immediately.

193
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,720
Around what time will they arrive?

194
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,870
They are on the highway right now,

195
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,870
so they should be here soon.

196
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,270
Hurry up.

197
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:17,670
Got it.

198
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,600
At 10:15 a.m. on December 12,

199
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,840
a multi-vehicle collision took place

200
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,770
near the M15 Junction on Highway 1.

201
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,750
Hello?

202
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,730
An Lan.

203
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,560
Where are you?

204
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,550
On my way back to the company.

205
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,150
What's your exact location?

206
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,200
M17 Junction

207
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,750
on Highway 1.

208
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,860
Have the driver change the route

209
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,190
and exit the highway early
at the M16 Exit.

210
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,240
What?

211
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,750
Trust me. Do it now.

212
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,390
Sir.

213
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,210
Please take the next exit ahead.

214
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,570
But taking this route
will add a lot of extra distance.

215
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,230
Give your phone to the driver.

216
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,970
Reroute immediately!

217
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,950
The route has been successfully
recalculated for you.

218
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,480
Who is he?

219
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,920
Just... One of my friends.

220
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,200
Excuse me.

221
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,660
Have you seen this person?

222
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,360
No.

223
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,000
Excuse me.

224
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,460
Have you seen this person?

225
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,240
No.

226
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,510
We should be able to reach

227
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,480
Moma headquarters in about 10 minutes.

228
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,550
Although we're a bit late,

229
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,320
we should still be on time.

230
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,910
Yeah.

231
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,480
What is going on over there?

232
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,720
Why are there so many people?

233
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,080
I'll go check.

234
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,700
Never seen him.

235
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,870
He looks a bit familiar.

236
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,660
Take a closer look.

237
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,270
I can't quite remember.

238
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,750
Got it.

239
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,560
Come here.

240
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,610
Do you remember him now?

241
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,780
Police, huh?

242
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,820
I remember now.

243
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,790
Ye Kun.

244
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,390
We worked as extras together
for a few days.

245
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,150
This guy

246
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,120
is good at martial arts,

247
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
so he played quite a lot of
those flying-around roles,

248
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,440
while we only got to play the roles
walking on the ground.

249
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,360
Where is he now?

250
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,510
I don't know where he is.

251
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,390
But if he's still flying through the air,

252
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,790
he must be in the studios.

253
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,750
Someone's trying to jump off
a building ahead.

254
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,350
It seems they lost heavily
in the stock market.

255
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,720
Shall we walk over?

256
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,550
Yes.

257
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,960
I still have to catch a flight
a little later this afternoon.

258
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,790
Give me one sec.

259
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,320
Okay.

260
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,960
Get ready for shooting!

261
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,290
Costume team, hurry up!

262
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,320
Do you know him?

263
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,510
Oh, Kun.

264
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,870
He's a stunt extra
from the martial arts team.

265
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,600
He's on leave today.

266
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,730
He said he was going to pick someone up.

267
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,320
Okay.

268
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,250
I'll send you the location.

269
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,810
So there's a café nearby.

270
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,470
We'll meet Mr. Mo over there.

271
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,440
He's on his way now.

272
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,320
Okay, sure.

273
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,750
Sir, we'll get off here.

274
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,820
Have you seen this person?

275
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,500
Yes.

276
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,650
He's a regular here.

277
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,180
Do you know where he lives?

278
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,270
He lives

279
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,790
in that building nearby.

280
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,790
Which building?

281
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,089
We go this way?

282
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,359
Yes, this way.

283
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,440
Qi.

284
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:39,160
Let's go to a café.

285
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,920
We'll meet the investors there instead.

286
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,829
Which café?

287
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:43,510
Not far. Super Coffee.

288
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,280
[Fang Lu, find the Super Coffee nearby,
go set up early, and stay undercover.]

289
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,550
Ye Kun is on leave today
to pick someone up,

290
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,680
but he didn't say where.

291
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,310
But I've found the area

292
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,790
where he usually hangs out.

293
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,190
I'll go look there again.

294
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,490
Why change the location?

295
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,000
They're stuck on Paris Middle Street.

296
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,930
Apparently, someone is about to
jump off a building.

297
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,550
Around 11 o'clock today,

298
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,960
someone tried to jump off the rooftop
of Yuehai Building,

299
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,490
the highest building
on Paris Middle Street.

300
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,160
The jumper has been in a standoff
with the police for hours,

301
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,350
causing major traffic jams

302
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,350
and gridlock in the nearby streets.

303
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,590
Tang Xin.

304
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,350
Let's talk.

305
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,160
Go ahead.

306
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
Moma is divided into two factions:

307
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
the tech faction and the finance faction.

308
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,160
Which one do you think you belong to?

309
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,560
I don't belong to either.

310
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,160
I don't like picking sides.

311
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,400
There's no middle ground.

312
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,920
Those stuck in between

313
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,440
never get any bread.

314
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,030
Then just take me

315
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,350
as my dad's shadow.

316
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,790
The tech faction.

317
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,880
You're just an intern,

318
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,470
a junior technician.

319
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,000
When do you think you'll be able to

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,800
climb to the top of the pyramid
of core technology?

321
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,310
Ms. Yu,

322
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,200
what exactly are you trying to say?

323
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,400
You're not as simple as you appear to be.

324
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,480
Although you seem like

325
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,720
an innocent little rabbit,

326
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,520
you've never stopped scouting.

327
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,690
Sniffing around, exploring,

328
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,180
always searching for someone to rely on.

329
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,300
If you haven't found that person yet,

330
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,400
come to me.

331
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,400
I really don't like picking sides.

332
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,310
And I believe

333
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,110
my dad didn't like picking sides

334
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,480
back when he was working in Moma, either.

335
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,430
Everyone is in their own faction,

336
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,270
and your dad was no exception.

337
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,000
You seem to be

338
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
quite close to An Lan recently.

339
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,640
But what's the use of her?

340
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,310
Although Mr. Mo gave her
some minor authority,

341
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,790
high-level tech executives
without significant shares

342
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,030
are still just employees.

343
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,030
I'm sorry, Ms. Yu.

344
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,590
An Lan and I are just colleagues,

345
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,110
merely working together.

346
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
Our relationship

347
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,960
is simply that of a junior technician

348
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,160
and a senior technician.

349
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,310
Ms. Yu.

350
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,400
I've voted today.

351
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,240
It can't be changed.

352
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,920
But I don't understand

353
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,030
why you want to oppose your husband.

354
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
I'm actually just like you.

355
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,640
You came to Moma

356
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,350
to preserve your father's legacy.

357
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,010
My situation is no different.

358
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,440
Do you like the current situation?

359
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,960
You don't.

360
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,310
Neither do I.

361
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,360
But we have no choice.

362
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,920
We have to preserve our business.

363
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,440
Moma is like a weighing scale.

364
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,830
Once it's out of balance,

365
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,110
everything will be in chaos.

366
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,840
This also applies to my family.

367
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,110
So I'm not opposing Mr. Mo.

368
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,030
I'm just maintaining balance.

369
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,350
Did my action today

370
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,790
make your scale lose balance?

371
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,510
Not yet.

372
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,030
But if you stand on my side,

373
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,240
you can stand more firmly.

374
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,300
Stop trying to get credit from Mr. Mo.

375
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,980
He won't be able to give you anything.

376
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,510
You're not An Lan.

377
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,530
You're of no use to him.

378
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,820
Think about it carefully.

379
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,200
Come over next time.

380
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,920
I'll show you around.

381
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,640
Thanks.

382
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,070
Are we there yet?

383
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,130
We're almost here.

384
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,830
This way.

385
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,310
Two Americanos.

386
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,630
Thank you.

387
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,510
What do you wanna drink?

388
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,110
I'd like a dark roast flat white with ice.

389
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,750
Okay.

390
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,960
One hot Americano, please.

391
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,490
Okay, please wait a moment.

392
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
Let's sit over there?

393
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,310
Okay.

394
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,790
Thank you.

395
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,370
Two Americanos.

396
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,560
Send them over there please.

397
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Mr. Mo is here.

398
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,270
Okay.

399
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,960
Mr. Mo, please allow me to introduce.

400
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,830
This is Maggie.

401
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,350
Mr. Mo.

402
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,790
Nice to meet you.

403
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,070
Nice to meet you, Maggie.

404
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,960
I'm sorry for the rush.

405
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,590
It's okay.

406
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,000
Please have a seat.

407
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,640
Okay.

408
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,830
It's our honor that Volly is interested

409
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,000
in this investment.

410
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,110
Maggie said that

411
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,310
regarding the cooperation,

412
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,310
she'd like to make a decision
after meeting you in person.

413
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,880
Okay.

414
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,860
You'll see Moma's sincerity.

415
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,490
I'm looking forward to it.

416
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,350
So let's...

417
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,880
Dark roast flat white with ice.

418
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,440
Thank you.

419
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,350
Your Americano.

420
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,950
Thank you.

421
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,750
Sir,

422
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,350
would you like anything else?

423
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,610
Not for now. Thank you.

424
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,000
Now, let's talk about the details.

425
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,000
Okay.

426
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,240
Volly is willing to sign

427
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,790
a bet agreement with Moma,

428
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,440
with the investment amount
about $200 million.

429
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,240
According to the bet agreement,

430
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,350
if Moma's performance grew
by more than 50%

431
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,680
in the first three years
after receiving the investment...

432
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,620
Boss, the one in red
is the celebrity, Fang Zhou.

433
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,270
This morning,

434
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,960
celebrity Fang Zhou appeared at a café

435
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,070
and was surrounded by fans,

436
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,310
causing a stampede at the scene.

437
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,710
The injured have been sent
to the hospital.

438
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,640
Mr. Mo.

439
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,560
Can we go somewhere else?

440
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,330
Put on your mask.

441
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,670
Fang Zhou!

442
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,590
Fang Zhou!

443
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,070
Sign for me, Fang Zhou!

444
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,920
Fang Zhou, give me your signature!

445
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,120
Keep it down, please!

446
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,830
Don't push!

447
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,510
Fang Zhou, look at me!

448
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,110
Fang Zhou, I love you!

449
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,810
Please keep it down!

450
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,590
One by one!

451
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,680
Fire!

452
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,880
This place is on fire!

453
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,070
Move!

454
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,480
Make way!

455
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,070
Make way!

456
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,480
Move!

457
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,710
Duck down and bend over
as you head outside!

458
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,710
Duck down and bend over! Be careful!

459
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,550
Go!

460
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,680
Go!

461
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,920
Watch your head!

462
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,590
Go!

463
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,500
Stop there!

464
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,200
Make way! Make way!

465
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,830
Move!

466
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,750
Move!

467
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,580
Move aside!

468
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,160
Make way!

469
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,790
Watch out!

470
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,320
Are you okay?

471
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,270
What happened?

472
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,600
Go support Boss! Hurry!

473
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,510
Move! Move!

474
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,200
Afraid of death?

475
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,400
Of course.

476
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,080
Who doesn't fear death?

477
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,000
People like us don't fear death.

478
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,720
What do you mean?

479
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,690
Don't move!

480
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,100
He's not a time loop perceiver.

481
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,050
Where's your phone?

482
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,640
Boss.

483
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,510
Why did you shoot?

484
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,750
In five minutes,

485
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,510
take him past

486
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,680
Mo Yuanzhi.

487
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,880
Make sure Mo Yuanzhi sees him.

488
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,850
In five minutes.

489
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,270
How do you feel?

490
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,750
Not that bad.

491
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,880
I still can move.

492
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,960
Which area?

493
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,550
The ankle.

494
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,590
The ankle.

495
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,750
How are you?

496
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,550
Are you hurt?

497
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,680
Thank you for saving me.

498
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,350
You're welcome. It's what I should do.

499
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,410
I'll remember you.

500
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,410
I'd like to be friends with you.

501
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,440
Ms. An, I think I saved you too.

502
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,110
Do you want to

503
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,440
be friends with me too?

504
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,790
I'll remember you too.

505
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,110
Thank you.

506
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
How did you know about the accident?

507
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:17,960
Maggie.

508
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,310
If you feel okay,

509
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,440
I have a suggestion.

510
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,510
You could say
we've been through hardships together.

511
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,400
How about we finish

512
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,330
our discussion?

513
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,680
What I'm about to say
is from the bottom of my heart.

514
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,960
Qi is here.

515
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,240
I won't lie in front of the police.

516
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,590
Moma's current financial situation
is very poor.

517
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,590
You know that.

518
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,460
Within a month,

519
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,790
two of our executives were killed
one after another.

520
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,580
The reason behind it is very ironic.

521
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,640
All just because
we encroached on someone else's turf.

522
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,830
Once the research on
the RAN gene-based drug

523
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,880
succeeds,

524
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,590
at least more than half of
the traditional pharmaceutical companies

525
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,350
will be affected.

526
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:56,920
So,

527
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,920
they don't want Moma to survive.

528
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,030
They don't want me to survive, either.

529
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,750
But it's precisely
because of their actions

530
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,510
that I realized

531
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,920
how outstanding our RAN technology is.

532
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,030
But as long as Moma survives,

533
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,590
the research on gene-based drugs

534
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,000
will definitely succeed.

535
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,750
RAN-X's development

536
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,350
has reached the final stage.

537
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,720
Volly will be the biggest winner.

538
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,440
No matter what,

539
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,680
I will lead the team

540
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,200
to continue the research.

541
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,240
Volly stepped in
during our time of crisis.

542
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,310
We'll definitely honor our promise.

543
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Whether you

544
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,190
want to invest or not

545
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,710
will test both your judgment

546
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,840
and your courage.

547
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,840
Okay.

548
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,230
I'll report to the headquarters

549
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,190
and give you an answer
as soon as possible.

550
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,920
Okay.

551
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,030
Is he Squid?

552
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,320
We don't know yet.

553
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,739
Do you know him?

554
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,150
Do they really not know Ye Kun,

555
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,030
or

556
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,740
is there a skilled performer
hidden in here?

557
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,360
Sorry, Officer Ding.

558
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,360
I need to leave the country immediately

559
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,670
to catch the afternoon flight
from Xinggang to New York.

560
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,190
If you need my cooperation with anything,

561
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,440
you can contact me via email

562
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,880
or video call.

563
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,670
Okay.

564
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,590
I'll get someone to give you a ride.

565
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,590
Thank you so much.

566
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,220
Give her a ride.

567
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,510
As for this investment,

568
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,320
I'm very optimistic.

569
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,320
I'll give you an answer
as soon as possible.

570
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,920
I'll wait for your good news.

571
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,920
He's cute.

572
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,080
Take care.

573
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,320
You too.

574
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,520
After midnight,

575
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,920
you'll still return to Hua'ao.

576
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
What's your name?

577
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,050
Can't you understand Cantonese?

578
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,880
What's your name?

579
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,710
Speak.

580
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:39,840
Okay.

581
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,280
There are surveillance cameras
all around the square.

582
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,880
I don't need your testimony.

583
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,440
I didn't do anything.

584
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,770
You didn't do anything?

585
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,470
Then who threw the smoke bomb?

586
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,430
What smoke bomb?

587
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,400
Fine.

588
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,750
If you don't admit it,

589
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,590
I'll show you
the surveillance footage later.

590
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,760
It wasn't me who threw it anyway.

591
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,890
Then why did you run?

592
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,030
He chased me. Of course I had to run.

593
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,960
I didn't know who he was.

594
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,360
I had told you we're the police,
yet you kept running.

595
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,820
The police even shot at me?

596
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,670
He also said that
people like us aren't afraid of death.

597
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,400
Don't talk nonsense!

598
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,320
I'm not.

599
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,600
What does "people like us" mean?

600
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,630
What does "people like us" refer to?

601
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,030
I have my own difficulties.

602
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,110
Besides,

603
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,510
was it really necessary

604
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,510
for you to write to Mr. Mo about this?

605
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,190
Watch where you're going!

606
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,440
If you have a death wish,
stay away from me!

607
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,280
How could you be so careless?

608
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,190
I'm sorry.

609
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,670
Fortunately, the incident

610
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,590
didn't cause serious casualties.

611
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,400
According to statistics,

612
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,460
all those sent to the hospital so far
have only sustained minor injuries.

613
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:02,910
[News Information]

614
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:07,430
[The lecture at Ivy Bay University
this afternoon may be postponed.]

615
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,870
I know you have questions to ask.

616
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,400
Go ahead.

617
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,880
Do you think Squid's motive for murder

618
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,250
was really business competition?

619
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,400
First it was Han, then Tang.

620
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,090
And now it's my turn.

621
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,800
Obviously,

622
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,680
Squid just wants
to destroy Moma Technology.

623
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,160
Isn't that motive clear enough?

624
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,760
Then why did you suddenly reach out to

625
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,710
Volly Group

626
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,440
and Maggie?

627
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,480
I met Maggie

628
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,670
when I was an exchange student

629
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,590
in the U.S.

630
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,800
After graduation,

631
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,550
she joined Volly.

632
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,550
She told me a long time ago

633
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,750
that she wanted Volly to invest in Moma.

634
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,510
But to be honest,

635
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,510
at that time

636
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,030
I didn't have a say.

637
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,030
And at that time,

638
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,510
Moma didn't need Volly.

639
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,100
These past few days...

640
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,040
It's okay.

641
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,110
Tell Qi the truth.

642
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,510
At this point,

643
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,260
we don't deserve to
keep any secrets anymore.

644
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,510
During this period,

645
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,970
which is after
the executives' murder cases,

646
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,300
I got in contact with Maggie again

647
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
according to Mr. Mo's instructions.

648
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,760
I didn't expect that

649
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,550
Volly's interest in investing in Moma

650
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,670
actually increased instead of decreasing.

651
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,670
Early this morning,

652
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,710
Maggie texted me.

653
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,000
She said

654
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,230
she was in Xinggang,

655
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,360
and she was willing to come to Hua'ao

656
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,760
to visit Mr. Mo in person.

657
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,610
Early this morning?

658
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,070
When exactly?

659
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,880
At 0:15 a.m.

660
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,510
Maggie is actually the first person
to break the loop.

661
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,320
An Lan.

662
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,960
Have you got the materials
that Volly requested ready?

663
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,620
Right away.

664
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,190
Okay.

665
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,920
How is it?

666
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,880
There seems to be nothing off
with this Maggie.

667
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,480
Her identity seems genuine.

668
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,630
There are two and a half hours

669
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,400
until the university lecture.

670
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,030
I'm in the open,

671
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,250
while Squid is in the shadows.

672
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,000
In the first four loops,

673
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,800
nothing counts.

674
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,640
He could simply obstruct my sight,

675
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,150
making it impossible for me
to judge the direction

676
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,480
from which danger comes in the final loop.

677
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,710
Who exactly is he?
