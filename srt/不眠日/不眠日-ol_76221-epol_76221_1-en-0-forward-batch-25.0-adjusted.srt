a sense of familiarity.

531
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,920
Excuse me.

532
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,850
I'm getting off.

533
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,000
Beautiful,

534
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,490
give me your number.

535
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,360
Take a photo with me.

536
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,110
Come on.

537
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,960
No thanks.

538
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,440
Come on! It's just a photo!

539
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,300
Don't touch me!

540
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,710
What are you doing?

541
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,630
Get him!

542
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,530
Stop there!

543
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,320
Stop running!

544
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,360
Freeze!

545
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,750
Thank you.

546
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,240
With this power,

547
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,840
I'm sure I can make a change in the world.

548
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,760
So,

549
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,550
I want to do something more meaningful.

550
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,800
Come in.

551
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,630
Sir.

552
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,960
Intern Officer 2254,

553
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,090
reporting for duty.

554
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,110
Name?

555
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,440
Ding Qi.
