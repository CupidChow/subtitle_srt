00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,460
We're being too obvious.

172
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,190
If Squid is watching us,

173
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,710
he'll immediately know that the police

174
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,240
have a time loop perceiver.

175
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:03,059
[Criminal Investigation Bureau]

176
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,669
We've already investigated you.

177
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:00,870
I'll be watching you.

178
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,320
Remember,

179
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,550
never do anything illegal

180
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,360
just for money.

181
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,090
Understand?

182
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,360
Y-Yes.

183
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,000
What does this mean?

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,170
For the overtime fine.

185
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,780
Take it.

186
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,640
Thank you.

187
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,080
I'm taking it.

188
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,540
Thanks.

189
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,550
Got it.

190
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,340
Excuse me, please let me through.

191
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:47,840
Hello?

192
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm so sorry,

193
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,480
the food is delayed.

194
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,000
Just five minutes.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,060
I'll be there soon.

196
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,540
Really sorry about this.

197
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,420
Thank you.

198
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,860
Come quick, look!

199
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,890
What's wrong?

200
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,750
Someone's collapsed over there.

201
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,090
Hello, Boss!

202
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,650
What's wrong with you?

203
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,360
Fu Jun is dead.

204
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Did you know that?

205
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,500
What?

206
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,080
The medical examiner says

207
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
it was a heart attack.

208
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,960
He literally worked himself to death.

209
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,200
Today, you brought a bunch of people

210
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,670
to help you check the cake.

211
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,950
Did you find anything?

212
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,030
You found nothing.

213
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,510
What was the point of letting me

214
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,600
hold Fu Jun back?

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,460
Making him pay more fines?

216
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,790
He was desperately delivering food.

217
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,510
His death

218
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,510
is my fault.

219
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,510
After midnight,

220
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,840
he'll come back to life.

221
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,670
Next time,

222
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,460
we can change his fate.

Ms. Dong,

232
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,870
we got caught up in small talk earlier,

233
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,670
and I forgot to introduce you.

234
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,550
This is our

235
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,750
Assistant to the Chief Scientist,

236
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,320
An Lan.

237
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,550
Hello, Ms. Dong.

238
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,120
Nice to meet you.

239
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,000
Nice to meet you, too.

240
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
Ms. Dong provided strong support

241
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,900
for our previous project.

242
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,960
And you've met Peter

243
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,560
at the board meeting before.

244
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,360
Nice to see you again.

245
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,120
Nice to see you again.

246
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,790
Peter is also

247
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,720
Ms. Dong's husband.

248
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,750
Hello, Mr. Han.

249
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,800
Can I get your contact info?

250
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,300
Mr. Gao.

251
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,720
Long time no see.

252
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,030
Hi, Mr. Mo!

253
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,160
I'll leave you to it.

254
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,600
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

255
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Come here, An Lan.

256
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,630
You guys go ahead.

257
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,570
This is

258
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,600
our Assistant to the Chief Scientist,

259
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,240
Miss An Lan.

260
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,670
Hello.

261
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,150
Nice to meet you.

262
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,670
Hello.

263
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,290
Nice to meet you.

264
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,410
Tang will have a worthy successor.

265
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,870
Tang's departure

266
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,030
has been difficult for all of us.

267
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,910
But in terms of technology,

268
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,840
we cannot stop.

269
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,790
So now,

270
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,550
we must fully trust

271
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,710
An Lan's expertise.

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,240
Under Mr. Mo's leadership,

273
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,790
everything will certainly go smoothly.

274
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,390
I'm flattered.

275
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,190
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Mo.

276
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,670
Mr. Han,

277
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,270
could I add you?

278
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,910
Distinguished guests,

279
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,030
dear friends,

280
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,720
the wedding ceremony

281
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,790
of Mr. Liu Haotian and Miss Zhao Zixin

282
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,790
is about to begin.

283
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,870
We kindly request all guests

284
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,510
to take your seats now.

285
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,520
Thank you for your attendance.

286
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,320
The wedding ceremony

287
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,670
of Mr. Liu Haotian and Miss Zhao Zixin

288
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,080
now officially begins.

289
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,240
Please give a warm welcome
to the happy couple.

290
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,080
The couple will make their lifelong vows

291
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,360
under the witness of the priest.

292
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,520
Liu Haotian,

293
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,310
do you take

294
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,680
Zhao Zixin to be your wife?

295
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,880
In sickness

296
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,829
and in health,

297
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:33,030
for richer or for poorer?

298
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,880
Do you?

299
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,160
I do.

300
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,960
Zhao Zixin,

301
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,589
do you take

302
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:41,589
Liu Haotian to be your husband?

303
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,000
In sickness

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
and in health,

305
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,109
for richer or for poorer?

306
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,400
Do you?

307
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,160
I do.

308
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,350
I now pronounce

309
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,920
you husband and wife.

310
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,960
Let's all give them our blessings.

311
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,680
Thank you, priest, for your blessing.

312
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,000
Now the couple will exchange
their tokens of love.

313
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,240
Please pick up the rings.

314
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,350
Mr. Liu Haotian,

315
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,640
as the groom,

316
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,790
please place

317
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,190
this sacred ring on your beloved's finger.

318
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,240
Similarly,

319
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,440
Ms. Zhao Zixin,

320
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,640
as the bride,

321
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,680
please place

322
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,080
this sacred ring on your beloved's finger.

323
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Now,

324
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,310
you may kiss your bride.

325
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,680
Let's all give them our blessings.

326
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,680
At this moment,

327
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,310
I am honored to announce—

328
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,310
Peishan, follow her.

329
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,680
Ms. Zhao Zixin...

330
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,200
Roger.

331
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,070
Wedding ceremony

332
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,510
is now complete.

333
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,920
Now,

334
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,070
may I invite the newlyweds

335
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,070
to step forward to the champagne tower

336
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,550
to kick off...

337
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,070
Fang Lu.

338
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,920
The champagne celebration for us.

339
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,480
Roger.

340
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,680
Just as you begin

341
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,480
your happy life together,

342
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,440
please work together

343
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,510
to pour and fill
the champagne tower before you.

344
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,480
Just as you will join forces in life—

So, Peishan, I need you
to pull his records.

521
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,840
Which one?

522
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,430
This man right here. That's him.

523
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,120
Found anything?

524
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,150
There's barely any information about him,

525
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,550
except for a registered address.

526
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,150
What's the location?

527
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,670
I'll go check it out.

528
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,470
Don't bother.

529
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,360
That place was demolished the year before.

530
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,840
Kai.

531
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,890
Do whatever it takes

532
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,630
to find this person today.

533
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,570
Understood?

534
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,730
Understood.

535
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,320
I'm going to assign tasks.

536
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,360
Fang Lu will be with Tang Xin.

537
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,510
Peishan will be with Yu Shiya.

538
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,170
Gu Song will be with Han Yufei.

539
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,480
And you will be with me.

540
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,630
From today on,

541
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,440
you'll treat these 3 people

542
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,710
as the Squid.

543
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,580
That's all.

544
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,230
Split up and do your jobs.

545
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,000
Keep me updated

546
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
on any incidents.

547
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,880
Got it!

548
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,130
Stay safe.

549
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,670
Okay.

550
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,450
Why are you staring?

551
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,160
Ludicrous.

552
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,880
I'm back in top form again.

553
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,720
Thanks, Boss.

554
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,070
Why

555
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,520
did he say "again"?

556
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:20,480
[Morning of December 12, 2024]
[The Third Loop]

557
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,650
Let me take a raincheck on that.

558
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm sick.

559
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,030
My throat's not feeling well these days.

560
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,630
Good morning, Officer Ding.

561
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,470
Good morning.

562
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,150
Okay. Let's reschedule.

563
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,670
Bye.

564
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,530
Where is Mr. Mo?

565
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,230
He hasn't got up yet.

566
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,490
He didn't sleep until 4:00 this morning.

567
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,230
You need to see him for something?

568
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,910
Would you like me to wake him up?

569
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:22,460
No need.

570
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,740
I'll wait for him here.

571
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:24,840
Okay.

572
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,890
Suit yourself.

573
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,550
Why have Mo Yuanzhi's movements

574
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,550
changed?

575
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,690
The loop started only a few hours ago.

576
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,320
Who changed him?

577
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,400
Help me check

578
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,920
all of Mo Yuanzhi's
call records and emails

579
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,380
from last night until now.

580
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,630
Why?

581
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,230
He was still awake at 4 AM,

582
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,690
which means something important happened.

583
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,800
Right,

584
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,670
around 2 AM,

585
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,710
when I planted the GPS tracker

586
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,770
on Mo Yuanzhi's car as you requested,

587
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
I found that the hood was still warm.

588
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,760
2 AM?

589
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,770
That means he most likely
went out last night.

590
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,760
This is the email
his secretary sent at 3 AM.

591
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,920
It's his schedule for today.

592
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,550
Let me see.

593
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,970
[Schedule]

594
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,840
Is there...

595
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,170
anything wrong with it?

596
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,360
No.

597
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,490
Peishan,

598
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,480
if you were the Squid,

599
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,360
and you'd have to make a move today,

600
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,230
among these events,

601
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,760
which one would you choose?

602
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,320
Ivy Bay University, I think.

603
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,400
Why?

604
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,550
Because Mo Yuanzhi will be

605
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,590
giving a long speech at the university.

606
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,710
And the content of his speech

607
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,550
will definitely be related
to Moma Biotechnology.

608
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,760
The Squid's targets

609
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,090
are Moma's executives.

610
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,590
If Squid killed Mo Yuanzhi on site,

611
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,920
that'd be the biggest humiliation to Moma.

612
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,180
Isn't that exactly what the Squid wants?

613
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,220
Don't forget to send me the call records.

614
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,030
Morning, Mr. Mo.

615
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,210
Morning, Qi.

616
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,840
I heard you were still up at 4 AM.

617
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,880
Did you have that much work to do?

618
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
The company is in great turmoil,

619
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,440
and there're lots of personnel changes.

620
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,970
I was tied up
with calls and emails last night.

621
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,110
At a time like this,

622
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,310
staying disciplined is quite a luxury.

623
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,510
The person who Mo Yuanzhi

624
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,320
frequently contacted this morning

625
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,110
is An Lan.

626
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,770
Who initiated the contact?

627
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,880
An Lan did.

628
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,270
I want the contents.

629
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,290
That'd be a violation.

630
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,490
I want the contents.
