1
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,760
I'm patronizing your business,
so could you give me a discount?

2
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,930
It's only 50 yuan.

3
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,830
How dare you haggle with me?

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,990
I just want you to feel

5
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,010
how exhausting it is to be an artist.

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,160
Why do you sound just like my mom today?

7
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,810
It's like you two are of one mind.

8
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,680
I don't want to be your mother.

9
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,810
I just think that dreams and reality

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,740
are two different things.

11
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,200
So we must not be impulsive.

12
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,720
We need to think carefully
before making our choice.

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
Who was it that told me

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,440
to always hold fast to my dreams?

15
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,320
Why the change of attitude today?

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,760
Just the other day,
you were so excited telling me

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,850
you were going to Stanford.

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,480
Why are you feeling so down today?

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,880
Stanford Medical School

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,120

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,870
Why?

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,560
My exchange student spot

23
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,330
was taken by someone else.

24
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,789
Stanford says

25
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:35,200
I can go only if I pay for myself.

26
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,160
You are a top-performing medical student.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,270
That paper of yours

28
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,180
was even published in SCI.

29
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,280
You have to believe

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,789
that you are the best.

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,250
To us, fate has never been

32

It's multiple choice.

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,500
You can still choose to study abroad.

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,310
Let me ask you one question.

36
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,130
Do you truly love this field?

37
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,770
Of course.

38
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,009
Between love, passion and devotion,

39
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:00,940
what do you really feel?

40
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,270
What's the difference?

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,979
Loving it means
you can live with or without it.

42
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:07,310
Being passionate means

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,370
it's great to have it,
but you could live without it for a while.

44
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,620
Being devoted means

45
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,570
you can't live without it
for even a minute.

46
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,340
Then I must be...

47
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,420
devoted.

48
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,550
Then what are you waiting for?

49
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,460
What are you doing?

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,650
If you can't go as an exchange student,

51
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,130
then let's send you over as
a self-funded student.

56
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,140
Take it back.

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,090
But I will definitely get

58
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,780
my spot back.

almost everything inside was burned.

and there are no bodies either.

a teacher was inside.

We've confirmed multiple times.

entered at exactly 8:05 PM.

112
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,420
Besides the cameras,

113
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,860
at the basement exit outside,

114
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,620
there were many students around.

115
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,500
Many saw Jiang Yuwen enter,

116
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,980
but no one saw him leave.

117
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,180
Among the student witnesses

118
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,300
was Mo Yuanzhi.

Half a minute later,

120
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,460
the sudden explosion
broke out in the laboratory.

121
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,370
So Mo Yuanzhi

122
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,940
has a complete alibi.

After that,

124
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,330
did you ever look for Jiang Yuwen again?

125
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,860
We did. We searched for a long time,

126
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,540
but couldn't find him.

127

You Yuxiang came to make a report
after the incident.

131
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,010
He claimed he saw

132
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,810
Mo Yuanzhi kill Jiang Yuwen
with his own eyes.

133
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,030
He said there was blood everywhere,

134
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,830
and the weapon used was a dagger.

135
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,660
But I didn't believe it.

136
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,980
Because we couldn't find any evidence
to support it.

137
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,980
No suspect, no blood,

138
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,440
and no body was ever found.

139
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,260
So you're saying...

140
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,400
Mo Yuanzhi had a motive for murder, right?

141
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,910
No.

142

143
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,370
the one who suffered
the greatest loss in the fire

144
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,420
wasn't Jiang Yuwen,

145
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
it was Mo Yuanzhi.

146
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,860
He had a groundbreaking dataset
that was nearly complete,

147
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,980
but because of the fire,

148
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,580
it was all burned to nothing.

149
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,510
Burned to nothing?

150
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,270

But given the patient's
level of suffering,

200
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,570
0.5 mg doesn't seem sufficient.

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,370
Come outside, I'll tell you.

343
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,250
Okay.

344
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,660
Mom.

345
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,660
Mom.

346
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,970
You're awake.

347
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,660
Mom?

348
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,940
Can you hear me?

349
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,770
Mom.

350
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,210
Mom!

351
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:36,940
Mom.

352
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,580
If you can hear me,

353
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,730
blink your eyes.

354
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,080
Mom.

355
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:13,940
Mom?

356
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,250
Mom?

357
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,050
Mom.

358
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,210
Mom... Mom.

359
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,350
Peishan.

360
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,940
Please look up information
on these three individuals.

361
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,870
Especially him.

362
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Whatever it takes,

363
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,490
you must find out where he's living now.

364
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,340
Not his registered address,

365
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,450
but where he's actually staying.

366
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,780
I've sent you his usual areas of activity.

367
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:47,940
Wait.

368
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,290
Who is this?

369
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:57,860
Squid.

370
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,380
Squid?

371
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,580
You found him so quickly.

372
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,250
Who are these two?

373
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,050
Accomplices.

374
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,420
When did you find out?

375
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,290
Just hurry up with the search

376
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,820
and stop asking questions!

377
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,050
Squid?

378
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,290
Accomplices?

00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:06,050
I've sent you the location

382
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,310
you asked me to look up.

383
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,000
Kai, keep a close eye on Ye Kun

384
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,650
and update me immediately
if anything happens.

385
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,380
Understood.

386
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,190
This cold is killing me.

387
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,940
Boss.

388
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,800
Ye Kun is awake.

389
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
You need to hurry.

390

391

392
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,740
Ye Kun is on his way back.
