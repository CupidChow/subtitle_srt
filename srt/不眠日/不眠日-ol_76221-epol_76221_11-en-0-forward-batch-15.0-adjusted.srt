00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,080
This is Ye Kun's phone.

179
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,750
Qi asked me to give it to you.

180
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,390
He wants me to crack it, right?

181
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
His real name is

182
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,920
Feng Qiming.

183
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,440
Look into it carefully.

184
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,370
Is Qi and the others okay?

185
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,790
The best way to make Squid

186
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,790
lower his guard

187
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,490
is death.

188
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,500
Boss.

189
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,240
Qi,

190
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
are you guys okay?

191
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,360
Don't worry. We're fine.

192
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,510
That's good.

193
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,170
I want to...

194
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,030
regroup.

195
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,440
Okay.

196
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,280
I might know the answer now.

197
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,650
[Mourn Vale Medical Center]

198
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,720
An Lan.

199
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,940
I'm a bit scared.

200
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,130
Scared of what?

201
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,130
I'm scared I won't be

202
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,240
able to paint

203
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,550
or write anymore.

204
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,540
What's wrong with your hands?

205
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,030
My hands are

206
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,320
getting weaker and weaker.

207
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,290
This feeling is terrifying.

208
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,710
But it doesn't matter.

209
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,070
He doesn't let me paint anyway.

210
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,200
I can only paint in secret every day.

211
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,550
He? Who is he?

212
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,440
Do you think I'll get better?

213
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,070
Of course you will.

214
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,480
I'll be back soon,

215
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,510
and I'll come see you first thing.

216
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,880
The world keeps repeating,

217
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,350
and the pain keeps multiplying.

218
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,720
I'm in so much pain,

219
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,730
so much so that I can't breathe.

220
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,590
Every single second,

221
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,850
it feels like I'm being torn into pieces.

222
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,790
Every time I think

223
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,160
I've made it through the worst moments,

224
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,330
I discover...

225
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,200
that it's all happening again.

226
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,310
Eight years ago,

227
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,440
Feng Wanqing

228
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,550
received early experimental RAN treatment

229
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,030
at Mourn Vale Medical Center.

230
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,960
At that time,

231
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,830
those drugs were

232
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,760
still in the animal testing phase.

233
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,510
The treatment

234
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,300
was absolutely illegal.

235
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,310
It definitely wasn't just Feng Wanqing

236
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,960
receiving early experimental RAN treatment

237
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,030
at Mourn Vale Medical Center.

238
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,200
That small laboratory

239
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,190
could conduct experiments on many people.

240
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,480
There,

241
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,530
they were all terminal patients
on their death beds.

242
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,510
They had no other options

243
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,770
and never complained.

244
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,640
Any so-called new drug,

245
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,320
for them,

246
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,480
could be a lifesaver.

247
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,850
The RAN technology on Wanqing

248
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,720
achieved a major breakthrough.

249
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,480
At least

250
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,160
in the final days of her life,

251
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,920
she was once declared

252
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,310
cured.

253
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,440
This is a medical miracle.

254
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,310
Heaven has finally given us a chance

255
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,860
to spend the rest of our lives together.

256
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,900
But

257
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,510
this brief recovery

258
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,500
only lasted seven days.

259
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,790
After seven days,

260
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,200
Wanqing's condition

261
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,530
deteriorated rapidly.

262
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,680
Her body failed quickly.

263
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,790
She endured her final days

264
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,350
in extreme agony.

265
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,550
She said...

266
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,880
she was in too much pain.

267
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,440
The world keeps repeating,

268
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,760
and the pain keeps multiplying.

269
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,980
She wanted to leave this world urgently.

270
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,570
But she couldn't

271
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,010
bear to leave someone behind.

272
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,750
At that stage,

273
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,590
only two people had access

274
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,880
to RAN technology

275
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,280
and experimental drugs:

276
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,360
Mo Yuanzhi and Jiang Yuwen.

277
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,270
And the one who wants

278
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,220
Feng Wanqing to stay in this world

279
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,910
must be him.

280
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,610
Dr. An's car was

281
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,270
indeed fitted with a tracker.

282
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,270
Feng Qiming;

283
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,450
32 years old;

284
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,350
originally from Lanxi Town in Hua'ao.

285
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,270
At the age of 12,

286
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,400
he attended a sports school in Mabu.

287
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,960
At the age of 18,

288
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,230
he severely injured someone

289
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,360
in a fight at school

290
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,280
and served 15 years in prison in Mabu.

291
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,030
Ye Kun must be

292
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,159
his false identity
after returning to his home country.

293
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,739
This phone number of Ye Kun is new.

294
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,360
The only call record today

295
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,710
is a missed call.

296
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,340
The caller was

297
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,500
inside the Moma building at that time.

298
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,510
What is this?

299
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,240
A signal jammer.

300
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,710
I'm not sure

301
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,240
if you're being monitored.

302
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,460
What do you want to tell me?

303
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,250
I need your help.

304
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,920
With some things,

305
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,670
only you...

306
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,510
would believe me.

307
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,920
Remember

308
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,920
the phrase in Feng Wanqing's diary:

309
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,280
"The world keeps repeating,

310
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,140
and the pain keeps multiplying"?

311
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,090
How do you interpret it?

312
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,040
She was talking about

313
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,000
the torment of illness

314
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,180
being endless.

315
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,480
I think the repetition...

316
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
refers to a loop.

317
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,920
I know what I'm saying sounds crazy.

318
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,510
You... You have no reason to believe me,

319
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,150
but

320
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,590
it's actually really happening.

321
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,800
This world enters a loop

322
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,110
every once in a while,

323
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,800
and this day

324
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,190
repeats over and over

325
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,360
until the loop ends.

326
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,630
All people and creatures

327
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,360
don't remember what happened.

328
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,550
Then,

329
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,070
if nobody remembers,

330
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,830
who can prove the loop exists?

331
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,880
I can.

332
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,230
I don't know how to explain it,

333
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,150
and I don't know why,

334
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,710
but...

335
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,110
I'm different from everyone else.

336
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,960
I can remember everything that happened.

337
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,880
I can even change

338
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,510
the outcomes of events on this day.

339
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,440
Many people think
I can predict the future,

340
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,030
but...

341
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,160
I just have the memories.

342
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,000
I know what will happen,

343
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,530
so I can anticipate things.

344
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,230
You...

345
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,880
still don't believe me, do you?

346
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,280
Do you think I'm crazy?

347
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,720
Come with me.

348
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,230
In the past two years,

349
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,000
in my RAN experiments,

350
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,550
two strange things happened

351
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,190
that I cannot explain.

352
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,070
I haven't told anyone about it

353
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,710
because I know

354
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,630
nobody would believe me.

355
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,550
To explain these experimental phenomena,

356
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,810
I've looked through countless theories

357
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,320
in the branches of biology,

358
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,360
ethology,

359
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,840
chemistry, psychology,

360
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,510
and

361
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,000
physics.

362
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,070
Among all the possibilities
I've deduced,

363
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,440
there is also

364
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,370
this answer.

365
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,260
[Foreknowledge?]

366
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,930
When I wrote down this deduction,

367
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,320
I was also

368
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,320
wondering if I had gone mad.

369
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,880
But among all these deductions,

370
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,340
only this one

371
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,380
perfectly explains RN356's behavior.

372
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,000
What is RN356?

373
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,510
It was

374
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,000
a lab mouse with abnormal behavior.

375
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,590
Indeed,

376
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,550
I'm the type

377
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,320
to bring lab mice home.

378
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,070
I need to constantly monitor

379
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,770
my special test subjects.

380
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
This maze is used

381
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,280
to test the memory

382
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
and learning abilities of lab mice.

383
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,740
It's even more complex
than the Tolman maze.

384
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,150
A year ago,

385
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,510
I used it to test

386
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,320
the effects

387
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,670
of RAN-Y on neural repair in mice.

388
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,480
I used two groups of lab mice.

389
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,800
One group had neural defects,

390
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,600
and the other were healthy mice.

391
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,710
I injected the reagent

392
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,320
into all the mice,

393
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,840
but nothing happened.

394
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,000
The vital signs of both groups

395
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,860
remained exactly the same
as before the injection.

396
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,760
Just when I thought

397
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,620
the experiment was going to fail,

398
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,230
I suddenly discovered

399
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,150
that in the healthy group,

400
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,480
there was one strange mouse.

401
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,880
Its code name was RN356.

402
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,920
It had a special ability.

403
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,960
No matter how I changed the maze,

404
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,320
it could accurately avoid dangers

405
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,480
and precisely locate the food reward.

406
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,150
After numerous experiments,

407
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,510
I discovered that RN356's ability

408
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,110
didn't come from

409
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,150
repeated learning and memory,

410
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,070
but rather seemed like

411
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,110
a kind of inexplicable

412
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,400
foreknowledge.

413
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,920
It was too special.

414
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,360
So,

415
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,480
I reported the results

416
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,440
to the chief scientist at that time,

417
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,300
Tang Shaorong.

418
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,230
However,

419
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,230
when I wanted to
demonstrate it to Mr. Tang,

420
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,880
RN356 had lost this ability.

421
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,880
This proves that your discovery

422
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,210
was just a coincidence.

423
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,760
This kind of experimental data

424
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,090
can't be used for scientific research

425
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,600
or in experimental reports.

426
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,200
If you have any doubts,

427
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,710
you can dissect RN356 to examine

428
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
its neural system

429
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,550
for any peculiarities.

430
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,710
But I suspect

431
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,630
you won't find anything.

432
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,320
So I brought RN356 home.

433
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,760
Almost daily,

434
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,670
I conducted the same experiment,

435
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,480
until its predictive ability

436
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,590
appeared again.

437
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,190
It only possessed this ability

438
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,480
on specific days.

439
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,880
I kept records.

440
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,880
But these dates showed

441
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,550
no pattern at all.

442
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,800
January 1, 2023.

443
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,510
February 25.

444
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,590
March 3.

445
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,920
March 29.

446
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:19,920
April 16.

447
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,300
May 19.

448
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,150
Right?

449
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,280
These are...

450
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,670
all loop days.
