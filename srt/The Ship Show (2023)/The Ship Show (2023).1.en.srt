1
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:23,311
Araw!

2
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:25,605
Araw!

3
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:27,816
Araw!

4
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:28,858
Dear!

5
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,543
Dear, dear!

6
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:31,610
Someone called!

7
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:33,239
Someone called just a while ago.

8
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:36,146
You got selected as
a semi-finalist for The Ship Show.

9
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:38,793
Did I apply for that?

10
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:42,278
Yes, it's the form
I made you sign last month.

11
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,025
Well then, get up from there.

12
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,341
The program staff will
call you for a phone interview.

13
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:48,879
Here it is, here it is!

14
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:51,157
There, answer it, answer it!

15
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:52,516
Go on, stand up!

16
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,403
This is what we've been
waiting for.

17
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:56,208
Put it on speaker!

18
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:07,107
Hello?

19
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,649
Good afternoon,
may I speak with Araw Macapinlac?

20
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,349
This is him.

21
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:19,324
Congratulations, you are shortlisted
as a finalist in The Ship Show,

22
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,052
the search for the next big love team.

23
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:24,341
I thought I was still a semi-finalist?

24
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:28,450
No, we decided to
make you a finalist.

25
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:30,583
Based on—

26
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:33,280
Yes, Araw?

27
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,703
Alright, thank you.

28
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:39,770
What can you say,
are you excited for The Ship Show?

29
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:42,032
That's fine!

30
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:43,726
- Yeah, yeah!
- Go ahead!

31
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:44,794
Yes.

32
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:47,420
I'm really excited.

33
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:50,981
We are too, please tell us
more about yourself.

34
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,344
What are you looking for
in a woman?

35
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:04,754
Nothing specific ma'am.
If we click, we click.

36
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:13,230
Philippines, welcome to The Ship Show!

37
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:17,481
Where 12 Love Birds were chosen
to stay together for a few days

38
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:19,862
in the House of Kilig.

39
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:23,724
Through various tests and challenges,
we will find out which couple

40
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:27,728
the viewers will ship to be
the next big love team.

41
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:29,296
Whose ship will sail?

42
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:31,255
Whose ship will sink?

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,660
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is The Ship Show!

44
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:37,379
Are you ready to get to know the ones

45
00:03:37,404 --> 00:03:40,616
who will make us feel giddy
in the next few days?

46
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:44,052
Shippers, meet our 12 Love Birds!

47
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:45,614
And, cut!

48
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:49,234
Alright, change outfits,
and let's do their makeup, okay? Thank you!

49
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,602
- Yes, direk.
- Direk, finally!

50
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:54,772
Here we are!
Oh, Dorian, this is it!

51
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:56,607
We were just conceptualizing this
during the pandemic

52
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,435
and here we are now.

53
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,130
This is our production
company's flagship show!

54
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:02,448
So I hope it becomes a hit.

55
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,366
That's right.

56
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:11,038
I just have a concern.
Did we choose the right finalists?

57
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:15,459
Because I saw many who were
more handsome, more beautiful...

58
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,086
Among the semi-finalists.

59
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:20,447
They didn't make it because you
and Jing eliminated them in favor of—

60
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:22,692
In favor of what, direk?

61
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,010
Ms. Jing!

62
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:26,279
Well... I mean...

63
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:29,638
Jing, it seems
we have better options.

64
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:33,247
Among the semi-finalists
who didn't make it, physically.

65
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:42,122
Direk, our show can't be just
about looks and figures, right?

66
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:45,656
If we want it to be talked
about not only on social media,

67
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:50,953
it's important that our Love Birds
have an interesting factor.

68
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:57,880
Yes, but Jing, let's not forget
our long-term goal, right?

69
00:04:57,905 --> 00:05:00,638
At the end of the Ship Show,
we need to find a love team

70
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:03,177
with commercial possibilities.

71
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,926
Endorsements, TV shows, movies.

72
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:09,179
Yes! And guestings,
festivals, ribbon-cutting.

73
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,521
Basically, those who will make money

74
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:14,554
for BenDo Production
and Artist Management, right?

75
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:19,964
From Love Birds to cash cows.
Am I right?

76
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:25,778
With all due respect, direk.

77
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:29,377
No matter how yummy your artists are.

78
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:32,238
And no matter how great
they are at acting...

79
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,466
It's all pointless, direk.

80
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,310
It's useless if our show
doesn't become a hit.

81
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:42,872
And that,
that's my role for you.

82
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:47,146
To keep things interesting,
right Dorian?

83
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,997
Of course, of course.

84
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:53,160
You are the Jing Pasion,
award-winning writer

85
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:57,025
of the country's best romantic
movies and series.

86
00:05:57,317 --> 00:06:01,090
Okay, good evening,
yes, good evening.

87
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:03,200
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening.

88
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:04,601
This is how it's going to happen.

89
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:07,002
We'll call your names one by one.

90
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:09,349
The girls first,
and then you boys.

91
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,535
When you hear your name,
stand by here at the back.

92
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,146
We'll play the introduction video
of the Love Bird we called.

93
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:22,111
You'll see the video on that screen,
so you'll know when the clip is done.

94
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,477
When will we
come out, direk?

95
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:25,755
After the clip.

96
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,906
Clip?

97
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:28,661
Clip!

98
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:30,866
Clip, video clip!

99
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:34,081
Ah, video clip.

100
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:37,626
After the introduction video,
you'll walk towards the front.

101
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:39,622
There are markers for each of you,

102
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:42,166
Just follow
the floor director's instructions.

103
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:44,191
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:47,010
Sir Dorian,
I have a question.

105
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:49,614
Are all the boys handsome?

106
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,850
I hope so, so it's exciting, right?

107
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:55,056
Well, they're all really handsome.

108
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,333
But here's my advice
to all of you.

109
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:00,127
I know you're all prim and proper but...

110
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:03,060
throughout the show,
when there's an opportunity-

111
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:06,450
Don't wait for the boys
to make the first move.

112
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:10,286
This is a competition,
if you like someone, go for it.

113
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,309
- Clear?
- Okay, got it.

114
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:17,766
Okay, cameras, don't be idle later,
I can't keep an eye on all of you.

115
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,942
If you see something interesting,
focus on it immediately, okay?

116
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:23,815
All set, direk?

117
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:25,092
15 minutes.

118
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:26,785
Alright,
I'll stand by outside.

119
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,543
I just thought of something.

120
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:32,939
What is it?

121
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:38,099
How can we make the process of
choosing the love team more exciting?

122
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:41,017
So... should we scrap the draw-lots?

123
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,349
It's kind of corny, like...
too random.

124
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:46,754
Let's surprise them.

125
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:51,099
Before their acquaintance party ends,
you announce, Dorian...

126
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:55,708
that within 30 seconds,
no, let's make it 20 seconds.

127
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:00,263
They need to choose who
they want as their love team.

128
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:04,060
And, it has to be a mutual choice.

129
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:08,083
But the result will be like they didn't
really think about their partnership.

130
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:12,688
That's how love stories begin, right?

131
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:18,192
The characters don't really think
about their decisions.

132
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:24,692
They just let fate take its course.

133
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:26,912
- I love it!
- I love it, too!

134
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:28,388
I love it!

135
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:32,699
Are you ready, Shippers?

136
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:33,940
Let's go and get to know.

137
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:37,846
One by one the six female
Love Birds of The Ship Show.

138
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:39,223
Oh, damn, here we go!

139
00:08:39,248 --> 00:08:41,892
Watch your words please,
your microphones are on.

140
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:42,809
Sorry.

141
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:46,964
Shippers, meet Belline De Dios
from Taguig City.

142
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:48,240
Shh!

143
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:50,277
Hi, Shippers! I'm Belline De Dios.

144
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:54,723
23 years old from Taguig City.
Specifically, from the BGC area.

145
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:56,444
Sheesh!

146
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,325
Currently, I work as
a commercial model.

147
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,786
You've probably seen
my face on posters

148
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,022
for various brands and products.

149
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:07,505
Here she is, Shippers,
Belline De Dios!

150
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:12,148
Who is she waving at,
there's no studio audience?

151
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:16,057
Fifi, Cora, tell the Love Birds
to look at the cameras!

152
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:17,146
Next!

153
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:20,264
Hello, Shippers! I'm Chia Encarnacion.

154
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:23,058
24 years old, from Olongapo City.

155
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,210
- She's an actress, right?
- I don't know her.

156
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,479
My only dream is to become an actress.

157
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:30,065
Be it in TV, theater,
or film.

158
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,467
I hope through the Ship Show,

159
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:36,474
I'll be given the opportunity
to showcase my talent.

160
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:40,742
Hey, Shippers! I'm Tintin Isip.

161
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:43,562
24, from Malolos, Bulacan.

162
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,589
Guys! I don't have a job, actually.

163
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:48,083
Mmm, just kidding!

164
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:53,349
Well, I'm a Sales Promoter at the mall.
Blenders, knives, and stuff!

165
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:56,675
I'm Marge Laban, I applied to Ship Show

166
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,910
because I'm so bored with my life.

167
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:02,575
I keep seeing the same faces
in Cabanatuan.

168
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,249
Hi, I'm Shey Roces!

169
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:06,818
And I hope to find the
right guy for me in here.

170
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,937
Hi, I'm Amor Sabado!

171
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:13,133
I want to experience being the one
who brings kilig to people.

172
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:18,966
Question, what kind of guy
are you looking for in a partner?

173
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:20,341
In one word.

174
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,434
- Let's start with Tintin.
- Oh!

175
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:23,493
I go first?

176
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:27,230
For me, maybe, charming!

177
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:28,423
Charming!

178
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:29,899
How about you, Marge?

179
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:32,385
- Mysterious.
- Mysterious!

180
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,427
Shey?

181
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:34,463
Cute.

182
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:35,505
Cute.

183
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,673
How about you, Belline?

184
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:39,951
I'm really attracted to manly men.

185
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:43,021
So I hope my partner is really manly.

186
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,415
And you, Amor?

187
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:47,602
I wonder...

188
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:49,836
Maybe,

189
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,353
intelligent.

190
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:53,815
Wow, Amor's a sapiosexual.

191
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,759
And there you have it, Shippers!

192
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:57,611
Our female Love Birds.

193
00:10:57,636 --> 00:11:02,200
I hope you find your ideal partner
among our male Love Birds.

194
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,394
And now it's time to meet the boys!

195
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:05,420
Sir!

196
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:12,051
I haven't answered yet.

197
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,612
Oh! Uh...

198
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,069
My bad, my bad.

199
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:18,307
Chia, how about you?

200
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:19,661
In one word.

201
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:23,578
What characteristic are you looking
for in a guy?

202
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:29,560
Is it for a real-life partner,
or a partner in a love team?

203
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:30,878
In general.

204
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:40,762
I'd like someone who brings out
the best version of myself,

205
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:44,656
instead of indulging my shortcomings.

206
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,270
Chia, just one word.

207
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,921
Inspiring.

208
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:55,886
[scoffs]

209
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:02,242
Guys, let's get ready.

210
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,755
Alright, let Ashley go first.

211
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:08,552
Hey, Shippers, I'm Ashley Astor.
25, from Pasay City.

212
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:12,373
I'm a ramp and fashion model,
and also a fitness instructor.

213
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:17,357
Hello, I'm Buddy Tanhueco, 18 years old
from Guagua, Pampanga.

214
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:20,974
I'm currently a college student taking up
Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy.

215
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:25,003
I'm Elbrich Bondoc, showband vocalist
from Batangas.

216
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:28,326
I joined here to help my parents

217
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,060
through a career in acting.

218
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:32,087
But of course, if I win,
there's the cash prize.

219
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:34,856
Hi, I'm Monti Villarosa.
I'm a Theatre actor.

220
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,877
I've appeared in various productions.

221
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:39,738
Ibong Adarna, The Crucible,
Spring Awakening.

222
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:42,919
I'm Nestor Coronel, 22 years old
from Baler, Aurora.

223
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:45,177
I help my grandma sell stuff
at the market.

224
00:12:45,202 --> 00:12:48,346
At night, I work as a waiter
at a restaurant on the beach.

225
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:51,349
I'm 24, from Cainta, Rizal.

226
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:53,005
An irregular college student.

227
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,716
I was supposed to enroll this year,
BS Psychology, but...

228
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:01,537
We don't have the money yet,
so I'm just staying at home.

229
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,948
My family thinks I'm good-looking,
so they had me join this.

230
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:10,811
Our last male Love Bird,
Araw Macapinlac.

231
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:17,373
There, our Love Birds
are complete, Shippers.

232
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:20,526
Boys, what are you
looking forward to?

233
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,844
Let's start with Ashley.

234
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:23,995
Of course, getting
to know all the girls.

235
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:27,699
Interacting with them,
especially those I'm interested in.

236
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:31,070
For me, I just want to enjoy
the moment.

237
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,903
Learn something from this experience.

238
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:39,825
Get to know myself better and
discover the true meaning of love.

239
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,202
Wow, sounds like that
came from somewhere.

240
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,505
Nestor?

241
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:47,745
For me, aside from being seen on TV,
I want to feel the kilig again.

242
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,545
It's been a while
since I last felt kilig.

243
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,885
I'm sure you're not the only one
who will feel kilig in Ship Show, Nestor,

244
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,830
but also our Shippers!

245
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,642
Last but not the least,

246
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:03,084
Araw, what are you looking
forward to in Ship Show?

247
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,910
I'm just here to watch everyone,
make each other suffer.

248
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:14,046
Break each other's hearts,
so to speak.

249
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,726
Oh my, God! He's so dark!

250
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:19,729
This is better than I expected!

251
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,548
Go, go! Let's continue!

252
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:23,633
And there they are, Shippers!

253
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,343
Our twelve Love Birds.

254
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:29,406
Who will vie to be the
country's next big love team!

255
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:34,953
The winning love team will receive
a cash prize worth one million pesos.

256
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:38,940
Aside from that, they'll be given
an exclusive management contract

257
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:43,084
under BenDo Productions
and Artist Management.

258
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:47,850
Lastly, the winning pair will
star in their own romance movie

259
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,295
which will be produced by
BenDo Productions as well.

260
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,249
Whose ship will sail?

261
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:55,170
Whose ship will sink?

262
00:14:55,195 --> 00:15:00,170
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is The Ship Show!

263
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:01,360
Cut!

264
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:03,280
Alright, let's have our acquaintance party.

265
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,888
You know, that's not how you
properly hold a champagne glass.

266
00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:43,544
Sorry. I only wash these back home.

267
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:46,361
I never tried drinking
from this glass before.

268
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,370
Like this,
let me teach you.

269
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:54,889
Pinch the stem of the glass
using your index finger and thumb.

270
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:57,702
Then, of course, your other fingers
will support it.

271
00:15:57,727 --> 00:16:00,733
Just don't touch the bowl part here.

272
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:03,725
Oh.

273
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:07,273
- Now I'm so sophisticated.
- Yes!

274
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:09,244
Thank you, master.

275
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:12,291
But you know, it doesn't matter
how you want to hold it.

276
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:16,764
I still like you anyway.

277
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,918
Belline, right?

278
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:23,570
You know what I feel?

279
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:26,391
You're the alpha among the girls here.

280
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,408
I feel the same way.

281
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,342
Well, I'm an alpha male.

282
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:33,654
So I think we should be a tandem.

283
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,142
Sure.

284
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:38,280
We'll see.

285
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:40,818
Shey, right?

286
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:44,569
Again, I'm Monti. Nice chatting with you.
So, I'll just go around.

287
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:46,499
- Sure. See you around.
- See you.

288
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:51,580
All the places we could meet again,
and it's here at the Ship Show.

289
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:54,685
How many years has it been
since we last talked?

290
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,174
Almost a year.

291
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,064
You've become more blooming.

292
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:01,750
Being single is nice.

293
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,128
There's no stress.

294
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,282
How about you and your girlfriend?

295
00:17:09,956 --> 00:17:10,993
We're not together anymore.

296
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:15,048
Actually, we were
never really together.

297
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,624
Hmm. I see.

298
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:19,402
Okay, I'll go over there then.

299
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:22,062
You know what I feel?

300
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,399
You're the alpha female
among the girls here.

301
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,137
It doesn't seem like it.

302
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:32,348
Well, I'm the alpha male.

303
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:36,098
So I think we should be a tandem.

304
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:40,551
Chia, have you talked to Elbrich?

305
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:41,681
- Hello!
- Hello!

306
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:43,645
- You have a beautiful smile.
- Oh, thank you.

307
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,339
Oh, by the way, I forgot to ask
your zodiac sign earlier.

308
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:47,824
Bro, we're talking here.

309
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:48,891
And so?

310
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:50,722
Isn't this an acquaintance party?

311
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,199
Why are you keeping her
to yourself?

312
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,094
Do you wanna get acquainted to this?

313
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,929
- Take it easy.
- Asshole.

314
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:58,809
What will the viewers think
when they see you acting like that?

315
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:01,272
What a jerk!

316
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:27,063
Are you okay?

317
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,684
You've been alone
here for a while.

318
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,498
You've been going around
to different guys.

319
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:38,794
You're so competitive.

320
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,997
I'm just getting
to know everyone.

321
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:49,749
You're trying to assess us.

322
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:53,611
One by one to determine who's
the most likely to get you the win.

323
00:18:56,804 --> 00:19:00,266
How about you, have you talked
to any of the girls?

324
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,012
I'm fine with just observing.

325
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,359
If you were given a choice,

326
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:15,554
who would you want
to be your partner here?

327
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,145
You.

328
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:31,215
You're the only one
who approached me.

329
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:36,596
Just kidding.

330
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,105
Interesting.

331
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,317
When you said you want me
to be your partner,

332
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:52,278
before I even answered,
you took your question back.

333
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:57,587
And you haven't even talked
to the other girls yet.

334
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,723
So what?

335
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:06,353
You're afraid of rejection.

336
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,774
Do you want me to help you
talk to the girls?

337
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,926
You're trying so hard,
you know?

338
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:19,183
Just to win this contest.

339
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,747
What's your problem?

340
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,301
I'm just saying,
you're overly competitive.

341
00:20:28,514 --> 00:20:30,054
That might be your downfall.

342
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,715
And you know what will
cause your downfall?

343
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,049
Love Birds, please assemble
in front of The Ship Show sign.

344
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,277
So, are you guys having a
good time getting to know

345
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:43,721
your fellow Love Birds here
in the House of Kilig?

346
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:45,191
Yes!

347
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:47,067
Okay, good, good.

348
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:52,416
Now, may I direct your attention
to that TV screen?

349
00:20:57,195 --> 00:21:01,458
Love Birds, you have 20 seconds to
choose who you'd like as your love team.

350
00:21:01,585 --> 00:21:02,966
Only Love Birds who mutually choose

351
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:06,723
each other can become
an official love team.

352
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,215
If you've found your partner,

353
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,317
hold each other's hands
and stand beside the timer.

354
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:15,153
Love Birds,
the timer starts now!

355
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:32,066
- So, are you game?
- Sure!

356
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,676
Buddy!

357
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,434
Come on,
let's be a love team.

358
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:47,207
Too slow!

359
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:48,910
Ashley!

360
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:52,716
We haven't had a proper chat,
but I think I find you cute.

361
00:21:52,741 --> 00:21:53,911
What's your favorite color?

362
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,270
- Orange.
- Mine too!

363
00:21:57,879 --> 00:21:58,960
Come on!

364
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:04,450
- Ashley, would you like to-
- Hell no!

365
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:06,346
Marge!

366
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,976
- We're out of time!
- What's your name again?

367
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:10,252
Save the small talk.
Come on.

368
00:22:57,808 --> 00:23:01,016
I just really struggled to
choose under pressure.

369
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:08,274
But, I believe that I can find
something appealing about Araw.

370
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,445
After all, everyone has
something good in them.

371
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:24,507
Whoever the universe gives me,
I will accept.

372
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:27,722
Besides, I'm used to disappointment.

373
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:34,399
At midnight, our mics and
cameras will stop recording.

374
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,656
And as early as 6 AM,
we will resume.

375
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:41,344
No phones, no internet connection,
or contact with the outside world.

376
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,617
Curfew is from 1 AM to 5 AM.

377
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,431
What do you mean curfew?

378
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:48,586
Curfew as in you can't leave your room
from 1 AM to 5 AM.

379
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:53,636
Can we stroll around the property?

380
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:56,539
You can do whatever you
want as long as it's not illegal,

381
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:58,024
doesn't harm others,

382
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:00,927
and doesn't damage any property.

383
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,431
Keep in mind that whatever we record,

384
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:05,195
we have the right to use in the show.

385
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,656
If there are no further questions,
see you tomorrow.

386
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:08,968
Goodbye!

387
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:11,329
- Goodnight!
- See you tomorrow!

388
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,015
So...

389
00:24:15,024 --> 00:24:16,434
Let's visit the boys.

390
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:18,149
Hi boys!

391
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,320
Let's go outside.

392
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:22,415
- Quick.
- Come on, come on.

393
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,250
You're so slow!
Hurry up!

394
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,789
Come on, go!

395
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,721
Come on, come on!

396
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:38,975
They're all going out.
Wanna join?

397
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:41,969
Not now, I'm tired.

398
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:48,125
Come on,
I want to bond with you.

399
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:50,280
Come on.

400
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,351
You still want to
be pampered, huh?

401
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,304
Why do you talk like that?

402
00:24:58,035 --> 00:24:59,536
Have you been possessed
by a dwarf?

403
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:01,336
Attention, Love Birds!

404
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:03,250
Time check: 12 midnight.

405
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:07,046
All cameras and microphones
will stop recording. Thank you!

406
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:09,922
Finally!

407
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,968
Hey, let's talk!

408
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:15,491
How will the Shippers ship us
if you keep being a smartass on me?

409
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:18,250
Just chill.

410
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,234
Don't you want to win?

411
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:23,193
Didn't you watch my
introductory video?

412
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,153
I just happen to be handsome.

413
00:25:25,748 --> 00:25:27,447
My parents made me join,

414
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,210
I got accepted.

415
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,660
So, you don't really plan on winning?

416
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:33,294
That's not something you plan.

417
00:25:33,818 --> 00:25:35,138
It just happens.

418
00:25:35,595 --> 00:25:37,040
Hey, listen to me!

419
00:25:37,261 --> 00:25:39,209
Whether you like it or not,
I'm going to win this.

420
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:42,754
If you want to be chill
and put in no effort, fine!

421
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,938
But you can't stop me
from wanting to win this.

422
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:46,984
Do you understand?

423
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:58,617
So, tomorrow, I'm going to woo you,
tease you and flirt with you.

424
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:01,398
So just go along with it, okay?

425
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:09,155
Cool, right? We both
got into the Ship Show.

426
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:11,893
Maybe we're meant to be?

427
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:16,237
Buddy, I only agreed
to be your love team

428
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:19,082
because you're the only one I know
among the boys here.

429
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,996
But I'm keeping an eye
on all your red flags.

430
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:25,948
I've changed.

431
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:32,129
My jealousy and paranoid,
my lack of respect for your boundaries.

432
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,415
My womanizing.

433
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:39,310
I know all that was wrong.

434
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:41,464
Really? Since when?

435
00:26:44,118 --> 00:26:45,650
Since I lost you.

436
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:47,193
Look!

437
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,546
You always look so grumpy!

438
00:26:49,606 --> 00:26:51,749
What if that's shown on TV, huh?

439
00:26:51,802 --> 00:26:54,242
People might think you're
unhappy with us together.

440
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,120
I'm here to be real.

441
00:26:57,217 --> 00:27:00,359
If you can't handle my authentic self,
I'm sorry.

442
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:02,336
But we'll both go down.

443
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:03,804
The masses!

444
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,838
Deep inside, they're also
frustrated with their lives.

445
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,482
Especially with their relationships.

446
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:13,386
Maybe they're not content
with their partner in real life,

447
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:15,638
or their love life isn't exciting.

448
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:18,333
That's why they're crazy
about love teams.

449
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:21,258
Because what they can't
find in real life,

450
00:27:21,731 --> 00:27:24,564
they experience
through the love team.

451
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,882
You're not only handsome
but also smart!

452
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:30,978
Have you always been like this
since you were young—

453
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:34,006
Let's talk about
more important things.

454
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:37,660
Because we're here to win,
not to bond.

455
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:40,911
Sorry.

456
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:43,082
Good morning, Love Birds.

457
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:47,186
Time check: a few seconds before 6 AM.

458
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:55,590
All microphones and cameras will start
rolling in five, four, three, two, one!

459
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:58,496
Good morning!

460
00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:03,449
As a love team, your chemistry
should be felt just from the photos.

461
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:05,535
That's why for today's challenge,

462
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,793
each love team is given disposable
cameras to take couple selfies.

463
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:13,918
Each camera can only
take a total of 12 shots.

464
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:17,691
From those 12 pictures,
each love team

465
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:20,845
will submit three for our
guest e-love-uators to judge.

466
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,246
So, choose wisely.

467
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:24,239
You have two hours.

468
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:25,293
Oh no.

469
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:26,676
I don't know this.

470
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:29,004
Let me see.
How does it work?

471
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,585
Oh, dear!

472
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,996
What a waste!

473
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:36,699
- Oh no!
- What did you press?

474
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:44,238
Let's plan this first.

475
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,434
Sorry.

476
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:50,446
What are the most effective
visual signifiers of chemistry?

477
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,444
Effective what?

478
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:54,735
Visual signifier!

479
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:57,692
This is so easy.

480
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:03,715
Agree. What if we
spice things up a bit?

481
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:08,418
Are you really going to lay all your
cards out this early in the show?

482
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:14,614
If yes, make sure you still have some
surprises left for the next challenges.

483
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:16,720
Wow.

484
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:18,673
Strategy.

485
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:22,935
It makes you a lot sexier.

486
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:27,519
Sit on my lap and
we'll take a photo.

487
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:28,844
Put your arm around my shoulder.

488
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:30,941
Cringe!

489
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:34,535
It's your loss!

490
00:29:55,674 --> 00:30:06,142
♪ My love, my heart holds a melody... ♪

491
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:18,003
♪ Would you lend an ear
to its whispering tune? ♪

492
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:20,322
What song is that?

493
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:22,550
It's my own song.

494
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:25,926
In fairness.

495
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,731
This is my real passion.

496
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:32,653
I hope there comes a day when
more people can hear my songs.

497
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:35,903
Why are you here
in the Ship Show then?

498
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:38,409
It seems like you
joined the wrong contest.

499
00:30:40,295 --> 00:30:42,798
I was thinking that
if I became an actor,

500
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:46,453
I could have a chance to
get a recording contract.

501
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:57,243
What are the chords to your song?

502
00:30:57,978 --> 00:30:59,293
Do you know
how to play the guitar?

503
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:20,271
Where's the most romantic place?

504
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,027
Just there.

505
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:27,324
Here.

506
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:30,262
No, there's a better
place than this.

507
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:36,090
Ah, excuse me! Your mics are dead.
They need a battery change.

508
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:37,535
Do we need to take them off?

509
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,121
Yes, so, just stand by while
we're changing the batteries.

510
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:43,825
Then, you can resume afterwards.

511
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,700
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you!

512
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:50,028
Thank you!

513
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:55,624
This is so boring.

514
00:31:57,756 --> 00:32:01,098
How about we strategize
while we wait?

515
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:02,954
Just keep taking photos.

516
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,090
I'm sure one of them
will turn out fine.

517
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:08,012
No, we can't
leave it to chance.

518
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,073
How about we kiss?

519
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:12,588
What?

520
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:14,679
Just kidding.

521
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:20,369
Araw, are you ever going
to take this seriously?

522
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:24,457
I need to win this, okay?

523
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:29,348
Because if not, my parents
will make me quit showbiz.

524
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:32,278
Then, they'll send me abroad.

525
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:34,628
I don't want that, Araw!

526
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:37,597
This has always been my dream—

527
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,873
To become an actress!

528
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,996
So please, this is my last shot.

529
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:44,668
Says who?

530
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:47,075
My parents, that's who!

531
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:50,228
So please,

532
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:52,879
will you work with me on this?

533
00:32:59,217 --> 00:33:01,895
Here are your mics, you can resume
now with the challenge.

534
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,875
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

535
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:21,472
Okay, fine.

536
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:27,933
I'm thinking we
walk around, first.

537
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:31,082
Have a bit of bonding
before we start taking photos.

538
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:42,754
We still have an hour.

539
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:50,124
So, 30 minutes for bonding,
then 30 minutes for picture taking.

540
00:33:52,436 --> 00:33:55,731
Do you think we can bond
in just half an hour?

541
00:33:58,023 --> 00:33:59,629
If we both make the effort.

542
00:34:01,312 --> 00:34:02,465
E-love-uators.

543
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,287
What do you think of Nestor and Tintin?

544
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:05,581
Sameera?

545
00:34:05,606 --> 00:34:09,840
They look joyful and the
happiness seems so genuine.

546
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:11,684
Okay, here's the thing, though.

547
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:14,879
I don't doubt the authenticity
of your connection.

548
00:34:14,904 --> 00:34:17,528
But your photos aren't
conveying romance.

549
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:19,256
I agree with Kristof.

550
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:22,200
The energy I get from
the pictures is platonic.

551
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:24,082
More friendship than romance.

552
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,944
Shey, you look kind of uncomfortable.

553
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,715
But Buddy,
you look so in love, right?

554
00:34:30,787 --> 00:34:32,684
Is it true that you two
used to be a thing?

555
00:34:33,278 --> 00:34:34,375
Yes.

556
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,113
It's a double-edged sword, isn't it,

557
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:39,606
being a real-life couple in a love team.

558
00:34:39,631 --> 00:34:43,274
Because, for instance, if they
have an issue with each other,

559
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:44,934
it'll come across on screen.

560
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,647
It's too calculated for me.

561
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:50,426
The idea is there but I guess
the execution was stiff.

562
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:52,336
You two don't smile much, do you?

563
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:55,781
But for me, this kind of vibe
appeals to the cool kids.

564
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:58,965
You know those wanting to
have a cool expression of their identity.

565
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,778
- And especially the rebellious teens.
- Yes.

566
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:05,129
That's my problem. The appeal
is limited, not for the masses.

567
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,215
I would say you two are the hottest
love team I've seen so far.

568
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,293
Visually, that is.

569
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,473
It's like I'm looking
at magazine photos.

570
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:15,551
It's like a fashion billboard.

571
00:35:15,576 --> 00:35:16,989
Glamorous, yes!

572
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:20,215
But you know what you two lack?
Vulnerability.

573
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:27,774
Our E-love-uators are lost for words,
aren't they?

574
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:29,817
Sameera, would you like to comment?

575
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:31,875
You've shown something different.

576
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,785
Every photo shows something unique.

577
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:36,215
There's a story.

578
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:38,761
But, is it just me?

579
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,964
I feel like it's lacking
in the romantic factor.

580
00:35:42,614 --> 00:35:43,662
Too plain?

581
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:44,739
Kind of?

582
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:51,340
But is it necessary for expressions
of romance to always be big and dramatic?

583
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:53,617
That's what the Shippers
are looking for, right?

584
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:56,393
Okay, Miss Tata,
with all due respect...

585
00:35:56,927 --> 00:36:00,246
What makes you feel love
when looking at these set of pictures?

586
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:10,075
Perhaps the fact that they both
look safe in each other's company.

587
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:12,230
It sounds boring, doesn't it?

588
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,723
Because we're all looking
for grand expressions of love.

589
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:19,844
But for me,

590
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:25,004
this is what love looks like—

591
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:26,330
Security.

592
00:36:27,748 --> 00:36:31,185
Our panel of E-love-uators
have chosen the top three

593
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,176
in the couple's selfie challenge.

594
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:34,668
In third place,

595
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,903
Araw and Chia!

596
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:39,389
Second place,

597
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:42,082
Ashley and Belline!

598
00:36:42,107 --> 00:36:46,762
And the love team our
E-love-uators ship the most is...

599
00:36:46,795 --> 00:36:49,739
Nestor and Tintin!

600
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:54,691
However, it is the Shippers who
will decide which love team will sail

601
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:56,134
or sink.

602
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:02,911
Do you know why we lost?

603
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:04,732
Because you're too alpha!

604
00:37:04,757 --> 00:37:06,254
I'm naturally an alpha!

605
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:08,639
We should complement each other.

606
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:11,106
So if I'm an alpha male,
you should be a beta female.

607
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:12,457
Excuse me?

608
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:14,231
I'm an alpha female, okay!

609
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,575
You should be the one
acting beta here!

610
00:37:16,774 --> 00:37:19,481
You know the people
don't like female alphas.

611
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,115
They prefer the woman
to be inferior to the man.

612
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,004
So you should act like you're
head over heels in love with me.

613
00:37:26,235 --> 00:37:28,653
Love, not just lust.

614
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:31,553
- What?!
- Come on.

615
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,191
I know you find me hot.

616
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:02,059
I still stand by what I said.

617
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:05,551
I'm alpha, you're beta!

618
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:11,030
Sorry.

619
00:38:11,268 --> 00:38:13,278
We flunked the challenge earlier.

620
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,035
Why are you apologizing?

621
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,333
I'm the one who looked
uncomfortable on camera.

622
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:25,449
But, I'm the reason why you
were uncomfortable, right?

623
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,941
How can we remove this
awkwardness between us?

624
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:41,136
If you stop bringing up our past.

625
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,559
Maybe I just need
closure once and for all.

626
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:57,644
Just tell me that you have
no feelings for me anymore.

627
00:38:58,528 --> 00:39:00,854
That I have no chance
of making it up to you.

628
00:39:03,615 --> 00:39:06,700
Promise. I won't bring up
our past anymore.

629
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:16,714
But if I tell you that it might affect
your performance on the show.

630
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:20,710
No, I promise it won't!

631
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:22,481
I'll be professional.

632
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,246
Buddy, I don't have feelings
for you anymore.

633
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:39,585
I've moved on a long time ago.

634
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:47,614
Hey!

635
00:40:00,723 --> 00:40:01,849
Don't worry.

636
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:05,309
I'm just processing my emotions.

637
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:10,739
I'm not crying
to make you feel guilty.

638
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:15,012
Promise, by tomorrow, I'll be okay.

639
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:18,285
All professional again.

640
00:40:24,364 --> 00:40:26,395
This tastes good, doesn't it?

641
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,183
Good morning, Love Birds!

642
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:33,043
For today, you need
to clean the bathroom.

643
00:40:33,068 --> 00:40:38,387
Except for the top three love teams
from the couple's selfie challenge.

644
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:41,566
The top three love teams
will be given a chance

645
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,855
to bond outside the House of Kilig.

646
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,801
The male Love Birds are required
to think of and choose the activity.

647
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:50,832
Go!

648
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:53,090
One more, one more.

649
00:40:53,813 --> 00:40:58,894
I wanted to take Tintin to
where I live but it's too far, so...

650
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:02,964
I just requested the staff if
they could take us to a place

651
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,309
that has a similar vibe.

652
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:07,739
Why did you choose
this activity for you two?

653
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:10,606
Maybe I wanted her
to experience my world.

654
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:12,004
A world without pretense.

655
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:13,457
No sophistication.

656
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:14,951
I hope she enjoys it.

657
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:27,797
I know how much Belline likes to swim,
that's why I brought her here.

658
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:33,694
Can you give me a back rub?

659
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:36,137
Come here.
Let's just lie here.

660
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:37,869
Please.

661
00:41:38,052 --> 00:41:40,215
Just lay there on my chest, okay?

662
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:46,697
Is this a dance studio?

663
00:41:46,722 --> 00:41:51,291
I used to dance here a lot
when I was attending dance workshops.

664
00:41:51,316 --> 00:41:52,567
You dance?

665
00:41:52,848 --> 00:41:55,447
I brought you here because
we're going to dance.

666
00:41:57,627 --> 00:41:58,650
What?

667
00:41:58,675 --> 00:42:00,604
I'm going to teach you a dance.

668
00:42:00,665 --> 00:42:01,693
Wait.

669
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,424
Ah, I don't know how to dance.

670
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:06,169
I only dance a little, but—

671
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:08,613
That's why I'll teach you, right?

672
00:42:09,756 --> 00:42:11,800
But I don't want to look stupid.

673
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:16,400
You need to be bad at something first
before you can be good at it.

674
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:19,807
Don't you trust me?

675
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:23,627
Right, left.

676
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:27,500
Last call, alright.

677
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,400
Left. Right.

678
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:30,992
Right foot.

679
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,593
But you're stepping forward,
you're not coming back.

680
00:42:34,672 --> 00:42:36,045
Ah, I got it.

681
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:39,240
I didn't really think about
where I would take Chia.

682
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:46,720
I didn't really plan to woo her
or impress her, so there.

683
00:42:47,744 --> 00:42:49,182
I just wanted to dance again.

684
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:50,333
To relieve some stress.

685
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:53,565
Whether Chia enjoys it or not,
it's her problem.

686
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:58,565
Araw is really sweet, isn't he?

687
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:02,594
You see, he's just putting
on a sour face.

688
00:43:02,635 --> 00:43:05,937
But deep inside, he's caring.

689
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:07,346
Isn't he?

690
00:43:07,644 --> 00:43:09,666
Hey! Ouch!

691
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:11,931
Alright, what?

692
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,786
Just kidding!
Let go of me!

693
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:15,096
Make me.

694
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:17,516
I'll kiss you, I swear.

695
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:20,292
Finally found an excuse
to kiss me, huh?

696
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:22,206
The nerve on this guy!

697
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,658
Enough.

698
00:43:25,642 --> 00:43:27,796
Good afternoon, Love Birds!

699
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:30,260
Thanks for cleaning the toilets.

700
00:43:30,334 --> 00:43:35,525
You can now go back
to your rooms to rest.

701
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,260
However, please be ready for 7 PM.

702
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:42,604
You will each be interviewed
in the interview room.

703
00:43:42,629 --> 00:43:43,846
Finally.

704
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:45,293
- Let's go, Amor.
- Let's go.

705
00:43:47,312 --> 00:43:48,989
Come on, let's go.

706
00:43:57,793 --> 00:43:58,820
Hey!

707
00:43:59,043 --> 00:44:00,092
Are you okay?

708
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,912
I'm just tired.

709
00:44:06,028 --> 00:44:07,079
Really?

710
00:44:08,336 --> 00:44:09,587
Not because of last night?

711
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:18,577
I can't deny it.

712
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:20,678
It still hurts.

713
00:44:21,544 --> 00:44:25,254
But I'm aware that
I shouldn't be like this.

714
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,051
Don't worry.

715
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:30,412
I'm just still processing.

716
00:44:32,982 --> 00:44:34,029
Warning:

717
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:38,016
Everything we discuss here,
you can't tell anyone,

718
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:39,473
especially your love team partner.

719
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,782
If you violate this, you're automatically
disqualified from the competition.

720
00:44:44,286 --> 00:44:45,328
Understood?

721
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:46,748
Yes.

722
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:50,293
All Love Birds will be given
a chance to change partners.

723
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,228
If the one you chose also chooses you.

724
00:44:53,253 --> 00:44:55,964
Then you two will
become a love team.

725
00:44:56,254 --> 00:44:57,924
- Clear?
- Alright.

726
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,028
So, Araw, do you want
to change partners?

727
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:04,844
Monti and Amor,
please come forward.

728
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:07,337
You were both asked individually

729
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:10,824
if you want to change partners
and you both answered.

730
00:45:11,481 --> 00:45:12,660
No.

731
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:13,731
No.

732
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:17,051
I think Monti and I are okay.

733
00:45:17,403 --> 00:45:20,622
But for us to really connect,

734
00:45:20,691 --> 00:45:22,276
we need more time.

735
00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:25,805
We seem compatible so...

736
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,164
Oh, cut it out.

737
00:45:27,189 --> 00:45:28,215
No.

738
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,702
- Elbrich, why—
- No.

739
00:45:31,536 --> 00:45:34,545
At first, Marge
and I didn't get along,

740
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,872
but since we discovered
that we both like music,

741
00:45:39,095 --> 00:45:40,972
We became closer.

742
00:45:41,097 --> 00:45:42,145
I see.

743
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,965
Then, how come Marge
wants to change her partner?

744
00:45:48,597 --> 00:45:49,879
Yes.

745
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:53,750
I like you, Elbrich, but...

746
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:56,008
this is the Ship Show,

747
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:59,496
I feel like the people don't ship us.

748
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:00,989
We're too...

749
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:02,671
similar.

750
00:46:02,696 --> 00:46:03,738
Sorry.

751
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,871
Buddy and Shey,
your love team is interesting

752
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:13,590
because you both want
to change partners.

753
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:14,918
Yes.

754
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yes.

755
00:46:16,632 --> 00:46:19,302
I want to change partners because I feel

756
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:22,398
that our past is getting in
the way of our progress.

757
00:46:22,856 --> 00:46:24,274
While Shey,

758
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:25,949
can be professional,

759
00:46:26,135 --> 00:46:27,942
I really can't.

760
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,877
I don't want to be
a burden to her.

761
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,242
She deserves to be
in a better love team.

762
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,756
Shey, why do you want
to change partners?

763
00:46:45,578 --> 00:46:47,955
Because I might fall in love
with him again.

764
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,817
I don't want that to happen.

765
00:46:53,316 --> 00:46:55,379
I want peace of mind.

766
00:46:57,228 --> 00:46:58,938
I want to focus on my career.

767
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,770
No!

768
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:03,778
I believe our tandem
is perfect already.

769
00:47:03,803 --> 00:47:05,262
I'm very proud of us.

770
00:47:05,287 --> 00:47:07,879
And I'm sure the Shippers
are already shipping us.

771
00:47:07,904 --> 00:47:09,075
Right, Ashley?

772
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:13,036
Belline, actually...

773
00:47:13,061 --> 00:47:14,348
No, you didn't!

774
00:47:14,682 --> 00:47:15,737
Yes.

775
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:18,215
Actually, I want to
replace you as my partner.

776
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,043
Because I feel like our
energies are competing.

777
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:29,259
Chia, you were asked if you
wanted to switch your love team,

778
00:47:29,284 --> 00:47:30,864
and you answered...

779
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:39,295
Yes.

780
00:47:46,256 --> 00:47:47,887
I just think that,

781
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:51,536
I can do better
with a different partner.

782
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:58,012
Oh, that must have hurt Araw
because he answered...

783
00:48:03,676 --> 00:48:04,769
No.

784
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:13,651
I admit I'm not that keen
on acting sweet and all.

785
00:48:14,652 --> 00:48:16,921
So, if my partner doesn't want me...

786
00:48:18,255 --> 00:48:20,176
That's fine. I get it.

787
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,910
But if it were up to me,

788
00:48:23,444 --> 00:48:25,872
I'm okay with
my tandem with Chia.

789
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:38,231
Now that we've revealed
all our Love Birds' answers,

790
00:48:38,674 --> 00:48:40,989
Nestor and Tintin,
Monti and Amor.

791
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:41,540
Come on.

792
00:48:41,564 --> 00:48:44,309
You may now head back
inside the house to relax.

793
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:54,114
Buddy, when asked who you
wanted your new love team to be with.

794
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,515
Who did you answer?

795
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,918
It's Marge.

796
00:48:58,222 --> 00:48:59,223
Marge?

797
00:48:59,248 --> 00:49:02,036
Who did you choose
as your replacement?

798
00:49:04,921 --> 00:49:06,172
Monti.

799
00:49:06,832 --> 00:49:10,853
Unfortunately, Buddy,
Marge doesn't want to pair with you.

800
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:13,666
As for you, Marge, as you saw,

801
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:16,473
Monti chose
to stick with Amor.

802
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:20,934
Therefore, Marge, you'll stay
with Elbrich as your love team.

803
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:24,153
You may now head back
inside the house.

804
00:49:24,746 --> 00:49:25,759
Shey.

805
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:29,309
Your wish to replace Buddy is with...

806
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,207
Ashley.

807
00:49:32,067 --> 00:49:34,965
Ashley, you also want
to change your partner.

808
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,953
Please state the name
of the female Love Bird

809
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:39,725
you expressed a desire
to also partner with.

810
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,495
Chia.

811
00:49:41,723 --> 00:49:42,747
Chia?

812
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:47,020
Chia, tell us the name of the
male Love Bird you want to be with.

813
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:50,797
Ashley.

814
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:53,518
Looks like we have a match!

815
00:49:53,606 --> 00:49:57,623
From now on, Ashley and Chia
will be a love team.

816
00:49:57,707 --> 00:50:02,723
Ashley and Chia, you may now
go back inside the house.

817
00:50:03,836 --> 00:50:05,340
Buddy and Shey.

818
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,421
You both wanted to change your partners.

819
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:12,082
Unfortunately,
your choices didn't reciprocate.

820
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:15,645
Therefore, you will
remain as a love team.

821
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,215
You may now head back
into the House of Kilig.

822
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:22,526
Araw and Belline,

823
00:50:22,622 --> 00:50:25,293
both of your partners have left you.

824
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:29,728
By default, you will become
a love team from here on out.

825
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,282
Anything you'd like to say?

826
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,460
What the freak

827
00:50:50,485 --> 00:50:53,184
is this biatch up to?

828
00:50:53,715 --> 00:50:55,434
Cam two, close up. Quick!

829
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,488
Actually, Dorian,
I'm really happy because

830
00:51:08,525 --> 00:51:12,247
Araw and I have been in a
mutual understanding for a while now,

831
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:16,161
Even before we joined the Ship Show
and met face-to-face.

832
00:51:16,186 --> 00:51:18,934
So Araw, we don't need
to hide anymore, do we?

833
00:51:31,394 --> 00:51:32,465
There!

834
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,106
That's drama!

835
00:51:35,146 --> 00:51:36,559
I love it!

836
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:38,504
That's drama right there!

837
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,043
Oh my, God!

838
00:51:40,068 --> 00:51:42,911
What a cunning girl!

839
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:43,965
Cut!

840
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:46,933
Come on, over here!

841
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:48,418
- Quick!
- Hurry, hurry!

842
00:51:48,443 --> 00:51:49,895
That's it, that's it.

843
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,075
- Quick!
- There!

844
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,476
That's it, that's it.

845
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:53,739
Go, Chia!

846
00:51:56,804 --> 00:51:58,536
- To the left, to the left!
- Shey!

847
00:51:58,653 --> 00:51:59,754
Go!

848
00:51:59,988 --> 00:52:01,174
Belline!

849
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,483
Come over here!

850
00:52:08,263 --> 00:52:09,316
Belline!

851
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:16,515
First place! We have Araw and Belline.

852
00:52:19,197 --> 00:52:22,638
Second place, Monti and Amor.

853
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:30,661
And third place. Buddy and Shey.

854
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,282
Over here!

855
00:52:37,307 --> 00:52:40,222
There you go!
You're nearly there!

856
00:52:40,247 --> 00:52:41,286
Hurry!

857
00:52:41,311 --> 00:52:42,817
Straight ahead!

858
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,593
Love Birds, Shippers,

859
00:52:48,618 --> 00:52:51,919
welcome to the first elimination night!

860
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:53,875
Tonight, we'll find out

861
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,723
which love teams will
continue their journey.

862
00:52:56,784 --> 00:52:58,957
And which will be the first love team

863
00:52:58,982 --> 00:53:03,169
to sink according to
the votes of our Shippers.

864
00:53:03,403 --> 00:53:04,819
Araw and Belline,

865
00:53:05,968 --> 00:53:07,966
your love team is...

866
00:53:09,294 --> 00:53:10,585
sailing!

867
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,424
Nestor and Tintin,

868
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:19,960
your love team is

869
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:22,785
sailing!

870
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:25,973
What happened to you?

871
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:28,968
Buddy and Shey,

872
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,465
you both wanted to
bail out of your love team

873
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,606
but failed.

874
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,731
However,

875
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:38,263
your love team is still sailing.

876
00:53:38,288 --> 00:53:40,184
Congratulations!

877
00:53:40,209 --> 00:53:41,692
Ashley and Chia,

878
00:53:44,223 --> 00:53:45,435
sailing!

879
00:53:46,371 --> 00:53:48,508
The two remaining Love Birds,

880
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:49,825
please come to the center.

881
00:53:50,302 --> 00:53:53,059
We're down to our
last two love teams.

882
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:55,723
Who among them will sink?

883
00:53:56,379 --> 00:53:57,931
Monti and Amor,

884
00:53:58,172 --> 00:54:01,473
based on the votes of
our beloved Shippers,

885
00:54:01,498 --> 00:54:03,903
your love team...

886
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:07,402
has sunk!

887
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,187
Which means,
Elbrich and Marge,

888
00:54:10,212 --> 00:54:12,131
you are sailing.

889
00:54:13,222 --> 00:54:14,902
I'm sorry, Monti and Amor,

890
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:18,372
you are eliminated
from the Ship Show.

891
00:54:18,397 --> 00:54:20,208
Goodbye, Monti and Amor.

892
00:54:23,098 --> 00:54:24,323
Son of a bitch!

893
00:54:24,606 --> 00:54:25,644
That's just it?

894
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:28,198
- Should we cut audio?
- No, no. Keep rolling.

895
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,220
But we're live streaming, Direk.

896
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:30,677
This isn't free TV, right?

897
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:31,723
Let him swear!

898
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:33,927
Love teams are supposed to
enter the show business, right?

899
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:36,752
Why isn't there an acting test?

900
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:38,630
Is this a dating show?

901
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,127
Ship Show?

902
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,380
More like a Shit Show!

903
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:43,138
Monti, that's enough!

904
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:46,220
You know,
you Filipino audiences,

905
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:49,653
you're the reason why young actors
nowadays suck at acting!

906
00:54:49,678 --> 00:54:51,552
You're all about those sissy acts!

907
00:54:51,577 --> 00:54:54,145
You stan the wrong people!

908
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:58,091
Direk.

909
00:54:59,106 --> 00:55:00,721
Look, it's still trending.

910
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:03,003
#TSSMakeThemAct

911
00:55:03,028 --> 00:55:04,348
My gosh!

912
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,840
I think what Monti said
resonated with a lot of people.

913
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,115
People are so fake.

914
00:55:11,364 --> 00:55:12,981
Even if there's a good actor,

915
00:55:13,006 --> 00:55:15,050
they still prefer the ones
who can give them butterflies,

916
00:55:15,075 --> 00:55:17,327
even if they suck at acting.

917
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:21,772
Dorian, if we want
people to take us seriously,

918
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:23,688
we need credibility.

919
00:55:23,713 --> 00:55:26,656
Yes, we are looking for
the next big love team,

920
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:28,672
But talent is a non-negotiable.

921
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,877
Please call Direk Nova.

922
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:41,525
Why do my romance movies succeed?

923
00:55:41,784 --> 00:55:44,612
Whether they're indie or mainstream?

924
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,401
It's not just because of
the well-written script,

925
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:51,550
neither is it because
of my, quote-unquote,

926
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,205
outstanding direction.

927
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:57,714
It's because I work
with talented actors.

928
00:55:57,739 --> 00:55:59,566
We can't rely on chemistry alone.

929
00:55:59,863 --> 00:56:02,640
What if there's chemistry,
but the acting's trash?

930
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:05,317
The challenge for today,

931
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:09,704
each love team will act in
a romantic movie scene.

932
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,928
You have the scripts.

933
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:14,948
Direk, isn't there a workshop for this?

934
00:56:15,198 --> 00:56:18,096
Not all of us have acting experience.

935
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:20,690
Didn't you know what
you were getting into?!

936
00:56:20,759 --> 00:56:21,775
Huh?

937
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,886
You didn't even bother to learn
on your own even a little bit?!

938
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:26,816
There's plenty of resources
on the internet!

939
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:30,401
We thought we'd be trained
here on the Ship Show.

940
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:32,103
That's not my problem.

941
00:56:33,244 --> 00:56:34,745
I guess.

942
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,191
In this challenge, I hope,

943
00:56:37,998 --> 00:56:40,333
those without talent
will be weeded out.

944
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:45,159
Honestly, my plan in life was
to focus on my career,

945
00:56:45,184 --> 00:56:47,534
but then you came along.

946
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:50,676
So, am I just a distraction
to your plans?

947
00:56:50,701 --> 00:56:52,519
How could you be a distraction?

948
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:55,441
You're the one
who gives me—

949
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:56,557
Cut!

950
00:56:56,582 --> 00:56:57,887
Nestor, that was awful!

951
00:56:57,912 --> 00:57:00,363
You sounded like you were eating ginger
while delivering your lines!

952
00:57:00,388 --> 00:57:01,441
Sorry, Direk.

953
00:57:01,466 --> 00:57:03,848
Deliver it like it's a
normal conversation.

954
00:57:03,873 --> 00:57:04,900
Practice!

955
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:06,026
I need to go to the bathroom.

956
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:09,059
Hey! What's with you,
you're driving me crazy.

957
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:10,894
Don't be sad, it's okay.

958
00:57:10,919 --> 00:57:12,642
It's your first time doing this, right?

959
00:57:13,194 --> 00:57:15,071
Come on, smile!

960
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,497
How could you be a distraction?

961
00:57:17,698 --> 00:57:21,244
You're the one giving me
inspiration to achieve my dreams.

962
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:23,596
You're important to me, Shey.

963
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:27,588
Line!

964
00:57:30,754 --> 00:57:32,925
Sorry, Direk.
I forgot my line.

965
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,973
Cut!

966
00:57:33,998 --> 00:57:35,919
Oh, Lord!

967
00:57:35,944 --> 00:57:38,660
That Buddy, he's very
charismatic on screen.

968
00:57:38,962 --> 00:57:41,799
His acting is raw,
but he has potential.

969
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:43,277
Thank you, Direk.

970
00:57:43,354 --> 00:57:45,166
What I noticed most
about you, my boy,

971
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:47,735
is your look of love
towards your partner.

972
00:57:47,789 --> 00:57:48,941
Believable.

973
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,885
It really looks like you love her.

974
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,391
Actually, Direk,
they used to be a thing.

975
00:57:54,152 --> 00:57:55,843
That explains it!

976
00:57:55,868 --> 00:57:59,497
Is that why you get tense when
you look at each other, Shey?

977
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:01,550
Honestly,

978
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,399
my plan was to focus
on myself first.

979
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:06,634
On my career.

980
00:58:07,433 --> 00:58:10,491
But then, you came along.

981
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:15,186
So, am I just a distraction
in your life?

982
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:18,260
How could you be a distraction?

983
00:58:18,613 --> 00:58:19,946
You're the one...

984
00:58:20,512 --> 00:58:22,816
- giving me the inspiration
- She's good! There's nuance.

985
00:58:22,926 --> 00:58:25,433
to achieve my dreams.

986
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:29,223
You're important to me, Chia.

987
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:31,266
Cut! My God!

988
00:58:34,855 --> 00:58:35,873
Chia?

989
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:39,328
You're so good.

990
00:58:39,562 --> 00:58:42,840
Obviously, you're not new to this.

991
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:48,214
But you, my boy,
what the hell was that?

992
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:50,561
You looked like you were
in a hotdog commercial!

993
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,743
Well, Direk, my background
is in commercial.

994
00:58:54,004 --> 00:58:55,140
Obviously!

995
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,027
This is the thing about...

996
00:58:58,297 --> 00:58:59,882
love teams, okay?

997
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:01,678
Remember,

998
00:59:02,431 --> 00:59:06,977
each one of you is one half
of a single entity.

999
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:11,910
You're part of a unit
called a love team.

1000
00:59:12,136 --> 00:59:15,231
Therefore, it's not acceptable
for only one to be good!

1001
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:19,812
Otherwise, the talented
half of the love team

1002
00:59:20,072 --> 00:59:22,116
might as well go solo.

1003
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,986
That is, if they can stand on
their own without a partner.

1004
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:30,480
Distraction.

1005
00:59:31,161 --> 00:59:33,157
How could you be a distraction?

1006
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:40,498
You're the one giving me inspiration
to fulfill my dreams.

1007
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:43,211
You're important to me, Belline.

1008
00:59:43,298 --> 00:59:44,387
Cut!

1009
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,154
Araw, relax.

1010
00:59:47,077 --> 00:59:50,191
Direk, can I talk
to Araw for a bit?

1011
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:51,988
Five minutes, go!

1012
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:02,879
What I commend about the two of them,
Dorian, is they help each other.

1013
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:04,955
At the beginning,
Araw was nervous.

1014
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,973
But after Belline talked to him,

1015
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:10,089
it seemed like he got
a boost of self-confidence,

1016
01:00:10,114 --> 01:00:11,996
resulting in a good performance.

1017
01:00:12,046 --> 01:00:14,006
What did you tell Araw, Belline?

1018
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:17,074
I just reassured him
of my trust in him.

1019
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:21,176
Not just as a love team,
but as an artist as well.

1020
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:25,476
The doubts go away when your partner

1021
01:00:25,508 --> 01:00:28,803
gives you support instead of pressure.

1022
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:31,478
How could you be a distraction?

1023
01:00:32,355 --> 01:00:37,449
You're the one giving me inspiration
to achieve my dreams.

1024
01:00:38,104 --> 01:00:40,017
You're important to me, Marge.

1025
01:00:41,535 --> 01:00:44,244
You're important to me too, Elbrich.

1026
01:00:44,717 --> 01:00:49,027
Everyday, my only wish
is to be with you.

1027
01:00:49,234 --> 01:00:52,070
If we become—
If we become a couple,

1028
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:54,746
can we balance

1029
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:56,207
our relationship and our dreams?

1030
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,246
If we strive for it,

1031
01:00:58,271 --> 01:00:59,313
why not?

1032
01:01:05,014 --> 01:01:06,178
Dorian!

1033
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,838
Didn't you say when
you hired me for the show,

1034
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:12,637
that I can be as blunt as possible?

1035
01:01:12,662 --> 01:01:13,747
No sugar coating!

1036
01:01:13,772 --> 01:01:15,267
Of course, Direk!

1037
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:18,738
After all, you're the
Direk Nova Fugaban.

1038
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:21,036
All right, then!

1039
01:01:21,354 --> 01:01:22,522
Elbrich and Marge,

1040
01:01:22,547 --> 01:01:24,605
I don't see a future
for you as actors.

1041
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:27,269
I also don't see a future
for you as a love team.

1042
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:28,520
Period.

1043
01:01:29,212 --> 01:01:33,754
For the acting challenge,
we only have one E-love-uator.

1044
01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:37,652
And that is none other
than Direk Nova.

1045
01:01:37,677 --> 01:01:41,707
We let her choose her top two
favorite love teams she's shipping.

1046
01:01:42,253 --> 01:01:44,238
In second place.

1047
01:01:46,557 --> 01:01:48,877
Buddy and Shey!

1048
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:55,041
And the best love team
for Direk Nova,

1049
01:01:57,687 --> 01:02:00,721
Araw and Belline!

1050
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:05,096
The reward for the two
love teams chosen by Direk Nova,

1051
01:02:05,303 --> 01:02:08,220
is that they're safe
from elimination tonight.

1052
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:11,112
Coincidentally, neither
of these two love teams

1053
01:02:11,137 --> 01:02:14,870
received the lowest votes
from the Shippers.

1054
01:02:16,078 --> 01:02:18,581
Elbrich and Marge,

1055
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,581
your ship has...

1056
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:25,255
sunk!

1057
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,393
You're hereby eliminated
from the Ship Show.

1058
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,955
Goodbye, Elbrich and Marge.

1059
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,523
Again, Shippers,

1060
01:02:35,573 --> 01:02:38,918
don't forget to log onto the
official website of the Ship Show

1061
01:02:38,943 --> 01:02:40,862
to vote for your favorite love team.

1062
01:02:41,393 --> 01:02:43,319
You're kicking me out and
you're making me sing too?

1063
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,091
Ashley and Chia,

1064
01:02:45,116 --> 01:02:46,659
Nestor and Tintin,

1065
01:02:46,684 --> 01:02:49,823
you may now go back
inside the House of Kilig.

1066
01:02:52,752 --> 01:02:53,850
Go ahead.

1067
01:02:54,431 --> 01:02:55,544
This is your chance

1068
01:02:55,852 --> 01:02:59,752
to showcase your real talent
to a lot of people.

1069
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:01,097
Let's do it.

1070
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:03,057
Let's sing your song.

1071
01:03:07,942 --> 01:03:12,405
Once again, goodbye,
Elbrich and Marge.

You ruined my sleep,

What?

1082
01:04:26,292 --> 01:04:27,517
I'm sorry.

1083
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,804
For what?

1084
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,135
That I switched partners.

1085
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,921
I was worried I offended you.

1086
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:38,182
You're regretting it, don't you?

1087
01:04:40,603 --> 01:04:41,723
A bit.

1088
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:45,528
Because you're losing
to Belline and me?

1089
01:04:46,051 --> 01:04:49,745
The only thing I regret is
that it affected our friendship.

1090
01:04:49,854 --> 01:04:52,018
Actually, I'm happy for you.

1091
01:04:52,043 --> 01:04:54,252
Because finally,
you're starting to care.

1092
01:04:54,503 --> 01:04:56,963
You're showing passion,
like you finally want to win.

1093
01:04:56,988 --> 01:04:58,432
And you,

1094
01:04:58,457 --> 01:05:00,823
you've become less competitive.

1095
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:02,322
That's good.

1096
01:05:02,752 --> 01:05:03,886
Congrats!

1097
01:05:06,783 --> 01:05:09,563
You were already in bed
when you were partnered with me

1098
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:12,557
now you're sleeping on the floor.

1099
01:05:13,307 --> 01:05:14,369
Enough!

1100
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:27,524
What?

1101
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,338
I'm a better kisser
than Araw, right?

1102
01:05:30,021 --> 01:05:32,284
Well, yes.

1103
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:34,393
But that's Araw's charm.

1104
01:05:34,418 --> 01:05:37,799
He's the decent and
submissive good boy.

1105
01:05:37,824 --> 01:05:41,784
And I'm wild, and a dominatrix.

1106
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:44,073
If we were outside
of the Ship Show...

1107
01:05:44,098 --> 01:05:45,245
My God.

1108
01:05:45,348 --> 01:05:47,159
I'd definitely choose you.

1109
01:05:47,248 --> 01:05:49,208
But we're in the Ship Show.

1110
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:50,784
And for the nth time,

1111
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:52,159
we're not a match!

1112
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,155
We're like two flames

1113
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,573
colliding!

1114
01:05:57,651 --> 01:05:58,798
So, you're saying

1115
01:05:59,603 --> 01:06:03,127
if we were given another
chance to change partners,

1116
01:06:04,863 --> 01:06:06,502
you'd stick with Araw, huh?

1117
01:06:09,135 --> 01:06:10,260
It depends.

1118
01:06:14,462 --> 01:06:17,576
Girls, come on!
We need to clean your room.

1119
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:19,573
Just bring your valuables with you!

1120
01:06:19,647 --> 01:06:21,315
Belline, come on!

1121
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,213
Make sure to clean
my bedsheet thoroughly.

1122
01:06:27,238 --> 01:06:28,299
Yes, ma'am.

1123
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:38,625
[chattering]

1124
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,713
You really like working out, huh?

1125
01:06:41,393 --> 01:06:44,062
- How long do you--
- Can you not disturb me for now!

1126
01:06:54,019 --> 01:06:56,353
I'm just going to get
something from my room.

1127
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,635
You know, even if
we're not a love team,

1128
01:07:30,322 --> 01:07:32,424
we can still be friends.

1129
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,327
Have you seen my Bible?

1130
01:07:40,629 --> 01:07:42,172
It's just under
the pillow, Ma'am.

1131
01:07:42,197 --> 01:07:44,700
Okay, I just have a verse to read.

1132
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:16,195
Oh, you devil!

1133
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:18,019
Hi, Nesty!

1134
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:20,629
Sorry, I thought
you were a ghost.

1135
01:08:20,874 --> 01:08:22,666
You're so cute when
you're scared.

1136
01:08:22,986 --> 01:08:25,299
Anyway, tomorrow night,

1137
01:08:25,682 --> 01:08:28,495
we'll be given another
chance to change partners.

1138
01:08:29,549 --> 01:08:30,694
How did you know that?

1139
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:34,245
Let's just say I overheard
the staff meeting.

1140
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:37,360
Anyway.

1141
01:08:37,555 --> 01:08:40,134
We need a strategic partnership.

1142
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:43,010
Let's choose each other.

1143
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:44,622
Oh my.

1144
01:08:45,095 --> 01:08:48,986
Why would you want
to be paired with me? I'm so plain.

1145
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:54,401
I have a secret to tell you...

1146
01:08:55,155 --> 01:08:58,463
you're the number one male Love Bird
here in the Ship Show.

1147
01:09:01,063 --> 01:09:03,440
So, Tintin and I are the
number one love team?

1148
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:09,533
I also found out that

1149
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:13,643
your family's life is in a terrible state.

1150
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:17,346
I mean, it's already established since

1151
01:09:17,371 --> 01:09:19,594
we were interviewed
one by one in the Ship Show,

1152
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:22,315
But you guys are really poor,
aren't you?

1153
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:24,223
Choose me tomorrow.

1154
01:09:24,248 --> 01:09:25,573
And I'll make sure

1155
01:09:25,598 --> 01:09:28,852
that I can provide a lot of money
for your family in the province.

1156
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:32,462
How much?

1157
01:09:32,671 --> 01:09:33,838
Forty thousand!

1158
01:09:34,182 --> 01:09:36,987
No! Okay, fifty!

1159
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:41,808
Be wise, baby.

1160
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:43,635
Life's not easy.

1161
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:50,348
Earlier, we called in the
Love Birds one by one

1162
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:54,221
and asked if they wished to
stay with their current love team,

1163
01:09:54,246 --> 01:09:56,557
or to switch partners.

1164
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:59,995
Those who said yes,
who wish to switch,

1165
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,971
please take a step forward.

1166
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,588
Ashley, please explain your decision.

1167
01:10:13,917 --> 01:10:15,782
I'm not connecting with Chia.

1168
01:10:15,861 --> 01:10:18,064
There's nothing about us
worth shipping.

1169
01:10:18,628 --> 01:10:22,120
Chia, what's your response
to Ashley's statement?

1170
01:10:23,424 --> 01:10:25,893
I've felt it from the start

1171
01:10:26,027 --> 01:10:28,270
that I wasn't really his type.

1172
01:10:29,971 --> 01:10:32,019
I accept his decision.

1173
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,314
Belline.

1174
01:10:33,853 --> 01:10:34,901
[clears throat]

1175
01:10:35,426 --> 01:10:38,104
I've discovered,
aspects of the person

1176
01:10:38,129 --> 01:10:39,354
that made me surmise

1177
01:10:39,379 --> 01:10:41,089
we are not a match
in the long term.

1178
01:10:41,418 --> 01:10:43,128
Ambition matters to me,

1179
01:10:43,192 --> 01:10:46,534
and alas, I just don't see
that in my current partner.

1180
01:10:46,559 --> 01:10:49,034
Am I watching a beauty pageant?

1181
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:52,049
Can someone please
get me a cup of coffee?

1182
01:10:52,245 --> 01:10:53,478
Black!

1183
01:10:53,503 --> 01:10:54,581
Nestor!

1184
01:10:58,362 --> 01:10:59,598
In my opinion,

1185
01:11:00,916 --> 01:11:03,034
I don't deserve Tintin.

1186
01:11:03,059 --> 01:11:05,018
She's too noble for me.

1187
01:11:05,581 --> 01:11:07,932
What do you have to
say about that, Tintin?

1188
01:11:13,376 --> 01:11:15,987
What are you saying, Nestor?

1189
01:11:16,626 --> 01:11:19,487
What the heck? You know
I love you so much, right?

1190
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,604
Finally, some drama!

1191
01:11:26,629 --> 01:11:28,167
Some drama!

1192
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:30,740
Now it's time for each
of the three Love Birds

1193
01:11:30,765 --> 01:11:33,518
who stepped forward
to pick the person he or she

1194
01:11:33,543 --> 01:11:35,096
wishes to be paired with.

1195
01:11:35,215 --> 01:11:37,042
Let's start with you, Ashley.

1196
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,049
Belline.

1197
01:11:39,074 --> 01:11:42,877
As before, you can only be successfully
paired with the Love Bird you chose

1198
01:11:42,902 --> 01:11:45,198
if they also want to
be paired with you.

1199
01:11:45,595 --> 01:11:46,663
Belline,

1200
01:11:46,688 --> 01:11:48,932
do you choose Ashley back?

1201
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,248
Nope!

1202
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:51,698
Oh my god!

1203
01:11:51,723 --> 01:11:53,846
Don't tell me she wants Buddy?

1204
01:11:53,871 --> 01:11:54,889
You, Belline,

1205
01:11:54,914 --> 01:11:56,963
who do you want to
be paired with now?

1206
01:11:56,988 --> 01:12:00,354
We all know that I come
from the world of the elite.

1207
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:03,837
This may come
as a surprise but lately

1208
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:06,854
I've taken a liking to
someone of opposite status.

1209
01:12:07,045 --> 01:12:08,120
Therefore,

1210
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,729
I choose Nestor.

1211
01:12:10,754 --> 01:12:11,784
Whoa!

1212
01:12:11,809 --> 01:12:14,582
- What a big surprise!
- What?

1213
01:12:14,822 --> 01:12:16,846
Now, let's ask Nestor.

1214
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:19,252
Who do you want
to be paired with?

1215
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:36,582
I'm sorry!

1216
01:12:36,994 --> 01:12:38,942
I don't want to switch
partners anymore.

1217
01:12:39,408 --> 01:12:40,485
Can I just

1218
01:12:40,871 --> 01:12:42,127
choose Tintin again?

1219
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:45,005
Direk! Direk!

1220
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:46,088
Are we going to allow this?

1221
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:47,706
- Yes, go ahead!
- No!

1222
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:49,909
It should be touch-move
for more conflict!

1223
01:12:59,009 --> 01:13:01,002
Okay, sorry, Nestor.

1224
01:13:01,221 --> 01:13:02,665
According to our show runners,

1225
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:05,479
you can't change your decision now.

1226
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:13,190
The new partner I choose

1227
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:20,001
is Shey.

1228
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,108
What the hell?

1229
01:13:22,556 --> 01:13:25,491
This little bird's clever too, isn't he?

1230
01:13:25,516 --> 01:13:26,556
Why?

1231
01:13:27,065 --> 01:13:28,007
Oh, oh!

1232
01:13:28,032 --> 01:13:29,745
Right, right!

1233
01:13:29,843 --> 01:13:33,071
He's doing this so
he ends up with Tintin again!

1234
01:13:33,096 --> 01:13:34,299
But, that means...

1235
01:13:34,324 --> 01:13:36,891
the love teams remain
the same tomorrow.

1236
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:37,935
How boring.

1237
01:13:38,549 --> 01:13:39,681
Move over.

1238
01:13:40,618 --> 01:13:41,871
I have an idea.

1239
01:13:41,896 --> 01:13:44,624
Obviously, Shey has no intention
of switching love teams

1240
01:13:44,649 --> 01:13:48,479
so, no need to ask her if she wants
to choose Nestor back.

1241
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:57,603
Alright, we're not done yet.

1242
01:13:57,628 --> 01:13:59,292
Listen carefully.

1243
01:13:59,354 --> 01:14:01,850
Since none of Ashley,
Belline, and Nestor

1244
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:05,659
were chosen back by the Love Birds
they wanted to partner with,

1245
01:14:05,684 --> 01:14:06,682
Chia?

1246
01:14:06,707 --> 01:14:07,707
Araw?

1247
01:14:07,732 --> 01:14:08,732
Tintin?

1248
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:13,393
You're given the option
to choose a new partner.

1249
01:14:13,698 --> 01:14:17,282
You are given ten seconds
to approach and embrace.

1250
01:14:17,307 --> 01:14:19,846
The Love Bird you want to pair with.

1251
01:14:20,283 --> 01:14:21,283
Ten,

1252
01:14:22,643 --> 01:14:23,812
nine,

1253
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:26,909
eight,

1254
01:14:27,817 --> 01:14:29,401
seven,

1255
01:14:30,361 --> 01:14:31,847
six,

1256
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:34,182
five,

1257
01:14:35,503 --> 01:14:36,679
four,

1258
01:14:37,827 --> 01:14:39,479
three,

1259
01:14:40,056 --> 01:14:41,398
two,

1260
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:43,942
one!

1261
01:14:45,019 --> 01:14:46,542
Time's up!

1262
01:15:09,977 --> 01:15:12,189
So, what are we going
to do with these two?

1263
01:15:14,061 --> 01:15:15,228
Drama.

1264
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:28,741
Ashley and Belline,

1265
01:15:28,766 --> 01:15:31,213
you are both left without a love team.

1266
01:15:31,502 --> 01:15:32,550
However...

1267
01:15:32,575 --> 01:15:35,487
You will not be forced back
into a love team.

1268
01:15:35,716 --> 01:15:38,926
Instead, you are both...

1269
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:41,537
eliminated from the Ship Show!

1270
01:15:41,562 --> 01:15:43,034
Are you serious?

1271
01:15:43,059 --> 01:15:45,896
Shouldn't elimination be based
on the votes of the Shippers?

1272
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,606
Indeed! This is unfair!

1273
01:15:47,631 --> 01:15:50,708
I'm sorry, that is the decision.

1274
01:15:50,733 --> 01:15:51,760
Whose decision?

1275
01:15:51,785 --> 01:15:53,846
Only the Shippers
have the right to decide.

1276
01:15:53,871 --> 01:15:57,346
You dare tell me that Belline and I's
love team got the lowest votes?

1277
01:15:57,473 --> 01:15:58,971
But you're not a love team anymore.

1278
01:15:58,996 --> 01:16:01,647
You both requested
to change partners.

1279
01:16:01,672 --> 01:16:04,425
You are eliminated because,
no one wants you anymore.

1280
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:05,479
No!

1281
01:16:05,504 --> 01:16:08,260
Ashley and I really
want each other! Right?

1282
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:18,359
Hey!

1283
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,400
No!

1284
01:16:23,519 --> 01:16:24,620
No!

1285
01:16:24,645 --> 01:16:25,645
No!

1286
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:27,929
Drama!

1287
01:16:27,954 --> 01:16:29,289
Finally, there's drama!

1288
01:16:29,314 --> 01:16:30,648
We're trending!

1289
01:16:30,648 --> 01:16:31,316
Because!

1290
01:16:31,316 --> 01:16:32,608
We have drama!

1291
01:16:32,633 --> 01:16:35,069
And that's why people watch us!

1292
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:36,855
Not talent!

1293
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:54,111
Psst!

1294
01:16:54,353 --> 01:16:55,378
Hey!

1295
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,668
Come on, are you going
to sleep already?

1296
01:16:58,276 --> 01:16:59,484
Let's go outside.

1297
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:04,644
I'm surprised you have
some energy left.

1298
01:17:05,604 --> 01:17:06,652
Come on.

1299
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,612
You should be thankful that
I saved you from elimination.

1300
01:17:10,799 --> 01:17:14,959
Hey, if you didn't choose me,
I would've gone back to Ashley anyway!

1301
01:17:14,984 --> 01:17:16,886
You're also heading
to elimination, right?

1302
01:17:16,976 --> 01:17:18,824
People really don't like you.

1303
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:20,152
Well, the same goes for you, right?

1304
01:17:20,373 --> 01:17:22,959
If you didn't pick me, you would've
ended up with Belline anyway.

1305
01:17:23,051 --> 01:17:24,093
Hey!

1306
01:17:24,118 --> 01:17:26,304
You guys are so messy!

1307
01:17:26,329 --> 01:17:28,683
We're going to step out.
You're kind of ruining our moment.

1308
01:17:28,726 --> 01:17:29,738
Sorry.

1309
01:17:32,932 --> 01:17:34,419
It's not twelve o'clock?

1310
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,943
So what now?

1311
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:42,512
Is it okay for the audience
to hear us argue?

1312
01:17:46,136 --> 01:17:47,187
You know,

1313
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:49,511
that kind of thing deducts points.

1314
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:50,763
Like that!

1315
01:17:50,824 --> 01:17:55,715
When you care too much
about other people's opinions.

1316
01:17:56,063 --> 01:17:58,823
I think we should just keep it real.

1317
01:18:00,299 --> 01:18:01,972
Huh, real?

1318
01:18:02,824 --> 01:18:05,418
Aren't you the one
acting all mysterious?

1319
01:18:05,443 --> 01:18:08,957
Pretending to not give a damn
because you're scared of getting hurt.

1320
01:18:10,597 --> 01:18:11,707
Wait,

1321
01:18:12,089 --> 01:18:13,730
why did you choose me anyway?

1322
01:18:13,933 --> 01:18:16,783
Don't tell me that you just
wanted to save me?

1323
01:18:23,892 --> 01:18:25,918
I really wanted to be your partner.

1324
01:18:37,554 --> 01:18:41,378
This is the part where you admit
you wanted me to be your partner, too.

1325
01:18:45,097 --> 01:18:46,210
Fine.

1326
01:18:50,128 --> 01:18:51,332
Louder.

1327
01:18:51,543 --> 01:18:52,999
So they can hear.

1328
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:15,206
I really wanted Araw to be
my partner again.

1329
01:19:15,231 --> 01:19:18,465
I regret that I decided to switch
partners in the first place.

1330
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:20,519
I hope you could all forgive me.

1331
01:19:26,769 --> 01:19:28,841
But frankly,
it's kind of Araw's fault too,

1332
01:19:28,866 --> 01:19:32,122
he didn't tell me directly
that he wanted me.

1333
01:19:32,215 --> 01:19:37,136
So I developed anxiety and insecurity
towards our love team.

1334
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:51,622
Fine.

1335
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:53,553
Say it louder!

1336
01:19:53,695 --> 01:19:56,097
So our Shippers can hear, hurry.

1337
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,798
I really like Chia!

1338
01:20:08,519 --> 01:20:10,968
Not only as a partner,

1339
01:20:10,993 --> 01:20:14,426
but as a person in general.

1340
01:20:28,519 --> 01:20:30,620
Let's go there.
There's a camera.

1341
01:20:31,518 --> 01:20:33,144
What do I do?

1342
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:36,253
Tell them what my
problems were with you.

1343
01:20:39,308 --> 01:20:42,420
I'm not good with making
decisions on my own.

1344
01:20:42,515 --> 01:20:44,805
I used to go with the flow because...

1345
01:20:44,931 --> 01:20:46,380
I'm afraid of being let-down.

1346
01:20:46,971 --> 01:20:48,149
But from now on,

1347
01:20:48,918 --> 01:20:50,577
I want to take control.

1348
01:20:53,222 --> 01:20:55,008
Here, here, okay.

1349
01:20:55,095 --> 01:20:56,643
Now, put me in the hot seat.

1350
01:20:56,668 --> 01:21:00,574
Tell me, and our viewers,
what your problems were with me.

1351
01:21:00,747 --> 01:21:01,859
Hurry!

1352
01:21:01,938 --> 01:21:03,016
You won't cry?

1353
01:21:03,848 --> 01:21:04,863
Trust me.

1354
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,049
Go!

1355
01:21:06,739 --> 01:21:09,730
At first, you were too competitive,

1356
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,574
now you're no longer competitive at all.

1357
01:21:13,339 --> 01:21:14,347
So?

1358
01:21:15,339 --> 01:21:16,613
That means I'm good?

1359
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:18,198
Nope.

1360
01:21:18,511 --> 01:21:21,082
Because you lost your will to compete

1361
01:21:21,107 --> 01:21:24,855
not because you no longer care
of what others think,

1362
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:28,808
but because you've already given up.

1363
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:31,313
Huh?

1364
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:34,036
I don't get it.

1365
01:21:39,267 --> 01:21:40,473
Deep down,

1366
01:21:40,579 --> 01:21:43,653
you believe that you don't
deserve to win.

1367
01:21:44,182 --> 01:21:48,449
So now you're just trying to find
something to prove to yourself that

1368
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:50,744
you really don't deserve to win.

1369
01:21:53,132 --> 01:21:54,873
What even makes you say that?

1370
01:21:55,636 --> 01:21:59,753
What did you say earlier when
Ashley decided to switch partners?

1371
01:22:02,555 --> 01:22:04,629
I've felt it from the start

1372
01:22:04,654 --> 01:22:07,004
that I wasn't really his type.

1373
01:22:08,651 --> 01:22:10,622
I accept his decision.

1374
01:22:12,652 --> 01:22:13,824
See?

1375
01:22:19,413 --> 01:22:20,769
So, what do you want?

1376
01:22:21,024 --> 01:22:22,567
That I become competitive again?

1377
01:22:23,033 --> 01:22:24,160
No.

1378
01:22:25,869 --> 01:22:28,149
I want you to rekindle your passion.

1379
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:34,861
Go back to why you are
here in the first place.

1380
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:44,063
- I want to be an actress.
- Mhm.

1381
01:22:44,088 --> 01:22:45,198
There!

1382
01:22:45,783 --> 01:22:47,775
Make that your motivation.

1383
01:22:48,446 --> 01:22:50,253
Not just winning.

1384
01:22:50,906 --> 01:22:52,603
Attention, Love Birds!

1385
01:22:52,628 --> 01:22:55,095
Time check: it's twelve midnight!

1386
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,986
All cameras and microphones
will stop recording in three,

1387
01:22:59,011 --> 01:23:01,001
two, one.

1388
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:02,228
Let's go?

1389
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:08,389
You know,

1390
01:23:08,446 --> 01:23:12,439
we need a gameplan so we can achieve
your dream to be an actress.

1391
01:23:12,586 --> 01:23:15,569
How so? The people only
vote for those who they want

1392
01:23:15,594 --> 01:23:17,388
to end up as real lovers.

1393
01:23:17,413 --> 01:23:19,749
They're not basing it on whether
we're good at acting or not.

1394
01:23:22,681 --> 01:23:25,525
I think you should
be acting all the time.

1395
01:23:25,561 --> 01:23:26,829
What?

1396
01:23:27,501 --> 01:23:29,853
Really embody the role of a girlfriend.

1397
01:23:31,733 --> 01:23:34,097
Act as if you truly love me.

1398
01:23:35,432 --> 01:23:38,776
Only a skilled actress
can pull that off, right?

1399
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:41,774
Correct?

1400
01:23:43,939 --> 01:23:45,400
Alright.

1401
01:23:45,856 --> 01:23:49,112
But you have to reciprocate, okay?
To make it convincing.

1402
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:54,244
The problem is I'm not a good actor.

1403
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:57,912
I need to feel the truth first before
I can play the role of a boyfriend.

1404
01:24:00,339 --> 01:24:01,749
Meaning?

1405
01:24:03,332 --> 01:24:05,336
Can I be your boyfriend?

1406
01:24:07,735 --> 01:24:10,113
Like, just for the sake of the show?

1407
01:24:12,435 --> 01:24:14,229
I just really want to
be your boyfriend.

1408
01:24:16,698 --> 01:24:17,727
[clears throat]

1409
01:24:19,024 --> 01:24:21,672
- Oka--
- I mean, there's no pressure.

1410
01:24:21,697 --> 01:24:26,634
- Only if you want it too.
- Ah, there he goes again.

1411
01:24:26,887 --> 01:24:28,597
A disclaimer right away?

1412
01:24:28,622 --> 01:24:29,915
You really don't want
to be let down, huh?

1413
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,892
No! Well, it can't just
be me who's interested.

1414
01:24:33,092 --> 01:24:34,907
That's why it's called a relationship.

1415
01:24:36,376 --> 01:24:37,496
Well, okay then!

1416
01:24:37,521 --> 01:24:39,626
Court me first,
then I'll decide.

1417
01:24:39,962 --> 01:24:41,278
Is that still a thing?

1418
01:24:42,111 --> 01:24:43,766
Don't you want to be my boyfriend?

1419
01:24:44,354 --> 01:24:46,595
You're playing hard to get.

1420
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:48,509
This is also for your dream.

1421
01:24:49,762 --> 01:24:52,125
Okay, let me think about it.

1422
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,666
What's that?

1423
01:25:36,819 --> 01:25:38,154
Being in control.

1424
01:25:42,205 --> 01:25:44,345
See, you're hotter
when you're like that.

1425
01:26:46,454 --> 01:26:47,685
Everyone's great,

1426
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:50,697
and it's almost like they're
all real couples, are they?

1427
01:26:51,598 --> 01:26:53,767
Why don't we ask the Love Birds?

1428
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:54,916
- Yes sir!
- Yes sir!

1429
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:56,371
- Yes sir!
- Yes sir!

1430
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:02,228
Actually, sir, we're exes.

1431
01:27:02,898 --> 01:27:05,868
But through The Ship Show,

1432
01:27:06,241 --> 01:27:09,087
we've resolved our past issues and...

1433
01:27:09,301 --> 01:27:12,251
learned to trust
each other again.

1434
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:14,326
Once we get out of here,

1435
01:27:14,436 --> 01:27:17,516
we'll try to get back together.

1436
01:27:17,601 --> 01:27:18,931
Why not right now?

1437
01:27:19,217 --> 01:27:21,681
Because if we did it here,
it might

1438
01:27:21,706 --> 01:27:23,124
seem like we have an agenda.

1439
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:26,126
People, and even Shey and I,

1440
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:28,697
might think we're only
getting back together to

1441
01:27:28,753 --> 01:27:31,580
increase our chances
of winning on this show.

1442
01:27:31,605 --> 01:27:32,940
Aw, nice answer.

1443
01:27:33,254 --> 01:27:35,392
The show became boring
when Belline left.

1444
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:38,884
What do you want to do? Bring her
back and Ashley as a wild card?

1445
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:41,052
We need more drama.

1446
01:27:41,835 --> 01:27:43,821
According to the Shippers' vote,

1447
01:27:43,966 --> 01:27:45,830
your love team has...

1448
01:27:46,221 --> 01:27:47,353
sunk!

1449
01:27:47,424 --> 01:27:52,556
Buddy and Shey, you are
eliminated from the Ship Show.

1450
01:27:56,001 --> 01:27:57,346
Aww.

1451
01:27:57,699 --> 01:27:59,122
Miss Belline?

1452
01:27:59,147 --> 01:28:01,072
Look at what we've found out.

1453
01:28:06,056 --> 01:28:07,080
Oh!

1454
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:10,025
What do we have here?

1455
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,594
The challenge this time
is romantic tension.

1456
01:28:17,998 --> 01:28:21,150
My first challenge for you
was straightforward.

1457
01:28:21,435 --> 01:28:24,017
Here, the scene is a big fight.

1458
01:28:24,556 --> 01:28:25,933
But even though you're fighting,

1459
01:28:26,086 --> 01:28:29,150
the audience should
still feel the romance.

1460
01:28:29,244 --> 01:28:30,372
- Direk?
- Yes?

1461
01:28:30,397 --> 01:28:33,158
According to the script,
there's a kissing scene.

1462
01:28:33,195 --> 01:28:34,611
Are we really doing it?

1463
01:28:34,736 --> 01:28:37,455
Actually, your writer said,

1464
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,845
there's a twist
in this challenge.

1465
01:28:40,893 --> 01:28:42,580
You'll swap partners!

1466
01:28:46,012 --> 01:28:49,375
But why aren't we doing the
scene with our own love team?

1467
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,404
Well,

1468
01:28:50,429 --> 01:28:53,138
that's the challenge!

1469
01:28:55,744 --> 01:28:57,854
So, Chia,
when you get here,

1470
01:28:57,879 --> 01:29:00,154
you see Nestor eating the food.

1471
01:29:00,248 --> 01:29:01,625
You'll now hit him on the head.

1472
01:29:01,724 --> 01:29:02,733
Hey!

1473
01:29:02,758 --> 01:29:04,427
That's for our guests!

1474
01:29:04,813 --> 01:29:07,318
Of course, Nestor, you're triggered!
She just hit you.

1475
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,522
So, you stand up.

1476
01:29:09,225 --> 01:29:10,521
Stand up! Stand up!

1477
01:29:11,029 --> 01:29:12,868
Then, you confront her.

1478
01:29:12,893 --> 01:29:14,154
Lines, lines, lines.

1479
01:29:14,179 --> 01:29:17,318
Ah, I don't care if the lines
are a bit unclear,

1480
01:29:17,343 --> 01:29:19,779
even if they overlap, that's fine.
The important thing is

1481
01:29:19,804 --> 01:29:22,068
we see this as a marital spat.

1482
01:29:22,093 --> 01:29:23,372
- Okay, direk.
- Okay?

1483
01:29:23,498 --> 01:29:25,857
After Chia, after you deliver your line,
what's that?

1484
01:29:28,568 --> 01:29:30,810
I'm thinking that you
don't love me anymore.

1485
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:35,255
So, Nestor, even if you're furious,

1486
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:37,289
you approach her and then...

1487
01:29:37,314 --> 01:29:39,349
you kiss her on the lips.

1488
01:29:39,538 --> 01:29:40,574
Alright,

1489
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:42,654
you guys rehearse on your own now.

1490
01:29:42,691 --> 01:29:44,201
- I need to direct these two.
- Direk?

1491
01:29:44,226 --> 01:29:46,478
Can I talk to Tintin for a moment,
I just need to ask...

1492
01:29:46,503 --> 01:29:47,333
No!

1493
01:29:47,358 --> 01:29:48,990
You stay there, and do your job!

1494
01:29:50,017 --> 01:29:52,074
Are we really doing this?

1495
01:29:53,241 --> 01:29:55,958
Nestor, we're actors, aren't we?

1496
01:29:56,380 --> 01:30:00,107
I think this is a test to see
if we're professional.

1497
01:30:00,355 --> 01:30:05,029
We do whatever the script says,
or whatever the director instructs us.

1498
01:30:05,303 --> 01:30:06,679
Is that how it is?

1499
01:30:07,349 --> 01:30:12,724
Technically, it's not us who are kissing,
but our characters.

1500
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,989
No way, I don't want to!

1501
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:19,159
I value the Shippers of
Nestor's and my love team.

1502
01:30:19,184 --> 01:30:23,966
They're invested in us as a duo,
not as individuals. Do you get that?

1503
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:25,618
I want to respect that!

1504
01:30:27,249 --> 01:30:28,642
It's just acting.

1505
01:30:28,667 --> 01:30:30,461
For us, it's acting.

1506
01:30:30,486 --> 01:30:32,740
But for other people, it's not!

1507
01:30:32,765 --> 01:30:34,691
What are you talking about?
This is the Ship Show, Araw.

1508
01:30:34,716 --> 01:30:37,953
Ship Show! I have no interest
in winning as a solo star!

1509
01:30:37,978 --> 01:30:41,565
Or winning with you! Especially
now that Nestor and I are dating.

1510
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:45,321
So, what, you're okay with your girlfriend
being kissed by another guy?

1511
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:46,817
Well, it's just work.

1512
01:30:46,889 --> 01:30:48,662
I trust Chia.

1513
01:30:48,794 --> 01:30:50,607
Well, good for you. But for me.

1514
01:30:50,632 --> 01:30:54,951
A peck on the cheek is all I can do!
My body, my rules!

1515
01:30:57,438 --> 01:30:58,564
We're ready, Director!

1516
01:30:58,615 --> 01:31:00,659
You've got an attitude, girl!

1517
01:31:00,684 --> 01:31:02,466
Do you agree with her behavior?

1518
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:05,701
Well, I'm not taking sides.

1519
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:09,779
But I'm just happy to
see their values clash.

1520
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:11,257
That's drama!

1521
01:31:11,282 --> 01:31:12,087
Direk!

1522
01:31:12,112 --> 01:31:13,447
Look at what's circulating
on the internet!

1523
01:31:13,447 --> 01:31:14,156
What's this?!

1524
01:31:14,357 --> 01:31:15,975
Nestor has a child?

1525
01:31:16,826 --> 01:31:18,435
Holy shit!

1526
01:31:18,865 --> 01:31:22,052
Oh my god!

1527
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:25,583
Oh, that's drama!

1528
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:28,581
Wow! Wow!

1529
01:31:28,606 --> 01:31:30,464
Hot damn!

1530
01:31:30,489 --> 01:31:31,815
Why did you hit me?

1531
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,567
You could have told me
nicely, couldn't you?

1532
01:31:33,592 --> 01:31:36,178
But didn't I tell you
that's for our guests!

1533
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:38,302
Well, I'm your guest too, right?

1534
01:31:38,745 --> 01:31:41,375
You know, sometimes,
I wonder if you really love me.

1535
01:31:45,128 --> 01:31:47,869
I love your acting, Araw,
very subdued.

1536
01:31:47,894 --> 01:31:50,426
But it gets the message across.

1537
01:31:50,536 --> 01:31:52,115
Tintin obviously feels awkward.

1538
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,016
But not in a way that she's
not doing it intentionally.

1539
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:56,432
For me, it's like you're
purposely faking it.

1540
01:31:56,679 --> 01:31:59,727
From my perspective,
it just seems unprofessional.

1541
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,647
I wouldn't want to work
with you on any project.

1542
01:32:03,957 --> 01:32:06,919
Why did you hit me?
You couldn't have asked nicely?

1543
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:09,655
Didn't I tell you
that's for the guests?

1544
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,404
Well, I'm your guest, too, right?

1545
01:32:11,577 --> 01:32:13,324
You know what sometimes I wonder...

1546
01:32:13,674 --> 01:32:15,326
if you truly love me.

1547
01:32:19,801 --> 01:32:21,156
Bravo, Chia!

1548
01:32:21,181 --> 01:32:25,060
I can imagine you as a
future primetime princess.

1549
01:32:25,085 --> 01:32:26,122
Thank you, thank you!

1550
01:32:26,147 --> 01:32:27,788
I agree. Even though
you're not a love team,

1551
01:32:27,813 --> 01:32:30,279
while watching, I believed that

1552
01:32:30,304 --> 01:32:31,680
you really like Nestor.

1553
01:32:31,705 --> 01:32:32,626
Thank you.

1554
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:35,662
Nestor's okay too,
but he froze during the kiss.

1555
01:32:36,112 --> 01:32:37,865
Was this your first kiss, son?

1556
01:32:37,949 --> 01:32:40,267
No, direk. I just got nervous.

1557
01:32:40,551 --> 01:32:43,899
Love Birds, please go back
to your respective love teams.

1558
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:47,683
Okay, let's now ask
our E-love-uators.

1559
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:50,904
who they think is the best performer
out of the four.

1560
01:32:50,929 --> 01:32:52,263
Let's start with Miss Tata.

1561
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:55,231
Chia!

1562
01:32:56,919 --> 01:32:57,931
Chia!

1563
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:00,637
Chia!

1564
01:33:09,156 --> 01:33:12,951
Can I talk to anyone about
what we discuss here?

1565
01:33:13,306 --> 01:33:15,740
Actually, you can!

1566
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,013
We have something to show you.

1567
01:33:22,317 --> 01:33:23,472
Go on.

1568
01:33:26,193 --> 01:33:27,414
Who's that?

1569
01:33:28,324 --> 01:33:29,740
That's Nestor!

1570
01:33:30,401 --> 01:33:33,112
No, not him!
The child he's holding.

1571
01:33:43,278 --> 01:33:44,348
Nestor,

1572
01:33:45,398 --> 01:33:46,775
please sit next to Tintin.

1573
01:33:55,428 --> 01:33:57,168
Tintin has a question.

1574
01:33:57,503 --> 01:34:00,168
Who's that kid you're holding?

1575
01:34:13,003 --> 01:34:16,575
My girlfriend got pregnant,
that was four years ago.

1576
01:34:18,496 --> 01:34:20,563
When she gave birth,
she died so...

1577
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:23,051
I'm raising our child on my own.

1578
01:34:29,685 --> 01:34:31,965
Why didn't you tell me?

1579
01:34:33,096 --> 01:34:36,199
- Was it all a lie?
- No!

1580
01:34:36,224 --> 01:34:37,802
Then why?

1581
01:34:42,496 --> 01:34:43,672
Why did you lie?

1582
01:34:43,697 --> 01:34:46,034
Why?

1583
01:34:52,157 --> 01:34:53,575
Congrats to both of you!

1584
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:55,717
Tintin.

1585
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:58,739
Leave me alone for a while, Nestor!

1586
01:35:03,835 --> 01:35:05,406
I'm sure we're going to lose now.

1587
01:35:07,699 --> 01:35:09,197
What's even more painful,

1588
01:35:10,136 --> 01:35:12,378
is that I'll lose Tintin too.

1589
01:35:14,628 --> 01:35:16,874
In the end, I'm left with nothing.

1590
01:35:18,805 --> 01:35:20,795
I really shouldn't
have joined this show.

1591
01:35:25,276 --> 01:35:28,310
You know what, I think
this show wants us

1592
01:35:28,675 --> 01:35:32,106
to pretend until we make
the audience believe.

1593
01:35:33,433 --> 01:35:35,901
Maybe you and Tintin can do that.

1594
01:35:37,012 --> 01:35:38,863
Just pretend that,

1595
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:42,714
Tintin is okay,
with you having a child,

1596
01:35:44,466 --> 01:35:46,245
that she accepts you completely.

1597
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:48,638
On the other hand, Nestor,

1598
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:51,625
I think you should just keep it real.

1599
01:35:52,903 --> 01:35:54,628
Tell the truth that

1600
01:35:54,993 --> 01:35:56,797
you really love your child,

1601
01:35:57,378 --> 01:35:59,091
that he's your priority.

1602
01:36:00,788 --> 01:36:02,136
And at the same time,

1603
01:36:03,486 --> 01:36:06,212
the love you have
for Tintin is genuine.

1604
01:36:07,912 --> 01:36:11,896
Let her decide whether
she'd keep on loving you.

1605
01:36:13,202 --> 01:36:17,526
There. That's nice.
The audience will love that.

1606
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,491
Hold on, why are you two
giving me advice?

1607
01:36:25,349 --> 01:36:28,329
Aren't you happy that our love team
is in shambles?

1608
01:36:29,174 --> 01:36:30,664
Don't you want to win?

1609
01:36:32,213 --> 01:36:36,378
If we're going to win, I'd like it
to be because of our acting skills.

1610
01:36:36,672 --> 01:36:39,131
Not because of any drama like this.

1611
01:36:41,022 --> 01:36:42,343
So stop crying.

1612
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:48,044
Did you see that?
The look, it's funny because...

1613
01:36:48,693 --> 01:36:49,591
Us?

1614
01:36:49,616 --> 01:36:51,593
Yes, let's keep it to ourselves.

1615
01:36:51,618 --> 01:36:53,898
- You have to tell—
- Hello, Love Birds!

1616
01:36:55,475 --> 01:36:56,969
Hello!

1617
01:36:57,828 --> 01:36:59,125
Who are you?

1618
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:02,953
Oh, I'm so sorry,
you haven't met me yet.

1619
01:37:03,028 --> 01:37:05,953
I am Jing Pasion.

1620
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,478
I'm the head writer.

1621
01:37:09,001 --> 01:37:13,414
Actually, the only writer
of the Ship Show.

1622
01:37:14,357 --> 01:37:16,326
And I'm here to
congratulate both of you.

1623
01:37:16,351 --> 01:37:19,773
Because #ArChia
has so many fans.

1624
01:37:19,798 --> 01:37:21,867
- Really?
- Yes, yes!

1625
01:37:21,892 --> 01:37:22,984
See?!

1626
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:28,472
But, after your recent
acting challenge aired,

1627
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:33,435
fans started to call you
a selfish bitch.

1628
01:37:34,632 --> 01:37:37,195
Actually you were trending
on Twitter—

1629
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:40,953
#TSSChiaCheater

1630
01:37:41,328 --> 01:37:46,601
They say you were quick to kiss a guy
who isn't your love team.

1631
01:37:47,028 --> 01:37:50,448
That you are willing to do
all these things to win.

1632
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:55,015
And they didn't see even
a hint of hesitation in you.

1633
01:37:55,283 --> 01:37:57,668
Chia is just doing her job.

1634
01:37:59,054 --> 01:38:01,505
Do not shoot the messenger.

1635
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:04,540
I'm just here to relay
the messages to you,

1636
01:38:04,565 --> 01:38:07,374
what we're reading
on social media.

1637
01:38:07,399 --> 01:38:09,296
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even supposed

1638
01:38:09,321 --> 01:38:11,156
to tell you all this information.

1639
01:38:11,181 --> 01:38:14,429
But because I care about
your love team—

1640
01:38:15,085 --> 01:38:16,603
I'm telling you.

1641
01:38:16,914 --> 01:38:19,180
You wouldn't want
to anger a big chunk,

1642
01:38:19,205 --> 01:38:21,242
of your Shippers, would you?

1643
01:38:21,468 --> 01:38:27,929
After all, your love team's success
heavily depends on them.

1644
01:38:37,699 --> 01:38:41,161
In a short while, we will
find out who the Shippers

1645
01:38:41,186 --> 01:38:45,013
will hail as the next big love team
of the Philippines!

1646
01:38:45,794 --> 01:38:48,383
Each love team will be given
the whole day today

1647
01:38:48,408 --> 01:38:51,263
to prepare for your final
showdown tomorrow.

1648
01:38:51,867 --> 01:38:54,141
What kind of showdown?

1649
01:38:54,622 --> 01:38:55,765
It's up to you!

1650
01:38:55,856 --> 01:38:58,692
It can be a dance number,
a song number.

1651
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,771
even a declamation if you like.

1652
01:39:00,796 --> 01:39:03,271
Just show the Shippers
what you got,

1653
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:06,763
as a love team to
convince them one last time

1654
01:39:06,788 --> 01:39:08,950
that you're deserving to win.

1655
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:11,784
Good luck, dude!

1656
01:39:11,809 --> 01:39:13,343
- Alright.
- I'll stay here for now.

1657
01:39:15,024 --> 01:39:16,818
So, what's our plan?

1658
01:39:19,913 --> 01:39:23,746
How about the dance routine
we did before?

1659
01:39:24,161 --> 01:39:27,060
We'll just improve it.

1660
01:39:28,595 --> 01:39:30,844
I'm sure by now,

1661
01:39:31,921 --> 01:39:34,138
our chemistry is much better.

1662
01:39:34,337 --> 01:39:35,407
I don't think that's it.

1663
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,760
We should have a
winning performance...

1664
01:39:38,785 --> 01:39:42,919
More romantic,
with a lot of touching.

1665
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:45,333
Don't you want to just
improve the—

1666
01:39:45,358 --> 01:39:46,755
No way!

1667
01:39:48,129 --> 01:39:50,081
We should do something

1668
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:52,148
more romantic.

1669
01:39:52,173 --> 01:39:54,880
A couple routine,
you know what I mean.

1670
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:59,013
With touching, lifting, dancing.

1671
01:39:59,216 --> 01:40:01,299
You know, like
Dancing with the Stars!

1672
01:40:01,324 --> 01:40:04,091
That! With sexual tension!
Like that!

1673
01:40:06,778 --> 01:40:07,904
Sexual tension?

1674
01:40:08,426 --> 01:40:09,489
Come here, come here.

1675
01:40:09,514 --> 01:40:11,025
Come on. Hurry.

1676
01:40:11,888 --> 01:40:13,637
Like this, let me show you.

1677
01:40:14,407 --> 01:40:17,779
You'll put it here, here.
Oh and here.

1678
01:40:17,907 --> 01:40:20,719
Then you do this, and this.

1679
01:40:20,744 --> 01:40:22,005
Then you lower me.

1680
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:23,115
One, two, three.

1681
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,124
Like this, gets?

1682
01:41:09,174 --> 01:41:10,509
What are you doing?

1683
01:41:12,495 --> 01:41:13,599
I love you.

1684
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,719
Hug me back.

1685
01:41:26,535 --> 01:41:28,933
Is there a problem?

1686
01:41:32,729 --> 01:41:35,815
There's no problem as
long as we love each other.

1687
01:41:46,031 --> 01:41:47,073
Come on.

1688
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:48,289
Let's practice.

1689
01:41:49,941 --> 01:41:51,423
Araw, what's wrong?

1690
01:41:53,839 --> 01:41:54,937
What is it?

1691
01:41:56,308 --> 01:41:57,878
Tell me, what's the problem?

1692
01:41:58,815 --> 01:41:59,894
Nothing!

1693
01:42:00,658 --> 01:42:02,620
Your sweetness is over the top.

1694
01:42:02,645 --> 01:42:04,456
It's obvious your love is fake.

1695
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:07,386
We won't win Ship Show
with just love alone!

1696
01:42:07,639 --> 01:42:10,971
In fact, because of our relationship,
we're becoming complacent!

1697
01:42:11,507 --> 01:42:13,964
Well, what do you think
will make us win, huh?

1698
01:42:14,018 --> 01:42:15,133
Ambition!

1699
01:42:15,666 --> 01:42:20,612
See, you can't even focus because
you're distracted by your feelings.

1700
01:42:20,637 --> 01:42:23,675
I can't concentrate because
every time you look at me,

1701
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:26,270
I don't see any sincerity
in your eyes.

1702
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:30,339
- Unless—
- Let's break up.

1703
01:42:31,235 --> 01:42:34,201
You're getting too caught up
in all this.

1704
01:42:37,292 --> 01:42:39,883
You'll making it even harder
to pretend I love you

1705
01:42:39,908 --> 01:42:41,214
if you're going to break up with me.

1706
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:44,263
I'm not as good as you with acting.

1707
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:47,420
Then just go with the flow.

1708
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,743
Chia.

1709
01:43:15,307 --> 01:43:16,340
Yes?

1710
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:20,855
Mom!

1711
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:22,759
Why are you here?

1712
01:43:22,784 --> 01:43:24,011
Are you allowed here?

1713
01:43:24,108 --> 01:43:25,166
Why not?

1714
01:43:25,423 --> 01:43:28,040
Your Dad and I are
secret sponsors of the show.

1715
01:43:28,341 --> 01:43:29,426
Sponsor?

1716
01:43:30,721 --> 01:43:34,815
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Araw,
your daughter's love team.

1717
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:40,011
Are the mics and cameras here rolling?

1718
01:43:40,909 --> 01:43:42,056
No, ma'am.

1719
01:43:46,967 --> 01:43:49,784
Ma'am, we'll leave you
alone for now.

1720
01:43:55,867 --> 01:43:59,378
Making out?
Lying on top of a guy?

1721
01:44:00,099 --> 01:44:03,143
Your pictures and videos
are all over the internet, Chia!

1722
01:44:03,168 --> 01:44:04,868
Are you that desperate to win?

1723
01:44:05,087 --> 01:44:09,144
Because if I don't win, you and Dad
will destroy my dream!

1724
01:44:09,169 --> 01:44:10,753
Since you were a child,

1725
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:14,419
your father and I did nothing
but support your acting.

1726
01:44:14,561 --> 01:44:16,313
But you never got anywhere.

1727
01:44:16,425 --> 01:44:18,623
We even had to donate
a huge sum of money

1728
01:44:18,648 --> 01:44:19,958
to BenDo Productions

1729
01:44:19,983 --> 01:44:21,943
so you wouldn't be eliminated here.

1730
01:44:21,968 --> 01:44:23,403
Did you really think that

1731
01:44:23,428 --> 01:44:27,223
you got to the final showdown
because people liked you?

1732
01:44:27,302 --> 01:44:29,480
It was mostly your dad and me.

1733
01:44:29,505 --> 01:44:32,592
Despite of that,
you're still struggling to win.

1734
01:44:32,617 --> 01:44:34,792
The other team is still ahead in votes.

1735
01:44:34,817 --> 01:44:36,901
And do you know
what that means, Chia?

1736
01:44:36,926 --> 01:44:39,528
You're not meant
to be an actress.

1737
01:44:42,893 --> 01:44:44,303
We will win.

1738
01:44:44,784 --> 01:44:46,089
I will make sure of it.

1739
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:48,722
You, will you make sure of it?

1740
01:44:49,272 --> 01:44:50,982
Your reputation with the viewers,

1741
01:44:51,007 --> 01:44:53,933
spineless, just going with the flow.

1742
01:44:53,958 --> 01:44:55,919
You're not fighting for anything!

1743
01:45:00,947 --> 01:45:02,070
Dear.

1744
01:45:02,368 --> 01:45:03,927
Has she answered yet, dear?

1745
01:45:04,207 --> 01:45:05,207
Not yet, Mom.

1746
01:45:05,486 --> 01:45:06,884
- You!
- Hon!

1747
01:45:06,909 --> 01:45:10,558
Your talent agent
is a scammer, idiot!

1748
01:45:12,034 --> 01:45:14,659
He took all our savings!

1749
01:45:14,737 --> 01:45:16,105
What now?

1750
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:17,649
Hon, stop!

1751
01:45:18,853 --> 01:45:22,284
I thought he was really going
to get me into showbiz.

1752
01:45:22,309 --> 01:45:24,558
Where are we going to get
a hundred thousand now?

1753
01:45:24,583 --> 01:45:26,433
What about your siblings' tuition?

1754
01:45:27,483 --> 01:45:28,484
I said stop!

1755
01:45:28,509 --> 01:45:29,510
Stop!

1756
01:45:29,948 --> 01:45:31,009
Stop babying him!

1757
01:45:40,078 --> 01:45:41,190
Dear.

1758
01:45:41,628 --> 01:45:44,011
I already told you, didn't I?

1759
01:45:44,932 --> 01:45:47,855
You shouldn't have trusted
that person.

1760
01:45:48,002 --> 01:45:50,880
Why are you only
listening to yourself?

1761
01:45:54,986 --> 01:45:56,022
Mom.

1762
01:45:57,096 --> 01:45:58,280
I'm sorry.

1763
01:46:03,596 --> 01:46:05,362
I won't do it again.

1764
01:46:06,003 --> 01:46:07,003
Araw.

1765
01:46:07,202 --> 01:46:08,370
I'm sorry.

1766
01:46:08,395 --> 01:46:09,395
Araw?

1767
01:46:13,025 --> 01:46:14,085
Araw.

1768
01:46:16,745 --> 01:46:17,787
Araw!

1769
01:46:22,385 --> 01:46:23,455
Anyway,

1770
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:25,274
break a leg!

1771
01:46:25,699 --> 01:46:27,816
Your dad and I will see you at home.

1772
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:33,495
Are you okay?

1773
01:46:34,463 --> 01:46:36,055
Araw, are you okay?

1774
01:46:39,777 --> 01:46:41,446
What if we really lose?

1775
01:46:43,221 --> 01:46:44,864
Araw, are you okay?

1776
01:46:46,307 --> 01:46:47,361
Araw!

1777
01:46:50,268 --> 01:46:51,349
Araw!

1778
01:46:52,088 --> 01:46:53,220
Chia.

1779
01:46:58,011 --> 01:46:59,647
You're gonna do great.

1780
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:01,182
Okay?

1781
01:47:05,534 --> 01:47:07,152
You're gonna do great.

1782
01:47:12,139 --> 01:47:14,394
We're gonna do great. Okay?

1783
01:47:31,213 --> 01:47:34,636
Ladies and Gentlemen,
let's all welcome...

1784
01:47:34,871 --> 01:47:36,799
Araw and Chia!

1785
01:47:42,394 --> 01:47:44,550
Before your final presentation...

1786
01:47:44,575 --> 01:47:46,715
Do you have a message
for your Shippers?

1787
01:47:49,867 --> 01:47:51,970
Thank you so much, Shippers.

1788
01:47:52,359 --> 01:47:54,472
Because if it weren't for you,

1789
01:47:54,975 --> 01:47:59,060
we wouldn't have made it to the finals.
We'll do our best.

1790
01:48:00,184 --> 01:48:01,313
Araw?

1791
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:17,454
Everyone, please listen to me.

1792
01:48:20,084 --> 01:48:22,847
This includes the producers
and staff of the Ship Show.

1793
01:48:22,872 --> 01:48:24,419
Please make some drama.

1794
01:48:24,742 --> 01:48:26,566
Please! Please!

1795
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:27,964
Fade out, music.

1796
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:30,050
I want a close up on Araw's face.

1797
01:48:30,526 --> 01:48:32,594
Chia isn't just a wonderful person.

1798
01:48:33,003 --> 01:48:35,221
She's also a wonderful actress.

1799
01:48:35,995 --> 01:48:37,249
Honestly...

1800
01:48:39,343 --> 01:48:41,645
She doesn't need a love team to shine.

1801
01:48:43,573 --> 01:48:46,268
She doesn't need me
to get to the top.

1802
01:48:56,496 --> 01:48:58,078
Chia is already a complete individual,

1803
01:48:58,923 --> 01:49:00,538
who unfortunately...

1804
01:49:00,781 --> 01:49:03,120
is being forced to be a broken piece

1805
01:49:03,175 --> 01:49:04,615
just for the Ship Show.

1806
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:07,879
Philippines?

1807
01:49:09,066 --> 01:49:11,174
I am begging each and every one
of you viewers at home,

1808
01:49:12,602 --> 01:49:15,112
that hopefully, after this contest,

1809
01:49:16,679 --> 01:49:17,787
hopefully...

1810
01:49:19,346 --> 01:49:22,435
you give her a chance to shine

1811
01:49:22,592 --> 01:49:24,187
as an actress.

1812
01:49:31,327 --> 01:49:33,029
Even if it's not with me.

1813
01:49:59,774 --> 01:50:02,878
Ladies and Gentlemen,
one more time,

1814
01:50:02,903 --> 01:50:04,780
Araw and Chia!

1815
01:51:25,549 --> 01:51:26,550
Hey!

1816
01:51:26,575 --> 01:51:29,178
Why aren't you voting?
Hurry up and vote!

1817
01:51:36,889 --> 01:51:41,045
Make sure you get your troll farm
to vote for these two, okay?

1818
01:51:41,288 --> 01:51:42,335
Yes, Ma'am.

1819
01:51:43,428 --> 01:51:45,302
Do you really want
these two to win?

1820
01:51:45,327 --> 01:51:46,365
No.

1821
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:49,057
I just really want
that Nestor to lose.

1822
01:51:49,292 --> 01:51:51,469
He's the reason I got kicked out!

1823
01:52:16,417 --> 01:52:20,858
And the couple that majority
of our dear Shippers,

1824
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:26,349
Voted to be the country's
next big love team is...

1825
01:52:36,744 --> 01:52:38,545
Are you still mad at me?

1826
01:52:46,673 --> 01:52:48,944
Was my acting effective, huh?

1827
01:52:49,109 --> 01:52:50,170
Huh?

1828
01:52:50,219 --> 01:52:54,460
I just exaggerated my reaction
so that, you know...

1829
01:52:54,485 --> 01:52:57,428
We can bounce back
in the final showdown.

1830
01:52:57,764 --> 01:52:59,853
I don't understand.

1831
01:53:01,569 --> 01:53:05,383
Nestor, to make our
love appear strong,

1832
01:53:05,408 --> 01:53:08,014
we have to show people
that it's...

1833
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,054
hopeless.

1834
01:53:10,546 --> 01:53:13,365
And then at the end, surprise!

1835
01:53:14,076 --> 01:53:15,519
Redemption.

1836
01:53:17,764 --> 01:53:20,413
So, you're not offended
about me having a child?

1837
01:53:21,154 --> 01:53:23,913
Ah, that was just for show.

1838
01:53:23,938 --> 01:53:27,275
That's what the Shippers expected,
so that's what I showed them.

1839
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,389
If I acted like I didn't care,

1840
01:53:29,414 --> 01:53:32,694
then they wouldn't have felt
that I really loved you, right?

1841
01:53:35,695 --> 01:53:39,537
So, you really don't feel
anything for me?

1842
01:53:44,822 --> 01:53:46,999
Well, I have a fiancé in real life.

1843
01:53:47,024 --> 01:53:49,702
He's 20 years older than me,

1844
01:53:49,727 --> 01:53:51,264
He's on dialysis.

1845
01:53:51,501 --> 01:53:53,874
That's why I joined this show, for him.

1846
01:53:54,819 --> 01:53:56,397
You're the same, right?

1847
01:53:56,834 --> 01:53:59,145
You joined this for
your child's future, right?

1848
01:54:01,576 --> 01:54:02,671
Yes.

1849
01:54:03,842 --> 01:54:05,447
So...

1850
01:54:07,737 --> 01:54:10,444
let's do this right
so we can win.

1851
01:54:11,445 --> 01:54:13,585
For the ones we love.

1852
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:18,498
I only did that for my child.

1853
01:54:20,474 --> 01:54:22,772
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1854
01:54:23,499 --> 01:54:25,663
But even though I hid it from you,

1855
01:54:26,514 --> 01:54:28,299
my love for you is real.

1856
01:54:28,701 --> 01:54:30,524
I hope you can forgive me.

1857
01:54:31,098 --> 01:54:34,257
Whatever your situation in life is...

1858
01:54:34,492 --> 01:54:38,036
that's the reason why
you became who you are.

1859
01:54:38,061 --> 01:54:42,639
So, I'll accept you wholly,
including your child.

1860
01:54:44,272 --> 01:54:47,468
I love you so much,
if only you knew.

1861
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:55,420
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Nestor and Tintin!

1862
01:55:40,344 --> 01:55:43,906
And the couple that the
majority of our beloved Shippers

1863
01:55:43,931 --> 01:55:49,561
voted to be the country's
next big love team is...

1864
01:55:54,569 --> 01:55:58,280
Nestor and Tintin!

1865
01:55:58,305 --> 01:56:01,522
Congratulations!

1866
01:56:13,312 --> 01:56:15,171
Thank you, Araw.

1867
01:56:15,867 --> 01:56:17,335
Thanks for everything.

1868
01:56:17,717 --> 01:56:20,781
I hope all your dreams
come true, Chia.

1869
01:56:21,148 --> 01:56:23,952
I'll always be here to support you.

1870
01:56:44,408 --> 01:56:45,545
Araw!

1871
01:56:47,278 --> 01:56:48,427
Araw!

1872
01:56:49,999 --> 01:56:51,483
Why are you still swimming?

1873
01:56:51,636 --> 01:56:53,099
Your guest is already here.

1874
01:56:54,721 --> 01:56:58,092
Araw, don't tell me you
didn't read the text message?

1875
01:56:58,218 --> 01:57:00,811
- Which one?
- The meeting was moved to today!

1876
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:02,632
Shit!

1877
01:57:14,569 --> 01:57:16,049
Lucky, aren't they?

1878
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:20,585
I hope you've read the
management contract I emailed.

1879
01:57:20,610 --> 01:57:21,972
Hi, Miss Tata!

1880
01:57:21,997 --> 01:57:23,436
Yes, I've read it.

1881
01:57:23,461 --> 01:57:27,132
My Mom and Dad
have read it too, it's all good.

1882
01:57:27,861 --> 01:57:31,694
I didn't read it, I wouldn't
understand it anyway.

1883
01:57:31,771 --> 01:57:34,796
But I'm fine with anything.

1884
01:57:35,186 --> 01:57:37,087
You're one of the most trustw—

1885
01:57:37,112 --> 01:57:39,490
I wanted you to read it
so you would know

1886
01:57:39,515 --> 01:57:42,311
your obligations as my talents.

1887
01:57:42,336 --> 01:57:45,663
I don't want my talents to be lax.

1888
01:57:46,264 --> 01:57:47,623
I'm sorry.

1889
01:57:48,404 --> 01:57:49,512
Anyway,

1890
01:57:49,537 --> 01:57:51,061
I have an inquiry for you.

1891
01:57:51,694 --> 01:57:55,314
One is a supporting role
in an Indie RomCom,

1892
01:57:55,339 --> 01:57:56,772
you'll be a love team there.

1893
01:57:56,797 --> 01:57:58,284
The other one

1894
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:00,703
Is only for Chia.

1895
01:58:01,009 --> 01:58:04,208
One of five leads in a TV series.

1896
01:58:04,442 --> 01:58:05,875
Heavy drama.

1897
01:58:06,256 --> 01:58:08,878
Which one will we take, Chia?

1898
01:58:20,259 --> 01:58:22,642
Come on now, both of you,
of course it's the TV series.

1899
01:58:23,128 --> 01:58:24,513
You're playing a lead role!

1900
01:58:25,449 --> 01:58:26,771
But what about you?

1901
01:58:27,724 --> 01:58:29,067
Don't worry about me.

1902
01:58:29,356 --> 01:58:31,978
I'm sure I'll have a project soon enough.

1903
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:34,487
Right?

1904
01:58:35,136 --> 01:58:37,114
Miss Tata, isn't that right?

1905
01:58:37,221 --> 01:58:38,709
We don't know that.

1906
01:58:39,552 --> 01:58:41,587
Oh, come on.

1907
01:58:42,669 --> 01:58:47,382
But seriously, Chia, you should
choose what's best for you.

1908
01:58:47,773 --> 01:58:51,928
We don't always need
to be together on screen.

1909
01:58:53,014 --> 01:58:54,548
And you know,

1910
01:58:55,513 --> 01:58:58,636
it's enough for me
that in real life...

1911
01:59:00,712 --> 01:59:02,172
you're my girlfriend.

1912
01:59:02,849 --> 01:59:04,198
Oh, please.

1913
01:59:06,021 --> 01:59:08,967
Why don't you just make me
your personal assistant?

1914
01:59:09,834 --> 01:59:11,927
You'd be a very handsome
assistant, wouldn't you?

1915
01:59:11,966 --> 01:59:13,245
Of course!

1916
01:59:13,324 --> 01:59:16,325
It's just, you know,
I don't want to be idle,

1917
01:59:16,636 --> 01:59:18,091
waiting for a project.

1918
01:59:18,638 --> 01:59:20,241
I should be doing something too.

1919
01:59:20,591 --> 01:59:21,842
Like what?

1920
01:59:22,676 --> 01:59:23,966
I could go to an acting class.

1921
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:27,388
So when an opportunity comes along,

1922
01:59:28,015 --> 01:59:32,544
they'll have no choice but
to be amazed by my talent.

1923
01:59:33,011 --> 01:59:34,339
That's a good idea.

1924
01:59:37,059 --> 01:59:39,903
Or maybe some mature roles.

1925
01:59:41,169 --> 01:59:42,359
