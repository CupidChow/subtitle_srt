1
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,420
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,110
If you don't know where you are, tell me what you see.

3
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,570
 I can find where you are. 

4
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,650
 Just tell me what you see! 

5
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:14,490


6
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,570
Yes, Gong Chan?

7
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,010
 The professor. Where is Professor Oh? 

8
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,980
Where is Professor Oh right now?

9
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,090
What's up? Is something the matter?

10
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,630
I heard an explosion over the phone.

11
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,650
I have to rush to her.

12
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,480
Professor Oh is in danger right now.

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,300
Seokpo Fishing Ground. She went to Seokpo Fishing Ground to meet Hong Seok Pal.

14
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,490
This is Seokpo Fishing Ground.

15
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,980
There was an explosion from a vehicle fire.

16
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,280
A person is injured. Possibly dead.

17
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,470
 Episode 7 

18
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,380
 Hong Seok Pal's car exploded at Seokpo Fishing Ground. 

19
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,030
 He's likely dead. Look into it. 

20
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,760
What's this?

21
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,230
Let's go.

22
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,450
 Hong Seok Pal's car exploded at Seokpo Fishing Ground. He's likely dead. Look into it. 

23
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,580
I think there's a fire over there.

24
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,730
- Sir, make a U-turn. 
 - What?

25
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,700
We have to follow the car that just passed us.

26
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,520
Please hurry! Hurry up and make a U-turn.

27
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,620
Geez, what the heck...

28
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,700
 Seoul 

29
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,910
I'll drive. Get out of the car.

30
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,040
How did you...

31
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,400
You look like you're about to faint.

32
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,880
Hurry up and get out.

33
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,820
Move! Didn't you hear the horn?

34
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,640
Are you hurt? Are you all right?

35
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,370
Gosh, why didn't you answer, Attorney Oh?

36
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,210
I'm on my way to the fishing ground.

37
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,740
So, why did Hong Seok Pal's car explode?

38
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,760
More importantly, are you okay?

39
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,580
I'm okay.

40
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,080
No. I'm on my way home right now.

41
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,270
Yeah. He called me first and asked to meet.

42
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,780
So I went, and the car exploded.

43
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,480
 How do we come up with a suspect list? 

44
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,810
 Can you think of anyone? 

45
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,410
 Hong Seok Pal. 

46
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,510
 Who's Hong Seok Pal? 

47
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,700
 The hostess bar owner where the deceased Park So Yeong worked. 

48
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,870
 What? Really? 

49
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,010
 I looked up all the video clips that people had recorded that night. 

50
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,690
 Don't you remember seeing him somewhere? 

51
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,420
 Oh, it's him! 

52
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,480
 Amazing. 

53
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,680
 He broke into Professor Oh's building, 

54
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,520
 stole Park So Yeong's cell phone... 

55
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,090
 And he was the hostess bar owner where Park So Young worked. 

56
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,870
 He's somehow connected to Park So Yeong's death. 

57
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,270
 That's why he stole her cell phone. 

58
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,730
 Okay. The reason he stole Park So Yeong's cell phone 

59
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,260
 is because something detrimental to him is on it. 

60
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,660
 That Hong Seok Pal, why would he break into the professor's building? 

61
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,720
 He's got no connection with our professor. 

62
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
 It has to be because of that USB. 

63
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,710
 Since Hansu Group's top secret information is on it. 

64
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,750
 The rumor is that for a long time he's been doing 

65
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,440
 all the dirty work for Chairman Han Seong Beom. 

66
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,020
 I see. 

67
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,580
 So Hansu ordered him to get that. 

68
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,090
 That seems most logical, but he's not from Hansu. 

69
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,850
 He's from TK Law Firm. 

70
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,800
 What? 

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,070
 Choi Ju Wan, CEO of TK Law Firm. 

72
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,980
 What's going on? How could so many who don't make sense be tangled and connected? 

73
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,670
 Whoa, I can't believe someone like him is our CEO. 

74
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,540
 Geez, that crazy trash! 

75
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,330
 For now, let's hold off working on the professor's building break-in. 

76
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,280
 Let's look for Park So Yeong's murder suspect first. 

77
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,010
 That's more urgent. 

78
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:24,010
 If Hong Seok Pal did kill Park So Yeong, 

79
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,410
 that thing. The paternity test of the fetus. 

80
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,420
 That could be relevant here. 

81
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,350
 The fact that she ran a paternity test on the fetus means 

82
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,860
 that the man denied getting her pregnant. 

83
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,260
 Park So Yeong's pregnancy was extremely uncomfortable for that man. 

84
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,360
 Bingo. 

85
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,560
 In that regard, the likely possibility of someone who was a customer who frequented the hostess bar 

86
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,720
 or someone who could be her personal sponsor. 

87
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,060
 Someone who'd be in huge trouble if her pregnancy were revealed. 

88
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,820
 For instance, 

89
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,150
 the VVIPs for the hostess bar. 

90
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,180
 Seonbae-nim, how do you know everything. 

91
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,050
 So, who would that be? 

92
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,670
 Chairman Han Seong Beom of Hansu Group. 

93
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,570
 Assemblyman Lee In Su of Everyone for the Future Party. 

94
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,490
 And lastly... 

95
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,850
 Chairman Choi Tae Gook of TK Law Firm. 

96
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,200
 But isn't that going a little too far? 

97
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,360
 They're a group chairman, law firm chairman, and a presidential candidate. 

98
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,190
 Those people hired a hostess bar owner to kill a hostess bar girl? 

99
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,830
 Even if that's the case, 

100
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,100
 the location of the murder happened to be TK Law Firm's rooftop garden? 

101
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,960
 Don't you think it's too farfetched? 

102
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,560
 I know. 

103
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,370
 Of all places, why that location? 

104
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,020
 At such an inconvenient location? 

105
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,380
 Hong Seok Pal could've kept track of Park So Yeong's whereabouts every hour of the day. 

106
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,650
 So, he followed her, knowing that she went to TK Law Firm. 

107
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,540
 So, he followed her there 

108
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,220
 and for some reason. Aha! 

109
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,410
 He pushed her off the building? 

110
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,900
 Well, that could happen. 

111
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,000
 They could've had an argument where impulsive emotions got out of hand. 

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,500
 We should keep an open mind to various possibilities. 

113
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,460
 Hong Seok Pal and the hostess bar VVIPs. 

114
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,750
 If I were to give you a tip, 

115
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,580
 there's a rumor that Park So Yeong and Chairman Han Seong Beom were pretty close 

116
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,320
 in that line of work. 

117
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,740
 It's pretty sickening, but 

118
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,450
 I'll check out Park So Yeong's OB/GYN. 

119
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,400
 I'm sure she dropped a few hints about the man. 

120
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,220
Hey, Do Jin Myeong, you like iced vanilla latte, right?

121
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,250
 I'll look into Chairman Han's whereabouts on the night Park So Yeong died. 

122
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,710
 I still have that much intel capability. 

123
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,980
Who ordered fried chicken?

124
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,680
No one ordered chicken.

125
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,360
 Choon Poong and I will look into Hong Seok Pal. 

126
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,070
 I'm a pretty good actor, you know. 

127
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,310
 Chan, just trust me. 

128
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,320
 Seokpo Fishing Ground 

129
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,370
 I heard from Park So Yeong's OB/GYN receptionist. 

130
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,430
 She said that the baby's father is a very wealthy man. 

131
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,000
 Park So Yeong took a taxi in front of the hostess bar 

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,330
 and Hong Seok Pal followed her in his car. That much has been confirmed. 

133
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,990
 As of now, Hong Seok Pal is very likely the culprit. 

134
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,470
It was Hong Seok Pal.

135
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,100
The one who broke into your building and hurt you, Professor,

136
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,850
and the one who stole Park So Yeong's cell phone from her house.

137
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,760
It was all Hong Seok Pal.

138
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,840
I know.

139
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,720
He came to the company a few days ago.

140
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,250
He said he had something to say about Park So Yeong.

141
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,930
He threw a ruckus, saying he wanted to meet the chairman but left without meeting him.

142
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,430
And regarding Park So Yeong?

143
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,160
I gave him my business card when I bumped into him for a second.

144
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,500
 I signaled to him that he could contact me 

145
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,790
if he's got something to say about Park So Yeong.

146
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
And then he called me.

147
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,900
Park So Yeong. What if I said I killed Park So Yeong?

148
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,260
What?

149
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,560
When I arrived, Hong Seok Pal was inside his car.

150
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,840
He was sitting in the driver's seat.

151
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,080
 It looked like he fell to the side as I approached the car. 

152
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,770
I didn't have time to do anything.

153
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,350
Then could Hong Seok Pal have committed suicide?

154
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,770
For feeling guilty about killing Park So Yeong?

155
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,270
I'm not sure.

156
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,510
 Are you interested now that I tell you I killed Park So Yeong? 

157
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,130
 Of course, you have some responsibility for So Yeong getting killed like a dog. 

158
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,680
 - What the hell are you talking— 
 - Right this minute, 

159
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,160
 come look for me at Seokpo Fishing Ground. 

160
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,720
Would a person trying to kill himself say something like this?

161
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,190
He said you have some responsibility.

162
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,330
So he wanted to put you in danger also.

163
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,590
I'm talking about the car explosion.

164
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,060
You were in danger, too.

165
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,010
If it wasn't a suicide?

166
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,740
What if it was a murder disguised as suicide, just like Park So Yeong?

167
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,180
Go home. It's getting late.

168
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,140
Auntie (her housekeeper) brought it over, but I'm not good at keeping it alive.

169
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,160
Go home for real now. I'm fine.

170
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,130
Your living room sofa looks pretty big.

171
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,640
What?

172
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,770
What about it?

173
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,450
I'll get some sleep.

174
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,710
What?

175
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,370
I'm sleepy

176
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,150
so I'm going to sleep.

177
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,620
If you're doing this because you're worried about me, you can go.

178
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,580
I'm fine.

179
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,450
Excuse me for a moment.

180
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,130
What's he doing?

181
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,950
There's such a nice bed like this. Why is she cold here?

182
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,590
I'll borrow your comforter.

183
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,760
I'm so very cold.

184
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,060
Hey, I'm really fine. You can go.

185
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,720
 If it was suicide, did he try to hurt Professor the moment it exploded? 

186
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,710
 If it was homicide disguised as suicide, then who was it? 

187
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,640
 Why? 

188
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,450
 Why would they want to endanger Professor Oh? 

189
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,170
 No! 

190
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,280
 Why it doesn't open! Open! 

191
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,260
 Who are you? 

192
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,900
Professor. Professor.

193
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,700
Are you okay?

194
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,310
Professor.

195
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,890
It was a dream.

196
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,830
 Who... 

197
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,820
 Who and why... 

198
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,310
 did they do this to me? 

199
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,980
 Why? 

200
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,940
 Why? Why?! 

201
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,780
Why are you hiding and crying?

202
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,620
So lousy.

203
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,420
Why are you sitting next to a lousy person?

204
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,900
Because I know how cool you are.

205
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,730
You just said I'm lousy.

206
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,710
People don't have just one side.

207
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,870
They have tens more... It could be hundreds more sides.

208
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,060
If you're lousy in a couple of those aspects, that's not being lousy at all.

209
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,160
It just makes you a cool person.

210
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,990
Cool, my foot.

211
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,920
So...

212
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,070
just cry when you want to

213
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,770
and say it's tough when you struggle.

214
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,540
The fact that you're cool won't change even if you do.

215
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,490
If I barely overcome one thing, another thing happens.

216
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,460
Then another.

217
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,000
I get angry.

218
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,060
I am so angry about my life.

219
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,040
How could it be like this?

220
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,230
How could this be?

221
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,230
I'm scared too!

222
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm also scared, and it's so hard.

223
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,370
 Police 

224
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,790
 Police 

225
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,880
- Noona, Noona! 
 - Hey, Detective Do.

226
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,110
Did you find anything?

227
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,500
Everything's burned. We'll have to investigate further.

228
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,520
 Stay out of this case. 

229
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,790
 Why? I guess you're thinking one of the suspects is someone I know. 

230
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:17,000
 He's not from Hansu. He's from TK Law Firm. 

231
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,270
 CEO Choi Ju Wan. 

232
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,300
 For instance, the VVIPs for the hostess bar. 

233
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,960
 TK Law Firm's... 

234
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,270
 Chairman Choi Tae Gook. 

235
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,430
 Eat well. Sleep well. 

236
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,620
 Don't get hurt no matter what happens. 

237
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,620
 Both physically and emotionally. 

238
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,400
 Don't get hurt. 

239
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,590
 No matter what happens, I'm here for you. 

240
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,400
 Next news. 

241
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,270
 Hong, who used to be called the emperor of Gangnam hostess bars, 

242
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,100
 died from a car explosion at an abandoned fishing ground. 

243
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,380
 Mr. Hong was known to run several hostess bars in the Gangnam area... 

244
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,830
Why did Su Jae show up there?

245
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,550
The CCTVs in the area captured Attorney Oh's car heading for the fishing ground.

246
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,720
It even captured her leaving that location after the car explosion.

247
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,470
They could've been on the same road coincidentally, no?

248
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,980
Yes, well...

249
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,190
I looked into it since I found it strange that Attorney Oh went to where he killed himself.

250
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,300
Attorney Oh was the last person Hong Seok Pal spoke to on the phone.

251
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,130
Who initiated the call?

252
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,060
Has that been confirmed?

253
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,170
It was Hong Seok Pal.

254
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,580
They could've made an arrangement to meet at the fishing ground.

255
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,270
I think Attorney Oh went there with some type of knowledge.

256
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,360
In any case, Hong Seok Pal is dead

257
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,220
and we'll have to get a statement from Attorney Oh.

258
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,840
Well, you should if you need to.

259
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,270
- But you know, Police Chief Kang. 
 - Yes?

260
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,180
- But you know, Police Chief Kang. 
 - Yes?

261
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,090
Don't let it be known how glad you are.

262
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,130
The fact that Hong Seok Pal took special care of you,

263
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,620
I'm sure everyone in this line of work is aware of it.

264
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,440
It shows how glad you are about that being buried.

265
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,140
Gosh, no, Chairman.

266
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,650
What do you mean, special care?

267
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,520
There's no such a thing.

268
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,800
It's just that I think Attorney Oh could be questioned.

269
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,370
I just wanted to report it to you in advance.

270
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,810
All right. Let's end it here.

271
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,370
I have a meeting to attend.

272
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,430
Yes, Sir. I understand, Chairman.

273
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,690
Why don't you pick up your phone?

274
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,480
Were you with Noona through the entire night?

275
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,770
According to the group chat, it looked like everyone went to the fishing ground.

276
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,120
But you were quiet, and I couldn't reach Noona.

277
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,710
Were you with Noona?

278
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,270
Yes.

279
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,890
How is Noona doing?

280
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,330
She's not okay.

281
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,570
There's no way she could be okay.

282
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,200
Hey, I'm the angry one. Why does it seem like you're getting upset?

283
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,000
- Why are you angry? 
 - You don't know?

284
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,890
Do you think you're the only one worrying about Noona?

285
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:32,120
I'm... so angry that the Professor was alone in that situation last night.

286
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,790
You must know since you heard the recording.

287
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm so angry that the Professor was alone in that situation.

288
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,330
Why are you so angry, Hyeong?

289
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:45,280
By chance, is it because Professor was with me all night?

290
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,490
- Is that what angers you so much? 
 - Yeah.

291
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,230
I'm angry that Noona didn't call for me, but another guy in that dangerous situation.

292
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,770
Despite the fact that I told her not to, yet again,

293
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,010
she called for that punk! That angers me.

294
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,600
I'm about to lose it because I'm so angry.

295
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,540
And I'll make this clear to you.

296
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,470
Don't you dare be suspicious of my father and my hyeong

297
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,720
recklessly and pull them into it.

298
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,500
There's a difference between me disliking them and someone else jabbering on about them.

299
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,840
You're suspicious of them, too Hyeong.

300
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,630
Aren't you?

301
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,220
You're trying to prove that they're irrelevant.

302
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,280
Isn't that right?

303
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,220
I was never suspicious of them

304
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,500
and I never tried to prove them irrelevant.

305
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,820
That sloppy list of suspects...

306
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,820
Just forget about it before you embarrass yourself.

307
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,160
There's nothing more you can do anyway.

308
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,430
Hong Seok Pal already said he killed Park So Yeong.

309
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,650
I'll have to look into it.

310
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,880
Hong Seok Pal did say he pushed off Park So Yeong.

311
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,900
But is that true?

312
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,710
If it's true, did he do it on his own, or did someone order him?

313
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,870
Did Hong Seok Pal really commit suicide?

314
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,730
Did the person who killed Park So Yeong also kill Hong Seok Pal?

315
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,980
Are those people on that sloppy list of suspects connected to this?

316
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,530
I said forget about it!

317
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,050
Fine.

318
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,880
Do whatever you want.

319
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,130
My father, my hyeong.

320
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,520
Pulling them into this however you want and being suspicious of them...

321
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,490
take it all the way, then.

322
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,570
I plan to.

323
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,260
If I take it all the way,

324
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,090
I'm sure I'll run into you at some point, Hyeong.

325
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,490
I'm sure you're very concerned about this.

326
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,540
"My father, my hyeong. Pulling them into this however you want?"

327
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,030
Who are Yoon Sang's father and hyeong?

328
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,370
Do we know them?

329
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,830
Who are they? Huh?

330
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,400
Oh, my God!

331
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,080
Choi Yoon Sang.

332
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,580
Choi Ju Wan.

333
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,760
Choi Tae Gook.

334
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,080
Is he the son of the TK Law Firm owner?

335
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,550
- Amazing. 
 - No wonder!

336
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,860
The last time we discussed it together, I thought he seemed off.

337
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,700
I guess that makes sense.

338
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,500
How do we face Hyeong Yoon Sang now?

339
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,160
What do you mean? We just face him as usual.

340
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,120
So, where did you go last night?

341
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,410
You wouldn't pick up the phone.

342
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,760
I got in touch with the Professor right after the incident.

343
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,520
So I went to the fishing ground area.

344
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,560
I ran into her nearby, so I drove her home.

345
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,930
What did she say?

346
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,150
Why did Hong Seok Pal ask her to meet him?

347
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,020
Professor doesn't know why, either.

348
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,690
He called up Professor out of nowhere and confessed to killing Park So Yeong.

349
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,980
After telling Professor to come, he dies in a car explosion.

350
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,120
It kind of falls apart.

351
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,570
The beginning, and end, and all of it doesn't quite fit.

352
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,670
It might not be suicide.

353
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,800
 Mirae Contractors 

354
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,560
 Mr. Go, the attorney you mentioned is here. 

355
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,890
She looks intimidating.

356
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,890
Let's grab some tea.

357
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,170
So, according to you, Chan,

358
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:26,080
Hong Seok Pal's phone recording is a lie.

359
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,730
But why? What for?

360
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,890
We have to find out.

361
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,370
To see if that's real or not.

362
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,970
Whether Hong Seok Pal is Park So Yeong's killer or not.

363
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,340
Whether Professor is responsible for her death or not.

364
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,690
There must be a black box inside the Professor's car, right?

365
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,690
Here's the black box card from my car.

366
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,590
Everything from the moment I got there, the sudden explosion, and the fire.

367
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,790
It's all recorded there. They could've placed explosives there.

368
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,140
Explosives?

369
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,230
You could find out through your network, Mr. Go,

370
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,860
if someone installed it to kill Hong Seok Pal

371
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,660
or if Hong Seok Pal installed it to kill himself.

372
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,110
Geez. So, how did you find out I was here?

373
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,620
I was all cooped up, thinking I'd go into hiding for good.

374
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,920
You talked about this place before.

375
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,310
That this place is where your heart is.

376
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,860
Gosh... My mouth. I guess I was loose-lipped.

377
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,600
I should've called you.

378
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,440
Ever since that Chief Ha stopped by,

379
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,810
all kinds of thoughts have gone through my head.

380
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,210
Attorney, now that I'm older,

381
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,680
I get scared easily and become cowardly.

382
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,590
I'm sorry.

383
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,650
Are you very sorry?

384
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,830
Excuse me?

385
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,620
Gosh, of course. Very much so.

386
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,300
I'm very, very sorry.

387
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,580
Then look into this thoroughly with that mindset.

388
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,340
Yes.

389
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,470
I understand.

390
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,950
I think I'll encounter a fatal experience soon.

391
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,850
How far did the police get?

392
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,150
They searched and seized Hong Seok Pal's bars and home.

393
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,180
I think they're thinking it was suicide.

394
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,760
Did they say they found anything in their search and seizure?

395
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,720
I asked a reporter, and they placed an embargo on the case.

396
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,240
I think something will come out of it soon.

397
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,060
All right.

398
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,770
I don't think there's anything to come out of it.

399
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,930
Please prepare it.

400
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,950
Please give me two minutes of your time.

401
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,400
My apologies, CEO.

402
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,680
- No, it's okay. See you guys later. 
 - Yes.

403
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,490
What's going on?

404
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,390
 Attorney Oh Su Jae was at the scene where Hong Seok Pal died last night 

405
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,360
 Attorney Oh Su Jae was at the scene where Hong Seok Pal died last night 

406
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,730
That's why I'm here.

407
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,900
I think I'll have a fatal experience soon.

408
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:06,890
 Smile Art Supply Store 

409
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,540
Eun Seo.

410
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm here.

411
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,720
Yoon Se Pil.

412
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,620
Aren't you cold?

413
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,810
Let's put this on you.

414
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,210
What's wrong?

415
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,280
No, no, Eun Seo. No...

416
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,710
Over here! Please help me! Help!

417
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,600
Please help!

418
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,920
Eun Seo.

419
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,310
Eun Seo, are you okay?

420
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,470
Let's go inside.

421
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,430
It'll be okay.

422
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,330
Breathe deeply.

423
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,470
I forgot.

424
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,860
I guess Eun Seo is still suffering.

425
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,540
But thank goodness she's alive.

426
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,820
She started painting again.

427
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,790
The trauma from the car accident is too great.

428
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,390
The cerebral hemorrhage was too severe.

429
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,190
I stopped the bleeding in surgery,

430
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,990
but she could have a neurological disorder.

431
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:37,080
And there are traces of suspected rape.

432
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,730
We should give it back to them.

433
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,690
Little by little.

434
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,710
Without leaving anything out.

435
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,200
I'll make sure.

436
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,580
 Barber Shop 

437
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,870
I have an important meeting today.

438
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,000
I'll pay special attention.

439
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,980
There are humans who are mistaken and think they own what I gave them.

440
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,220
They don't realize all of that will disappear without me.

441
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,440
Those dogs.

442
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,200
They think they're all that.

443
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,320
Yes. There are so many punks like that.

444
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,840
 Oh Su Jae 

445
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,290
Hey, join me.

446
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,980
It's very good today. Try it.

447
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,960
It's much better than last time.

448
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,400
Thank you.

449
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,070
Should I turn on the music, Chairman?

450
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,740
No, today is a very happy and good day even without any music.

451
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,210
I guess you're having a good day.

452
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,730
Especially happy that Hong Seok Pal, who used to get in the way, died.

453
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,010
What was it last time?

454
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,880
Grilled sea bream head.

455
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,240
That was really nice.

456
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,320
I'll prepare it.

457
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,760
That guy died because of you.

458
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,290
It was the result of your hard work with the dishes, Su Jae.

459
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,230
That guy died because of you.

460
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,430
Su Jae,

461
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:42,640
how well do you think you can protect yourself?

462
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,970
 By throwing out bait called Hong Seok Pal... 

463
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,570
I'm the one protecting you.

464
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,720
I saved you.

465
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,500
 Someone who wants to hurt me. 

466
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,040
Hong Seok Pal died because of you.

467
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,240
You ordered Hong Seok Pal to kill Park So Yeong.

468
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,430
Chief Kang says an investigation on you is inevitable.

469
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,670
There is an anniversary event for Mirae Law Forum tomorrow.

470
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,670
I'll save a seat for you. Be sure to attend.

471
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,980
It's a gathering for the purpose of getting Assemblyman Lee to the presidency.

472
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,020
But I basically initiated the gathering.

473
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,410
You'll suddenly save me a seat for a gathering that started two years ago? The reason

474
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,880
is it to show in return for when I asked for 70 billion?

475
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,110
Don't you know who the attendees of the Mirae Law Forum are?

476
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,930
I'm telling you to join the most powerful inside my circle.

477
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:41,380
If you join the circle, never mind Chief Kang. No one can ever mess with you.

478
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm saying this for you!

479
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,090
Do you know the best sensation in your hands when you're deep-sea fishing?

480
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:00,440
When I was little, I used to go fishing with my dad.

481
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,480
The best experience I had was catching black sea bream.

482
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,810
The pulling strength is amazing the moment you feel it bite.

483
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:11,410
It's so strong that it pulls away your fishing rod.

484
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,480
The fish took my fishing rod as I stood there upset.

485
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,390
This is what the boat captain said.

486
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:23,880
"You're not the only one throwing out the bait.

487
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,860
Now that he took your fishing rod,

488
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,750
that fish is a notch above you."

489
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,180
It took the bait and took the fishing rod. So it's a notch above you?

490
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,300
No, Su Jae.

491
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,040
How long do you think it lasted?

492
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,860
Would it have lasted a day?

493
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,860
If you think you took the bait, you'll get hurt less if you just go along with it.

494
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,800
If you struggle and strain, it will rip your oral orifice

495
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,640
and your body could get hurt as well.

496
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,060
Attend the event.

497
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,860
A great path will open up ahead of you.

498
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,150
I will reject your offer.

499
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:17,480
I will not take that bait, Chairman.

500
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,420
 Gong Chan 

501
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,680
Hey.

502
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,980
 The first quarter moon is up. 

503
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,500
What?

504
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,810
I can see Jupiter right next to the quarter moon.

505
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,840
Jupiter?

506
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,930
Where in the world is Jupiter?

507
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,170
The one that sparkles a little bit right next to the moon.

508
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,340
That's Jupiter. Don't you know?

509
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,470
 So ignorant. 

510
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,770
It's my first time hearing that I'm ignorant.

511
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,840
♫  Like a dream, repeatedly  ♫

512
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,600
So, where are you right now?

513
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,480
Making a delivery while looking up at Jupiter.

514
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,650
 Delivery? 

515
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,140
Delivering a healthy dinner.

516
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,640
♫  Because it glimmers over and over  ♫

517
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,930
I left it in front of your door.

518
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,100
Did you just come by? Are you on the first floor?

519
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,010
I wanted to see your face as I made my delivery, but

520
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,300
I thought it might take away from your sleeping time.

521
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,340
I'll just leave.

522
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm hanging up.

523
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,060
♫  I promised myself since that day  ♫

524
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:22,390
♫  I like you so much that I'm overwhelmed  ♫

525
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:28,460
♫  Oh, beautiful you  ♫

526
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:35,630
♫  You blossom so passionately inside my peaceful heart  ♫

527
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:43,680
♫  You came to me in this world  ♫

528
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,570
 Eat everything without leaving a single thing out, before it gets cold. 

529
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,530
 Don't worry about anything and sleep tight. 

530
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,730
 See you at school with a smile. 

531
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,250
The cops are here.

532
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,680
They said they couldn't reach you, Attorney Oh. So they came in person.

533
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,540
Even if you couldn't reach her, you can't just come looking for her like this.

534
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,660
You realize this is a huge overreaction, right?

535
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,190
Gosh, come on. I didn't come because I wanted to, either.

536
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,940
You came looking for me?

537
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,710
I'm Detective Do Jin Myeong from Seoul Central Police Station.

538
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,880
Why don't you pick up our calls?

539
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,530
We came to personally get you because you wouldn't pick up our calls.

540
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,630
Come with us as a material witness, please.

541
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,630
You must've come because of Hong Seok Pal's death.

542
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,670
If it's about my presence at the scene, there isn't much to it.

543
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,130
Hong Seok Pal called me to meet him, so I went. Then his car exploded.

544
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:59,120
After I called 119, I left the scene.

545
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,990
I'm sure you checked Hong Seok Pal's call history and 119 center call history.

546
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,930
Do you conduct a material witness investigation in person so urgently?

547
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,590
Isn't this an overaction on a grand scale?

548
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,290
As you mentioned, you spoke to him during his last remaining moments,

549
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,500
you were with him on the scene, and you did call 119.

550
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,420
And deceased Hong Seok Pal's cell phone was discovered in his office.

551
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,940
The last phone conversation with you was recorded in it.

552
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,200
 Park So Yeong. 

553
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,260
 What if I told you I killed Park So Yeong? 

554
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,030
 What? 

555
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,020
 Are you interested now that I tell you I killed Park So Yeong? 

556
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,650
 Of course, you have responsibility for So Yeong getting killed like a dog. 

557
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,430
You're clearly connected to Hong Seok Pal's death.

558
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,700
Also, Park So Yeong's death is also mixed in. There is so much to investigate.

559
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,390
Please come with us.

560
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,040
Are you asking her to accompany you voluntarily?

561
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,880
You don't even have an arrest warrant.

562
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,560
She's not a suspect but only a material witness.

563
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,750
Asking her to go to the station without her consent? That makes no sense.

564
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,210
Hey, student.

565
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,680
We'll decide whether she's a material witness or a suspect.

566
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,800
Wait.

567
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,840
A suspect?

568
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,380
Did you just call our professor a suspect?

569
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,700
We can hold you accountable for what you just said, right?

570
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,800
I'll record this from now on. Okay?

571
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,870
Oh, right. We'll record all this.

572
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,320
You'll have to be liable for this later.

573
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,180
Geez, seriously...

574
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,120
 Hong Seok Pal died because of you. 

575
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,510
 Chief Kang says an investigation on you is inevitable. 

576
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:28,740
So did your Chief Kang tell you to catch me?

577
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,060
Yes, Chief.

578
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,890
Yes.

579
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,920
Got it.

580
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,810
Ms. Oh Su Jae, you're under arrest without a warrant.

581
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,760
You have no charges against her, and her identity is authenticated.

582
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,670
An arrest without a warrant?

583
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,240
This is an abuse of power.

584
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,380
Criminal penal code, article 213. Abuse of power and obstruction of exercise of rights.

585
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,640
Article 214. Abuse of power and obstruction of exercise of rights and arrest.

586
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,060
Ms. Oh Su Jae!

587
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,060
For the allegations of inciting the murder of Park So Yeong

588
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,200
and abetting Hong Seok Pal's suicide, you're under arrest without a warrant.

589
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,400
- Do you understand? 
 - What a bullshit!

590
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,340
Detective Do, what are you talking about?

591
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,210
You have the right to an attorney, and you have the right to remain silent.

592
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:16,520
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

593
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,460
Well, you know that already.

594
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,880
Professor...

595
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,850
 If you think you took the bait, you'll get hurt less if you just go along with it. 

596
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:35,090
 If you struggle and strain, it will rip your oral orifice 

597
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,400
 and your body could get hurt as well. 

598
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,510
He felt more rushed than I thought.

599
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,020
Right?

600
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,510
Without an arrest warrant,

601
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,850
putting me under arrest, you're confident about this, right?

602
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,670
You must think we're being reckless here, but

603
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,270
we have our grounds—

604
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,200
An arrest without an arrest warrant.

605
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,530
You carry a risk of determining how appropriate it is later.

606
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,870
You've taken that into account, correct?

607
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,320
Putting your job on the line?

608
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,810
Seriously.

609
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,180
Geez, it's so tough to arrest a lawyer.

610
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,520
Let's go quietly. Okay?

611
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,690
Professor!

612
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,230
- Professor! 
 - Detective Do!

613
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,280
Song Mi Rim.

614
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,700
Be my attorney.

615
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,940
Okay.

616
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,520
I'll do it.

617
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,900
I'll do this.

618
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,860
No one...

619
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,100
No one should come out.

620
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,070
Please take her without handcuffs.

621
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:37,700
She wouldn't run away, and this is a school.

622
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,390
Let's mind minimal courtesy.

623
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,270
Let's go.

624
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,690
Do you have a warrant?

625
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,010
Are you sure there's sure cause for arrest without a warrant?

626
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,870
How can you put handcuffs on a professor on campus?

627
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,830
Are you out of your mind?

628
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,650
Let's go.

629
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,490
Just a moment.

630
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,900
Please water my plant.

631
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,460
Step aside. Let's go.

632
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:07,310
 Seoul Central Police Station 

633
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,670
 Do you admit to inciting Park So Yeong's murder? 

634
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,390
 Do you admit to abetting his suicide? 

635
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:29,160
 Why did you tell him to kill her? 

636
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,990
 Is it true you asked him to kill Park So Yeong? 

637
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:34,890
When Park So Yeong died, you didn't feel guilty at all.

638
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,070
How do you feel now?

639
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,110
You still don't feel any guilt?

640
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,090
Not at all.

641
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,500
- What? How can you? 
 - Get out of the way.

642
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,900
 Next news. 

643
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,980
 TK Law Firm's partner, 

644
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,800
 Attorney Oh Su Jae, who was in the spotlight at the time of Park So Yeong's death, 

645
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,450
 was arrested without a warrant for the allegations of 
  

646
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,940
 inciting Park So Yeong's murder and abetting Hong Seok Pal's suicide. 

647
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,850
What's going on?

648
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,950
 - Attorney Oh Su Jae was... 
 - What nonsense...

649
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,360
 brought up as a candidate for the law firm CEO position at TK Law Firm. 

650
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,360
 She was the star attorney at TK Law Firm. 

651
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,880
- What's this? 
  - Falling from the TK Building, 

652
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:13,400
 Park So Yeong—it was revealed that Attorney Oh Su Jae incited the murder 

653
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,050
sending shockwaves.

654
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,440
Father.

655
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,540
You knew, right?

656
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,730
You knew all about Noona's arrest without a warrant, right?

657
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,700
Please get her out of there now.

658
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,450
Get her out of there!

659
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,420
Why did you do it?

660
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,750
I was bored.

661
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,170
What were you looking for?

662
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:59,090
I guess you did hide something in there then.

663
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,490
Behind that weird button.

664
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,270
I've finally come to my senses after you hit me with that.

665
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,120
Stop beating up on people, Father.

666
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,900
What if you kill someone?

667
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,190
Consider yourself lucky that you're my son.

668
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,700
Or else you couldn't be standing right here.

669
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,290
Father,

670
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:31,720
I've never for a single moment considered myself lucky being your son!

671
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,960
Father, why is Su Jae—

672
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,640
I bet Hyeong did, though.

673
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,100
You were lucky that you were Father's son.

674
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,320
When I was a third year in high school!

675
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,450
When Mom collapsed when you caused that huge mess!

676
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,880
I just remembered how Father cleaned up all your mess.

677
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,000
What are you talking about?

678
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,150
Mom passed away within five days back then,

679
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,430
so I wasn't even interested in what kind of trouble you got yourself into.

680
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,650
Hyeong, did you feel relieved then because you were Father's son?

681
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:05,520
You asshole...

682
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,330
- Choi Yoon Sang! 
 - Yes!

683
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,060
I'm leaving!

684
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,830
I'll go and make sure I get Noona out.

685
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:15,780
If you leave now, you do only two things!

686
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,900
Don't do anything related to Su Jae

687
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,950
and move back home.

688
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,770
Everyone is wondering if Su Jae's arrest will cause problems for the sale.

689
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,470
Chief Han has been calling me nonstop.

690
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:44,890
Don't you miss the timing with Su Jae's absence.

691
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:46,650
Bring in what you need to bring in.

692
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,660
Father, so...

693
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:54,190
Is that why you didn't stop Su Jae's arrest without a warrant?

694
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,410
Are you going to interrogate her?

695
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:32,660
Chief says he wants to watch, so we should wait.

696
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,280
Is that woman that big of a deal?

697
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,430
Even Chief is coming for this?

698
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,040
Did she hear us or what?

699
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,680
Why did she smile?

700
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,860
Isn't she a little crazy?

701
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,330
Gosh, the passcode.

702
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:57,080
I should've asked her. What should I do?

703
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,950
Should we ask her friend?

704
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,020
Dr. Chae Joon Hui.

705
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,770
 Attorney Song, I wanted to call you. 

706
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,740
 Su Jae won't pick up. 

707
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,030
Ah Dr. Joon Hui, I'm in a rush.

708
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,250
By any chance, do you know Attorney Oh's front door passcode?

709
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,120
Can't believe how weak the passcode is...

710
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,900
Gong Chan!

711
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,070
 Auntie brought it over, but I'm not good at keeping it alive. 

712
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,420
The unit is in the company name.

713
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,610
It's being rented.

714
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,060
Attorney Song!

715
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,230
Where are you, Attorney Song?

716
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:07,890
Dr. Joon Hui, over here!

717
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,900
I'm here.

718
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,670
- Is she okay? 
 - Yes, she's okay.

719
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,060
CEO?

720
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,490
 I came here with high expectations since people say 

721
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,110
 TK Law Firm is all that, and all the lawyers aspire to work here. That's why I had some expectations. 

722
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,470
 For you to share this space with this punk 

723
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,850
 makes me worry about your mental health, Professor. 

724
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,250
 What? "A guy like this"? 

725
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,490
 Yes. 

726
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,500
 A punk. 

727
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,710
Now that I think about it, CEO it's a little strange.

728
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,000
You could've told Attorney Song to come.

729
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,280
You came here yourself with a locksmith.

730
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,310
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

731
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,630
Others might think you're a burglar, CEO.

732
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,690
Do I need to explain myself here?

733
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,740
And this isn't Attorney Oh's place. It's one of the company leases.

734
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,770
Didn't you know that, Attorney Song?

735
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,670
So you could break into a house if it's company-owned?

736
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,990
I guess that's how it goes at TK Law Firm.

737
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,640
"That house isn't yours. I rented it to you.

738
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,630
So I can go in if I want to." Is that what you're saying?

739
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,120
Where is Attorney Oh's bedroom?

740
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,910
Go and see what that moron is doing in the room.

741
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,190
- Oh, okay. 
 - Okay.

742
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:42,080
Did you find what you're looking for? Are you leaving?

743
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,910
Ms. Oh Su Jae.

744
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:01,870
I refuse to answer until my attorney gets here.

745
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:06,290
I mean, when is your attorney coming?

746
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:11,960
I'm sorry.

747
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,600
I'm sorry.

748
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,180
I had to water the plant.

749
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,940
Let's begin.

750
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:28,270
 Because of 

751
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:32,290
 Attorney Oh Su Jae at TK Law Firm, 

752
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:35,560
 I killed Park So Yeong. 

753
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,860
 The one who pushed Park So Yeong from the rooftop of the TK Law Firm building 

754
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:44,890
 was me, Hong Seok Pal. 

755
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,650
 Hey. 

756
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,800
 Who the hell do you think you are to tell me what to do? 

757
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,580
 It doesn't make sense to let Park So Yeong be. 

758
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,310
 Do you want to go to prison? 

759
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,550
 I noticed you own several hostess bars in Gangnam. 

760
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:09,610
 I can bankrupt them all. 

761
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:10,930
 Your kids studying abroad... 

762
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:14,570
 Do they know how their father makes money to support their studies? 

763
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,570
 Hey! 

764
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:19,240
 Don't mess with my kids! 

765
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,530
 If you mess with my kids, I'll kill you for real! 

766
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:25,920
 You got that? 

767
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,030
 Then, think carefully. 

768
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,600
 How you'll take care of Park So Yeong. 

769
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,530
 Take care of what? 

770
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,750
 Why would I do that? Huh? 

771
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,820
 You know what you do best. 

772
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:42,350
 Burying people without anyone knowing. 

773
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:46,390
 The reason Attorney Oh Su Jae blackmailed me like this 

774
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,190
 is all because of that Assemblyman An Gang Hoon. 

775
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:55,080
 Assemblyman An, who used to date her got scandalous with Park So Yeong. 

776
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:02,230
 Attorney Oh Su Jae flipped out and told me to kill Park So Yeong. 

777
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:05,420
 If I didn't kill Park So Yeong, 

778
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,490
 she said she would destroy all my businesses. 

779
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:13,850
 She said, she'd make sure my kids struggle... 

780
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,660
Do you admit to telling Hong Seok Pal to kill Park So Yeong?

781
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,890
Attorney Oh.

782
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:26,270
Let's watch it until the end of it, for now.

783
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,180
 That's how Attorney Oh Su Jae blackmailed me 

784
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:38,400
 and I had no choice but to kill Park So Yeong. 

785
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,430
 Jo Kang Ja: Just obtained Hong Seok Pal's suicide video 

786
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:47,150
 I had nightmares every night 

787
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:50,160
 and I couldn't bear it as days went by because of my guilty conscience. 

788
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,700
 So Yeong, I'm really sorry. 

789
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:58,320
 And I sincerely ask for forgiveness from her family. 

790
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,250
 I'm sorry. 

791
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,900
 I'm very sorry. 

792
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,710
 I will meet Attorney Oh Su Jae for the last time 

793
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,340
 and in front of her eyes, 

794
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:20,820
 I'll die. 

795
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,300
That's it.

796
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,340
It's over.

797
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,590
 So, Hong Seok Pal, that motherfucker dared come here 

798
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,150
and spew nonsense about Park So Yeong?

799
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:55,160
Tell that motherfucker to get over here!

800
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,740
We should tell the dishwasher to do the dishes.

801
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,010
I guess Oh Su Jae could deal with him.

802
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,240
Tell her to stamp him hard, into tiny pieces.

803
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,330
After she does the dishes, why don't you get rid of the dishwasher, too?

804
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,640
Why would you get rid of Oh Su Jae?

805
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,220
She still has to wrap up the sale

806
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,750
and she's a different quality girl compared to Hong Seok Pal.

807
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,630
Whenever I stand here,

808
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:21,220
I realize Chairman Choi sure picked the perfect spot.

809
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,530
But...

810
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:26,910
since Oh Su Jae still has the cruise file,

811
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,760
it makes me wonder if my road to that place will be a flowery path or a shitty one.

812
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,030
If we're in it together, you should put everything into it,

813
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:46,060
so that you'll become Minister of Justice in the Lee In Su administration.

814
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:51,430
Your intention to make me the president.

815
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:57,970
You didn't change your mind about being a stepping stone for me, right, Chairman Choi?

816
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:02,120
Wait a minute.

817
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,260
Why are we so serious all of a sudden?

818
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,770
Of course not.

819
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:14,830
In order to make me the president, you said you'll do anything.

820
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:17,270
You meant it, didn't you, Chairman Choi?

821
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:21,100
Of course, Assemblyman Lee. Was I ever insincere?

822
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:27,100
If someone saw you two, they might think you're exchanging love confessions.

823
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,830
Gosh, really.

824
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,850
Gosh, this is weird.

825
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,860
For a mere minister position.

826
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,430
Punk, he has no idea who the stepping stone is.

827
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,920
He has no idea what his role is.

828
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:59,340
 Autopsy Report: Hong Seok Pal 

829
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,180
There are no crime allegations and I suspect substance addition.

830
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:06,630
But it's not directly connected to his death.

831
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:10,490
He died from carbon monoxide asphyxiation and burns.

832
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:13,920
 Carbon monoxide asphyxiation and burns... extreme measures...  
 I suspect he took extreme measures to take his life.

833
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:53,340
 Establishing Law and Order 

834
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:05,250
 Why Her? 

835
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:15,460


836
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:24,470
♫  Show me your smile  ♫

837
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,700
 - Crazy... 
 - Crazy trashy journos! 

838
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,560
 This is just the beginning. 

839
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,300
 Worse things will become facts, and she'll be marked a culprit. 

840
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,940
 Attorney Oh Su Jae's home and office were under search and seizure. 

841
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,430
 - It disappeared, huh? 
 - Yes. 

842
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:38,070
 TK Law Firm has nothing to do with this case. 

843
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:40,260
 We must find evidence that proves Professor's innocence ASAP. 

844
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,580
 You assholes! 

845
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,150
 Why is everything happening so fast? 

846
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,840
 We don't know whether it's real or fake. It could be real. 

847
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,270
 She'd never say that, man. 

848
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,160
 I'm sure she's thinking of various ways from inside the prison. 

849
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,090
 Someone who could drag me into it by using Hong Seok Pal. 

850
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:55,140
 How would you feel if you were in my shoes, defendant? 

851
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,930
 I would arrest me.
