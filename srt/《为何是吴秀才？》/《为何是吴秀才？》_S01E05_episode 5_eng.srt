00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,810
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,210
 Episode 5 

3
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,460


4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,400
Yeah, it's me. You're close?

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,830
Come straight up to the second floor.

6
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,230
Who the hell are you?

7
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,360
Who are you?

8
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,030
Yeonsu-ro 2, number 22.

9
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,750
Hurry over!

10
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,700
P-Professor!

11
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,470
Professor!

12
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,290
Professor!

13
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,370
Professor!

14
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,800
Professor...

15
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,670
Are you all right?

16
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,740
Wait a minute.

17
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,420
Professor.

18
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,770
Professor!

19
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,550
Professor!

20
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,930
A female, currently, has lacerations on her shoulder and is unconscious.

21
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,540
Aside from that, she's stable but needs immediate attention.

22
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,750
 Emergercy Medical Center 

23
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,100
A large glass fragment was inside your blouse.

24
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,120
It's fortunate that it didn't touch any big blood vessels.

25
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,410
But it will take about ten days to remove the stitches.

26
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,320
Okay.

27
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,620
Your friend is in the waiting room.

28
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,430
Are you all right?

29
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,490
The perpetrator's face or voice. You're saying you don't remember anything, right?

30
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,350
Ah, yes.

31
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,470
By chance, does anyone hold any grudges against you, or do you suspect anyone?

32
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,800
Um, please do not open up an investigation.

33
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,970
Excuse me?

34
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,600
But you also have injuries.

35
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,920
He didn't steal anything, and I hurt myself because I fell.

36
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,620
You must be busy. No need for you to investigate a petty theft.

37
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,170
I don't want this to create a commotion, either.

38
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,190
Then, we'll just wrap it up like this.

39
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,340
You can't change your mind and say things about it later.

40
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,370
Yes.

41
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,780
Let's go.

42
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,010
You have blood on your shirt.

43
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,100
Why did you tell the police not to investigate?

44
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,520
It's my business. Don't get involved.

45
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,960
Thanks for your help, but I'll decide this.

46
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,020
This is...

47
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,600
Why is this...

48
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,970
I asked the hyeongs to move them to our house.

49
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,150
The key to your front door is completely destroyed.

50
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,430
Someone else could try to break in again.

51
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,730
Why do you keep crossing the line?

52
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,900
Do you think I called you because I didn't know how to call 112?

53
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,940
I called you because I didn't want it known and for things to be complicated.

54
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,840
And you called the police, and why move these now—

55
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,500
You called me because you believed I'd get there faster than the police.

56
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,110
I'll take the files back as soon as possible.

57
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,030
I'm not going to your house. That's nonsense.

58
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,370
What's with you?

59
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,900
Where are you going?

60
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,270
Please do as I say, just this once.

61
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,850
If you just leave like this, I won't be able to sleep, not even a wink, from worry.

62
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,790
And if something happens to you after parting like this,

63
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,650
I'll just go crazy. I'll go nuts.

64
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,350
Going nuts isn't good.

65
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,520
Please go toward Seojung University Law School.

66
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,040
Okay.

67
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,860
The hyeongs sleep on the third floor.

68
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,520
Once they fall asleep, nothing would wake them up, even if this building collapsed.

69
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,850
So, you don't have to worry.

70
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,040
I put new sheets down on the bed in this room. You can sleep here.

71
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,010
The couch is fine for me.

72
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,410
I sleep on my couch at home, too

73
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,520
because the bed is kinda cold.

74
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,200
I see.

75
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
Okay.

76
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,510
By chance did you see that man?

77
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,560
The black cap...

78
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,090
We had a scuffle in front of the building.

79
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,270
But he ran away while I was out of it for a second.

80
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,800
Is the reason you don't want the police to investigate this

81
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,140
because it might be someone you know?

82
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,290
I don't know the details, but

83
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,570
as the company was about to be sold, you took their files.

84
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,340
And if the top-secret file that was compiled internally was included in it,

85
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,380
the perpetrator must be someone connected to the sale.

86
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,770
He knew that you had the top-secret file.

87
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,370
It must be someone who wants that file in their hands, even if it means hurting you.

88
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,340
Someone like CEO Choi Ju Wan.

89
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,210
You really are no good.

90
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,380
Not good at all.

91
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,350
You keep finding out more about me. You notice things.

92
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,510
And you even connect the dots and come up with who the perpetrator is.

93
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,640
I don't like that.

94
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,260
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

95
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,560
What is it that she doesn't like?

96
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,900
Why do you go through something like this?

97
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,970
What kind of world do you live in?

98
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,460
 Tasanjiseok 
 (TN: One man's fault can be another's lesson.) 

99
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,100
Let's hurry.

100
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,710
Geez, what the heck?

101
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,930
Hey, what's going on? Did you sleep here?

102
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,420
Hey, we thought we were going to die moving those boxes.

103
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,160
What a pathetic thief he was.

104
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,200
It didn't look like there was anything worth stealing.

105
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Oh, right.

106
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,230
Is the Professor okay? I heard she got hurt.

107
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,900
Geez, why did I fall asleep?

108
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,270
Hyeong, he got rejected by a girl

109
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,900
so he's punching the innocent couch.

110
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,370
I don't think he got rejected 
  I'll take the files back ASAP. Thanks for a warm place to sleep. –Oh Su Jae 

111
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,700
I think he rescued her.

112
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,930
 I'll take the files back ASAP. 

113
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,170
 I wasn't cold. 

114
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,900
What? Last night?

115
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,700
How could that be?

116
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,960
You almost got killed!

117
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,130
Gosh, those motherfuckers! Should we just kill them?!

118
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,570
Geez, seriously!

119
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,660
Geez, it's not like I could investigate all of them!

120
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,860
Don't be like that.

121
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,860
I wrapped up the incident.

122
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,450
Let's catch the perpetrator first.

123
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,440
That asshole took the USB, too.

124
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,180
What?

125
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,500
Who could it be?

126
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 As the company was about to be sold, you took their files. 

127
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,120
 And if the top-secret file that was compiled internally was included in it, 

128
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,990
 the perpetrator must be someone connected to the sale. 

129
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,790
The perpetrator must be someone connected to the sale

130
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,040
and someone who knows me well.

131
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,300
 It must be someone who wants that file in their hands, even if it means hurting you. 

132
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,540
Even if it means hurting me, it must be someone who wants that USB in their hands.

133
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,930
 Someone like CEO Choi Ju Wan. 

134
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,410
Then, there are several suspects.

135
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,100
Han Gi Taek, Han Seong Beom,

136
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,770
CEO Choi Ju Wan,

137
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,080
and our chairman?

138
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,760
Find out the whereabouts of those four last night.

139
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,650
Okay.

140
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,520
But it's pretty terrifying.

141
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,650
I'd rather it was a petty thief, a complete stranger.

142
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,300
I know, right?

143
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,350
Why don't you get some rest today?

144
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,590
I'll contact you after looking into it.

145
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,860
I have to check.

146
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,140
The expressions on their faces after pulling that stunt as they face me today.

147
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,510
I should check them out.

148
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,400
 Chief Legal Officer 

149
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,850
 Hansu 

150
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,680
 Chief Legal Officer 

151
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,970
The chair is more uncomfortable than I thought.

152
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,080
If you had called me ahead of time, I would've come to see you.

153
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,540
Is there a reason I can't come here?

154
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,700
No. Of course not.

155
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,200
The three things you mentioned last time.

156
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,530
First of all, the three gentlemen and Park So Yeong.

157
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,870
Well, you know.

158
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,080
The relationship between a VIP and a hostess bar escort.

159
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,770
That's exactly what it is.

160
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,020
It looks like my uncle did pay her a little extra.

161
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,520
But not the other men.

162
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,480
Are you sure about that? Did you confirm?

163
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,830
I couldn't check with them.

164
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,930
I checked with CEO Hong Seok Pal

165
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,980
since he knows the most about Park So Yeong.

166
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,940
CEO Hong Seok Pal?

167
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,850
 The rumor is that he does all the dirty work for Chairman Han in that field. 

168
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,890
 He's in demolition contracts, so he also subcontracts for Hansu Construction. 

169
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,100
At times, Uncle puts him to good use.

170
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,550
So, Chairman Han keeps a thug scumbag close to him, huh?

171
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,090
Wherever it may be, you're bound to find a dirty dishwasher, like him

172
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,910
for matters that he is unable to personally take care of.

173
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,000
Those in the businesses who quietly clean up blood and shit, while we get it on ourselves,

174
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,760
like you and me.

175
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,300
We're no different.

176
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,790
Do you really want to put yourself in the same category as that scumbag?

177
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,430
Do you really?

178
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,640
 That moron who hurt me. 

179
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,030
 Could it be Hong Seok Pal? 

180
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,970
So, I guess that scumbag would stop at nothing, right?

181
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,770
Like stealing something or hurting someone.

182
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,860
There is no way for me to know all that.

183
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,400
What you were curious about was the relationships concerning Park So Yeong.

184
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,110
I'm sure they gave special attention to her.

185
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,400
Since she was exclusively escorting VIPs.

186
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,800
Yes, probably so.

187
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,450
You know how it goes.

188
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,070
Then why did they leave her to die?

189
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,540
Oh, and... as for 27 billion won,

190
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,460
it was me.

191
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,810
I did that alone.

192
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,760
I'm telling the truth. How would I plot something like that with another person?

193
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,840
I risked my life when I did that.

194
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,470
And there's Taoist Master Kim, who was involved in deciding to halt Hansu Bio's sales.

195
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,580
The fortune teller that my uncle consults often.

196
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,220
The sales timeline worth as much as two trillion won was decided by a word from a mere fortune-teller.

197
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,350
Oh, my. How interesting.

198
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,290
Then does Taoist Master Kim get to decide on a time to resume the sales?

199
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,740
Fortunately, things were hashed out last night.

200
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,890
It will resume soon.

201
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,290
I guess his birthday party yesterday was pretty fun, then?

202
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,650
Chairman Choi is quite something.

203
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:35,810
 All right, we wish you a very happy birthday once again, our great leader, Your Excellency In Soo. 

204
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,810
 - Happy birthday! 
 - Happy birthday! 

205
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,110
 Wow, I was craving some sashimi. 

206
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,030
 I mean, putting in seawater and filling it up with saw-edged perch and black seabream... 

207
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,960
 Wow, this sure is... 

208
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,350
 I'm so touched, Chairman. 

209
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,440
 This is all Chairman Choi's idea. 

210
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,770
 He said to drain the pond water and fill it up with seawater. 

211
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,400
 Then fill it up with live fish. 

212
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 When I first heard it, I was so shocked. 

213
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,370
 It's such an original and adorable idea! 

214
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,910
 An intelligent person sure thinks differently. 

215
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,770
 This is why I like Chairman Choi. 

216
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,290
 Amazing! So amazing! 

217
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,820
 Chairman Han. 

218
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,670
 How is the Hansu Bio sale coming along? 

219
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,610
 Gi Taek mentioned that we should probably resume that soon. 

220
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,730
 - Right? 
 - Yeah. 

221
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,600
 That's not a bad idea. If it gets too cold while trying to cool it down a bit, its worth could drop. 

222
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,130
 It would be good to resume without dragging it on too long. 

223
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,990
 That's right. I'll have to ask Taoist Master Kim when the best time is. 

224
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,550
 Taoist Master Kim is very skilled. 

225
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,840
 - Hey, Gi Taek! 
 - Yes? 

226
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,310
 Gi Taek, a bait net! Hey, a bait net! Bait net! 

227
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,410
 Assemblyman Lee, come here! 

228
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,460
 - Wow! 
 - We really caught one! 

229
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,850
 Hey! Come on! 

230
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,970
 Why did you fucking fall down? 

231
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,490
 Look! Pull, pull! 

232
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,710
 Oh, my! Look at this! 

233
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,590
 I've always felt this, but Chairman Choi is quite something. 

234
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,860
Any person, whoever it may be, will end up moving the way he wills.

235
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,880
We're analyzing the video file that Attorney Oh gave us from various angles.

236
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,440
 If we enlarge the video, the image gets distorted and falls apart. 

237
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,920
 So, we can't really perform forensics on it. 

238
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,310
How long have you been a deputy chief prosecutor?

239
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,610
It's been a little over two years, Chairman.

240
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:49,760
Two years... you should know when to step it up and when not to by now.

241
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,020
If it were you,

242
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,500
if the company with your name on it keeps getting chewed out by the public,

243
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,270
would you like it?

244
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,010
No, Chairman. That won't be good.

245
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,920
I was about to explain my plan to wrap up the case.

246
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,810
Have some.

247
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,170
Let's grab dinner sometime with Assemblyman Lee.

248
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,700
I'll do my utmost best!

249
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,330
Chairman, Police Chief Kang Gil Ju would like to meet with you.

250
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,980
I thought I was meeting only Deputy Chief Hwang today.

251
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,250
He has something to tell you regarding Attorney Oh.

252
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,250
A report came in last night at Eulso District Station.

253
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,590
They said a thief broke into a building.

254
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,940
It turns out it was Attorney Oh Su Jae's building.

255
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,030
A law school student made the report

256
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,000
and Attorney Oh denied the investigation.

257
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,820
- And her reason is? 
 - She doesn't want to make noise.

258
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,290
She said it won't be necessary.

259
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:08,130
But one of the reporters at the station heard about it when he stopped by.

260
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,290
You know that Park So Yeong who fell to her death from the rooftop?

261
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,260
Of all people, he happens to be the reporter who reported the story.

262
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,110
Don't you know that I detest hearing noisy news these days?

263
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,880
So I called in that reporter, gave him another piece of news, and wrapped it up.

264
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,880
I'll drink it well, Chairman.

265
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,630
Chief Ha, was it you?

266
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,230
Pardon?

267
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,290
I heard a thief broke into Su Jae's building.

268
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,910
I'm asking if you did that.

269
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,120
I'm not sure what you're talking about...

270
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,590
If it's not you, who could it be?

271
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,410
Why isn't it you?

272
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,480
My apologies.

273
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,370
Find it.

274
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,910
That punk took what I should have in my hands.

275
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,310
Bring that in front of me!

276
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,000
Open this for me, and don't ask any questions.

277
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,230
What is it?

278
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,800
What is it that I can't ask any questions?

279
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,570
You're not doing anything bad. Just open it for me.

280
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,800
I'll tell you later.

281
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,200
This is weird.

282
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,570
I need to know what's in here—

283
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,420
Noona! Chan is acting strange!

284
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,640
I think he stole this.

285
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,950
He just demands that I open it.

286
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,190
He says don't ask any questions.

287
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,790
You ask Choon Poong to open this and you ask me to get the CCTV footage.

288
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,810
What are you up to?

289
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,980
- He did? 
 - Yeah.

290
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,150
- Noona... 
 - Gong Chan, you punk!

291
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,230
What's going on? What did you steal?

292
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,830
This.

293
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,620
Where did you get this?

294
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,390
It was only thrown to the executives for Hansu Group's anniversary.

295
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,170
What's this?

296
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,780
It's weirder that you know that, Hyeong.

297
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,560
Is your father a Hansu executive?

298
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,340
No, that's not it.

299
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,830
I happen to know some useless stuff.

300
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,660
Look me in the eyes and tell it to me straight.

301
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,940
What are you doing going around?

302
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,190
Well... a thief broke into the house of someone I know.

303
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,730
The thief tried to steal it, but he dropped it.

304
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,500
We had a scuffle, but he ran away.

305
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,720
A scuffle?

306
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,050
So you fought with that thief?

307
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,720
Who's the person you know?

308
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,800
Where is that place?

309
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,480
Let's open the USB first.

310
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,960
How about the USB owner?

311
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,150
Does he know you took it?

312
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,590
I'll tell her after I open it.

313
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,700
Why?

314
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,090
I have to know what's in it

315
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,050
to know what he was trying to steal.

316
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,050
That way, we would know how the owner should preemptively act.

317
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,860
So, please help me, Noona.

318
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,150
It's a woman.

319
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,430
I mean, the USB owner is a woman.

320
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,420
A woman that Chan is interested in.

321
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:35,230
And it's a one-sided love, where he has a huge crush on her.

322
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,060
Am I right?

323
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,630
Then that makes sense. That's the answer.

324
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,050
Hey, you should've said so!

325
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,500
No...

326
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,970
Well, it's not a huge crush or anything...

327
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,580
I got it, I got it.

328
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,220
Let's just help him.

329
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,170
He says he had a one-two scuffle to protect his crush.

330
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,300
Whoa, "you the man." A true alpha male.

331
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,640
Just open that for me.

332
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,840
- All right. 
 - I got it. Let's just open it for him!

333
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,670
Let's open it for him.

334
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,620
Who's the USB owner?

335
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,660
By chance, is it Professor Oh?

336
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,220
Tell me.

337
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,470
Just like how I recognized the USB, I could find out more stuff for you.

338
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,650
You're right.

339
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,350
You say it's Noona's?

340
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,060
"Noona"?

341
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,130
Hey, let's go in first. Go in. I'll explain.

342
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,150
Choon Poong, switch seats with me.

343
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,100
- What? 
 - Switch seats with me.

344
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,120
- Move? 
 - Switch seats.

345
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,900
Why switch seats? Why?

346
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,600
 How not to send your client who stole money to prison. 

347
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,190
There was an excellent verdict that came down from the Supreme Court today.

348
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,650
The original verdict for Chairman Ko Man Yeol of Serim Group of a three-year imprisonment sentence

349
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,360
and four years of probation was basically confirmed.

350
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,410
That happened?

351
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,420
- Do you know about that? 
 - No, I didn't.

352
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,110
How pathetic.

353
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,120
The people who want to become legal professionals have no idea what's going on in the world?

354
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,030
Search it up.

355
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,440
 Chairman Ko Man Yeol of Serim Group  
 In the first trial, 70 billion won for embezzlement,

356
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,420
out of 324.5 billion won, and breach of duty were the charges He was found guilty.

357
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,220
For engaging in accounting fraud, 200 billion won out of 2 trillion won, he was found guilty.

358
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,200
He received a six-year prison sentence.

359
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
However, the second trial turned out differently.

360
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,490
 Serim Group  
 Yes, they said they do not acknowledge that Chairman Ko colluded with accountants

361
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,320
and gave a not guilty verdict on the accounting fraud charge in the amount of 2 trillion won!

362
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,960
But he stole 2 trillion won!

363
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,250
He stole 2 trillion won yet was found not guilty.

364
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,460
And the point is?

365
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,630
The point here is the accountants.

366
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,530
Chairman Ko held a consistent opinion that the accountants committed the fraud and he had no idea of it.

367
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,510
Oh, so when a conglomerate chairman

368
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,520
steals company funds or squanders them, he always uses someone else's name.

369
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,090
That way, if any issues come up,

370
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,030
"Oh, I didn't know!"

371
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,360
If he says that, he can be found not guilty.

372
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,050
Professor Oh was your tutor?

373
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,450
It's a secret.

374
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,700
- Noona said she'd kill me if it's known. 
 - There were other similar cases. What

375
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,920
- Whoa. 
 - were they?

376
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,550
So, what happened to Noona last night?

377
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,180
Yes.

378
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,220
He received a two-year prison sentence in the first trial, but it flipped in the second trial.

379
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,690
Two years of imprisonment and three years probation.

380
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,600
And Chairman Seo got reinstated as the group chairman recently.

381
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,160
The reason the first trial verdict was dropped?

382
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,950
The subsidiary companies who suffered a loss petitioned, saying they don't want the chairman to be punished.

383
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,570
They submitted pleading petitions.

384
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,570
And Chairman Seo promised to pay for the loss.

385
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,380
And plus,

386
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,770
he said it was an inevitable choice due to the management decision.

387
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,200
He emphasized the fact that he meant no private gain

388
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,500
in order to receive the probation.

389
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,340
- I did that. 
 - Amazing!

390
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,670
That was your case, Professor?

391
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,300
Any other cases?

392
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,750
A paper company was created and 200 billion won was held back in taxes

393
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,220
but received only a probation sentence. It's the case of Chairman Kang of Korea Distribution.

394
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,980
He received a two-year prison sentence in the first trial.

395
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:08,800
In the second trial, he insisted that he was trying to rebuild the company with that money. And that worked.

396
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,280
He received two years in prison, (deferred to) three years of probation.

397
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,550
That was also your case, Professor.

398
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,480
Now, you know why my nickname is Dishwasher.

399
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,240
When I prepare the first trial for clients like them, I tell them this.

400
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,860
"In the first trial, you'll be put under court custody and receive a prison sentence."

401
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,740
"That would have a big impact,

402
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,480
and it's effective because it would seem that you're receiving just punishment."

403
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,060
"And then,

404
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,410
when people are busy making a living and are about to forget their anger toward you,

405
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,700
I'll let you get out with probation in the second trial

406
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,380
because the public will only remember your first trial."

407
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,840
Noona must be looking for the USB, though.

408
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,750
I think it'd be better if she doesn't know until we open it and check.

409
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,000
If someone finds out, it could put Professor in danger again.

410
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,610
What did I just say for you to do?

411
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,820
So...

412
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,950
you were discussing how not to send clients who stole money to prison...

413
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,020
I'm sorry.

414
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,660
Get out.

415
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,740
Are we elementary school kids or something?

416
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,810
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

417
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,990
Hey, hey! Forget it.

418
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,790
Let's finish what we were talking about.

419
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,360
What were you saying earlier?

420
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,950
You want me to what?

421
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,540
What is it? Do you want me to look into something?

422
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,080
Yes.

423
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,150
- What? 
 - The jerk who hurt Professor Oh.

424
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,610
I think it's someone close to Professor Oh.

425
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,240
Either they put the USB together or know what's on it,

426
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,710
or they want that.

427
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,490
So, what can I do about it?

428
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,880
Hyeong.

429
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,860
You're the son of Chairman Choi Tae Gook of TK Law Firm.

430
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,460
CEO Choi Ju Wan is your older brother.

431
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,350
 Hey, you. 

432
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,590
 Geez, Father. 

433
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,490
 You never call me. 

434
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,950
You caught me. All of it.

435
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,330
Isn't it better that I catch you than anyone else?

436
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,460
Damn it! Seriously!

437
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,660
Hey, bring the car.

438
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,970
Why did you visit CEO Hong?

439
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,950
Did you do something through Mr. Hong—

440
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,310
What do you care?

441
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,070
Why do you care, Chief Ha?

442
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,710
Who cares what I order Mr. Hong to do?

443
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,620
Chairman Choi asked me to find out.

444
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,580
 Attorney Oh, as you expected, he got all furious as if he got caught causing trouble. 

445
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,300
So...

446
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,950
CEO Choi did something in secret through Hong Seok Pal

447
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,580
and it didn't go as planned.

448
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,840
Chairman Choi caught him doing something he shouldn't have done, and that's why he's furious.

449
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,740
- That's it, right? 
 - Yeah!

450
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,940
Did any of the CCTVs in the area capture anything?

451
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,160
What the heck? Everything is broken.

452
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,740
As if they broke them on purpose.

453
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,850
What's wrong with all of them?

454
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,560
They were determined to break them all.

455
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,390
 I looked into it and turns out 

456
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,850
 some scumbags went around breaking them all a few days ago. 

457
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,530
I'm sure they planned it.

458
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,740
They planned to do what they did to me.

459
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,570
I'm sure they put that much effort into it.

460
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,980
But did CEO Choi really make Hong Seok Pal...

461
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,440
Could he really have done that?

462
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,810
I think that's just wrong.

463
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,460
That's so thuggish.

464
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:43,810
USB Flash Drive Locked

465
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,190
Drive locked.

466
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,400
 Drive locked 

467
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,960
Chan, is your girlfriend pretty?

468
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,340
I said she's not my girlfriend.

469
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,600
"I said she's not my girlfriend.

470
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,720
It's just a crush."

471
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,420
He's been so hesitant about texting his crush since earlier.

472
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,920
Why? Is he afraid she won't reply?

473
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,900
You confessed, right?

474
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,200
You guys are flirting, right?

475
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,160
We're not doing all this when you're not even flirty with each other, right?

476
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,410
- No, that's not it. 
 - Come now.

477
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,300
 Professor Oh Su Jae 

478
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:33,310
By chance, did you get to see the license plate number, and the vehicle model last night?

479
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,850
He didn't have a car.

480
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,130
I just saw him run off.

481
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,090
He might've parked it elsewhere.

482
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,580
Perhaps he could've used public transportation on purpose.

483
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,490
By chance, are you looking for him?

484
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,400
 Don't look for him. 

485
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,330
What?

486
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,600
You could be in danger again. Don't do anything.

487
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,620
If you risk danger and get hurt again...

488
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,060
I beg you.

489
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,330
Please trust me and wait. Please?

490
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,870
What's with you? What are you doing here?

491
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,370
I heard a thief broke into your place.

492
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,110
Gong Chan has a bigger mouth than I thought.

493
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,040
It's not that Chan has a big mouth.

494
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,690
Anyway, he told me because he's trying to help you.

495
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,800
That's all you need to know.

496
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,610
What are you talking about?

497
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,160
From now on, if something happens...

498
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,220
If a thief breaks in or my father or hyeong pisses you off,

499
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,570
call me first.

500
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,010
Not another guy.

501
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,060
Not Gong Chan. Call me.

502
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,650
I'm off.

503
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,430
Hey!

504
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,770
What's with him now?

505
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,610
I'm sorry, Father.

506
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,760
I really tried to do this well.

507
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,940
I set my mind to it and did my best, but...

508
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,580
Why did you drag Hong Seok Pal into this?

509
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,430
Why him?

510
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,680
I heard he's good at doing everything.

511
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,000
I heard you trust him and use him at times.

512
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,940
Geez, really.

513
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,150
I can't believe I'm doing the job myself, at my age, to help you, CEO.

514
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,700
I would usually have my guys do this.

515
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,620
Go now. Be sure to get it back.

516
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,450
Let's meet back here in 20 minutes.

517
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,800
 So... 

518
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,560
where is the USB?

519
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:55,140
If you brought it back, you should hand it over to me.

520
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,160
Go get it.

521
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,380
Go back and get it! Go back!

522
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,130
Come on!

523
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,370
Some guy popped out of nowhere.

524
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,600
What am I supposed to do?

525
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,760
I've been polite to you because you're the Chairman's son!

526
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,440
How dare you think I'm a pushover! I just ought to!

527
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,370
Hey, get lost. Get lost, you asshole!

528
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,050
- You ass...
 - Where are you going?

529
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,230
- Hey!
 - Get lost, you fucker!

530
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,410
Hey, stop!

531
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,680
Stop, you asshole! Stop!

532
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,000
You stupid idiot!

533
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,920
Don't you think

534
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,590
Su Jae would find out it was you?

535
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,460
She probably found out already.

536
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,080
And you dare pull such a stunt on Su Jae?

537
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,670
Father, you said you must have it.

538
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,210
I did it for you, Father.

539
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,860
From the bottom of my heart, I did it for you.

540
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,910
Geez, this guy...

541
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,230
Mr. Ko?

542
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,980
Oh, you're here.

543
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,640
Wow, Attorney, you should be a fortune teller.

544
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,480
Why? Did you find something?

545
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,350
Did you catch the thief?

546
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,260
There...

547
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,090
Please look into Han Gi Taek.

548
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,380
Han Gi Taek?

549
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,890
Not Hong Seok Pal or Choi Ju Wan?

550
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,370
I think I saw something.

551
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,590
- Are you okay, sir? 
- Come on.

552
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,690
How could you drive like that?

553
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,310
I'm so sorry, sir.

554
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,560
My mother is on her deathbed.

555
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,450
I was so out of it thinking about that.

556
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:12,290
May I get this fixed and return it to you today?

557
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,940
 KG Car Center 
 You own a body shop?

558
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,740
Ki Joon, bring me the air pump. 
  KG Car Center 

559
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,670
Okay!

560
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,110
It wasn't Hong Seok Pal. It was Han Gi Taek.

561
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,390
That's right.

562
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,720
There's no way CEO Choi would've gone that far.

563
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,610
He ran away when he saw the police car.

564
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,960
So, how did you know?

565
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,860
Did you see something?

566
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,870
His tennis shoes.

567
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,890
I thought he would just lie on his back after getting caught with 27 billion won.

568
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,540
He has totally lost it.

569
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,970
It's usually like that.

570
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,550
When people get cornered and get scared, they pull some crazy shit.

571
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,690
 Who the hell are you! 

572
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,550
 Who are you! 

573
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:22,010
I guess Han Gi Taek could've been one step behind.

574
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,040
What is all this, Chan?

575
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,230
 HS Holding 

576
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,910
Hey, what is all this?

577
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,680
Look at all the amounts.

578
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,840
They're all more than 100 million won.

579
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,200
It looks like corporate financial data.

580
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,650
Wow, did you guys pull an all-nighter again?

581
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,790
- Yeah...
- Oh, you opened it!

582
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,670
Who do you have a crush on again?

583
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,400
Who is it that she's got something like this?

584
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,020
It's not his crush. It's Professor.

585
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,520
- Professor Oh Su Jae.
 -  What? 

586
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,880
A thief broke into Professor Oh's building.

587
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,730
It's near the tavern.

588
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,270
I was close by. That's why she had called me.

589
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,160
So why didn't you tell us from the get-go?

590
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,450
You could've just opened up to us.

591
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,280
Because I wanted to keep her safe.

592
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,900
She denied the police investigation as well.

593
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,940
She didn't want outsiders to know about it.

594
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,280
If we started talking among ourselves, she could've been in danger.

595
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,230
True. Se Ryeon could've told someone.

596
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,820
Hey! Geez!

597
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,800
I'm asking you all. Please keep this a secret.

598
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,150
Please, Noona.

599
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,480
Tell your employees to keep this quiet.

600
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,760
Okay.

601
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,930
That thief is someone Professor knows.

602
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,590
He knew when he came

603
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,250
that this was at her place.

604
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,080
Don't worry.

605
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,060
That jerk has been captured in here.

606
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,390
The way this man walks. Can you think of anything?

607
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,530
This man!

608
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,640
It's him, right?

609
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,290
That's right. That's the look I had on my face when I first saw this.

610
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:34,080
Look. The man next to him has been captured, too.

611
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,960
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

612
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,100
 Choi Ju Wan 

613
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,850
 Gong Chan 

614
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,520
Gong Chan reported it to the police.

615
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,740
He's a student at Legal Clinic.

616
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,790
He was at the hospital with Attorney Oh that night.

617
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,750
Father.

618
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,440
Sit down.

619
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,120
Hyeong broke into Noona's place...

620
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,120
You knew, right?

621
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,920
Where is Hyeong? He's not in the office, and he won't pick up.

622
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,510
Did he run away or something?

623
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,050
I sent him to the States.

624
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,670
Why?

625
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,440
In case Noona reported Hyeong to the police?

626
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,450
She would've done so already if she wanted to.

627
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,300
Choi Ju Wan, that pathetic fool! That idiot!

628
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,160
Mind your manners.

629
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,030
How dare you judge your older brother?

630
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,870
Ju Wan did that for me

631
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,790
to bring me what I wanted.

632
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,130
Ju Wan did what you couldn't even fathom.

633
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:10,240
Who is that man, Father?

634
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,490
The man that Hyeong hired to do the job!

635
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,900
He didn't just do that.

636
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,150
Noona will find out soon.

637
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,460
She'll find out everything.

638
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,340
Did you know who it was?

639
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,400
Kind of.

640
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,270
This man over here is the same person there.

641
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,400
Do you know who he is also?

642
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,480
There is someone I kind of suspected.

643
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,650
Who is it?

644
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,620
Hong Seok Pal, the owner of the hostess bar that Park So Yeong worked at.

645
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,590
He stole Park So Yeong's cell phone

646
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:27,840
and stole the USB by breaking into your building to help Choi Ju Wan.

647
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,340
This was dropped as he ran off... by Hong Seok Pal.

648
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,320
You had this?

649
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,440
Since when?

650
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,710
I think he dropped it when he scuffled with me.

651
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,160
Why didn't you tell me?

652
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,590
If someone found out you had this, you could be in danger again.

653
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,720
Choon Poong and we all cracked the password.

654
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,460
We also saved another copy.

655
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,390
Please message the CCTV footage to my phone.

656
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,810
Are you going to just leave?

657
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,460
Why? Did you think you'd hear compliments from me?

658
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,630
Did you think I'd thank you for finding out who the thief is and hacking into the USB?

659
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:16,400
I clearly told you not to cross the line.

660
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,710
Yet you even got the team members involved?

661
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,500
Do you think I'm joking?

662
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,310
Do I seem like a joke to you?

663
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,180
I didn't do that to be commended.

664
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,370
I never thought you were a joke, Professor.

665
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,750
The thief broke in, so I caught him.

666
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,780
I was worried about you, so I didn't tell you I had the USB.

667
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,420
I can figure out what to do next only if I know what's on the USB.

668
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,010
I did it because I wanted to help you.

669
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,930
Because I worry about you.

670
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,370
I worry about you a lot.

671
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,290
Chief Han Gi Taek had called several times.

672
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,370
He wants me to set up a meeting with you.

673
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,060
That pathetic punk.

674
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,050
He could never do anything right.

675
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,230
Don't laugh.

676
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,610
I knew you'd be like this. That's why I didn't tell you.

677
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,820
It's no big deal, and I knew you'd fuss over it.

678
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,780
It's no big deal?

679
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,920
A thief broke in, and you got hurt.

680
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,120
And it turns out that Choi Ju Wan was the thief. That's no big deal?

681
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,810
There are two more punks.

682
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:41,120
The scumbag who acted on it following Choi Ju Wan's orders

683
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,120
and Hansu Group's Chief Han Gi Taek.

684
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,360
That Gong Chan who rescued you.

685
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,730
That cool man. I feel like bowing to that amazing man.

686
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:54,580
He's our hope, you bitch!

687
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,450
What am I to do if you drink it all.

688
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,530
- I want some, too. 
- Shut up.

689
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:02,330
I'm so scared, Quack.

690
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,650
Hey, come on! You...

691
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,310
You work yourself to death and are so deathly loyal to the firm.

692
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:12,010
And all those fuckers around you have it out for you.

693
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,080
Do you think your chairman has no idea?

694
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,300
Do you think he has no idea what his son did?

695
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,450
That old snake.

696
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,720
I'm sure he knows about everything!

697
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,650
- Joon Hui.
 - What?

698
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,450
You know Gong Chan?

699
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,980
Yeah, what about Gong Chan?

700
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,680
One time he came to the firm, and he said this.

701
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,300
"This place, the people in this place.

702
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,570
They're not good at all."

703
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:47,520
Did I not know this or did I stay despite knowing that?

704
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,650
 Do you think I don't know? 

705
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,910
 I can see them whisper trash talk about me as soon as I turn my back. 

706
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,070
 The morons everywhere who are dying to cut me down. 

707
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:01,030
But when he pointed that out to me...

708
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,240
Thump.

709
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,100
My heart dropped.

710
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,580
And he found out who the thief was.

711
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,470
He even hacked into the USB.

712
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,470
My anger is at the boiling point...

713
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,820
because he knows me too well.

714
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,360
What's wrong with a man who's interested in you getting to know you?

715
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,140
Did you want to show only the pretty and positive side?

716
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,760
Does that work in life?

717
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:50,500
Even if people trash-talked and gossiped about me,

718
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,170
I ignored everything and tried never to show my fragile side.

719
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,730
No matter what happened, I pretended to be okay and not affected.

720
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,660
I pretended like I didn't have any tears.

721
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,280
I pretended to be okay.

722
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,070
I gritted my teeth, held it in, and held my ground.

723
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,290
That always worked for me.

724
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:24,150
But I don't think that would work for him.

725
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,470
He found out too much about me already

726
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:34,060
and I think he'll get to know everything.

727
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,180
And that embarrasses me to no end.

728
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,690
It's so embarrassing that it makes me cry.

729
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,960
What's so embarrassing about that?

730
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,310
Gosh, crazy bitch, there are so many things to be embarrassed about, then.

731
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:25,780
 Let's grab dinner, Su Jae. It's been a while. 

732
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,810
Yes.

733
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,550
I emailed what you asked about.

734
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,620
I'll see you at the hamburger joint one of these days.

735
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,020
 I heard CEO Choi went to the States. 

736
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,520
 He probably went to the Bahamas. 

737
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,860
 I don't know what you're holding in your hands, 

738
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,210
 but they must know about it, too. 

739
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,350
 That you have it in your hand. 

740
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,270
How is the catch?

741
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,610
Please have a seat.

742
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:56,500
I prepared what you like already,

743
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,410
Attorney Oh.

744
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:03,360
After all, I've known you for about ten years now, Attorney Oh.

745
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,680
I'm supposed to meet the chairman.

746
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,210
I know.

747
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:10,050
Chairman Choi sent me here.

748
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:17,840
Chairman asked me to bring him the USB.

749
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:25,740
I so brazenly said I would get the USB for him.

750
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,890
When I went, someone else had taken it already.

751
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,900
To be precise, some other punks.

752
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,820
He should've pulled it off if he dragged Hong Seok Pal into it.

753
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,840
Anyway, that Choi Ju Wan.

754
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,690
He's clumsy no matter what he does.

755
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,890
Right?

756
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,430
How interesting.

757
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:48,990
I shouldn't have held back if I knew you'd spill everything so easily.

758
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,960
You lost the USB and were one step behind as a thief.

759
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,540
I thought, why bother someone who'd feel like dying?

760
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,300
So I didn't mind you.

761
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,140
Should I have minded you a little bit?

762
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,100
If I were you,

763
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:10,110
I wouldn't have worn my everyday shoes to commit a crime.

764
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,300
 You have beautiful kids. 

765
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:20,430
 Especially not the pair I had worn being a good dad in front of my kids. 

766
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,310
I'm sure your kids don't know.

767
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,090
The fact that their dad had stacked his uncle's money out slowly bit by bit.

768
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:38,870
In a hospital in New York, a Korean unwed mother gave birth to a child.

769
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:44,750
I heard the unwed mother had something going on with a very famous lawyer's son in Korea.

770
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,480
 Go to the US. 

771
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:53,910
I've set it up at the firm, so you're supposedly going to a training program there.

772
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,800
Why to the US...

773
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,430
If you go ahead, Ju Wan will follow you.

774
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:06,150
Have the baby there and you two could have an informal wedding.

775
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:12,810
You two met in the States on a training program, fell in love, and married.

776
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:16,210
Anyone would say it's a great story, no?

777
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:21,640
I wish for my daughter-in-law to be the star of a great story.

778
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,680
When you come back, I'll give you a proper wedding.

779
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,710
Okay.

780
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,150
You go on ahead.

781
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,280
I'll go as soon as I wrap up some work here.

782
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:02,090
 Chairman is at his oldest son's wedding at the moment. 

783
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:06,900
 But she had a stillbirth, and the man who was supposed to join her didn't come. 

784
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,030
 And that unwed mother even tried to kill herself. 

785
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,850
Was it about seven years ago?

786
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:18,770
I heard it from a reporter I knew when I was at the US branch and called Chairman Choi.

787
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:25,680
He told me to shut that reporter up so that CEO Choi isn't hit by the shit.

788
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,880
I spent pretty good money on drinks then.

789
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,030
Attorney Oh, the past is like a snake inside a jar.

790
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:40,520
Even if you put a lid on it, it keeps wanting to raise its head and sneak out.

791
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,650
When that happens, you've got to put two or three lids on top.

792
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:48,200
You can't try opening it to see if it's dead or alive. You can't.

793
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,870
The thing with 27 billion won is the same way.

794
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,810
Nothing good would come out of going through that stuff.

795
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,980
We should try to cover up for each other.

796
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,890
We live in a world where we should help each other.

797
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:03,890
That USB, please give it to Chairman Choi Tae Gook quickly.

798
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:07,130
Since when and why

799
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:12,490
did you start being loyal to Chairman Choi Tae gook rather than your uncle Chairman Han Seong Beom?

800
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,280
When I was

801
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,130
crawling under my uncle Han Seong Beom, who chased my father out like a dog,

802
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:26,790
Chairman Choi Tae Gook noticed me and helped me build my own cash stash.

803
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,610
How do you think I was able to take 27 billion won?

804
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,340
It's all thanks to Chairman Choi Tae Gook. I—

805
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,820
I'll be loyal to him to death.

806
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:40,160
I truly trust that gentleman.

807
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,490
Trust is connected to your flaws.

808
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:51,690
The trust that this person will not attack me even if I show him all of my flaws.

809
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,570
Is Chairman Choi that type of person to you, Chief Han?

810
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:59,040
On the contrary, do you think Chairman Choi thinks of you in that regard?

811
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,830
An incompetent moron who can't even bring him a USB?

812
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:07,680
The Chairman I know isn't likely to be that way.

813
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,550
In any case...

814
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,400
In any case, you and I

815
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,570
are both under his shadow all the same.

816
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:20,920
We're on the same side anyway. We can just let it slide.

817
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,690
Why did you have to take all my files and why show each other this part of ourselves?

818
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,220
Why?

819
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,220
Why?

820
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:43,160
Did you think that you could go up against me?

821
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,040
What good would it do to kill 100 minions in a battle?

822
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,000
You have to cut the throat of the commander.

823
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:56,320
You're just one of the minions to me.

824
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,250
Tell the chairman to come.

825
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,020
The main dish should be served after appetizers.

826
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,110
 Oh Su Jae 

827
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,090
 Su Jae? 

828
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:58,000
 Wh-Why d-did you do that to me? 

829
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,470
 I'm sorry to hear that you had a stillbirth. 

830
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,710
 You s-said if I s-stayed here 

831
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:08,900
 Ju Wan would come here. 

832
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,920
 That we would have the baby, and get m-married. 

833
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,480
 Wh-Why did you s-say that to me? 

834
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,610
 Su Jae, 

835
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:27,120
 a person should know when to feel ashamed and know his place. 

836
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,810
 You lacked both. 

837
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,730
 This isn't something you should be angry about. 

838
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:35,050
 Make a choice. 

839
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:42,250
 Either come back and work for me again or go and live off of trash. 

840
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,720
 ← Ward 505-510 
Ward 501-505→ 

841
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:56,770
 TK 

842
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:22,080
 Choi Tae Guk 

843
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,460
 The woman your son played around with and tossed aside. 

844
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:31,810
 For what the father of that son did to the woman, 

845
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,720
 I felt surging anger, but I still came back. 

846
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,390
 Good. You made the right choice. 

847
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:46,120
 My flaw is also your flaw, Chairman. 

848
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:52,860
 You and I are clenching onto each other's one flaw. 

849
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,600
 Please don't forget.&lt;/ 

850
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,850
 Choi Tae Guk 

851
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,830
 I'll raise you up. 

852
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:20,320
 The advancement, success, and power you've never tasted before. 

853
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,420
 I'll let you taste it. 

854
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,730
 No, Chairman. 

855
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:28,630
 I'll climb beyond that. 

856
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,480
 Until I swallow everything. 

857
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,980
Do you think I didn't know your intentions back then?

858
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:43,500
I thought, "I guess she'll struggle to climb up trying to eat up the entire TK."

859
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,880
"I guess I'll be raising a tiger cub."

860
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,150
I knew it, but...

861
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:52,340
I guess you couldn't help since we both hung onto each other's flaws.

862
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,800
That's not it!

863
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,990
I let you off.

864
01:01:56,990 --> 01:02:00,740
With a baby you made when my son made a mistake playing around one night,

865
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,920
your intention of trying to get something out of it.

866
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,720
I let you off.

867
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,090
What do you think of yourself, Su Jae?

868
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:15,330
Are you deluded and think you're in the same position as me?

869
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,690
Flaw?

870
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,410
I have no flaws.

871
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,160
I'm sure you have them, though.

872
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,000
I probably covered them up for you.

873
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,180
You who are powerless and helpless, without a place to turn for support.

874
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,390
To train a tiger cub to become a playful puppy,

875
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,530
I could probably do that much for you.

876
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:38,670
So, that's what you did.

877
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:43,590
You thought of me as a happy tail-wagging bitch.

878
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:48,300
That's why you used my name everywhere.

879
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:00,660
Do you know that your name is in that file, Professor?

880
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,790
The file on the USB.

881
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,370
The paper company that's set up in the Bahamas.

882
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,860
As the money was sent to that paper company,

883
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:12,050
the name on the foreign account used for money laundering.

884
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,460
Oh Su Jae.

885
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,580
 TK Law Firm, KOREA EXCHANGE BANK, Oh Su Jae  
 I wonder why you used my name.

886
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,520
The answer is obvious.

887
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,450
If any issues arose, I'd be the one to completely take the fall.

888
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:29,190
But I took that file.

889
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:34,850
Whether it be by Han Gi Taek or making your son do it, I'm sure you wanted it back.

890
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:39,110
The bomb that destroys everyone if it becomes known.

891
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:41,060
I'm sure you wanted to take it away.

892
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:44,450
Why do you keep spinning, beating around the bush? Just tell me what you want.

893
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,480
The cost of using my name.

894
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:51,900
The cost of using my name on that bomb without my permission.

895
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,730
- You don't like that, Chairman? 
- Permission?

896
01:03:55,730 --> 01:04:00,440
Did I ever have to ask someone for permission?

897
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,750
Fine. What should I give you?

898
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,650
You turned down the CEO position.

899
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,750
What is it you want?

900
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,950
Seventy billion won.

901
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:13,750
What?

902
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,480
Choose, Chairman.

903
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,910
Would you like to see me shit all over the big picture you're working hard on,

904
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:26,100
or would you hand over the entire commission of 70 billion won from the sale of Hansu Bio,

905
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,060
whole?

906
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:40,030
 Why Her? 

907
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:49,420


908
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:00,630
 The deal won't go through without Attorney Oh Su Jae? 

909
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,130
 He doesn't want to toss his hard work out the window. 

910
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:05,530
 You are making a good business deal going up against me. 

911
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,920
 I should've known sooner. I'm a little late. 

912
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,030
 She's so calm after making 70 billion won. 

913
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,450
 I actually missed you. 

914
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,650
 There's something I haven't told you yet. 

915
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:14,860
 Noona, do you like Chan? 

916
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,880
 Who the hell is this Gong Chan? 

917
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,280
 Just live quietly as Gong Chan. 

918
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,700
 Isn't that why you're deceiving Professor, too? 

919
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,100
 Don't you know who I am? 

920
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,050
 Where are you? Something's up, right? 

921
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:27,760
 Park So Yeong. What if I said I killed Park So Yeong?
