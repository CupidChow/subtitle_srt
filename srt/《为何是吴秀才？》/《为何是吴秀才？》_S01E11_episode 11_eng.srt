22
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,120
Try this.

23
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,770
Gosh, amazing!

24
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,270
You both have a crazy touch for making food.

25
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,730
Whoa! It's so yummy!

26
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,050

 Ji Soon Ok 

37
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,050
 Dong Gu, how could you hurt my Na Jeong... 

38
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,480
 How could you do that... 

39
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,460
 Why! 

40
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,410
 Get her! 

41
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,070
 - Why did you do it? 
 - Please sit down. 

42
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,110
 Get seated! 

43
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,490
 I have something to say. 

44
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,990
 In Yeongpyeong District... 

45
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,220
 No. Something urgent came up. I have to go. 

46
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,890
 Five minutes will do. 

47
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,020
 No, three minutes. 

48
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,090
 Let's talk at home later. 

49
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,780
Director.

50
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,700
 Jeon Na Jeong  
 Did you come to see this child? Jeon Na Jeong.

51
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,970
What brings you here...

52
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,280
I have a daughter.

53
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,990
She got into a big accident ten years ago.

54
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,960
 Are you okay? 

55
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,000
 Please let me borrow your phone. 

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,020
 My phone? 

57
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,230
 A girl named Jeon Na Jeong... 

58
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,850
 Put this on to warm up first. 

59
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,410
 I found out later that she helped my daughter. 

60
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,100
But she had already passed on from an all too unfortunate event.

61
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,780
I am heartbroken, thankful,

62
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,030
and also sorry.

63
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,710
So I come by at times to give my late regards.

64
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,720
But how do you know Jeon Na Jeong?

65
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,710
Later.

66
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,400
I will tell you later.

67
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,820
Sure. There will come a day.

68
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,380
 Jeon Na Jeong 

69
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,980
 Eventually, this is how we meet. 

70
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,420
Yes, Hyeong.

71
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,230
Are y-you with the professor?

72
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,230
No.

73
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,340
 I heard Professor went up to the rooftop to look for you. 

74
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,310
 So I came by and the rooftop room door is open. 

75
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,490
 You don't think Professor entered the rooftop room, do you? 

76
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,960
This is exactly why I told you to get rid of all that.

77
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,500
I told you to tell Professor that you're Kim Dong Gu, you punk!

78
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,160
 Prosecutor Seo Joon Myeong =&gt; Seojung University Law School Professor 

79
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,800
 Who is Seo Joon Myeong... 

80
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,140
 Are you okay? 

81
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,940
   
 Who is Chairman Choi Tae Gook... 

82
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,950
 I came here with high expectations since people say 

83
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,140
 TK Law Firm is all that, and all the lawyers aspire to work here. 

84
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,190
 I was here only for a short time but makes me wonder if this place is meant for people. 

85
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,660
 He already knew. 

86
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,740
 You are really cool, Professor. 

87
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,720
 You are not the culprit, Professor. 

88
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,380
 I have something I couldn't tell you as well. 

89
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,930
 I don't want you to find out, but 

90
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,450
 I still have to tell you. 

91
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,930
 The one who believed me until the end 

92
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,590
 Why couldn't I... 

93
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,860
 recognize you? 

94
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,350
 Welcome 

95
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,530
You remember this, right?

96
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,110
Na Jeong made four of the same ones and gave one to each of us.

97
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,330
Hey, I'm sure the police will do their work.

98
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,120
It's for them to look into these things that police exist.

99
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,960
Why are you the one getting ahead of yourself?

100
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,650
The police have all the information.

101
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,930
If we bring Ajumma to the station for an examination, this will end in a moment.

102
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,300
- We can check in a couple of days— 
 - I said no!

103
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,090
I don't want to.

104
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,900
Back when you changed your first name and abandoned your last name,

105
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,100
I couldn't say anything to you. Why?

106
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,700
Because I felt guilty about what I had done.

107
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,870
I told myself, let's just think I don't have a son.

108
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,550
I tried so hard to live that way.

109
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,300
Now you tell me to bring Na Jeong's mom to the police station?

110
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,350
Me?

111
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,700
No way. Don't want to.

112
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,930
I do not want to get involved with that woman.

113
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,720
Ajumma is going blind and having a hard time.

114
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,250
I am having a hard time, too.

115
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,970
Everyone living here is having a hard time.

116
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,550
This is her address.

117
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,960
Get your hands off of this matter. Please!

118
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,090
You've had enough of that incident ruining your life.

119
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,820
Forget everything, bury it all, and just live on, man.

120
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,170
Don't tell anyone that you're Kim Dong Gu.

121
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,870
And even when you meet a woman you like later, don't even mention it.

122
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,180
Just go on like that.

123
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,250
I will go on like that as well.

124
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,950
Go now.

125
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,980
Dad.

126
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,380
Don't let me know even if you change your number from now on.

127
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:12,320
I keep coming to you because I know your number.

128
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,020
Forgetting the kind of a person you are.

129
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,810
I...

130
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,920
You should go.

131
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,720
 Late-night Food  
 Oh, my, take some herbal medicine. Don't just drink alcohol.

132
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,720
Did something happen?

133
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,690
She's been sitting like that for an hour.

134
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,140
I'll take care of her.

135
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,300
What are you doing drinking without ordering any food?

136
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,230
Gosh, girl. You've got to

137
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,730
have the food ordered so I can eat as I drink.

138
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,640
Joon Hui.

139
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,340
Yeah.

140
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,310
My heart...

141
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,620
keeps going back and forth,

142
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,620
- you know? 
 - Why?

143
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,780
What's the matter?

144
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,950
Should I tell him everything and end it...

145
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,310
or turn a blind eye and sit back?

146
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,630
Kim Dong Gu.

147
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,090
Kim Dong Gu?

148
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,180
 Police Investigating Bones Found in Yeongpyeong District 

149
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,130
 Police Investigating Bones Found in Yeongpyeong District 

150
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,450
He's drunk.

151
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,080
Seriously...

152
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,360
Are you freaking blind?

153
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,530
I apologize.

154
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,330
Hey.

155
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,760
You think bowing is enough?

156
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,730
You've got to say, "I'm so sorry."

157
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,570
"I will never do that again!"

158
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,120
"I have committed a great wrong!"

159
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,930
You should be begging.

160
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,120
What big wrong did I commit?

161
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
This bastard!

162
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,170
Bastard.

163
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,460
- That bastard... 
 - Are you okay?

164
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,090
 Forget everything, bury it all, 

165
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,020
 and just live on, man. 

166
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,600
 Never say that you were Kim Dong Gu, anywhere. 

167
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,050
 And even when you meet a woman you like later, 

168
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,400
 don't even mention it. 

169
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,040
 Just go on like that. 

170
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,900
How can I do that?

171
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,220
How?

172
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,840
How can I do that? How can I do that?

173
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,580
Hey, hey, hey. Hurry and run!

174
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,410
 Doctor's opinion 

175
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,230
We made it so that Managing Director Han Dong Oh had received treatment for panic disorder.

176
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,920
And it's been arranged so that

177
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,010
he was driving under the side effects of his prescription drugs, not a DUI.

178
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,960
The door is open.

179
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,740
He's coming out.

180
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,990
Wasn't it a DUI?

181
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,310
What was the cause of the accident?

182
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,730
Is it situationally justified?

183
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,870
Tell the truth!

184
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,010
I apologize for causing controversy.

185
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,430
Are you admitting to it?

186
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,710
Please say a word.

187
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,720
The investigation regarding those bones.

188
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
It is going to take about a month for them

189
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,630
to cross-check with the police DNA database.

190
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,520
I will make sure to settle everything

191
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,200
as soon and quietly as possible by then.

192
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,540
Aigoo. Well...

193
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,430
Coffins and bones turning up at construction sites.

194
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,650
That's nothing new.

195
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,410
But the one that came out of a sack is giving me bad vibes.

196
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,410
I have notified the chief of police and

197
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,240
Police Chief Kang will be on the move.

198
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,660
Well done.

199
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,350
A sack... geez!

200
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,220
Thank you for sparing your precious time to be here. You must be so busy.

201
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,620
Please, take a seat.

202
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,460
As we all know,

203
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,120
Myeongmun Daily's power either makes or breaks every election.

204
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,170
Those weary citizens are

205
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,030
sure to trust and follow Seoul Research's public opinion data blindly.

206
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,570
Dragging down a president

207
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,360
and making a president.

208
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,670
That's Myeongmun's power.

209
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,150
According to Chairman Choi Tae Gook,

210
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,270
Assemblyman Lee In Su aims to hold the presidency for two years.

211
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,620
Once the 2024 elections begin,

212
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,420
they're going to create a parliamentary system

213
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,630
which means entrusting the domestic administration to the prime minister.

214
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,690
These are groundbreaking policies.

215
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,100
It's clear as day that Assemblyman's approval rating will go up.

216
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,370
As expected, you're the brain. Brain.

217
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,430
Let's take a shot.

218
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,410
Me, too.

219
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,920
♫  I will fall down  ♫

220
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:28,260
♫  Lost your head in a twinkle  ♫

221
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,550
Your face...

222
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,560
I...

223
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,730
I will speak first.

224
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,600
♫  Found another way  ♫

225
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,100
I don't want to hear any of it.

226
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,360
Until I say okay,

227
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,780
don't say anything to me.

228
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,020
 She knows. 

229
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,190
Any word.

230
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,780
♫  Just tell me how to get through this  ♫

231
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,350
♫  It's necessary so we 

232
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,490
And this... 
 ♫  can hold our hands again   ♫

233
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,370
♫  Again  ♫

234
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,700
I'll give it back to you.

235
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,040
Why are you giving it back?

236
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,230
♫  And your eyes showed me the way  ♫

237
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,150
♫  Your breath it makes me invincible  ♫

238
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,050
♫  You don't have to be afraid  ♫

239
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,690
 She knows 
 ♫  Cause I’ll never  ♫

240
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,110
 who I am. 
 ♫  Cause I’ll never  ♫

241
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,580
♫  ever leave you  alone  ♫

242
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,800
♫  Again  ♫

243
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,740
♫  Again  ♫

244
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,200
♫  I'm here  ♫

245
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,170
 How would it have been if I'd told her 

246
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,250
 I am Kim Dong Gu from the beginning? 

247
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,520
Chairman.

248
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,180
Chairman?

249
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,960
Yeah.

250
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,300
Are we here?

251
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,380
There is something I need to tell you, Sir.

252
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,720
 What are you talking about? 

253
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,650
 How could you... 

254
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,210
 I can't believe what you're telling me! 

255
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,170
 I am very sorry, Chairman. 

256
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,150
Hey.

257
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,290
 - Just take care of it. Got it?  
 - What do you think you are doing?

258
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,100
Why are you eavesdropping like a rat?

259
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,630
I just heard Father breaking something.

260
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,270
Crazy bastard.

261
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,000
Is something wrong?

262
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,690
 Seojung University Law School, Director Baek Jin Gi, next Minister of Justice candidate 

263
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,260
Professor.

264
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,450
Hello.

265
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,930
Here you go.

266
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,380
So, where did Chan go so early in the morning?

267
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,960
I don't think I saw him leave.

268
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,430
I thought you came home quite late last night, Professor.

269
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,920
Were you very busy?

270
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,870
Thank you, but I don't think I can eat because my stomach isn't feeling well.

271
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,290
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,000
Pardon me.

273
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,250
Ah... I see.

274
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,700
Something feels off, Hyeong.

275
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,480
I think she saw the rooftop room.

276
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,790
When did Chan come in and leave?

277
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,870
I don't know.

278
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,010
I didn't even know he came home.

279
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,310
Should I call Chan?

280
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,080
He's not answering. I already called him like ten times.

281
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,910
Gosh. Poor guy.

282
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,670
Where the heck did he go?

283
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,480
Long time no see.

284
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,850
 Advanced Correction  
 What?

285
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,790
Did you miss me?

286
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,590
You killed my sister.

287
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,210
Man, you didn't believe me back then,

288
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,070
and insisted that I didn't kill her.

289
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,520
Now you accept it?

290
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,900
Yeah.

291
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,190
You did kill her.

292
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,990
What are you going to do now?

293
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,440
I became eligible for parole.

294
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,510
Does it turn your insides out?

295
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,400
You want to kill me, don't you?

296
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,410
Hey!

297
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,980
Nothing matters.

298
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,360
This country is willing to forgive me.

299
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,540
This country.

300
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,200
Why did you kill my sister?

301
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,200
No reason.

302
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,610
I was just really bored.

303
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,140
Why did you throw the body into the ocean?

304
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,530
When you're hiding bodies, the ocean is the best place.

305
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,720
The ocean where I threw her body

306
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,160
has the craziest current.

307
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,500
The ocean will take the body further out on its own.

308
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,180
You don't even have to tie something heavy when you toss it into the ocean.

309
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,210
No need to wrap the body up.

310
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,710
Is that why...

311
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,500
you threw my sister's body into the ocean?

312
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,350
Without tying weights, or wrapping her up? You just tossed her?

313
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,760
Of course.

314
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,930
The ocean takes the body

315
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,870
and gets rid of it.

316
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,810
It's definitely not you.

317
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,670
Make sure to come out on parole.

318
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,440
I'll be waiting.

319
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,510
 Choon Poong 

320
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,140
- Yeah. 
  - Hey! 

321
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,160
 You cut class and don't even answer your phone. You want to die?  

322
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,480
They're here. Ms. Ji Soon Ok and her friends.

323
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,800
They brought rice cakes for us, too.

324
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,150
She's looking for you.

325
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,640
She feels bad about the last time and wants to apologize.

326
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,510
Ma'am, Chan said he would be here soon.

327
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,910
You just need to wait a little.

328
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,020
Hurry up, okay?

329
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,470
It's good. Really good.

330
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,600
How can the police suddenly change their attitude,

331
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,990
saying that they'll help and all?

332
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,210
Yeah. Attorney Song Mi Rim.

333
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,310
Our team's lawyer really went out of her way to help us out.

334
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,700
As expected of Attorney Song.

335
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,410
So will the cosmetic company owner give the money back?

336
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,130
That's the most important part.

337
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,190
The police promised us that they'll definitely get our money back

338
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,900
and said that will be their top priority.

339
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm so glad.

340
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,410
It's not much, but

341
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,230
these are socks we produce at the factory.

342
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,010
I wanted to give them to you.

343
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,840
I really want to apologize to that student.

344
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,240
Because I'm so sorry and grateful.

345
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,950
Chan is on the way. Don't worry.

346
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,410
Okay.

347
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,550
 Su Jae, it's crazy right now. 

348
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,490
 The bereaved family and the families of the injured workers 

349
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,910
are posting on SNS and talking to the reporters,

350
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,410
protesting in front of the hospital.

351
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,490
Where are you right now?

352
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,150
Hurry up and come, Su Jae.

353
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,500
I'm almost there. Bye.

354
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,170
 Bring them back to life! Bring them back to life! 

355
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,310
 Hansu Construction should apologize! 

356
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,930
 Apologize, apologize! 

357
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,880
It's that man.

358
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,740
The representative for the victims' families.

359
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,890
   
 Bring them back to life! Bring them back to life! 

360
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,520
 Murderer 
 Apologize Now! Chairman Han Seong Beom! 

361
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,820
What brings you here?

362
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,320
Chairman Choi ordered me to serve you well, Attorney Oh.

363
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,590
It is my role as a TK Law Firm Intern.

364
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,940
What about school? Don't you need to study?

365
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,720
Thanks to the internship verification,

366
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,450
there are some classes I can replace with writing reports.

367
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,980
So it's okay.

368
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,340
 Collapsing Accident Victims' Consolidation 
 Rest in Peace and Ease into Nirvana 

369
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,780
- Get out of here! 
 - Hey! Get out!

370
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,170
 Get out! Who are you to come here? 

371
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,140
- You! 
 - Get out!

372
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,480
You didn't even show up for the first two days.

373
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,370
What show are you trying to put on now?

374
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,520
Get lost!

375
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,650
 Get out! 

376
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,260
I am Attorney Oh Su Jae of Hansu Construction.

377
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,290
We tried to contact you all this time, but I was told that you declined to meet with me.

378
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,210
However, delaying much longer would not be proper

379
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,720
and I also wanted to hear the stories of the remaining family members.

380
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,830
Proper?

381
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,370
Listen to our stories?

382
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:40,800
After killing people and injuring them,

383
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,710
and putting them in comas?

384
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,360
Get out!

385
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,270
- Who are you? 
 - Get out of the way!

386
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,760
Please calm down and talk it out.

387
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,110
- Who do you think you are? 
 - Who are you?

388
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,570
You think you can tell us what to do?

389
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,220
Show at least the minimum amount of respect.

390
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,000
Choi Yoon Sang!

391
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,240
Hello, Chairman!

392
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,660
I can't even imagine how heartbroken...

393
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,530
Chairman, please meet the families first...

394
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,490
How heartbroken you must be.

395
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,100
I will wait however long it takes for you to be pacified.

396
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,790
If I can provide even the slightest bit of consolation,

397
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,090
I will try in any shape or form—

398
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,330
You!

399
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,980
- I'm sorry. 
 - Hey!

400
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,400
You.

401
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,210
Hey, what is she doing?

402
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,870
 What is she doing? 

403
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,160
Hey! You!

404
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,950
What is this woman doing?

405
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,410
 - What are you doing? 
 - Please, hold back. 

406
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,280
 Let him go. 

407
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,500
 I can't breathe. 

408
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,170
 Get her off of him! Get out! 

409
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,770
What do you think you're doing?

410
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,190
Those people were becoming aggressive

411
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,850
toward you, Noon— I mean, Attorney Oh.

412
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,940
You think Mi Rim was staying still because she didn't know that?

413
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,890
It's the rule to never protect her in those situations.

414
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,890
I thought you were going to get hurt.

415
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,000
That was why I did what I did.

416
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,270
Go to the police station and check on the Yeongpyeong District investigation progress.

417
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,500
Don't forget to bring this fool with you.

418
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,580
It was delicious.

419
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,750
- Really? 
 - Yes, thank you.

420
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,490
Thank you for enjoying it.

421
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,100
Noona.

422
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,530
Chan.

423
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,520
Ma'am, Chan is here.

424
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,830
Oh, student!

425
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:41,600
I apologize for confusing your voice with someone else that I know.

426
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,320
- Noona, let me have a brief word with her. 
 - Sure.

427
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,140
Okay then.

428
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,630
I'm sorry again.

429
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,180
I always get confused and make mistakes when I meet

430
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,770
someone with a similar voice.

431
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,010
Ajumma,

432
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,130
I think I found Na Jeong, Ajumma...

433
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,670
Na Jeong's bones have been discovered.

434
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,000
Let's go to the police station together.

435
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,400
What do you mean, bones?

436
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,980
What do you...

437
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,210
Let's go to the police station.

438
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,690
We need to go and get some exams done.

439
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,340
Why are you like this?

440
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,750
You're not Kim Dong Gu, Student.

441
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,140
You're not Kim Dong Gu!

442
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,560
I am Kim Dong Gu, Ajumma.

443
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,730
I'm... Kim Dong Gu.

444
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,590
No.

445
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,210
My Na Jeong is alive.

446
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,360
No...

447
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,820
Oh, my. Ma'am.

448
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,670
- Ma'am. 
 - My Na Jeong...

449
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,990
- No! 
 - What in the world...

450
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,000
No! It's not!

451
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,390
My child is alive!

452
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,950
No...

453
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,580
I said, it's not! No!

454
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,460
Please calm down.

455
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,680
- Ma'am... 
 - No! She's alive!

456
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:14,600
Don't you think Ms. Ji Soon Ok is mentally unstable?

457
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,550
She said she wanted to apologize to Chan,

458
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,590
but she went and did that again.

459
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,950
Exactly. She does that whenever she sees Chan.

460
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,560
 I am Kim Dong Gu, Ajumma. 

461
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:32,560
 I... am Kim Dong Gu. 

462
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,720
If Chan is Kim Dong Gu...

463
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,780
- What? 
 - Why say something like that, Eonni?

464
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,800
Isn't it the same as supposing that Na Se Ryeon is Jo Kang Ja?

465
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,710
That makes no sense at all.

466
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,260
Not at all.

467
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,430
Kim Dong Gu could have just changed his name to Gong Chan.

468
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,190
Change names?

469
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,400
 Chairman Han Seong Beom of Hansu Group, who visited the joint memorial altar 

470
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,510
 for the Yeongpyeong District Construction Site, 

471
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,820
 has been hospitalized due to the violent acts of the bereaved families. 

472
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,140
 He is receiving thorough medical exams for trauma 

473
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,350
 caused by the worked-up families' one-sided physical assault. 

474
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,020
 Chairman Han Seong Beom had his collar grabbed—   

475
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,770
I apologize, Chairman. I should have protected you until the end.

476
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,190
But my slipped disc worsened at the moment.

477
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,460
I'm sorry.

478
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,910
I couldn't even imagine that those people would lose control like that.

479
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,880
Gosh, you fools.

480
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,110
I was intently waiting for someone to grab me by the collar.

481
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:22,460
That woman took my bait just in time.

482
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,320
Attorney Oh definitely knows how to paint the bigger picture.

483
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,100
You are definitely the best.

484
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,550
Awesome Su Jae!

485
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,650
Today's incident may earn you some sympathy votes for now,

486
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,870
but the winds may turn as soon as we act against the demands of the victims' families

487
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,120
and also negatively affect the sale of Hansu Bio.

488
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,810
"I sincerely understand corporate responsibilities.

489
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,560
I promise the maximum compensation."

490
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,110
These two statements are the key points.

491
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,630
I'll make the arrangements accordingly.

492
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,870
Sure, sure.

493
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,470
Whether it be compensation or consolation money, be generous about it

494
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,160
and just keep them from being noisy.

495
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,370
It's Chairman Choi.

496
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,650
Yes, Chairman Choi.

497
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,960
Yes.

498
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,920
Did you watch the news?

499
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,200
You are telling me to sign this and shut up, right?

500
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,700
Isn't that right?

501
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,590
Read it first. The conditions aren't bad.

502
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,010
Other people have already signed the agreements.

503
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,370
Well, I won't sign.

504
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,840
You really think some chump change will make me sign when my son

505
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,170
hasn't even regained consciousness?

506
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,310
Look.

507
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,230
Look at the amount.

508
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,880
 300 million won 

509
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,120
You still think this is chump change after looking at it?

510
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,220
You can't earn this much in your lifetime.

511
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,550
- Am I wrong? 
 - Hey!

512
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,230
Your son, Oh Pil Seung, practically lived on the construction site.

513
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,810
He practically lived there to receive overtime pay.

514
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:02,380
The best thing you can do for your son now is to take this money and live tenaciously.

515
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,150
Sign the agreement and take the payment.

516
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,160
This is the most amount of money I can get you.

517
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,360
I really hate this.

518
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,230
Really hate it.

519
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,740
I am so sick and tired... of money.

520
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,670
Take it even if it disgusts you.

521
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,190
Take care of it even if you hate to do so.

522
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,640
You've suffered enough, raising him by yourself.

523
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,410
How did you know?

524
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,230
Oh Pil Seung, the son of Oh Su Jeong.

525
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,920
You named him well.

526
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,380
So cool.

527
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,770
My Pil Seung...

528
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,280
He will wake up, right?

529
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,510
Of course, he will.

530
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:15,670
His mom, who grabbed and shook Hansu Group's chairman by the neck, is waiting for him.

531
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,080
He has to wake up.

532
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,660
You're so annoying, Oh Jae Su.

533
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,470
 Seojung University Hospital 

534
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,120
Thanks.

535
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,900
 Call 

536
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,010
 Gong Chan 

537
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,340
Get in for a second, Su Jae.

538
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,810
 Presidential candidate, Assemblyman Lee In Su of Everyone for the Future Party, 

539
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,350
 has announced a promise to enforce the parliamentary system. 

540
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,830
 Everyone for the Future Party, together with Assemblyman Lee In Su 

541
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,740
 promise to enforce the parliamentary system after two years of presidency. 

542
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,340
 We will promote constitutional amendments upon his taking office. 

543
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,860
 We will disperse the huge centralized power of a president. 

544
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,310
   
 According to the polls, the stagnant approval ratings 

545
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,900
 suddenly rose more than eight percent. 

546
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,290
 The experts say that he solidified 

547
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,860
 his winning position with groundbreaking election pledges. 

548
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,870
Yes, Assemblyman, congratulations.

549
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,960
The approval rating finally broke through the box zone.

550
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,730
As groundbreaking as they are, they had to be kept top secret.

551
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,620
I told you, didn't I?

552
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,070
- I will definitely make you the presiden... 
  - Look, Chairman Choi. 

553
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,680
This is your plan, not mine.

554
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,770
Election pledges unknown to me getting announced as mine,

555
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,300
and polls about those pledges

556
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,100
making the news right after.

557
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,800
 Listen to me, Chairman Choi. 

558
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,820
 Don't you think you are crossing the line too much? 

559
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,670
You seriously think that just to be a merely two-year president,

560
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,120
I supported you

561
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,920
and supported Yeongpyeong District?

562
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,990
Well, although the investigations are going on here and there

563
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,540
because of the Yeongpyeong District incident,

564
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,250
the dividend payouts due to your family are constructed not to surface.

565
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,200
So, you don't need to worry.

566
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,400
Hey, Chairman Choi.

567
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,310
If Chairman Han finds out about you doing thi...

568
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,350
What do you mean?

569
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,910
So... Chairman Han knew about it already as well?

570
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,470
Sir, you must depart now.

571
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,980
Approval ratings will soon rise even more.

572
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,500
I am here working behind the scenes for you.

573
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,470
I said, okay.

574
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,900
Assemblyman Lee In Su is here! 
 Chicken and Beer with Assemblyman Lee In Su 

575
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,840
Assemblyman Lee!

576
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,310
Lee In Su!

577
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,400
Lee In Su! President!

578
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,900
- Yes, yes, yes. 
 - Lee In Su! President!

579
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,500
Okay, everyone, have a seat now, please.

580
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,660
- Thank you, thank you. 
  - President! 

581
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,480
Let us sit down.

582
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,070
Making Assemblyman Lee president was for your own good.

583
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,340
Yes.

584
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:09,380
I never have, not even once done all that work for Assemblyman Lee.

585
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,450
Everything was for my own good.

586
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,630
Since you now have Chairman Han's power too,

587
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,400
you are sure to make some great dreams come true.

588
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,020
Hurry up on selling off Hansu Bio, and marry Ju Wan.

589
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,390
Seung Yeon agreed to the divorce settlement and will leave soon.

590
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:36,370
Working for me will be for your own good.

591
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:41,530
There are so many things I can do for you if you become one of my people.

592
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,570
You can look forward to it.

593
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,220
I'll make myself clear now.

594
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,570
Unfortunately, I do not see CEO Choi Ju Wan as a human being.

595
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,620
I've also never worked for someone else's good.

596
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,590
It was always for my own good.

597
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:36,360
So I'll never become someone's person.

598
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,200
Whomever that may be.

599
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,730
Is there anything you can do?

600
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,600
Detective, just this once, please.

601
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,640
You're driving me nuts.

602
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,110
You should compare them right now.

603
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:06,700
So why should the remains' DNA and this hair DNA be compared?

604
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,930
You need to first identify yourself and the hair's owner.

605
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,900
I'll tell you when the results come out.

606
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,090
- First, take this an... 
 - What are you? A YouTuber?

607
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,510
Are you trying to get views?

608
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,040
Wait, aren't you filming this on a hidden camera or something?

609
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,260
It's nothing like that.

610
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,080
If your secretly shot videos go live, I'm going to throw you into the cell.

611
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,390
Just accept this, please.

612
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,570
This bastard!

613
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:31,410
I've been trying to hold back my temper.

614
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,350
Thank you. Please let us know as soon as it comes out.

615
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,480
This is my sister.

616
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,300
The Yeongpyeong District remains.

617
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,810
That is my sister, Jeon Na Jeong!

618
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,340
- Hey, hey! 
 - Hurry and investigate!

619
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,290
What the hell are you doing?

620
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,800
Your sister? The remains?

621
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,950
Sister?

622
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,580
What is it? Is it your sister or not?

623
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,990
Hey.

624
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,620
Hey!

625
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,680
 Forget everything, bury it all, just live on, man. 

626
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,570
 Never say that you are Kim Dong Gu, anywhere. 

627
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,400
 And even when you meet a woman you like later, don't even mention it. 

628
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,770
 Just go on like that. 

629
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,120
 I will go on like that as well. 

630
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:06,710
Are you sure that young man said that it was his sister?

631
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,530
Send me the CCTV footage.

632
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:50,560
 Attorney Oh, Choon Poong called earlier and said there was a commotion when Ji Soon Ok visited. 

633
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,220
 Chan apparently told Ji Soon Ok that he is Kim Dong Gu. 

634
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:00,480
 Ji Soon Ok got mad because of that and said things like, "You are not Kim Dong Gu," 

635
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,940
 "Na Jeong is not dead," and went home. 

636
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,730
 I was confused by this as well, 

637
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,080
 but Chan told the detective at the police station 

638
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,740
 "The Yeongpyeong District remains are my younger sister, Jeon Na Jeong." 

639
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,290
 I have something I couldn't tell you as well. 

640
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,850
 I don't want to be found out, but I still have to tell you. 

641
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,630
 I know that I have to tell you, 

642
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,700
 but I still hesitate a lot. 

643
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:46,270
 I'll tell you for sure, but you'll hate me for sure. 

644
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,410
 Even so, stay by my side. 

645
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:53,940
 You can hate me so don't go elsewhere. 

646
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,580
 Attorney Oh Su Jae 

647
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,740
Yes.

648
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,450
I'm here.

649
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:43,600
I'll go there.

650
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,730
 Listen from there. 

651
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,650
I heard from Mi Rim.

652
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:56,780
Are you thinking that the Yeongpyeong District remains are Jeon Na Jeong's?

653
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,950
I apologize...

654
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:05,500
for not telling you that I am Kim Dong Gu, and failing to tell you sooner.

655
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,940
I should've told you.

656
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,740
 I liked the fact that you didn't recognize me. 

657
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:18,190
I liked the fact that you didn't see me as Kim Dong Gu, but as Gong Chan.

658
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,220
I liked that you saw me as Gong Chan.

659
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,780
Why do you think the remains are Jeon Na Jeong's?

660
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,700
 How much does Ji Soon Ok know? 

661
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,020
Are you not listening to what I'm saying?

662
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:37,330
How would it have been if I told you sooner?

663
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,210
I am so regretful and sorry.

664
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:43,040
I really wasn't trying to deceive you.

665
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,070
- Not deceiving yo—
  - You did deceive me. 

666
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:52,160
You deceived me, Kim Dong Gu.

667
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,190
If you believe that the remains are your sister's,

668
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,300
hurry and take Ji Soon Ok to the police station.

669
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,820
 Or give information to the police if that's too difficult. 

670
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,170
 Don't move rashly out of anxiousness. 

671
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,400
That incident ten years ago can't be compared to how you feel

672
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,150
but is also something I want to forget.

673
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,600
S-Something...

674
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,250
Something you want to forget?

675
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:27,080
In all of my career as a lawyer, it was the most humiliating defeat.

676
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,400
You believed that I wasn't the culprit.

677
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,100
Although we lost, you pleaded not guilty,

678
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:38,020
and I was eventually found innocent.

679
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:43,940
You don't believe that the guy behind bars right now is the culprit.

680
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,010
 What's the use of changing your name? 

681
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,520
 While trapped in the incident ten years ago, 

682
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,890
 you're living a lie deceiving everyone else. 

683
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:58,690
Not even believing that No Byeong Chool is the real culprit.

684
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,500
No Byeong Chool

685
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,180
is not the true culprit.

686
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,800
On what basis?

687
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,310
Do you have proof?

688
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,830
Something substantial in your grasp?

689
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,420
There are things that I heard for sure.

690
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,180
About No Byeong Chool.

691
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,940
That's not proof.

692
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,780
- But— 
  - If you went as far as to change your name, 

693
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,720
you should leave that incident behind.

694
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,930
You're still immersed in it.

695
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,080
If I hand known that you were Kim Dong Gu,

696
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:35,090
I wouldn't have had mistaken feelings for you.

697
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,270
A mistake?

698
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,140
Yes, a mistake.

699
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,170
I was mistaken briefly.

700
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,360
 That I like someone who I don't even know. 

701
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,230
So it basically didn't mean anything.

702
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,360
 Wait. 

703
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:03,660
I wanted to live as a decent person.

704
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:07,170
Not someone who lives with

705
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,320
fingers pointed at him, even after being found innocent.

706
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,100
Not as someone who hangs his whole past life around him everywhere.

707
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,400
Not that kind of life.

708
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,210
That's why I changed my name.

709
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,890
 You're right. 

710
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:29,760
If I had told you that I'm Kim Dong Gu,

711
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,350
we wouldn't have even been able to come this far.

712
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,980
That's true.

713
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,530
See?

714
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,580
That's what it meant for me to be Kim Dong Gu.

715
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,870
 Even my feelings for you. 

716
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:55,090
They're possible as Gong Chan, but never as Kim Dong Gu.

717
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,020
That's what it means.

718
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:02,350
That's why I didn't want to tell you and wanted to delay it as much as possible.

719
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,210
Even hide it forever, if possible.

720
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:10,340
Not being able to tell you sooner

721
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,600
all those things,

722
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,740
made me feel guilty.

723
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,560
Looks like I won't have to.

724
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,230
Since you confirmed that for me just now.

725
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,760
That's right.

726
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,750
I told you...

727
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,900
that there will come a time when you'll hate me.

728
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,750
- But don't go anywhere and— 
 - No.

729
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,560
This much.

730
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,870
Just this much.

731
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,870
Keep your distance.

732
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,660
 Yongju City Step-sibling Homicide Investigation Report 

733
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,430
 Victim's information... 

734
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,930
 Confession of the Facts of Suspected Crime 

735
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,950
 National Institute for Forensic Investigation 

736
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,760
 Ungju Case of Half-sibling Murder' Kim Dong Gu "Innocent" 

737
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,350
You...

738
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,240
Why did you deceive Noona?

739
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,770
Kim Dong Gu.

740
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:44,910
 Ungju Case of Half-sibling Murder' Kim Dong Gu "Innocent" 

741
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:14,740
 You deceived me, Kim Dong Gu. 

742
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,940
 If I had known that you were Kim Dong Gu, 

743
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,720
 I wouldn't have been mistaken to think that I like you. 

744
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:26,050
 Saying that I like someone that I don't even know. 

745
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,980
 So basically it meant nothing. 

746
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,440
 I was at the beach when I opened my eyes. 

747
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,720
 A knife was dnearby. 

748
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,200
 Na Jeong's clothes. 

749
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,180
 Blood on the clothes. 

750
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:01,530
 I'm not sure why I was at the beach. 

751
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:05,580
 When I found Na Jeong at that Samjoong-dong construction site... 

752
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,470
 I yelled for help... 

753
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,910
 Na Jeong! 

754
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,920
 Someone, please help... 

755
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,650
 I just remember being struck hard. 

756
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,630
 The amount of blood on Na Jung's clothes 

757
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,600
 is enough to deduce the cause of death. 

758
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,530
 That's what the prosecution will claim. 

759
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:33,510
 That you killed Na Jeong 

760
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:37,410
 and also got rid of the corpse. 

761
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,400
 She's not dead. 

762
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,500
 She was alive when I held her in my arms, for sure. 

763
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,830
 Her body was warm, and I heard her breathe. 

764
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,450
 We need to find her. 

765
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,640
 We need to find Na Jeong as soon as possible. 

766
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,680
 All of the NFS results say that Kim Dong Gu is the culprit. 

767
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,950
 What else are you looking for? 

768
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,950
 It says that they found two other fingerprints on the knife. 

769
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:02,710
 One of them is from the police officer that came to the scene, 

770
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:07,000
 and the other is from the citizen who first came across the scene. 

771
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,870
 Right? 

772
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:09,190
 Huh? Oh, yes. 

773
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,840
 He's right. 

774
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,500
 I am the one who called the police. 

775
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,820
 Gosh, I absolutely freaked out. 

776
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,400
 Did you happen to see the knife at the scene? 

777
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,610
 A knife? 

778
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,640
 How could I see that? 

779
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,080
 My mind was going off the rails. 

780
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,840
 The news reported that they found a knife, 

781
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,080
 blood-stained clothes, 

782
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,200
 and all that stuff. 

783
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,310
 Thank you. 

784
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,450
 There's a possibility that he's not guilty. 

785
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:46,430
 I can also prove that the evidence regarding the weapon 

786
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,660
 found at the scene has a loophole. 

787
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:54,170
 The answer is that Kim Dong G is not guilty. 

788
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,950
 Is that worth it? 

789
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:01,130
 Let it take its natural course. 

790
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:05,220
 Inspector General Choi Tae Gook will retire as soon as this case is closed. 

791
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,160
 And then he'll open up a law firm after. 

792
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,840
 Let things take their course and close out. 

793
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,190
 Then move to that law firm. 

794
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:19,400
 So you're telling me to abandon my client? 

795
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:24,980
 Give up pleading not guilty and prepare a false defense? 

796
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,520
 False defense? 

797
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,860
 Am I someone who orders my own student to prepare a false defense? 

798
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,660
 Kim Dong Gu is obviously the culprit. 

799
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:39,860
 All the evidence and circumstances point to Kim Dong Gu without fail. 

800
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,210
 Why are you needlessly questioning that? 

801
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,270
 Did I teach you to do that? 

802
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:49,870
 You taught in your first class that we do not send our clients to jail. 

803
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,840
 Kim Dong Gu may not be guilty. 

804
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,030
 Are you telling me to turn a blind eye to that possibility? 

805
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:02,960
 Did you know that your brothers and your mother 

806
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,630
 were arrested for fraud again? 

807
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:11,750
 That possibility you are talking about is less than 0.1%. 

808
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:16,640
 Don't waste your life on a worthless possibility. 

809
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:21,050
 Let it take its course. 

810
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,430
 Your Honor, there were three different fingerprints on the knife. 

811
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:33,130
 Kim Dong Gu's fingerprints were found, 

812
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:35,920
 - but the other two people also need to be identi— 
 - Your Honor. 

813
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,670
 one of the other two fingerprints was from the cop who arrived at the scene. 

814
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:44,050
 The remaining one was from the eyewitness who discovered Kim Dong Gu at the scene, 

815
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,800
 and we have his testimony that he held the knife. 

816
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,220
 It's only a testimony. 

817
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,880
 It was not investigated thoroughly. 

818
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,260
 Your Honor, we must take measures 

819
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,410
 to confirm that the mysterious fingerprint belongs to the eyewitness. 

820
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:59,920
 That doesn't seem important, counsel. 

821
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,980
 What matters is that the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife, does it not? 

822
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,320
 That's right, Your Honor. 

823
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,290
 The defendant admitted to his criminal activity 

824
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:10,380
 and his DNA and fingerprints were found on the knife. 

825
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,910
 Other findings are not important. 

826
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,880
 It doesn't matter whether the unidentified fingerprint belongs to the eyewitness. 

827
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,470
 To be blunt, even if my fingerprints were found on the knife, 

828
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,450
 or if the counsel's were found, 

829
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,870
 or even if the judge's were found. 

830
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:28,320
 It simply doesn't matter. 

831
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,780
 Judge 

832
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,270
 What is it this time? 

833
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,380
 No, Su Jae. 

834
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,800
 I wouldn't scam other people. 

835
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,570
 I didn't do it. 

836
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:57,440
 That's true, Su Jae. It really isn't us. 

837
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,190
 We're the ones that got framed. 

838
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,500
 You'll get us out, right, Su Jae? 

839
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,780
 Right? 

840
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:06,500
 You're getting us out, right? 

841
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:12,560
 Counsel, 

842
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,980
 do you have anything more to say or provide? 

843
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,830
 Your Honor, 

844
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:29,440
 the counsel's attitude just seems as though she's trying to delay the trial. 

845
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,940
 Counsel. 

846
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,730
 Nothing else, sir. 

847
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:02,340
 Witness allegation overturn (Perjury possible) 
Secure witness' fingerprint: important! 

848
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,460
 I... 

849
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,790
 abandoned... 

850
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:22,970
 Kim Dong Gu. 

851
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,810
 I abandoned... 

852
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,410
 you. 

853
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:39,620
 Why Her? 

854
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:49,600


855
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,910
 I'll make sure to prove that No Byeong Chool is not the culprit. 

856
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,840
 I'm not interested. Keep your distance. 

857
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,500
 You deceived Noona, and she abandoned you. 

858
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,640
 Spill everything you know and what you presume. 

859
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,950
 Bring me Seo Joon Myeong! I said, bring me Seo Joon Myeong! 

860
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,510
 Why aren't you picking up? 

861
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:14,730
 How have all of you been? 

862
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:18,290
 I'm curious about the Ungju Step-sibling Murder  Case from ten years ago. 

863
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:23,120
 There's definitely somebody who framed innocent Kim Dong Gu 

864
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,910
 and made No Byeong Chool the culprit. 

865
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:26,570
 I'll definitely get to the bottom of this. 

866
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:27,360
 Over here! 

867
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,820
 Going against them without solid evidence— 

868
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:30,700
 Shut up. 

869
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,640
 I entrusted you with my life at stake. 

870
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,840
 And this is what you do? 

871
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:40,360
 The culprit definitely must have recognized that his crime has been exposed to the world.
