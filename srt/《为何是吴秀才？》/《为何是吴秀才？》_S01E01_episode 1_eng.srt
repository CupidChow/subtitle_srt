 Oh Su Jae, Partner Lawyer

 Episode 1

00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:27,525
 #TK Law Firm, #Working as Associate Attorney at TK Law Firm 

7
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:29,815
"Seonbae, you're so cool."

8
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,715
"TK Law Firm, daebak."

9
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:34,275
Gosh, you're such an ins  (trendy).

10
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,179
While you have time to show off about working at TK Law Firm on Instagram,

11
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:42,799
why don't you revise your brief one more time?

12
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:48,439
Excuse me! The rest of you are no different.

13
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,179
Since you barely made the cut to join Attorney Oh's team, you should pay your dues.

14
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:58,189
Don't submit briefs that are out of context and are inconsistent in argument.

15
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:03,049
Shouldn't you be sorry that I stay up all night fixing your errors?

16
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,369
I'd want to croak out of embarrassment if I were you

17
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,199
Why is your father-in-law's mistake your weakness?

18
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,569
The assemblymen on our side will cover for you during the hearing.

19
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,319
So, don't worry.

20
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:27,395
Anyway, I made sure things will go over smoothly.

21
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:30,209
Let's grab a bowl of  bokguk  (puffer fish stew) sometime. Okay?

22
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,769
Okay. Bye!

23
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,669
 Assemblyman Lee In Su 

24
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,360
Sit down.

25
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:44,319
All right. Let's hear about Hansu Bio.

26
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,319
Why don't you pick up your phone?

27
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,279
The phone, where did I put it?

28
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,769
Oh, boy. I left it on vibrate.

29
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,079
I guess one can't fool time (feeling the weight of his age), Assemblyman.

30
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,419
I'll report to you at another time.

31
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:01,309
Attorney Oh, are you very busy?

32
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:04,159
Oh, yeah. Su Jae, stay for a moment.

33
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,839
You can go, Yeong Bae.

34
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:15,479
Attorney Oh, you know...

35
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,229
There are more than 200 residents in Yeongpyeong District who 
   One day ago, National Assembly, Transportation Committee State Audit 

36
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:21,399
don't have money to move nor afford even a small studio,

37
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,319
and yet you keep pushing no matter what.

38
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,809
Do you want to see all of them die?

39
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:30,329
Geez, those bums. Not being able to rent a room is nothing to boast about.

40
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,289
Your mic! Mic!

41
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,419
What did you just say?

42
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,829
Did you just call the people "bums"?

43
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:44,419
Assemblyman Lee In Su, you say you want to become the president!

44
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,139
How dare you call the people "bums"?

45
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,769
No. I got distracted and was talking to myself.

46
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,109
You can't deny it by saying you got distracted.

47
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:53,789
This will not work.

48
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,209
No matter what, you must bend over 90 degrees and bow.

49
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,179
Oh, man.

50
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,069
My goodness. Just for talking to myself?

51
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,299
 We reported illegal political funds were involved in the election,
   

52
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:07,289
 but the Prosecutors' Office completely ignored us! 

53
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,669
 As a result, Assemblyman Lee In Su, who's serving his fifth term, 
   

54
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:13,259
 is being mentioned as a leading candidate in the presidential race. 

55
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,299
 The man who wants to become the president called the people "bums"! 

56
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,519
 - We must stop him!  
 - What the hell is this?

57
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,499
 We must stop him! 

58
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,219
- My apologies. I'll look into it right away. 
  - After stopping him... 

59
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:28,529
Attorney Oh, what do I need to do?

60
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,959
Do you know what the weakness of someone who risks his life for justice is?

61
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:37,679
 His calling us bums is an opportunity, I say. 

62
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:40,809
 I'll get an apartment and a store in a shopping mall out of him. 

63
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:42,449
 Once I get that out of him, 

64
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,819
 I'll stamp a vote for him as president. 

65
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,269
They get their unjust intentions exposed.

66
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:53,049
I sent it over to them, too, so I'm sure they understand.

67
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:56,489
Make concessions, pretending not to know, and wrap it up nicely.

68
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,409
 Assemblyman Lee In Su, Compensating Yeongpyeong District for damages Rise in approval rating 

69
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,039
 Manse (similar to banzai or hooray), Assemblyman Lee In Su! 

70
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,059
 Manse! 

71
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:14,369
I know. I don't know how exactly Su Jae did it.

72
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,759
They were shouting "manse" and hugging each other.

73
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,169
Gosh, forget it! Why should I be jealous of someone who does the dishes?

74
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,589
Anyway, I'm the one who's going to become managing partner.

75
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,489
But, Honey, are you sure you'll really become managing partner?

76
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:27,949
- Are you sure? 
  - It's been decided internally 99.9%. 

77
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,109
Tell our kids. Also, tell father-in...

78
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:34,089
Hey, I have the chills.

79
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:37,919
There goes Oh Su Jae again. She's axing the associates again.

80
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,669
What a vulgar bitch.

81
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:43,179
The whistleblower who revealed that he falsely reported 
  Jo Moon Yong (43-year-old, male) 

82
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:44,739
the air pollution emission level, Jo Moon Yong

83
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,599
will be a witness for the plaintiff.

84
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,609
How do we undermine Jo Moon Yong's testimony?

85
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,069
We must stop him, no matter what.

86
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:53,069
No matter what? How?

87
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,719
I'm not saying stop him thoughtlessly. Use appeasement and persuasion.

88
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,909
We should meet him in person to persuade him.

89
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,569
I'll persuade him.

90
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,569
I'll find out what we need and say to him, "Have there ever been instances of whistleblowers succeeding?

91
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,579
"You'll be ostracized and ultimately get kicked out.

92
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,859
"You have a wife and kids. Decide wisely."

93
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:10,769
Apply firm pressure, and at the same time—

94
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,879
You're out, too. Get out.

95
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:16,089
Please, let me know if my opinion is wrong.

96
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,699
Attend the trial if you want to find out.

97
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,539
However, you'll be sitting with the audience.

98
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:24,169
 Second Trial of Damage Suit for Dust Inhalation Damages against Hansu Biochemical Complex 

99
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,029
Defense counsel, please begin your questioning.

100
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:31,019
Your Honor, I would like to show

101
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,419
the true nature of the credibility of witness Jo Moon Yong,

102
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,900
who falsely reported the air pollutant emission of Hansu Biochemical Complex.

103
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,869
Please think about this as you look at this photo.

104
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:09,609
The witness Jo Moon Yong received money from the plaintiff. Does his testimony

105
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:12,659
come from a place of wanting to bring about justice?

106
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:18,919
Jo Moon Yong's testimony exposed that the level of air pollutant emission was falsely reported.

107
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,339
Could it really be true?

108
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,159
It's true!

109
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:24,509
What I exposed is really true!

110
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,839
It's true!

111
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,889
It's a trap! It's a trap.

112
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,549
He's trying to screw me over!

113
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,309
You're screwing me! He's trying to screw me over!

114
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,419
- Let go! 
 - Quiet! Quite! We'll take a recess!

115
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,479
He's screwing me over!

116
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,449
Let go...

117
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,399
What did you just do?

118
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,499
I told you. The second trial will be difficult.

119
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:50,519
 Court in session 

120
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,959
 Court in session  
 While preparing for the second trial, we

121
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,899
tried to focus on why Yang Ji Ho got sick.

122
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,159
We conducted investigations and experiments.

123
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:04,409
Not only in the vicinity of the factory, but we also widened our scope of investigation to other areas.

124
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:09,939
You can see that other areas also showed similar levels of pollutants as the vicinity of the factory.

125
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:15,069
This proves that Yang Ji Ho's illness and Hansu Biochemical Complex's air pollution level

126
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:18,459
have no cause-and-effect connection.

127
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,569
No, Your Honor!

128
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:24,919
Our Ji Ho is sick because my husband and I are incompetent and poor.

129
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,249
Ever since he was in my womb, he breathed in black air.

130
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,239
Your Honor...

131
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,139
Please save my Ji Ho.

132
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:36,669
Please save my Ji Ho, Your Honor.

133
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:40,249
Your Honor, please help us!

134
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,709
Thank you!

135
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,029
The child is suffering from a lung condition that is similar to  pneumoconiosis  (dust inhalation causing coughing, inflammation, and fibrosis).

136
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,289
This is due to the air pollutant from the Hansu Biochemical Complex.

137
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:04,049
Including lung diseases, scary air pollutants known to cause various cancers

138
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,229
have diseased this child's lungs and have been threatening the residents in the area.

139
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:10,029
 Plaintiff 

140
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,719
The reason Ji Ho is suffering from a lung condition similar to pneumoconiosis

141
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,699
is mainly from the environmental factors,

142
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:26,649
according to his physician, Dr. Sin Do Hyeong's testimony.

143
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:29,939
Also, the medical professionals from the same hospital have provided the same opinion.

144
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:35,369
Does it make sense that a child as young as Ji Ho continues to suffer due to environmental factors

145
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,909
while going through tests for pneumoconiosis?

146
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:44,129
Your Honor, I will submit the expert report from a doctor.

147
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:47,239
I request an opportunity to read the statement in open court.

148
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:52,299
Your Honor, she's trying to muddy up the essence of this trial by a surprise reading of a statement.

149
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:55,619
There is no reason to stop her since the closing statement has not been given yet.

150
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:57,229
Please go ahead.

151
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:02,249
"A connection between patient Yang Ji Ho's illness

152
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:08,319
and the air pollutant from Hansu Biochemical Complex cannot be proven."

153
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:14,519
Your Honor, please confirm from which doctor and by what means she obtained that statement!

154
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,029
We must confirm it.

155
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,479
You don't need to confirm it.

156
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:23,039
It's the expert report from Ji Ho's attending physician, Dr. Sin Do Hyeong.

157
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:28,539
Also, those from the same hospital where Dr. Sin practices,

158
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,839
pulmonologists, their expert reports are also enclosed.

159
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:45,469
However, Your Honor, there is a more important truth that needs to be known about Yang Ji Ho.

160
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:48,729
Your Honor,

161
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:53,829
please order the security guard to escort Yang Ji Ho out of this courtroom for a moment,

162
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,189
and I request that you make this a closed trial.

163
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:59,119
How can you do that?

164
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,389
Open it all up! Why should my Ji Ho leave the room?

165
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,889
We cannot accept her sudden request for a closed trial!

166
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,899
Please proceed as is.

167
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:11,639
I clearly gave you a chance.

168
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,949
What chance are you referring to?

169
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,759
Yang Ji Ho was adopted at the age of five.

170
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,189
 What? Yang Ji Ho was adopted? 

171
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:24,829
 - What is she saying? 
 - What's going on? 

172
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:30,799
The statement about Ji Ho breathing in polluted air from his mother's womb is all a lie, Your Honor.

173
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,239
 What is she talking about? 

174
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,509
 - What is she saying? 
 - Seriously? 

175
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:37,449
 - How could this be? 
 - How can she do this? 

176
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:40,629
Your Honor, I request a recess.

177
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:44,639
It's probably better for you to end the trial now rather than hold a recess.

178
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,779
Not only did those people abuse Ji Ho all this time,

179
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:50,529
I obtained testimony that says they went through adoptions and

180
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:53,479
dismissal processes of several children to profit off of them.

181
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,269
It's all a lie!

182
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:58,039
Ji Ho is our son!

183
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,079
Ji Ho is our son! Yes! Look!

184
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:04,359
We didn't abuse him! We don't abuse!

185
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,109
We need objective evidence.

186
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,209
Here are those pieces of evidence.

187
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,629
This is a fabrication! It's a fabrication!

188
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,230
Please be quiet!

189
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,620
 Plaintiff 

190
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,820
 Judge 

191
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:22,909
 Genetic Test Report 

192
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,799
 (%) chance of relationship: N 
 Biological relationship is not established between Subject A and Subject B 

193
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,279
Did you run a genetic test?

194
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,819
This is illegal. You didn't even get our consent.

195
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:32,329
That's why we can't submit this one.

196
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:35,789
But the pieces of evidence are overwhelming.

197
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:45,429
You ruined it all. You ruined it.

198
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,419
You ruined this!

199
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:50,369
I should've abandoned you a long time ago! A long time ago!

200
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:53,189
We brought you in when you can't even earn your keep! What are we going to do now!

201
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:55,309
What are we going to do now! What now?

202
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,189
 What are you doing? 

203
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,409
 What's going on here? 

204
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,489
 Since the plaintiff Yang Ji Ho was not born and raised in the industrial complex, 

205
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:16,799
 we cannot acknowledge  a causal relationship between Hansu Biochemical Complex's air emissions 

206
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,149
 and his lung disease. 

207
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,429
 Therefore, the original verdict in favor of 

208
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,819
 Plaintiff Yang Ji Ho is reversed, 

209
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:28,079
 and the claim made by the plaintiff Yang Ji Ho will be dismissed. 

210
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,639
Don't you feel sorry towards Yang Ji Ho?

211
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,719
 Do you feel any responsibility toward Yang Ji Ho? 

212
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:35,569
Don't you think that you violated Yang Ji Ho's human rights?

213
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:38,039
Let's go.

214
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:41,719
A word, please!

215
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:43,329
 Isn't that right? 

216
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:45,609
 - Please say a word!  
 - Excuse me.

217
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:48,459
How did you know that Yang Ji Ho was adopted?

218
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:51,779
Didn't you notice anything strange from the family registry?

219
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:53,569
First of all, 
  Family Register 

220
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:57,459
Yang Ji Ho is the only one without the generation character "Ye." 
  Yang Ye Hwi, Yang Ye Seo, Yang Ji Ho   / (T/N: Each generation in a clan has the same character in the given name.)

221
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:58,779
Second,

222
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:03,189
the gap between Yang Ji Ho and the next older child, Yang Ye Seo is only 11 months.
  Yang Ye Seo 6/20/13, Yang Ji Ho 5/2/14 

223
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:04,879
It's not even a year.

224
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:10,669
Why is it that I'm the only one who sees these kinds of things?

225
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:13,219
So how did you know that Jo Moon Yong would accept a bribe?

226
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:16,609
I never thought a whistleblower would accept a bribe.

227
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:17,889
His attitude.

228
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,309
 The essence is in his attitude. 

229
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:24,519
 To be honest, I knew this issue would get exposed. 

230
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,689
 Someone with ill intent is bound to have unclear intentions. 

231
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:31,609
 I dropped some info on Yang Jeong Tae's side. 

232
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:34,869
Saying if they give money to Jo Moon Yong, he'd give beneficial testimony.

233
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:38,269
So those two people with ill intent basically blew themselves up.

234
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,849
But as for stuff like attitude and essence,

235
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,819
you catch those things because it's you.

236
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:45,739
It's not like associates like us are fortune-tellers.

237
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:48,859
We must destroy the credibility of a witness who is disadvantageous to us,

238
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:52,479
and we must invalidate a trial that is disadvantageous to us.

239
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,349
That's the point.

240
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,389
If you don't get it even after watching the trial,

241
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,309
then change your occupation.

242
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,439
Tomorrow is the award ceremony, right?

243
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:20,769
So, should I take my kids and go there with some flowers?

244
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,419
Forget it. Makes me cringe just thinking about it.

245
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:26,409
 Hey, smile for the photos this time. 
    

246
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:29,559
You know that you had a totally blank expression last time you got an award, right?

247
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,329
Say, "Auntie, smile!"

248
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:34,019
 Auntie, smile! 

249
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,009
 Auntie, congratulations on your award! 

250
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:38,999
 - Auntie, congratulations on your award!  
 - You're too noisy, you quack.

251
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,189
 - Good job!  
 - Bye!

252
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,819
 You arrive at a beach.   

253
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:56,839
 This beach under the shining sun 

254
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,799
 boasts a long coast of sand and shallow waters... 

255
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,119
 The tourists and locals enjoy this spot the most. 

256
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,899
She's here. 
  TK Law Firm's Attorney Oh Su Jae, The Star Attorney of the Year  

257
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,939
Did you see her yesterday?

258
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,299
Congratulations!

259
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,539
- Look at her facial expression. 
 - Congratulations!

260
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,059
Congratulations!

261
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,809
Congratulations!

262
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:14,159
Attorney Oh, congratulations!

263
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,689
- Congratulations! 
 - You're so cool!

264
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,229
- She doesn't smile, though. 
 - Never mind. She never smiles.

265
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:21,379
Geez, that damn girl has all the award luck.

266
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:24,639
Gosh, she used to be a clumsy "never heard, never seen before" thing when she first got here.

267
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:27,069
 No one wanted to include her. 

268
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:34,519
 Hey. 

269
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:38,069
 Get out. 

270
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,299
 Remember? That girl couldn't even look us in the eye, back then. 

271
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,039
 Let's just go eat jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) 

272
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,779
 Hello. 

273
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:51,849
 - Let's hurry up and go eat. 
 - There's a really good sushi place. 

274
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,669
 Let's go. 

275
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:55,819
 We have to hurry up and eat. 

276
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:57,519
 Come on. 

277
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,469
 When I was an associate, I didn't even eat with her. 

278
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:05,589
 Why include her? I would've lost my appetite. 

279
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:08,439
So I'm saying, do we have to address that bitch as managing partner?

280
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:11,499
No, never!

281
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:15,789
According to the new resolution, 40% advisor opinions,

282
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:19,679
40% partner and associate opinions, and 20% my opinion will be combined

283
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,859
to select the law firm CEO (managing partner).

284
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:24,849
You can review the document for the partners' and associates' opinions.

285
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,659
You could do as you please, Chairman,

286
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:28,329
so why bother gathering the opinions of underlings?

287
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,239
The trend of those somewhat prestigious law firms

288
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:33,569
is to pretend to listen to the underlings when selecting a CEO.

289
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:36,269
We can't fall behind the trend.

290
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:40,209
In any case, our thoughts are on Attorney Min Yeong Bae.

291
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,089
Look at the top ten law firms in the nation.

292
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,319
There aren't any female CEOs.

293
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,879
On top of that, a high school graduate? Oh my, give me a break.

294
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:50,999
The fact that you promoted a high school graduate female attorney with nothing to show for her

295
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:54,499
means you've already led the trend, Chairman.

296
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,729
Su Jae has done well to deserve it.

297
00:18:56,729 --> 00:19:00,229
But I heard Song Mi Rim is Attorney Oh's right-hand person.

298
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:03,209
Why place her in the interview?

299
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:08,439
We'd summon the finalists' right-hand people and hear their honest comments as a reference.

300
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,779
People read into things like that and are moved in this day and age.

301
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,569
True. We have a former chief of police,

302
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:22,039
Commissioner of the National Tax Service, the Commissioner of Customs, a Supreme Court justice,

303
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,279
Secretary-General of the National Assembly, and Chairman of the Fair Trade Commission.

304
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,079
Including former ministers, the best advisers in the nation are gathered

305
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,649
and are kindly listening to the underlings' opinions.

306
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:34,739
This should make the front-page news.

307
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:42,169
Song Mi Rim? I pulled her to my side.

308
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:44,819
I put out feelers, and she's pretty ambitious.

309
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,329
Think about it. She's an associate, yet she plays the role of a secretary, too.

310
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:51,189
No wonder her nickname is Baby Oh Su Jae.

311
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:54,739
That's why I made a deal with her. I told her to vote for me and come work under me.

312
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,759
Then I'll make her a partner.

313
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,089
She has only five years of experience. What partner?

314
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:03,179
- That's too much. 
 - Have you only been in the business one or two days?

315
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,800
Pull her to my side first, and if you just don't fulfill, whatever.

316
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:09,419
So, who's buying lunch today?

317
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,149
Attorney Oh brought in 32 billion won in revenue last year.

318
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:14,559
Attorney Min brought in 8 billion won.

319
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,369
Attorney Oh earned far more.

320
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:21,759
We know all that. But... that can't be the only condition to being a law firm CEO.

321
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,649
So, I'd like to bring this up cautiously with all of you.

322
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:31,039
I have realized something while enduring five years under Attorney Oh.

323
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,249
A partner and a leader are different things.

324
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:36,279
Thirty-eight partners.

325
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,989
Sixty-two associates.

326
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:40,079
Over 100 employees.

327
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,649
A law firm CEO needs to have leadership

328
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:46,519
and character is more important than performance.

329
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,889
So, who do you wish would become CEO?

330
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:52,289
Probably Attorney Oh Su Jae. Isn't that so?

331
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:55,729
Could it possibly be Attorney Min Yeong Bae?

332
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,549
The arm always bends inward.  (T/N: You'll side with whomever you're close to/family.) 

333
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,039
It must be Attorney Oh.

334
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,819
Well, an arm doesn't always bend inward.

335
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:09,229
It could unexpectedly bend outward, you know.

336
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,479
Congrats on your award, for real.

337
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:34,689
Everyone is dying of jealousy. But I mean it.

338
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:36,109
You know, right?

339
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,399
I heard you were great in front of the elders.

340
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:49,209
Out of three companies that want to acquire Hansu Bio,

341
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:52,459
SP Partners are the most aggressive. 
  Companies interested in purchasing Hansu Bio 

342
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,769
The purchase bid is similar to the other two companies, but

343
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:59,209
they additionally offered to pay royalties for the use of the Hansu brand.

344
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:02,619
My uncle also has his eyes on SP Partners.

345
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:06,129
I'm so envious of Chief Han.

346
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:09,009
His uncle is the chairman of Hansu Group.

347
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:13,149
It means even better job security than a government position.

348
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:14,779
But Chief,

349
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:17,889
do you know the first priority in keeping your job?

350
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:19,979
It's all about making a conservative choice.

351
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,479
CEO Yoon Se Pil at SP Partners is doing extremely well.

352
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:24,309
But they grew too fast.

353
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,849
What does this mean? That they're that much riskier.

354
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,479
Yes, of course.

355
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:34,989
So, we'll trust the choice of both of you and go with it.

356
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:38,919
First of all, we have something to discuss among ourselves.

357
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:41,579
Oh, yeah. The discussion among the heads only.

358
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,019
I love stuff like this.

359
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:45,229
Go ahead and get to work. Go now.

360
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,579
Work hard. It'll pay off someday.

361
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:00,429
You know the judge for the appeal?

362
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,619
I'd like to give him a gift. Something small.

363
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:06,389
I heard his son is finishing college.

364
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,649
Oh, that's great then.

365
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:10,699
I guess I could create a position for him at Hansu.

366
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:14,519
They're noisy about preferential job treatment or whatever. Why don't you create some interim time?

367
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,739
Can't I even express gratitude?

368
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:18,459
Why is the world so heartless?

369
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:22,739
I mean, for me, even a legislative aide... We live in a world where I can't hire whom I want.

370
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:24,159
My goodness.

371
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,829
That Shaman Kim is excellent.

372
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:30,159
Chairman, you were fortunate enough to make a lot of money this year.

373
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,949
And he said you'll move up to an important position, Assemblyman.

374
00:23:32,949 --> 00:23:37,839
The Yeongpyeong District issue worked out, and if the Hansu Bio sale goes over well,

375
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:41,219
the great cause you've been working on for the past ten years will come to fruition.

376
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,629
That's right! Our 10-year cause will be realized.

377
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:46,879
Dream come true!

378
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:52,579
Oh, right. Has Min Yeong Bae been decided as the law firm CEO?

379
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,529
Well, I'm about to.

380
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:58,559
Yeah, that kid Yeong Bae is easy to handle.

381
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,059
Oh Su Jae, that bitch, is perfect to put to work.

382
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,259
 Oh Su Jae 

383
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:08,289
I'm sorry. I'll take this call.

384
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:14,159
Yeah, it's me.

385
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,239
 Seonbae, you've been having fun these days. 

386
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:22,529
Naon Group paid you off under the pretense of betting on golf.

387
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:26,849
You've been partying with H&amp;T Korea, enjoying everything for free.

388
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:29,419
You were working really hard, Seonbae.

389
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:32,679
 What... hey, Su Jae... 

390
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,289
What is all this?

391
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:39,339
Chief, I met them all strategically to gather intel from them.

392
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:41,319
What are you doing? We're both pros at this.

393
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,749
Drop out quietly.

394
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:47,369
I'll tell the outsiders that you're swamped, Seonbae.

395
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:50,379
- What? 
 - Why do you think I told everyone to leave?

396
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:53,179
I wanted you to save face, Seonbae.

397
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:57,099
Haven't you heard the rumor?

398
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:59,059
You haven't heard the rumor because you were so excited after getting an award?

399
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:02,829
I'm the next law firm CEO. 99.999% decided.

400
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:06,189
Your child, Song Mi Rim sided with me, too.

401
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:13,349
 Chairman Choi Tae Guk  
 Chairman, did you decide on Seonbae?

402
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:14,859
I haven't decided yet.

403
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:16,389
Seriously.

404
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,689
I'll work on the acquisition of Hansu Bio alone.

405
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,679
Okay, got it.

406
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,819
 Chairman Choi Tae Guk 

407
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,819
How dare you look into my background?

408
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,269
Are you a thug? Huh?

409
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,839
A scumbag is someone who lied and tempted my associate, saying you'll make her a partner.

410
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,599
Seonbae, you're the real scumbag.

411
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,379
Th-That So-Song Mi Rim...

412
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:46,299
Why don't you leave now?

413
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,999
So we can have our meeting.

414
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:51,659
- Hey, where is Song Mi Rim? 
 - Yes?

415
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,459
Hey, who the hell are you? Huh?

416
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:57,769
Come in.

417
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,879
Let's go in.

418
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:09,189
What are you looking at?

419
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:13,189
Please let me apologize.

420
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:15,139
We should conduct business without any background noise.

421
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,319
It's all right.

422
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:18,899
Although I was a bit taken aback.

423
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:20,839
- Shall we continue? 
 - Ah, yes.

424
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,749
But...

425
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,799
you realize we're missing a lot of files, right?

426
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:31,179
I appealed to you several times not to leave out anything, even down to the last sheet of memos.

427
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:32,849
Yes.

428
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:35,569
I'll look through them again.

429
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,789
- Get them for her. 
 - Okay.

430
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:40,539
If it's okay with you, we'll come and get them soon.

431
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,399
Yeah? Well...

432
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:46,849
Yeah.

433
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:50,789
 Go, go, go! 

434
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,189
 Chief Legal Officer 

435
00:26:54,189 --> 00:26:56,539
Hey, hurry up and gather!

436
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:59,719
Let's hurry it up! Hurry up!

437
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:02,009
Please stop!

438
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:05,909
Who are you to be doing this?

439
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:11,119
I said stop, please!

440
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,949
What?

441
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:22,549
The people sent over just now, did you just send them, Attorney?

442
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,739
Did you send them over already?

443
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:29,479
Because you said, "soon."

444
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,529
Come out.

445
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:40,969
Hey! What did all the security kids do?

446
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:43,399
Does it make sense that they swooped up everything?

447
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:53,849
It's the first time I've seen Chief Han Gi Taek get so riled up.

448
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:57,009
He must have so many things to hide.

449
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:00,259
It's so commonplace, professional negligence and embezzlement.

450
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:01,949
Must be very extravagant.

451
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:06,019
That crazy bitch, Oh Su Jae, dares pat down my place!

452
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,189
To what extent did she take things?

453
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:11,759
How about the cruise?

454
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,809
She took that, too?

455
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:15,359
Hey, you fuck!

456
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,089
Do you want to get kicked out like your father?

457
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:21,599
Go get the stuff that Oh Su Jae took right now!

458
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,259
Now!

459
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:26,879
What will you do now?

460
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,369
Chairman.

461
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:31,529
If Su Jae has it in her hands, it's the same as me having it.

462
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,819
You don't have to worry.

463
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:36,049
Damn it! Fuck!

464
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,009
That cruise...

465
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,569
You must be careful with it.

466
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:42,919
If that gets opened up—

467
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,679
You don't have to worry.

468
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:46,839
That Han Gi Taek...

469
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,669
That lacking bastard.

470
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:51,209
Wow, seriously.

471
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:55,699
I'll seat Su Jae as the law firm CEO.

472
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:57,869
You should kick her out right away! What are you talking about?

473
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,279
She's too useful a child to get rid of.

474
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,959
A loyal dog who wags her tail even if you throw her a load of crap.

475
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:08,309
She's too much of a waste to drive out just because she played around once.

476
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:35,269
 Mom 

477
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:00,249
 Daebak. 

478
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:02,699
 Is this for real? 

479
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:04,389
 - Really? 
 - What's this? 

480
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:05,769
 For real? 

481
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:07,949
 I hadn't mistaken anything, right? 

482
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:09,369
Is this non-fiction?

483
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:11,479
Does this make sense?

484
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,989
Yes. Oh Su Jae. Oh Su Jae!

485
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:22,779
She usurped my position!

486
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,169
Chairman promoted that damn girl!

487
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:28,869
 Personnel Announcement: TK Law Firm Appoints Oh Su Jae as the Law Firm CEO 

488
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,239
 Women's Bar Association Regular General Meeting 

489
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:41,619
 Choogin Law Firm 

490
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:43,779
You heard the news about Oh Su Jae, right? 
  TK Law Firm 

491
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,559
What do you mean she's CEO.

492
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,939
It was decided initially on Attorney Min Yeong Bae,

493
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:49,579
but Chairman Choi flipped out.

494
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:52,139
She apparently took files from Hansu Group.

495
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:53,769
I heard that's why it was overturned.

496
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,379
She's so viperous.

497
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:57,429
She swooped down Hansu's stuff while working on their case?

498
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,819
Gosh, how scary!

499
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:02,139
There she comes.

500
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:04,879
Look at her smile. What a bad omen.

501
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,439
Whoa, goodness!

502
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:08,639
Hello.

503
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:10,929
Congratulations, Attorney Oh.

504
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:13,349
You sure shattered the glass ceiling.

505
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:15,219
It makes me so proud of you.

506
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:17,009
It's all thanks to you, Chairwoman.

507
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,549
Congratulations, Attorney Oh.

508
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:19,979
Congratulations!

509
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,569
I'm so jealous. A managing partner already?

510
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:24,659
The Seding Group case that our firm is working on,

511
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,369
we're enlarging the defense team.

512
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:30,189
Could TK join us?

513
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:32,529
I'll speak to Chairman Choi Tae Guk.

514
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:35,509
I could take care of that case.

515
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:37,419
Su Jae!

516
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:41,689
Congratulations!

517
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:45,899
My Min Yeong Bae foolishly jumped the gun saying he would be the CEO.

518
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:51,509
But you know, wasn't it too harsh to kick him out of the Hansu Bio acquisition project?

519
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:57,329
Did you two get back together?

520
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,059
Have you ended your separation?

521
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,549
Hey. We were never separated!

522
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:04,369
Where did you hear such a false rumor?

523
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:06,029
Oh, my! Chairwoman!

524
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,179
- How have you been? 
 - You came, Professor Jeong.

525
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:10,419
 Yes. You look great! 

526
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:13,269
 Hello, hello! 

527
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:26,229
Congratulations, Attorney Oh.

528
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:35,499
I'm looking forward to the sale of Hansu Bio.

529
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:40,719
CEO Yoon Se Pil of SP Partners.

530
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:43,029
I'm sure you're aware that meeting like this during the sale negotiation is unnecessary

531
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:46,439
and could obviously be misunderstood.

532
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:49,719
The managing partner position at TK Law Firm.

533
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:53,299
Did you obtain what you wanted?

534
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,759
The fact that he switched from Min Yeong Bae to you

535
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,339
means that the files you have became your weapon.

536
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:05,279
Should I...

537
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,809
give you a tip?

538
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:12,599
Those files

539
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,839
will contain things that are beyond your imagination.

540
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:18,899
Be sure to find them.

541
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,659
 CEO Yoon Se Pil 

542
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,539
 TK Law Firm 

543
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:43,919
Congratulations!

544
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,349
Congratulations!

545
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:46,489
Congratulations!

546
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:48,709
Congratulations!

547
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:50,419
Congratulations!

548
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:57,999
Congratulations!

549
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,549
Congratulations!

550
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,349
Congratulations!

551
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:07,289
Congratulations!

552
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,819
 TK Law Firm 

553
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,599
Congratulations, CEO.

554
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,039
I haven't taken office yet.

555
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,879
Gosh. Did you see the article?

556
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:33,109
"The success story of a high school grad attorney."

557
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:38,559
"The first female law firm CEO in the top ten law firm in the nation."

558
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,139
You have many interview requests.

559
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,279
Turn down all the interviews.

560
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,659
Call the facilities and tell them to take all these.

561
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,369
How come?

562
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:50,399
It's perfect for making others get jealous.

563
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,139
Look. They're suffering from group depression right now.

564
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:14,019
Welcome, our new CEO.

565
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:19,919
There was someone who was 99.9% certain that he was the one.

566
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:22,619
Thank you.

567
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:27,679
You never know about personnel appointments until you open them up.

568
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,649
Min Yeong Bae was arrogant

569
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:32,879
and you were diligent.

570
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:38,119
Assemblyman An Gang Hoon.

571
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,859
You know him, right?

572
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:47,019
I guess An Gang Hoon had played around with a bar hostess girl.

573
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:51,359
The problem is that the girl is going around spreading a rumor that he raped her.

574
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,779
Assemblyman Lee requests that we take care of it quietly.

575
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:59,569
Why would Assemblyman Lee ask that?

576
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:02,269
Weren't the two people political rivals?

577
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:03,739
I heard they're not on good terms, either.

578
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:07,379
If a rival within the same party is involved in a nasty scandal,

579
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:10,069
it's not good for Assemblyman Lee, either.

580
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:12,249
The assemblymen growl at each other in front of the cameras.

581
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:14,359
Once the camera is off, they eat together

582
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:15,669
and go to saunas together.

583
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:17,169
Well, you know how it goes.

584
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:18,829
Yes...

585
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:24,939
And the files you seized.

586
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:28,679
Chairman Han was enraged, so what I told him is

587
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,069
that if Su Jae has it, it's the same as being in my hands.

588
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:33,419
That he has nothing to worry about.

589
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,259
Worst case, it would be a double ledger,

590
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:38,929
and he probably has a slush fund.

591
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:41,349
That's not much of a flaw.

592
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:42,989
If you got what you wanted by seizing the files,

593
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:45,509
dust them off carefully and return them to him.

594
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:46,759
Got it?

595
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,669
Of course.

596
00:36:48,669 --> 00:36:51,229
I'll use it to help with the sale.

597
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:52,619
There won't be any problems.

598
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,199
That should be the case, of course.

599
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:59,349
There cannot be any problems.

600
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,049
I'll put together a proper inauguration ceremony for you.

601
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:07,749
Before that, take me to the fish market, make a feisty fish full of vigor into sashimi,

602
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:09,859
and have a shot of soju.

603
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:14,169
You got the position you wanted and landed a big case.

604
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:16,189
You should treat me.

605
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:17,949
Yes, Sir.

606
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,559
Attorney Oh.

607
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,899
Here are additional files on Park So Yeong.

608
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:40,499
Her family relations and rumors from hostess bars.

609
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:44,149
The recorded video is on the USB.

610
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:48,559
By chance, did you also do a background check on Assemblyman An Gang Hoon?

611
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,299
I have not. Do you need it?

612
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:55,339
No. It's all right.

613
00:37:56,979 --> 00:37:59,249
 Park So Yeong 

614
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:02,369
Daebak.

615
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:04,129
Crazy scumbag.

616
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:07,819
Gosh, I can't believe this guy dared say he was going to run for president.

617
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:10,509
 Gang 

618
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:13,319
But what is all this all of a sudden?

619
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,169
A bar hostess named Park So Yeong.

620
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,529
She claims that Assemblyman An raped her.

621
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:23,109
But Chairman ordered me to shut Park So Yeong's mouth.

622
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:26,999
Why? Park So Yeong could be the victim here.

623
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:30,229
Isn't that cornering her to frame her as a gold digger just because she's a hostess?

624
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:32,049
Isn't that also a framed notion of yours?

625
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:34,929
Why do you, without regard, think the woman has to be a victim?

626
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:36,609
What if she really is a gold digger?

627
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:39,539
And what if Assemblyman An is the victim?

628
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:43,989
 Gang 

629
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,069
Su Jae.

630
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,459
No!

631
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:13,039
I did go there a few times, and it's true that I got wasted.

632
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,069
But no! I have no memory of it.

633
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:18,049
It's an en-entrapment.

634
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:21,739
Someone is using Park So Yeong to bring me down.

635
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:25,169
Who do you think you are that they'd want to bring you down?

636
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:28,119
All your life, you've been all about image-making. Making your way through life just on popularity.

637
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,369
You must be ecstatic about being mentioned as a presidential hopeful somehow.

638
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:35,559
The fact that you're being discussed as a presidential hopeful

639
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:39,589
is evidence that our politics still suck.

640
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:42,859
Then why did you go out with me?

641
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:44,499
A big toy.

642
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:45,379
What?

643
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:49,729
It was funny to see you whining and spending money, asking me to go out with you.

644
00:39:50,629 --> 00:39:54,709
It was entertaining to see you begging me to wear these shoes.

645
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:00,479
You were perfect as a toy to play with for a while and then toss.

646
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:03,299
What type of outcome are you looking for?

647
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:07,379
I'm trying to find out what my client wants and the best outcome.

648
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:09,869
I'm asking you as a lawyer.

649
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:14,569
Please don't let my political career end.

650
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:16,629
Just a false rumor?

651
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:19,139
Make it a minor mishap and let it pass.

652
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:21,679
I beg you.

653
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,919
Kneel and ask for my help.

654
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:30,219
Either end your political career without getting what you want

655
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,659
or kneel in front of me.

656
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:39,819
A phone call.

657
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:42,519
 Assemblyman Lee In Su 

658
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,529
Yes, Assemblyman.

659
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,349
Yes.

660
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:53,209
I understand.

661
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:14,979
Please save me.

662
00:41:23,129 --> 00:41:25,379
You and I...

663
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:29,589
never met

664
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:32,629
in person.

665
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:51,659
Let's go.

666
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:02,509
Whoa, what in the world?

667
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:05,179
You have the same taste as me.

668
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:13,889
These are super expensive.

669
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:17,149
You must make a lot of money.

670
00:42:17,149 --> 00:42:20,449
Park So Yeong, your attitude is a bit cheap.

671
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:27,509
Have you ever met Assemblyman An Gang Hoon before the incident?

672
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:28,529
No.

673
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:31,559
Even if you haven't met him, you knew who he was, right?

674
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:33,739
Former actor and single assemblyman.

675
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:37,099
He's popular and has a great image.

676
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,799
But his nickname is Dog in my field of work.

677
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:42,849
Sleazy Crazy Dog at that.

678
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:45,069
But he's a VIP

679
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:47,519
because he definitely spends money.

680
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,029
So did you indulge in that money?

681
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:52,329
No.

682
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:54,459
 I'm the victim. 

683
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:57,069
 A rape victim. 

684
00:42:57,069 --> 00:42:59,509
 I even have evidence. 

685
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,029
I'm not interested, though.

686
00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:06,209
What is your dream?

687
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,919
Don't you have one?

688
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,649
What was your dream before?

689
00:43:10,649 --> 00:43:14,019
Your work right now couldn't have been your dream job.

690
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:17,119
Having a dream in South Korea?

691
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:20,419
Why?

692
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:22,489
You fulfilled your dream, so you're sitting there.

693
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:25,759
And I'm sitting here because I couldn't reach my dream.

694
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:28,709
Is that what you want me to become aware of?

695
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:31,039
I'm just curious.

696
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,079
Why did you pull off something like this?

697
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,379
I'm asking you because I'm curious.

698
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:38,249
I didn't "pull it off." I'm the one who's been wronged.

699
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,069
He violated me.

700
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:43,039
I said I'm the victim!

701
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:45,819
Why are you quiet?

702
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:47,479
Are you sure you're a lawyer!

703
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:49,139
Oh, yes.

704
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:50,509
Just a moment.

705
00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:54,559
Oh, yes. A-Attorney Oh Su Jae?

706
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:56,879
We have evidence.

707
00:43:56,879 --> 00:43:59,789
What was submitted as evidence is that, inside Park So Yeong's underwear,

708
00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:02,809
An Gang Hoon's DNA was found.

709
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,619
That indicates that she was wronged.

710
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:07,599
To establish that it was a rape,

711
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,259
you must prove that physical assault or threats

712
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:13,139
 were used to force sexual intercourse without consent. 

713
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:16,669
 How would you prove that it was coerced with the DNA from her underwear? 

714
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:20,159
You'd be able to retrieve DNA if sexual intercourse took place with consent.

715
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,229
Oh, however,

716
00:44:22,229 --> 00:44:25,789
Park So Yeong has been consistent in her claim of rape.

717
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:29,289
Also, the recent trend is that the victim's testimony

718
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:32,979
is given importance in recent trends.

719
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,049
This eonni is laughing.

720
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:40,199
We're both women, and I'm saying I got raped.

721
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:41,829
And you laugh?

722
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:43,209
How could you do that?

723
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:45,019
How could you do that!

724
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,959
Song Mi Rim?

725
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:52,309
 She's the one who flirted with An Gang Hoon first. 

726
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:54,359
 Anyway, So Yeong is so funny. 

727
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,839
 She seduced him with her innocent face and is now stabbing him in the back. 

728
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,309
 That's her method. 

729
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,009
Hey!

730
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:16,979
Your father is an alcoholic, and your mother is ill.

731
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:20,439
Does your younger sister know what your occupation is?

732
00:45:20,439 --> 00:45:22,969
Do you want me to post the video on your sister's school forum?

733
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:26,519
I could also spread it everywhere where your mom is hospitalized.

734
00:45:28,249 --> 00:45:29,539
Shut up!

735
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:32,899
Would you be able to live in peace, Park So Yeong?

736
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:36,009
There's nothing Korean netizens can't find.

737
00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:38,919
No matter where you go, they'll find you, post your photos and make them go viral.

738
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:42,549
They'll make sure you want to die.

739
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:44,229
Ms. Park So Yeong, please calm down.

740
00:45:44,229 --> 00:45:46,469
Please sit down. Sit, sit.

741
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:48,049
Wait...

742
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:51,099
I mean, a hidden camera and blackmailing her using her family.

743
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,579
Isn't this too much?

744
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:56,849
What class in the Judicial Training Institute are you in?

745
00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:59,489
I'm not in the Judicial Training Institute. I'm in Law School's ninth class.

746
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:01,399
And you're trying to beat me?

747
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:03,139
N-No...

748
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:07,449
I mean, I-I'm not saying I'm going to lose.

749
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:10,299
Listen carefully, Ms. Park So Yeong.

750
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:14,219
When a woman becomes a victim of sexual crime in Korea,

751
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:16,269
the law is not on the woman's side.

752
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:17,559
Not to mention public opinion.

753
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:20,389
What do you think, Law School ninth class?

754
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:22,489
But...

755
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:23,869
Despite that...

756
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:26,589
we must see things from the victim's perspective.

757
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:28,839
And especially lately...

758
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:31,909
the victim's testimony is given more importance...

759
00:46:31,909 --> 00:46:34,879
Let's say Ms. Park So Yeong indeed is a victim, and we go to trial.

760
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:38,139
Do you think you can beat me in the courtroom, Ninth Class?

761
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:44,509
Ms. Park So Yeong?

762
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:49,089
Let's say that you erred under the influence of alcohol.

763
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:52,299
You never even met An Gang Hoon.

764
00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:53,749
The end.

765
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:55,299
Okay?

766
00:46:55,299 --> 00:46:57,499
Then how about you?

767
00:46:57,499 --> 00:46:59,809
Was this your dream?

768
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:02,559
To become a lawyer,

769
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:04,779
push the victim into a corner,

770
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:07,769
and make me want to die?

771
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:09,429
Was this your dream?

772
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:11,309
Why would you die?

773
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:13,389
You should live.

774
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,839
Curse me and live.

775
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:22,199
If you curse someone, you miraculously gain the strength to go on.

776
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,099
Let me know if you ever need an attorney in your life.

777
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:30,399
 Oh Su Jae, Partner Lawyer 

778
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:32,239
This guy's not it.

779
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:34,649
Where did you ever find such an empty shell?

780
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:38,080
He can't protect his client, not even a single bit.

781
00:47:50,669 --> 00:47:53,009
Hey, you crazy bitch!

782
00:47:55,399 --> 00:47:58,219
You don't have a dream, either!

783
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:00,719
You don't have one, either!

784
00:48:10,149 --> 00:48:11,889
No.

785
00:48:12,779 --> 00:48:14,999
I have one.

786
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:19,249
Going all the way to the top.

787
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:25,529
That's my dream and I'm halfway there.

788
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:33,169
I'm different from you.

789
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,229
Park So Yeong.

790
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:48,549
She seems to have suffered injustice.

791
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:52,599
My client is An Gang Hoon. Not Park So Yeong.

792
00:48:53,749 --> 00:48:54,659
Okay.

793
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:57,649
Do you know what Park So Yeong did wrong?

794
00:48:57,649 --> 00:49:01,180
She didn't use me as her lawyer.

795
00:49:09,919 --> 00:49:14,960
 TK Law Firm 

796
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,359
Do you need anything?

797
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:19,939
Go home.

798
00:49:19,939 --> 00:49:22,329
I'll go ahead then.

799
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:59,169
Your car is ready outside.

800
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,220
 TK Law Firm 

801
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:28,069
Attorney Oh!

802
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:30,629
Attorney Oh Su Jae, are you okay?

803
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,969
Call 119!

804
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:33,399
Hurry up and call the police!

805
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:35,630
Block off the people!

806
00:51:43,439 --> 00:51:46,670
 Oh Su Jae, Partner Lawyer 

807
00:52:39,729 --> 00:52:41,079
 Shut up! 

808
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:44,079
 Would you be able to live normally, Park So Yeong? 

809
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,989
 No matter where you go, they'll find you, post your photos and make them go viral. 

810
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:49,039
 They'll make sure you want to die. 

811
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:50,949
 Hey, you crazy bitch! 

812
00:52:50,949 --> 00:52:54,169
 You don't have a dream, either! 

813
00:52:55,059 --> 00:52:57,479
 I'm different from you. 

814
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,800
 TK Law Firm 

815
00:53:35,229 --> 00:53:38,600
 Song Mi Rim 

816
00:53:41,029 --> 00:53:44,139
 We reviewed the CCTV, but it didn't capture anything. 

817
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:47,009
 I have no idea how she went up there. 

818
00:53:50,979 --> 00:53:52,279
 Song Mi Rim 

819
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:56,739
 The police are wrapping up the case as a suicide from a despondent view of life. 

820
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,550
 TK Law Firm 

821
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:15,959
 It's Attorney Oh Su Jae! She's here! 

822
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:19,549
Attorney Oh Su Jae, why did Park So Yeong throw herself off the TK Law Firm building?

823
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:20,299
I don't know.

824
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,249
Do you feel guilty about Ms. Park So Yeong?

825
00:54:22,249 --> 00:54:23,179
Not at all.

826
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:26,359
I hear you treated her harshly for being a vocational woman.

827
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:28,959
I heard you stomped on the rights of vocational women.

828
00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:31,389
Please tell us.

829
00:54:33,789 --> 00:54:36,659
Aren't you a vocational woman, too?

830
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:40,189
You have a consistent job as a woman.

831
00:54:40,879 --> 00:54:43,979
And you're a vocational man.

832
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:48,209
You push sleazy words like that, so they call you Trashy Reporters.

833
00:54:48,209 --> 00:54:51,829
Oh, I've heard about "reporter infestations" lately.

834
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:56,019
Because you swarm over rotten information like maggots.

835
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:59,199
- My gosh... 
 - What did you just say?

836
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:00,459
Reporter infestations?

837
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:02,979
 Who do you think you are? 

838
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:05,799
 You must kick Su Jae out this time, Chairman. 

839
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:08,899
Our big clients have been up in arms for the last few days.

840
00:55:08,899 --> 00:55:12,139
Our image plummeted because of Attorney Oh. It's indescribable.

841
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:14,519
This is a very dire situation.

842
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,599
It's a fact that Su Jae seriously provoked Park So Yeong.

843
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,449
 Was the meeting of Park, who jumped, and Su Jae decisive?  
 After the meeting that day,

844
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,609
I saw her do that myself.

845
00:55:24,649 --> 00:55:28,589
It'd be good to have Attorney Oh take a break while we're at it, Chairman.

846
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:30,899
And to hold the law firm CEO inauguration ceremony amidst all this?

847
00:55:30,899 --> 00:55:32,789
You need to reconsider.

848
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:35,429
Please let Su Jae take a break for a short while, Chairman.

849
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:38,159
Well, under the guise of training overseas

850
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,279
you could send her to the US or China branch for about a year...

851
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:45,099
A year wouldn't be long enough, would it?

852
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:51,389
Out of all of you,

853
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:55,369
who earned as much money as I did for TK?

854
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:59,539
Or who has won as many cases as I have in court?

855
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:01,989
That's not everything!

856
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:06,379
The dignity and class as an attorney at TK Law Firm.

857
00:56:06,379 --> 00:56:09,409
Park So Yeong committed suicide because of you, Attorney Oh.

858
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:13,329
TK's honor has fallen to the ground!

859
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:15,109
You know that?

860
00:56:16,929 --> 00:56:18,809
Seonbae.

861
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,229
I'm TK.

862
00:56:22,229 --> 00:56:25,389
TK is me.

863
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:27,929
I have lived like that without missing a day.

864
00:56:27,929 --> 00:56:31,019
And that me should be driven out of the country?

865
00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:35,939
I would rather you go ahead and chop off my head.

866
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:41,849
Seonbaenim.

867
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:46,499
You totally looked down on me for being a high school graduate when I started here.

868
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:50,219
You didn't even let me come into the conference room.

869
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:53,809
Gosh, you called me out to all kinds of drinking parties

870
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:57,529
saying, "Why bother calling a hostess? Let's just use Oh Su Jae."

871
00:56:57,529 --> 00:57:00,569
You did that more than once or twice.

872
00:57:01,779 --> 00:57:06,619
You always put your name on the briefs that I put together.

873
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:08,559
Seonbae...

874
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:12,029
Forget it.

875
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:14,529
I feel sorry for you, Seonbae.

876
00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:16,799
Just know that.

877
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:21,680
While I lacked so much compared to all of you, I've made it thus far.

878
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,010
That means!

879
00:57:26,189 --> 00:57:29,759
I've come this far, putting my life on the line.

880
00:57:29,759 --> 00:57:35,849
And if you mess with someone like me, you'll get hurt.

881
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:37,989
Do you understand?

882
00:57:57,959 --> 00:58:02,319
"Oh Su Jae is TK and TK is Oh Su Jae"?

883
00:58:16,049 --> 00:58:18,529
Wow, has it been eight years?

884
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:20,209
You've gotten prettier.

885
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:22,669
Did you hear that I was coming here?

886
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:25,439
Oh, I heard someone died, and you were put in a bind.

887
00:58:25,439 --> 00:58:27,609
Let me know if I can help you in any way.

888
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:30,239
Who?

889
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:32,279
You'll help me?

890
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:33,289
Yeah.

891
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:35,929
Mr. Choi Ju Wan, you will help me?

892
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:58,039
This is on the house today!

893
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:00,449
Eat all night!

894
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:02,979
Hurry, hurry.

895
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:04,319
There.

896
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,969
Here you go.

897
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:07,309
Looks good!

898
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:09,919
My boss got into law school

899
00:59:09,919 --> 00:59:11,589
and we're moving into a mixed-use commercial building space that we bought.

900
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,149
It's completely awesome, huh?

901
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,639
Congratulations!

902
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:16,589
- Eat up, eat up! 
 - Okay!

903
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:18,089
Eat up!

904
00:59:18,089 --> 00:59:19,909
- Eat up. 
 - What do you need?

905
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:21,360
Give me sea bream.
  Brother Fish Market, Mr. Gong Chan got accepted to law school! Daebak! 

906
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,919
 Sea bream? You asked for kimchi earlier. 

907
00:59:24,919 --> 00:59:27,409
 Daeyeong Store 

908
00:59:27,409 --> 00:59:30,529
Do you know why I like this place?

909
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:35,339
The fun starts by picking out live fish like that.

910
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:38,789
"Kill that one and serve it to me."

911
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,149
I'm chewing on the fish that was alive a moment ago.

912
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:50,309
I like it a lot.

913
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:55,829
You wanted to chew up TK like this, so you endured and climbed up this far.

914
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:58,609
I know that better than anyone else.

915
00:59:58,609 --> 01:00:00,379
But Su Jae,

916
01:00:00,379 --> 01:00:02,629
would I feed the porridge I made for myself to a dog?

917
01:00:02,629 --> 01:00:06,049
I'd rather dump the pot.

918
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:08,199
As for a dog...

919
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:14,289
it must be loyal, know its place, and bear shame under any circumstances

920
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:18,599
in order to be loved.

921
01:00:20,729 --> 01:00:23,189
Go on a vacation.

922
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:27,139
As an adjunct professor at Seojung University law school.

923
01:00:27,139 --> 01:00:30,039
Not for long. For about a semester.

924
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:33,809
I'm taken aback by your suggestion, Chairman.

925
01:00:33,809 --> 01:00:36,599
Seonbae Baek Jin Gi is there as the director.

926
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,439
He's extremely concerned about you.

927
01:00:38,439 --> 01:00:40,989
He said he'd open up an adjunct professorship for you.

928
01:00:40,989 --> 01:00:43,479
I'll turn it down.

929
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:46,999
This is not a suggestion.

930
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:49,169
It's an order.

931
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:52,269
Take the CEO position next time.

932
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:54,189
Do it next time.

933
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:55,599
Do you understand?

934
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,699
To shake me up with my position right before the inauguration ceremony—

935
01:00:58,699 --> 01:01:01,239
It's my position.

936
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:03,359
All the positions at TK

937
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,459
are mine.

938
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:07,149
Intern, associate, partner, CEO.

939
01:01:07,149 --> 01:01:10,609
Even the security guard and facility positions!

940
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:15,369
They're all my positions.

941
01:01:19,919 --> 01:01:22,139
Park So Yeong.

942
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,609
Did I do that to her?

943
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:29,099
Park So Yeong.

944
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:31,739
Did I kill her?

945
01:01:32,499 --> 01:01:35,529
Please answer me, Chairman!

946
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:37,969
They say it's your fault.

947
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:41,149
The people say.

948
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:45,049
The world!

949
01:01:56,299 --> 01:01:58,689
My apologies. I'm so sorry.

950
01:01:58,689 --> 01:02:01,259
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes, I'm fine.

951
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,989
I'll clean up really quick.

952
01:02:09,419 --> 01:02:11,799
I'm very sorry.

953
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:33,689
 - Su Jae. 
 - Huh? 

954
01:03:33,689 --> 01:03:39,179
 I'm not worried at all since my Su Jae is so kind and smart. 

955
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:41,799
 - You're not worried at all? 
 - Of course not. 

956
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:46,049
 The toughest thing to do in life is to gain people's hearts. 

957
01:03:46,049 --> 01:03:48,329
 Since my Su Jae is kind and smart, 

958
01:03:48,329 --> 01:03:52,169
 whoever you meet will open their hearts to you. 

959
01:03:58,059 --> 01:04:00,189
No, Dad,

960
01:04:00,189 --> 01:04:02,509
it's not so.

961
01:04:10,569 --> 01:04:13,829
 How could you leave us like this? 

962
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:16,819
 What about our kids! 

963
01:04:18,819 --> 01:04:22,139
You're so heartless!

964
01:04:22,139 --> 01:04:23,529
 I want to go with him! 

965
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:26,119
 - I want to go, too! 
 - Are you crazy, Mom? 

966
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:28,379
 - Let go of me! 
 - Come on, Mom! 

967
01:04:28,379 --> 01:04:30,129
 My daughter, 

968
01:04:30,129 --> 01:04:35,449
 you have to become a good lawyer who gains people's hearts, okay? 

969
01:04:35,449 --> 01:04:40,459
♫  And your eyes showed me the way  ♫

970
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:43,179

971

♫  It makes me invincible  ♫

972
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:48,609
Why is this happening to me?

973
01:04:48,609 --> 01:04:50,039
Why?

974
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:52,380
Why?

975
01:04:53,049 --> 01:04:57,319
♫  Goes out never  ♫

976
01:04:57,319 --> 01:04:59,930
 They say it's your fault. 

977
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,929
 Do you feel guilty about Park So Yeong? 

978
01:05:02,929 --> 01:05:04,439
 The people say. 

979
01:05:04,439 --> 01:05:06,599
 The world! 

980
01:05:10,509 --> 01:05:12,959
I'll look down on them.

981
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:17,470
I'll stand in the highest place and look down on them all!

Here you are, coming to me because you want to live.

987
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:06,239
What did I tell you?

988
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:08,459
If you don't take arrhythmia seriously,

989
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:11,069
you'll die suddenly. Did I tell you that or not?

990
01:06:11,069 --> 01:06:12,799
CEO or whatever. Quit it right this minute.

991
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,579
You'll die for sure at this rate!

992
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:20,069
If I wanted to leave, I would've left a long time ago.

993
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:21,679
If you were going to leave, you wouldn't have

994
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:23,609
gone back there when you came back from the States.

995
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:26,069
Gosh, you vicious bitch.

996
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:28,769
Su Jae.

997
01:06:28,769 --> 01:06:30,829
Oh, Su Jae, you're alive!

998
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:32,529
Yes.

999
01:06:33,609 --> 01:06:36,129
Don't worry about that arrhythmia and just live.

1000
01:06:36,129 --> 01:06:38,499
If it gets worse, just pass out and come back to the hospital.

1001
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:40,409
Joon Hui and I will save you.

1002
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:42,809
Right, Honey?

1003
01:06:42,809 --> 01:06:45,119
I noticed you had lots of packages delivered.

1004
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,809
Oh, right. Let's go camping together next time.

1005
01:06:46,809 --> 01:06:51,169
Go and just space out all day and drink all night.

1006
01:06:51,169 --> 01:06:54,449
Then that'll be really good for our mental health.

1007
01:06:56,269 --> 01:06:58,449
Don't look at me like that.

1008
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:01,719
I feel like I'm getting arrhythmia. I'm going to see Eui Jae.

1009
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:07,929
Look at him. You passed out because of arrhythmia,

1010
01:07:08,689 --> 01:07:10,739
yet he's asking you to drink all night with him.

1012

You and I are in the back.

1013
01:08:00,529 --> 01:08:02,499
Barely made it here, huh?

Professor!

1017
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:16,699
Professor, how come our seats are all assigned?

1018
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:18,679
I want to sit in the front and listen well.

1019
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:20,599
I'm a TA.

1020
01:08:20,599 --> 01:08:23,159
Your seats are in the order of your grades.

1021
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:24,399
Starting at the top in the front row.

1022
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:27,619
Then is the eighth group at the bottom of the class?

1023
01:08:27,619 --> 01:08:29,569
Me?

1024
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:35,829
Geez, how embarrassing.

1025
01:08:35,829 --> 01:08:38,519
What? Why sit in the order of grades?

1026
01:08:38,519 --> 01:08:39,939
It sucks.

1027
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:40,969
Right, Eonni?

1028
01:08:40,969 --> 01:08:43,359
I'm grateful we got in. Who cares if I'm at the bottom?

1029
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,009
I'm not embarrassed at all.

1030

About the professor,

1032
01:09:01,129 --> 01:09:02,899
who is it then?

1033
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:08,599
 Student Support Team 

1034
01:09:08,599 --> 01:09:10,899
Gosh, why isn't she picking up?

1035
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:13,789
 - The call is not going through.  
 - I'm going crazy.

1036
01:09:13,789 --> 01:09:16,379
The lecture hour will be over soon.

1037
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:21,399
 What's going on here? 

1038
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:23,459
 What a waste of time. 

1039
01:09:25,989 --> 01:09:29,349
 Geez, so irresponsible. 

1040
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:31,619
 I'm so bored! 

1041
01:09:37,849 --> 01:09:40,009
 When is she coming? 

1042
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,449
 What time is it now? 

1043
01:10:14,839 --> 01:10:17,959
 Oh

01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:21,379
 Oh Su 

1045
01:10:22,309 --> 01:10:25,509
 Oh Su Jae 

1046
01:10:26,299 --> 01:10:28,169
Oh Su Jae?

1047
01:10:28,169 --> 01:10:30,129
Oh, my God...

1048
01:10:30,129 --> 01:10:31,669
Oh, my God!

1049
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:34,369
 Oh Su Jae | I will never send my client to jail 

1050
01:10:35,509 --> 01:10:38,189
 I will never... 

1051
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:42,459
 Oh Su Jae | I will never send my client to jail 

1052
01:10:42,459 --> 01:10:46,259
This is the beginning and the end of a lawyer's fundamentals.

 Oh Su Jae | I will never send my client to jail

 But what happened to your face? 

1059
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:30,489
 - Get lost. 
 - Hey... 

1060
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:32,329
 I'm your lawyer. 

1061
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:36,369
 You won't listen to me or believe me either. 

1062
01:11:36,369 --> 01:11:38,609
 So, get lost. 

1063
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:41,429
 Get lost! Get lost! 

1064
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:44,579
 I don't need you! Get lost! 

1065
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:45,609
 Let go! 

1066
01:11:45,609 --> 01:11:47,159
 Let go! I said let go of me! 

1067
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:50,549
 - Let go! 
 - Wait! Wait! Wait a minute! 

1068
01:11:52,389 --> 01:11:54,179

 Thank you for coming to Seojung University Law School. 

1103
01:14:49,809 --> 01:14:51,159
 Is the class getting canceled? 

1104
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:53,049
 I heard the class will be canceled if less than five people show up. 

1105
01:14:53,049 --> 01:14:54,119
 Why didn't you change your class? 

1106
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:56,159
 I like Professor Oh Su Jae. 

1107
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,739
 Everyone is causing a ruckus saying they won't take the class. 

1108
01:14:57,739 --> 01:14:59,039
 I think the class will get canceled. 

1109
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:02,469
 It's Oh Su Jae. She's not one to let the class get canceled. 

1110
01:15:02,469 --> 01:15:04,929
 Start as my spokesperson first. I'll take you to the Blue House if you want.
