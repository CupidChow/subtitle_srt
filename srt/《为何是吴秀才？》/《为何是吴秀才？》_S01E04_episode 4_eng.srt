1
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,890
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,340
 Episode 4 

3
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,401
It was the professor.

4
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:38,531
She told the police. One hundred percent.

5
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:40,571
Really? For real?

6
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:41,791
The professor?

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,721
One hundred percent. For real.

8
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,681
Noona, do you think that, too?

9
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,761
She might not have.

10
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:50,601
When I heard Park Ji Yeong was arrested without a warrant, I asked my hoobae.

11
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:53,051
A report came in out of nowhere.

12
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,521
And all those things were what we had told her.

13
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:02,891
So, of course, it has to be for real, 100%.

14
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:05,771
Hey. What are you thinking about?

15
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:07,261
What?

16
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,551
Professor, seriously. This seems wrong, no?

17
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:21,430


18
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,431
You know Park Ji Yeong?

19
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:52,961
As the first case for Legal Clinic, how about we help Park Ji Yeong?

20
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:56,071
Based on what I saw, that girl could use some help.

21
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:59,911
Coming here looking for you, uploading the video... She must have her reason.

22
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,921
There are some things you just know when you get to be my age.

23
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:06,221
She's not the culprit.

24
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:09,101
Who do you think is the culprit?

25
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:15,861
For me, rather than wondering who the culprit is,

26
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:19,221
what bothers me more is why she died there.

27
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:21,681
Why did she have to die there? Why?

28
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:23,641
Of all places?

29
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,261
He's the owner of the hostess bar that Park So Yeong worked at.

30
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,501
His name is Hong Seok Pal. 
  Hong Seok Pal 

31
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:49,401
 He was infamous for being cruel on redevelopment demolition sites. 

32
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:52,261
 He caught Chairman Han's eye and works on Hansu Construction jobs 

33
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,281
 and runs the hostess bar successfully. 

34
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:58,811
The rumor is that he does all the dirty work for Chairman Han in that field.

35
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:03,221
 There's a separate VVIP (Very VIP) room on top of that building. 

36
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:06,041
 So, who's the most important VVIP? 

37
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,531
- Oh my, hello. 
 - Hey, CEO Hong.

38
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,461
- Looking good! 
  - Chairman Han Seong Beom. 

39
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:12,281
- Hey, Assemblyman Lee! 
 - Hello.

40
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,251
 Assemblyman Lee In Su. 

41
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:16,461
 And... 

42
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,401
 Don't be shocked. 

43
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,381
 Our chairman. 

44
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:26,681
Gosh, why do they have to play around like that? Geez...

45
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,461
 Mr. Go  

46
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,231
Yes?

47
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:34,881
 Attorney, I found out what it is. 

48
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,941
 I'm on my way. 

49
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:42,001
Park So Yeong... Why did she go to the OB/GYN?

50
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,901
It was really tough to get this.

51
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,071
  Diagnosis: Pregnancy 4 weeks, needs prenatal care 

52
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:51,681
Pregnant?

53
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:54,151
Did you know about this, Attorney Oh?

54
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,041
I thought it was a possibility.

55
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,621
But it wasn't reported on the autopsy at all.

56
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:00,811
That coroner guy said...

57
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:04,141
 My director said, "Why are you doing something you weren't told to do? 

58
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,821
 Stop messing around and just turn it in." 

59
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,471
 His director said the case will close as suicide anyway. 

60
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,471
He told him to wrap it up clean and simple.

61
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:16,011
He said he did what he was told.

62
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:18,661
Crazy. What nonsense!

63
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:26,321
So, she ended up dying like that.

64
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,001
With a baby in her womb.

65
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,841
She was a mom.

66
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:35,581
 Mom. 

67
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,711
And this, Attorney.

68
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:48,281
Gosh. My guys finally managed to open it up after staying up several nights.

69
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:52,801
And even after opening it up, each file has a password lock on it, double and triple.

70
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,201
What's this?

71
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:56,981
I found it inside the Hansu Bio file folder.

72
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,771
Fingerprint recognition and passwords on every file?

73
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:03,671
Something must be really fishy.

74
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:10,071
We finally managed to open up one file and it's just so baffling.

75
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,901
  Yeongpyeong District Promotion Center Opening Ceremony   
 With a heart full of hope for Yeongpyeong District,

76
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,811
they will the first ones to break ground with their shovels.

77
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,511
One. 
   Yeongpyeong District Promotion Center Opening Ceremony  

78
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:27,441
Two.

79
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:30,211
Three!

80
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:33,231
  Yeongpyeong District Promotion Center Opening Ceremony  

81
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,651
Congratulations.

82
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:45,201
  The city I want to live in, Yeongpyeong   
 Wow... You've been stressing over this for years.

83
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,191
You finally did it, Chairman.

84
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:50,031
Gosh, I didn't do this all by myself.

85
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,961
You've been working on it, Assemblyman Lee.

86
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:56,791
And Chairman Choi, you've been supporting me.

87
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,891
I got help all around.

88
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:04,581
- Chairman Choi, I'm considering postponing the sale as you mentioned. 
 - Pardon?

89
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:10,001
I consulted Master Kim and he says it's good to cool down for a bit.

90
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:14,411
- He says it's good that I've got my hands on the soil these days. 
 - Is that so?

91
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:18,761
He's saying it's good to get fired up by touching the moisture in the soil.

92
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:22,331
And just in time, it exploded over on the other side of the site.

93
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:24,681
- What?
 - Underground water.

94
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,441
Gosh, he's right on. He's so skillful.

95
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,451
Oh, I see.

96
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:32,681
Considering the fact that he said, "You'll be the president in the future."

97
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:35,801
- he sure is right on. 
 - I know!

98
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:38,891
Sometimes he scares me because he's so right on.

99
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:51,481
 What you say is so profound and perfectly right, Chairman. 

100
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:56,021
 Chairman Han was born with so much fire in him. 

101
00:06:56,021 --> 00:07:00,331
 He needs to draw out the fire by touching the wet soil. 

102
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:05,301
 Then it would be safe to touch the metal by pursuing the sale afterward. 

103
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,001
 I'll tell him that. 

104
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:16,671
That's a wise decision, Chairman.

105
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:20,531
While I'm cooling down, why don't you set up a meeting with the FSS (Financial Supervisory Service) director?

106
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:24,981
I have already contacted him. He's so fond of you, Chairman.

107
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:28,701
Excuse me.

108
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:34,131
By the way, did you hear that the police arrested Park So Yeong's sister?

109
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:35,741
Oh, really?

110
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:38,171
I guess that's going to give you a headache, Chairman Choi.

111
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:41,481
As for me, it's only a headache

112
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:45,821
but it could be heartbreaking for you, Chairman.

113
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:49,631
You really treasured So Yeong.

114
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:52,091
I treasured her?

115
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:54,991
I did?

116
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,921
Treasure her?

117
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:05,011
Move the car!

118
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:15,381
  Cell 2   
 Hey. It's you, huh?

119
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,591
The high schooler who pushed her sister off the building.

120
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:20,321
It's you, right? Why?

121
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:21,941
What?

122
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,961
Why are you giving me the stink eye?

123
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,861
You sure seem to eat well and sleep well.

124
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:35,221
Are you able to eat after killing your sister? You could sleep?

125
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:36,911
That's right! What are you going to do about it!

126
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:39,741
Hey! How dare you!

127
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,391
Stop it!

128
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:49,011
How dare you!

129
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:52,011
Let go!

130
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,501
Stop!

131
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,951
Even after such a mess, she's keeping her mouth shut. 
  Violent Crime Division Team 1  

132
00:08:56,951 --> 00:09:01,001
I asked her what would make her talk as I put her in a solitary cell.

133
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,751
Attorney Oh Su Jae.

134
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,311
What?

135
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,851
Attorney Oh Su Jae.

136
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:08,761
That's all she said.

137
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:11,481
"Attorney Oh Su Jae. Attorney Oh Su Jae."

138
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:13,071
Since her case is such a big issue,

139
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:16,021
the higher-ups are rushing us to investigate and make an announcement.

140
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:19,051
But she won't talk.

141
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:22,451
Seeing how vicious she is, she is definitely capable of killing her sister.

142
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:25,751
I could make an issue out of your statement, right?

143
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:27,861
What?

144
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:30,981
You made your moves after reaching a conclusion after Park So Yeong's death.

145
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:32,741
Closing the case as suicide no matter what?

146
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:36,631
What do you mean we reached a conclusion? This is unfair to us, too!

147
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:39,811
All the detectives on the case went to other places due to a personnel shake-up.

148
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:43,201
The case was basically dumped on our team.

149
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,611
Only if we had seen this back then...

150
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:54,991
Okay, look.

151
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:57,031
It's Park Ji Yeong's diary.

152
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,671
She must've hated her sister so much 
  I really wish my eonni would die.  

153
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:03,611
that she always said, "I wish my sister dead. I want to kill her..." 
   I really wish my eonni would die. I want to kill her.  

154
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:07,061
She couldn't have written this in the right state of mind. 
  I really wish my eonni would die. I want to kill her. I want to be happy. 

155
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:13,161
If I show you this, you'll get a confession out of Park Ji Yeong.

156
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:17,001
It's going to be bad if you don't keep your promise.

157
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:20,171
How could you make a request in such a shitty way?

158
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:22,881
It's because I'm so cornered myself.

159
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:24,481
Okay, look.

160
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:27,031
She climbs up the emergency stairwell as if her life depended on it.

161
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:32,141
And exactly 18 minutes later, she's recorded again going down the stairs as if her life depended on it.

162
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:35,931
And this is CCTV footage from in front of the building.

163
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:40,401
Park Ji Yeong came out of the building and witnessed this six minutes after Park So Yeong fell.

164
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:44,991
It means it took her about 27-30 minutes roundtrip to the rooftop garden.

165
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:49,801
Within that timeframe, she could've climbed up the stairs as if her life depended on it, pushed her sister, and come back down.

166
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,941
Well, it's not entirely impossible.

167
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:58,351
And above all, she had a location tracker on her sister's cell phone.

168
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:01,761
That's how she was able to follow her here.

169
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,691
She planned this out meticulously.

170
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,421
Why did you ask for me?

171
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:16,131
Get me out of here.

172
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:19,581
How could you ask me for a favor so rudely?

173
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,041
Is the land for this police station cursed?

174
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,651
What's wrong with everyone here?

175
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:31,341
My sister died because of you.

176
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,581
I'm here because of you.

177
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,921
So, you should take responsibility.

178
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,601
Just spill everything.

179
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:43,961
Why you wanted to kill your sister and how you killed her.

180
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:46,230
Tell me everything.

181
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,831
That's the only way I will be able to help you.

182
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,721
Spill it now.

183
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,981
I didn't do it.

184
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,101
I said I didn't do it!

185
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:06,711
You expect me to believe that?

186
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,781
That's right.

187
00:12:08,781 --> 00:12:10,661
You have to believe me to help me.

188
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,471
Are you willing to help me when you can't even believe me?

189
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:15,600
It's not you that I have to believe in. I have to believe in myself.

190
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:21,801
Whether you acknowledge your crime or not, I have to believe that you're not guilty

191
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:24,651
So that I could work on your behalf.

192
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:27,031
That's what lawyers do.

193
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,111
What's that? What the heck?

194
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,501
What's going on?

195
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:58,661
It's a contract.

196
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:04,290
A contract that says Park Ji Yeong will agree to use me as her lawyer.

197
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,401
Let's see it.

198
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,251
There's no obligation to show a contract between a lawyer and a client to the police.

199
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,191
You have no right to force me, either, Detective.

200
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,531
Eat well and sleep well.

201
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:26,141
Don't get into fights.

202
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:29,031
How would I get into fights in a solitary cell?

203
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,981
I like your attitude.

204
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,711
Attorney, even if it's a contract...

205
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,420
I've just left.

206
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,681
Those accountants

207
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:51,231
are working with Yoon Se Pil of SP Partners.

208
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,341
I got a text saying that they both have a meeting set up with Yoon Se Pil.

209
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:57,281
Gosh, those traitors. What do we do with them?

210
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,821
Wait, wait, wait.

211
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,651
  Presidential Suite 

212
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,621
A suite?

213
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:30,631
  Presidential Suite 

214
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,761
A suite?

215
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:36,831
She went straight to the suite?

216
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:38,491
That's what I'm saying!

217
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:39,981
I saw her go.

218
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:43,891
A suite in the middle of the day? That's crazy!

219
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:48,021
But I wonder how much a suite costs there?

220
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,551
What are you saying?

221
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,011
Right. Who cares how much it costs?

222
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:55,141
Honey, stand guard right there

223
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,451
and take a picture with your cell phone and see who Su Jae is walking out with.

224
00:14:57,451 --> 00:15:00,121
Who knows? She might be walking out with a married man.

225
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:03,731
That's right. If I capture that, it'd be solid evidence.

226
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:07,481
That's right! We'll make her slide all the way down with that.

227
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:09,911
I'll get Legal Clinic Center back

228
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:12,631
and you'll push down Su Jae. Okay?

229
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:14,121
Sounds good.

230
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,571
Gosh, I haven't had so much fun in a while.

231
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,781
Oh, I heard they signed a confidential agreement first as they started working with you.

232
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,591
So, you won't have to worry.

233
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:30,281
I have no intention of stealing anything.

234
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,221
Please don't hate them too much.

235
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:36,851
I couldn't dig up background information on Hansu forever.

236
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:38,041
My apologies.

237
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:43,051
I forgot that if one betrays once, he's capable of betraying again and again.

238
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,251
Attorney, have a seat.

239
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,301
Ta-da. Let's eat this together.

240
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:03,471
This is my favorite.

241
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:06,431
I got one for you, too.

242
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,501
The burger from this place is my soul food.

243
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:17,241
When I came back to Korea, I went straight to this burger place from the airport.

244
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:20,941
You also have food you crave like that, right?

245
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,911
I'm not sure.

246
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:32,581
  Well-known guests from the political and financial world, including Assemblyman Lee In Su, in attendance 

247
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,361
Interesting man, isn't he?

248
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:40,361
He's not so competent, but very greedy. 
   Well-known guests from the political and financial world including Assemblyman Lee In Su in attendance 

249
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,231
He wouldn't have made it that far if it weren't for Chairman Choi Tae Gook's brain.

250
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:48,381
I'm sure Chairman Han Seong Beom's money also played a role.

251
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:51,031
They say, "Don't give power to the greedy,

252
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:53,461
don't give money to the ignorant,

253
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:56,161
and don't give a sword to the insane."

254
00:16:56,161 --> 00:17:00,771
But the three of them are on the same team. They're enormously powerful.

255
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,911
My dream is...

256
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,451
to destroy all three of them.

257
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:12,741
On the same day and time. Completely ruined.

258
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,811
Speechless, huh? I get it.

259
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:21,941
But I mean it.

260
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:25,131
What makes you think you could trust me and open up like that?

261
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,021
My gosh, why did I do that?

262
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:31,851
Why do I want to be so honest with you, Attorney Oh?

263
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:35,850
"If you want to kill someone, wait by the river.

264
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,831
His body will float ashore."

265
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:45,381
Why bother to destroy someone with my own hands?

266
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,961
Why would I want to dirty my hands?

267
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,270
Under no circumstances

268
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,771
would I wish for my opponent's destruction.

269
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:57,731
Even if he's my enemy.

270
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,411
Without breaking him, I wish to own him perfectly whole.

271
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:05,341
Sounds great.

272
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:10,610
I'm in a great mood, and I'd like to give you some intel.

273
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,991
Hansu Group will announce that they'll postpone the sale of Hansu Bio.

274
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:17,861
You don't have to worry, though. They're just stalling for time.

275
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:19,701
And this.

276
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,631
I'm giving it to you because it might be useful to you, Attorney Oh.

277
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,421
I believe you're connected to this case.

278
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:34,671
I hope you find them useful.

279
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,111
You know all kinds of things.

280
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:38,801
That's just my position.

281
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:42,671
Even if I sit still, all kinds of intel come to me.

282
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:45,091
Manage those accountants well.

283
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,001
If anything leaks,

284
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,481
I'll make you stand in a courtroom.

285
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,251
Who's that?

286
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:08,611
Who were you with in the suite in the middle of the day?

287
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,741
Yes, she just came by.

288
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:16,211
I feel like we see eye to eye.

289
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,171
I got chills.

290
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,561
CEO Yoon Se Pil!

291
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,821
Yoon Se Pil of SP Partners?

292
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:24,661
The one trying to buy Hansu Bio?

293
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,181
Yes! That Yoon Se Pil!

294
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:28,821
A net worth of seven trillion won. That Yoon Se Pil!

295
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:31,551
A net worth of seven trillion won...

296
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:33,151
Wait, why Oh Su Jae?

297
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,271
Why would someone with a net worth of seven trillion won go for Oh Su Jae?

298
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:36,761
Is she that pretty?

299
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:39,331
 Damn it, what are you saying? Hang up for now! 

300
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:41,231
Gosh, so annoying.

301
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:45,401
Who the hell is with that girl? Seven trillion won? Why? Gosh, seven trillion won.

302
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:48,201
So annoying. I'm so irritated.

303
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:51,081
What an annoying little bastard!

304
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,191
  Attorney Song Mi Rim 
 Attorney Oh asks everyone to meet in an hour. 

305
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:06,921
 Attorney Song Mi Rim 
 Everyone, be there!  

306
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:15,681
We'll take Park Ji Yeong's case as the first Legal Clinic Center case.

307
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,301
Here's the case record. Please review.

308
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:24,071
Professor Oh. Did you turn over the information we dug up to the police?

309
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:30,081
Did Park Ji Yeong get arrested without a warrant because of the evidence we found?

310
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,731
Yes.

311
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:36,761
She got arrested because of you, but we're helping her now?

312
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:39,281
Please tell us why you're doing this.

313
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,951
Look into it, each of you.

314
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:44,311
Why I did that and why I'm doing this.

315
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:49,111
Do you believe that Park Ji Yeong is not guilty?

316
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:51,371
I don't believe in my clients.

317
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:54,271
I believe in myself since I need to defend my client.

318
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:57,061
The client...

319
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:01,371
You don't believe clients?

320
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:05,901
Believing in the client isn't important, but making sure the client receives a not guilty verdict is.

321
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:08,701
That's the job of a lawyer.

322
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:13,521
So, find evidence that gets Park Ji Yeong out of the shadow of a guilty verdict.

323
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:18,671
Look into the possibility of someone else being the culprit, not Park Ji Yeong.

324
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:34,431
 Here is a written conversation Attorney Oh had in the interrogation room. 

325
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:37,081
 Where is the cell phone? 

326
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:45,891
 Someone stole it. The day after I uploaded the video. 

327
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:49,820
She doesn't believe the detectives who closed the case as a suicide. That's what she's saying.

328
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,620
That's what she's saying.

329
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,961
Is there another suspect that Professor Oh is thinking of?

330
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:59,141
Well, I'm not sure. I think we should look into that.

331
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:01,211
Then give us some tips, Attorney Song.

332
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:05,971
If I were you, I'd first look for Park So Yeong's cell phone that Park Ji Yeong lost.

333
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:10,851
If you see that memo, the person who stole the cell phone is likely the culprit.

334
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:12,821
I see.

335
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:19,111
And it seems everyone mistrusts it because Park Ji Yeong was arrested without a warrant.

336
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:23,871
Attorney Oh is incredibly fantastic and warm.

337
00:22:23,871 --> 00:22:26,341
Trust me.

338
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:29,251
All right then, let's work hard. Fighting.

339
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:32,181
- Warm? 
 - I'll try trusting her.

340
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:34,511
She sure is loyal to her.

341
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:38,371
I think Attorney Song noona is pretty cool.

342
00:22:38,371 --> 00:22:40,041
Right?

343
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:42,541
Yeah.

344
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:53,901
 I don't believe in my clients. 

345
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:56,891
 I believe in myself since I need to defend my client. 

346
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:01,371
 I believe you. 

347
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:10,051
Be sure to call a driver!

348
00:23:15,231 --> 00:23:18,621
You look so lonely.

349
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:21,621
The loneliest woman in this universe, Oh Su Jae!

350
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:25,241
No, I'm not. I'm not lonely.

351
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:27,291
Oh, yeah?

352
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,041
Cheers!

353
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:39,061
Gosh, this is much spicier. It's so good!

354
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:43,181
Why do you keep drinking and not eating the food?

355
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,751
Hey, I ordered your favorite.

356
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:50,191
- Have you ever kissed someone first? 
 - Ma'am, bring us cod roe rolled eggs!

357
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:51,551
 Coming! 

358
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:53,621
She's coming. She's bringing it over.

359
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:55,051
Let's share it.

360
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:58,931
Gosh, I'm falling asleep. I can't, though.

361
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:00,591
So what if I told you?

362
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:03,911
You can't even hear me, you quack.

363
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:11,461
You make the best eel, ma'am.

364
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:14,641
Hyeongs can't make it taste like this no matter what.

365
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:19,821
- So, did you get a girlfriend at the law school? 
 - No.

366
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:23,441
Gosh, are you an idiot? You're perfectly healthy.

367
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:26,351
Hey, do you have some issues or something?

368
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:29,511
Ma'am, I'm perfectly fine.

369
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,721
- I'm no joke. 
 - Give me a break.

370
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,971
Geez, have you ever been in a relationship?

371
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:38,951
There's a woman I like.

372
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:40,651
You do? Who?

373
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:42,891
Is she pretty? Is it a friend at school?

374
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:45,211
She's pretty.

375
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:48,091
She's cool and amazing.

376
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:55,181
But my heart ached a little bit today.

377
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:56,681
Why?

378
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:59,751
Hey, because she doesn't know how you feel?

379
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:06,921
She must've had it so hard trying to get up to her position.

380
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:13,841
To do that, I'm sure she behaved badly

381
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:16,891
and said some harsh words.

382
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:21,341
Ma'am. You know how it is sometimes?

383
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:27,091
You're really tender and kind at heart

384
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:33,561
but you have to be harsh and behave badly to beat others.

385
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:38,401
That's right.

386
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:42,831
If you don't, people think you're easy.

387
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:49,061
Hey, so in order to win, you have to stand your quills sharply like a porcupine

388
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,791
and say harsh things.

389
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,971
That's how you survive in this world.

390
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:56,141
Right.

391
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:58,461
That's why...

392
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,441
That's why...

393
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:06,701
my heart ached a little today.

394
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:10,071
She's pretty, cool, and amazing.

395
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:14,681
But I don't think she knows that about herself,

396
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:20,461
and it seems only the bad things happen all around her.

397
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:23,671
There only seem to be people who give her a hard time.

398
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:28,111
And so,

399
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:33,551
she seems to speak so harshly.

400
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:37,421
I want to get her out of that place.

401
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:39,501
That's just how I feel.

402
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:43,061
Gosh, you've fallen head of heels for her.

403
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:47,721
It's like that when you truly fall for someone.

404
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:50,751
You just feel sorry for that person for no reason.

405
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:53,491
You want to do everything for her.

406
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:57,471
Hey. You know that moron over there?

407
00:26:57,471 --> 00:27:00,621
I just feel so sorry for him.

408
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,761
It's as if he'd die without me.

409
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:08,461
Gosh, you're smiling.

410
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,831
But...

411
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:15,511
I think she has a boyfriend.

412
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:17,201
Really?

413
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:18,841
She has a boyfriend?

414
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:20,821
I happened to overhear it.

415
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:23,641
Her boyfriend's net worth is worth seven trillion won.

416
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,881
What's that? Seven trillion?

417
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:27,451
Trillion comes after billion.

418
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:29,981
One trillion, two trillion. That trillion.

419
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,871
Oh, my... What are you going to do?

420
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:37,281
How would you ever beat seven trillion won?

421
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,881
Why couldn't I beat him?

422
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:42,131
My heart is worth 70 trillion won!

423
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:46,971
Here we go again. You're drunk again after drinking half a bottle.

424
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:49,921
Fine. Here's 70 trillion won.

425
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:53,101
You sure have an amazing heart.

426
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:03,071
Ma'am, let me borrow your umbrella.

427
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,561
Huh? Leaving?

428
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:15,731
Hey. Why did you pay so much?

429
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:17,941
Why did you have to drink half a bottle?

430
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:19,921
Can't you even calculate your tab?

431
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:23,271
I told you my heart is worth 70 trillion won.

432
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:31,511
That's right! Seven trillion won is no big deal!

433
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:33,451
Go for the girl.

434
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:37,211
- Fighting. 
 - Fighting!

435
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:03,641
I believe Attorney Oh is having a fling with CEO Yoon Se Pil.

436
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,631
I suspect that's how she got the Hansu Bio files

437
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:08,681
and drove me out before she did that.

438
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:10,801
So?

439
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:14,191
CEO Yoon might already have Hansu Bio files.

440
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:17,861
If that's true, this is treason, CEO!

441
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,491
- Then what were you doing all this time? 
 - Pardon?

442
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:28,841
While Attorney Oh was committing treason, what were you doing?

443
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:32,411
Were you busy being entertained by clients here and there?

444
00:29:32,411 --> 00:29:34,641
- You couldn't quit that habit? 
 - No, Sir.

445
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:36,581
It's a misunderstanding. That has never happened.

446
00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:38,901
If you're not competent, you should learn to read the room.

447
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:42,611
If you can't read the room, learn to get some intel.

448
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:45,241
 Next news. 
    

449
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:49,381
 Hansu Group has postponed the sale of Hansu Bio. 
   

450
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:51,811
 The sales negotiation has been stalling, but 
   

451
00:29:51,811 --> 00:29:54,981
 the dominant news up until last week 

452
00:29:54,981 --> 00:29:59,161
 was that the sale of Hansu Bio would move rather quickly. 

453
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:02,901
 SP Partners who wanted to purchase Hansu Bio 

454
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,871
- He's never right. 
  - and H&amp;T Korea... 

455
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,091
  Hansu 

456
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:11,421
Min Yeong Bae is so excited.

457
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:15,371
He's saying something about you coming down from a suite with Yoon Se Pil.

458
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:17,261
What the hell are you up to?

459
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:20,101
Since when were you together with Yoon Se Pil?

460
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:32,851
Is that why you took Hansu Bio files?

461
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:36,091
What a low-quality novel you're writing.

462
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:37,911
Are you stalking me now?

463
00:30:37,911 --> 00:30:40,691
Can you really smile right now?

464
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:42,691
What the hell are you plotting with Yoon Se Pil?

465
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:44,141
What did you guys exchange?

466
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:46,341
- Hamburger. 
 - What?

467
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:49,541
We ate hamburgers while feeling each other out

468
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,331
and tried to figure out our direction.

469
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:53,711
Since everyone always serves you with finished work,

470
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:56,761
you have no idea how real work is done.

471
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:59,571
That's why your ears perked up at such a low-quality fiction

472
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:01,511
and you started imagining such weird things.

473
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:03,781
Hand it over then.

474
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:07,971
The Hansu Bio file you have. Prove to me that you didn't hand it over to Yoon Se Pil.

475
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:11,191
The sale has been postponed. Why the rush?

476
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:14,931
I'll open it up when I'm done studying it.

477
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:16,541
Wait a little while.

478
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,041
I'll show you in the most friendly manner.

479
00:31:28,401 --> 00:31:30,751
  Chairman Choi Tae Gook 

480
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:36,001
Baek seonbae is being so passionate about this, so I can't stop him. /   Seojung University Law School Legal Clinic Center takes Park Ji Yeong's case as its first 

481
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:40,441
Wrap it up quietly by getting her a reduced sentence.

482
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:46,571
I cannot accept any chaos associated with TK getting involved further.

483
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,861
And Ju Wan.

484
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:53,381
File his divorce.

485
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:54,591
Pardon?

486
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:58,921
My daughter-in-law wants both child custody and parental rights.

487
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:01,541
There is no way.

488
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,461
She'll contact you.

489
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:05,491
I told her you would take care of it.

490
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,021
No.

491
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:09,651
I will not do that.

492
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:13,911
I'll do everything else, but I won't do that, Chairman.

493
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:16,421
No, Su Jae.

494
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:20,281
You do what I tell you, whatever that may be.

495
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:21,871
That's what you do.

496
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:23,971
That's your job.

497
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:29,931
My people, who take my money from me, must do whatever I tell them to do.

498
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:32,551
That's the rule in my world.

499
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:39,261
Was the postponement on the sale of Hansu Bio also determined based on your rule?

500
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:42,651
Resumption of the sale is up to you.

501
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:46,531
Is that your way of saying hand over the files?

502
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:50,481
If so, I'll do my best to work toward the resumption of the sales.

503
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:53,071
Since it's up to me.

504
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:57,761
However, I will not work on Choi Ju Wan's divorce proceeding.

505
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:20,691
Ms.

506
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,271
Hi, it's you.

507
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,671
I want to wash my hands.

508
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,011
But I'm still too short.

509
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:42,151
Aren't you going to wash your hands, Ms.?

510
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,081
You touched this.

511
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:46,791
It could be dirty.

512
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,451
Okay.

513
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:56,031
I'm going to the airport to meet my mom.

514
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:58,531
My mom is coming from the States.

515
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:01,201
I'm going to the airport with my dad.

516
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:04,371
I'm wearing my uniform to show it to my mom.

517
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:08,341
My mom is so busy that she couldn't make it to my admission ceremony.

518
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:12,001
But my mom was so happy when she saw my pictures

519
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:14,241
that I want to show her wearing my uniform.

520
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,471
My Jae Yi!

521
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,811
- Where did you go? 
 - Daddy!

522
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:19,781
There!

523
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:22,671
- Should we eat jokbal today? 
 - Yes.

524
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,961
Mister!

525
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:29,541
Don't you dare have me

526
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:34,261
work on your divorce case.

527
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:38,211
You may have no conscience, but you should have some basic manners.

528
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,621
That's what makes us human.

529
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,850
 Pung PC Cafe 

530
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,881
 Mukbang YouTuber 
 (Mukbang: Livestream featuring a person eating a large quantity of food.) 

531
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:00,251
Hey, are you sure you saw it?

532
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:02,441
You should remember his face if you saw him!

533
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:03,471
I know.

534
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:06,931
I wasn't thinking and dozed off. Then it just passed.

535
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:10,921
You should've saved it then! What the heck were we doing for three hours here?

536
00:35:10,921 --> 00:35:12,891
If you work like this, I'll just fire you.

537
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:14,521
Geez, that's wrong!

538
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:16,511
I still gave you crucial information!

539
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:19,551
I'll make a report saying that an owner who goes to law school is power tripping.

540
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,551
I'll post it on SNS and make the PC room go out of business.

541
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:25,321
You always say we'll go camping and don't keep your promise.

542
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:28,111
Why bother saying you'll become the president?

543
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:30,811
They're so carefree.

544
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:35,061
All right. I'm sorry.

545
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:39,371
Then let's close the PC room next weekend and go camping. Deal?

546
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,191
 - Deal! 
 - Deal! 

547
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,591
You're a pretty good boss.

548
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,801
A boss is nothing without good employees.

549
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:51,101
They let me make a living, let my mom and dad buy a house,

550
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:52,901
and they're sending me to law school.

551
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,871
I should be good to them.

552
00:35:56,201 --> 00:35:58,671
I found it! This is it!

553
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:01,301
Where? Let's see it!

554
00:36:01,301 --> 00:36:03,751
 When it comes to chicken feet, Yeonnam chicken feet is the best. 
   

555
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:06,301
 Yeonnam-dong. 
   
    

556
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:08,921
 Now, there is so much collagen. 

557
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:11,701
 Everyone, we'll try eating tteokboki this time! 

558
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:13,991
- What's going on? It got cut off.   - It's so spicy . 

559
00:36:13,991 --> 00:36:16,111
 So spicy. 

560
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:32,301
 Hold on! 

561
00:36:32,301 --> 00:36:35,351
Who keeps ringing the bell like that?

562
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:36,331
Who are you?

563
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:37,480
Hot, hot, hot!

564
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,110
Hot, hot, hot!

565
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:44,811
Don't waste your time, and please leave.

566
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,571
Geez, it's all soggy.

567
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:56,571
You just have to give us the video you recorded that night.

568
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:58,901
How many times do I have to tell you?

569
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:01,451
I really don't want to get involved!

570
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:04,521
I finally passed 600 subscribers.

571
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:07,001
Geez, please leave. Get out.

572
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:08,961
I can't give it to you.

573
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:12,671
Besides, you're not even a cop. Coming here and doing this...

574
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:14,881
Isn't this illegal?

575
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,201
Wait.

576
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:20,231
So, it sounds like something did get recorded, didn't it?

577
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:24,111
And you didn't even report it, right?

578
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:26,791
- Let me call... 
 - Wait, wait, wait!

579
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,501
I said I don't know.

580
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:30,471
Report what?

581
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:31,881
Please leave.

582
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:35,211
I'm so irritated about my soggy ramen.

583
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,191
Hey, why do you only dwell on one thing?

584
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:40,031
Gosh, so frustrating.

585
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:42,531
Hand it over to us and see what happens.

586
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:45,341
If the case is resolved because of your recording,

587
00:37:45,341 --> 00:37:48,911
you can openly say, "My channel caught the culprit."

588
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:50,711
Six hundred subscribers?

589
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:53,221
You'll easily go over 6,000.

590
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:58,661
You could take care of this in one shot and move into a better place.

591
00:37:58,661 --> 00:37:59,891
M-Move?

592
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,891
- Right? 
 - Yeah, of course.

593
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:03,601
Only 6,000?

594
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:08,131
Well? 60,000? Easily.

595
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:10,911
60,000...

596
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:14,081
You know I work at Legal Clinic with Noona, right?

597
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:18,721
Why did that woman Park So Yeong fall to her death from there?

598
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:20,871
I thought she committed suicide because of Attorney Oh,

599
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:25,391
but her younger sister got arrested as a suspect and is under investigation.

600
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:28,901
We'll find out when the investigation result is out.

601
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:36,101
Is my father or Hyeong involved in that case?

602
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:38,351
They're not.

603
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:39,561
Are you sure?

604
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:44,671
That question is extremely insulting to those two men.

605
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:48,141
I'm relieved.

606
00:38:48,141 --> 00:38:53,120
Gosh, but Ajussi, why do I still feel so uneasy even after hearing you?

607
00:39:03,231 --> 00:39:06,541
As you requested, we made sure he's completely wasted.

608
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:09,571
He'll probably tell you everything you ask him.

609
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:11,001
I didn't come here tonight. Got it?

610
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:12,881
Aigoo, don't you worry.

611
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:18,011
I'll erase all the CCTV footage in here without a trace.

612
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:27,890
My uncle Han Seong Beom, who took everything my father owned

613
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:31,721
and didn't even give me a penny.

614
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:36,241
My cousin Han Dong Oh, who looks down on me!

615
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,541
This isn't fair, CEO Choi.

616
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:40,391
This is so unfair!

617
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:43,581
Gosh, I know how loyal you've been.

618
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,231
But you're not treated right.

619
00:39:45,231 --> 00:39:48,111
- I know all that. 
 - Thanks.

620
00:39:48,111 --> 00:39:50,401
You even buy me drinks like this.

621
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:57,331
I'm saying this only to you, Hyeongnim.

622
00:39:57,331 --> 00:40:01,461
I have all the files Su Jae took from you. All of them.

623
00:40:01,461 --> 00:40:03,171
Really?

624
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:05,591
- All of them? 
 - Yes.

625
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:07,371
So, you have that, CEO Choi...

626
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,361
So...

627
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:10,430
Geez, it's enormous,

628
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,440
and it's a hassle for me to study it all.

629
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:17,021
I'm thinking of just returning them to you, Hyeongnim.

630
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:22,031
Is there something you want to get back?

631
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:23,281
Really?

632
00:40:23,281 --> 00:40:26,111
If I really tell you, you'll give them to me?

633
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:33,551
A black USB.

634
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:36,011
The one we made for the Hansu Group anniversary.

635
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:39,071
If you give that back to me...

636
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:42,321
I see. That one?

637
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:50,381
Hyeongnim.

638
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,871
Hello?

639
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:54,891
Works great.

640
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:06,201
Thank you.

641
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:08,821
He'll wake up sometime around tomorrow afternoon.

642
00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:12,061
When he wakes up, he'll say, "Oh? What did I do last night?"

643
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:13,501
He won't remember anything.

644
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:16,491
His head will hurt like crazy.

645
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:20,181
The elders mentioned that you'd come in handy, Mr. Hong.

646
00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:21,971
Oh, yes.

647
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:26,701
Thanks to Chairman Han, I get to serve Assemblyman Lee and Chairman Choi.

648
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:31,201
And especially for Chairman Choi, I do everything myself without relaying it to my subordinates.

649
00:41:31,201 --> 00:41:33,201
He likes everything clean-cut.

650
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,921
He doesn't like it when other people get involved in his matters.

651
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:42,531
By chance, if you have anything to take care of quietly,

652
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:44,960
I'll consider it as if I'm serving Chairman Choi

653
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,440
and take care of it nicely and perfectly.

654
00:41:49,751 --> 00:41:51,491
That's nice.

655
00:41:51,491 --> 00:41:53,101
Thank you.

656
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:04,511
Daddy, are you watching me?

657
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:07,551
- Are you watching me? 
 - Yeah, good job!

658
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:09,611
Go and play now.

659
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:16,541
You have beautiful kids.

660
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:20,051
Attorney!

661
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:22,241
Do you exercise here?

662
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,741
I saw 27 billion won in slush funds,

663
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:29,041
but I couldn't open so many documents.

664
00:42:29,891 --> 00:42:33,041
Attorney, that's really...

665
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:35,561
I would rather you just kill me instead.

666
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:40,581
"Why did he make that USB and hide it?"

667
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:43,081
I thought about it.

668
00:42:43,081 --> 00:42:44,991
It's insurance.

669
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:50,481
It must've been insurance for you to use when you were pushed into a crisis.

670
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:55,770
 It's a book of shame that could destroy Chairman Han, Assemblyman Lee,  

671
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,500
  and Chairman Choi in one blow.  

672
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:00,761
Of course, you'd be ruined, too,

673
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:03,131
but you'd think, "I'm not going down alone."

674
00:43:03,131 --> 00:43:07,541
Insurance with a clear objective.

675
00:43:10,561 --> 00:43:13,591
Should I pretend that I didn't see it?

676
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:18,501
And in return?

677
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:21,431
Please give me answers on three matters.

678
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:23,851
What is it?

679
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,531
First,

680
00:43:25,531 --> 00:43:28,621
Park So Yeong's relationship with the three men.

681
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:32,481
I heard that Park So Yeong was pretty close to Chairman Han.

682
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:34,451
But I think a little differently.

683
00:43:34,451 --> 00:43:38,851
Was it only with Chairman Han?

684
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:40,361
Second,

685
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:43,740
the person who helped you put away 27 billion won

686
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,070
without your uncle's knowledge.

687
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:50,901
I've known you for around ten years, Chief.

688
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:54,871
You know, I know you're not that gutsy.

689
00:43:54,871 --> 00:43:56,161
Third,

690
00:43:56,161 --> 00:44:00,431
hurry up and resume the sale of Hansu Bio.

691
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:03,041
It's so obvious what Chairman Han must've said.

692
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:06,651
Out of the blue, he said, "Postpone the sale." Right?

693
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:10,411
Find out who encouraged him to make such an unnecessary move

694
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:12,611
and get the sale back on track.

695
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,961
Your kids are so beautiful.

696
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:24,781
They must take after their mom.

697
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:28,421
Hi!

698
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:37,161
  Han Gi Taek 

699
00:44:49,641 --> 00:44:53,131
I heard an arrest warrant was issued, and she was moved into a detention center.

700
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,361
Do you think there's a way to help her?

701
00:44:55,361 --> 00:44:58,741
I'll meet with the team members. Something will come up.

702
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:01,641
I met Chairman Choi yesterday.

703
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:10,241
 Tell me whatever you need for the legal clinic, Seonbaenim. 

704
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:14,081
 It's not because my son is there. 

705
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:19,961
 The only thing I'm concerned about 

706
00:45:19,961 --> 00:45:23,121
 is for them to keep an appropriate boundary. 

707
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:29,821
 I'm not trying to force anything on you. 

708
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:32,340
It's up to you, the center director,

709
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,110
to decide what kind of case Legal Clinic takes on.

710
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:39,441
I'm just saying it's better not to worry others around us.

711
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:42,341
That's how matters of the world go.

712
00:45:42,341 --> 00:45:45,951
Let it take its natural course. That's the best we could do.

713
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:49,011
A word from Chairman Choi

714
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:52,041
means a lot to you, Director.

715
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,780
Even before you brought this up,

716
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,541
Legal Clinic was working on Park Ji Yeong's case.

717
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,831
I've already made the decision

718
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:07,481
and I'll take responsibility for the concerns and worries of those around us.

719
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:10,411
Whether that's going with the flow or not...

720
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:14,061
well, is that important?

721
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:19,781
The day Park Ji Yeong's house was broken into,

722
00:46:19,781 --> 00:46:23,901
the CCTV in front of her house captured a suspicious man.

723
00:46:32,951 --> 00:46:35,071
No matter how much I enlarge the footage,

724
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:39,761
neither the license place nor the man's face were captured.

725
00:46:39,761 --> 00:46:42,791
But he has a unique stride.

726
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,871
Oh, you're right!

727
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:49,721
Of course, Detective Jo. You got something there.

728
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:51,880
Observing the person's

729
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,300
stride out of potential trespassers would help.

730
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:56,071
Professor.

731
00:46:57,971 --> 00:47:02,071
I think Park So Yeong was pregnant at the time of her death.

732
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:04,011
Pregnant?

733
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:06,031
  DNA Parentage Test Report 

734
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,611
Did you know, by chance?

735
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:10,621
Yeah, I knew.

736
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:14,321
But I didn't think it was directly related to her death,

737
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:15,701
so I didn't tell you guys.

738
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:20,321
If you look at that document, Park So Yeong requested a paternity test for the fetus.

739
00:47:20,321 --> 00:47:22,511
Testing for the paternity of the fetus is prohibited.

740
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:23,931
And she did that?

741
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:26,111
That's why she did it overseas.

742
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:29,421
The result came in after Park So Yeong died.

743
00:47:29,421 --> 00:47:32,691
Park Ji Yeong was keeping that in her school locker.

744
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:33,921
Her locker?

745
00:47:33,921 --> 00:47:36,541
Oh, because someone broke into her house?

746
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:38,941
That's why she had removed her name tag from the locker.

747
00:47:38,941 --> 00:47:44,351
Then it's highly likely that the man Park So Yeong was seeing is the culprit.

748
00:47:59,241 --> 00:48:03,191
  Prosecutors' Office 

749
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:06,201
You can't just barge in here like this.

750
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,451
Decide after you see what I have.

751
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:13,011
Sure, let's do that.

752
00:48:13,011 --> 00:48:15,241
Legal Clinic Center or whatever.

753
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:19,711
I get that you feel rushed since it's been in the news loud and clear.

754
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:25,161
But if you're trying to negotiate her sentence, just take it and leave.

755
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:28,341
If you leave, we'll just say this never happened.

756
00:48:28,341 --> 00:48:31,841
Don't try to negotiate with me.

757
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:34,011
Why don't you leave quietly?

758
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:38,371
Come on.

759
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:45,241
 For people who like spicy food, you'll go crazy over this. 

760
00:48:45,241 --> 00:48:46,401
 Wow... 

761
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:48,601
What's with this nutjob?

762
00:48:48,601 --> 00:48:51,051
 When it comes to chicken feet, Yeonnam chicken feet is the best. 

763
00:48:51,051 --> 00:48:53,571
 Yeonnam-dong. 

764
00:48:53,571 --> 00:48:57,061
 Now, there is so much collagen. 

765
00:48:57,061 --> 00:49:00,001
 I heard this is good for your skin, too. 

766
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:02,111
 Gosh, it's so spicy! 

767
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:04,781
What's that?

768
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:06,391
- Where is that? 
  - But I don't drink water. 

769
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:10,181
It's the TK Law Firm rooftop garden.

770
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:21,771
There's no need for a trial.

771
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:24,331
Release Park Ji Yeong.

772
00:49:27,111 --> 00:49:29,251
Park Ji Yeong will be released today.

773
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:30,771
 Really? That's great. 

774
00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:32,201
 Good work. 

775
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:33,931
 I can tell the team members, right? 

776
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:35,051
Go ahead.

777
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:37,471
Oh, yeah. I just got the paperwork you mentioned.

778
00:49:37,471 --> 00:49:39,411
I'll leave it on your desk.

779
00:49:40,501 --> 00:49:43,960
  Partner Oh Su Jae 

780
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:49,300
  DNA Parentage Test Report 

781
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:52,221
 You know, this just 

782
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:54,511
 says the fetus and the father are biologically related, 

783
00:49:54,511 --> 00:49:59,291
 but I think we need to find out who the father is. 

784
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:02,031
 Who are you thinking of? 

785
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:09,050
  Subject 1 and Subject 2 are not biologically related 

786
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:14,380
  Director Baek Jin Gi 

787
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:17,571
Yes.

788
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:19,761
I heard the news. Park Ji Yeong will be released?

789
00:50:19,761 --> 00:50:21,251
Good work.

790
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,461
Don't mention it.

791
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:24,241
It didn't go to trial. Good job.

792
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:26,781
You let it take its course. Good.

793
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,221
  Director Baek Jin Gi 

794
00:50:36,221 --> 00:50:39,091
 Let it take its natural course. 

795
00:50:39,091 --> 00:50:43,271
 Inspector General Choi Tae Gook will retire as soon as this case is closed. 

796
00:50:43,271 --> 00:50:45,601
 And then he'll open up a law firm. 

797
00:50:45,601 --> 00:50:48,621
 Let things take their course and close out. Then move to that law firm. 

798
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:50,641
 He'll help you grow. 

799
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:53,481
 Baek Jin Gi seonbae is there as the director. 

800
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:55,331
 He's extremely concerned about you. 

801
00:50:55,331 --> 00:50:57,271
 He said he'd open up an adjunct professorship for you. 

802
00:50:57,271 --> 00:50:59,301
 You know Park Ji Yeong? 

803
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:04,111
 As the first case for Legal Clinic, how about we help Park Ji Yeong? 

804
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:06,281
 Choi Tae Gook. 

805
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,661
 Baek Jin Gi. 

806
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:16,481
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

807
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:20,501

809
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:26,201
  Kang Eun Seo 

810
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:28,221
 Happy birthday! 

811
00:51:34,111 --> 00:51:35,861
Wait!

812
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:40,421
Excuse me.

813
00:51:51,551 --> 00:51:53,481
Ms. Eun Seo.

814
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:56,201
You like this, don't you?

815
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:41,931
 You'll be arrested without a warrant soon. 

816
00:52:41,931 --> 00:52:44,341
 As a suspect for the Park So Yeong case. 

817
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:45,201
 What? 

818
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:48,901
 Go to jail for a short time. I'll let you go soon. 

819
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:51,041
 Are you crazy? 

820
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:53,981
 - You're nuts. 
 - The hospital bill. 

821
00:52:53,981 --> 00:52:56,911
 Your payment is pretty late. 

822
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:59,241
 I heard you're behind on your rent, too. 

823
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:00,911
 It's all because of you. 

824
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,911
 My eonni died because of you! 

825
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:05,391
 Don't be ridiculous! 

826
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:08,351
 You also know I didn't do it. 

827
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,971
 Tell me what you really want. 

828
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,461
 Reinvestigation. 

829
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:20,771
 Reinvestigation by the police. 

830
00:53:21,841 --> 00:53:25,811
 If you're arrested, the police have no choice but to reinvestigate. 

831
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:28,331
 Write up a fake diary. 

832
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:31,041
 Make it believable as if you hate your sister. 

833
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,051
 When you're arrested, exercise your right to stay silent. 

834
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:36,051
 Do you understand? 

835
00:53:43,031 --> 00:53:45,241
Yes, this is Oh Su Jae.

836
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:47,721
My mom's hospital bill.

837
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:51,081
I'll make sure I pay you back.

838
00:53:51,081 --> 00:53:52,961
 How old are you? 

839
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:55,101
Eighteen.

840
00:53:58,451 --> 00:54:04,811
The fact that your sister is gone will be tough on you in the future.

841
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:08,261
But you should live your own life.

842
00:54:08,261 --> 00:54:10,071
You must.

843
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:14,171
Be sure to stay alert.

844
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:17,061
Don't let anyone control you.

845
00:54:17,961 --> 00:54:19,811
Do you understand?

846
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:24,241
Thank you.

847
00:54:36,261 --> 00:54:39,110
  Gong Chan 

848
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,440
- Hey. 
  - I wanted to apologize to you. 

849
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:46,891
For what?

850
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:51,791
I misunderstood initially and thought you turned Park Ji Yeong in to the police.

851
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:53,561
But you said you believed me.

852
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:57,831
I did, but it's true I did misunderstand you.

853
00:54:57,831 --> 00:54:59,871
I was foolish.

854
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:02,501
 I'll never do that again. 

855
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:04,611
Never again.

856
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:06,471
I really won't.

857
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:11,061
You also did a good job.

858
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:15,121
 Good job. You did well. 

859
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:16,541
- No. 
 - Hyeong!

860
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:17,931
I didn't do anything.

861
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:20,311
A woman. A woman?

862
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:25,481
 I think you misunderstood another thing. 

863
00:55:26,321 --> 00:55:27,161
Excuse me?

864
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:30,341
Net worth seven trillion won. He's not my boyfriend.

865
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:31,901
What?

866
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:41,721
Crazy. I must be crazy. Really.

867
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:54,831
 Hey! Seven trillion won is no big deal! 

868
00:56:04,701 --> 00:56:08,581
He must've made his move and was rejected.

869
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:10,621
Why did I drink...

870
00:57:25,051 --> 00:57:28,530
  Gong Chan 

871
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:50,041
Professor.

872
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:52,581
Professor?

873
00:57:52,581 --> 00:57:54,831
Hi, it's me. You're close?

874
00:57:54,831 --> 00:57:56,391
That's right. It's right across the street from the school.

875
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:58,131
Yeonsu-ro 2, number 22.

876
00:57:58,131 --> 00:58:00,691
Come straight up to the second floor.

877
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:12,571
Hey, she'll call you trash if you keep coming onto her after she rejected you!

878
00:58:12,571 --> 00:58:14,961
Don't go, man!

879
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,471
Who the hell are you!

880
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:28,761
Who are you!

881
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:52,210
  Why Her? 

882
00:58:54,540 --> 00:59:01,460


883
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,911
 A report came in last night. 

884
00:59:10,911 --> 00:59:12,891
 There was a report of a burglar in the building. 

885
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:14,691
 It was Attorney Oh Su Jae's building. 

886
00:59:14,691 --> 00:59:19,061
 I have to see what his face looks like while facing me today after having pulled that stunt. 

887
00:59:19,061 --> 00:59:21,711
 Hey, you stupid idiot! 

888
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:25,261
 Steal something or hurt someone. 

889
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,951
 You'll look for it? Don't look for it. 

890
00:59:26,951 --> 00:59:29,081
 You could be in danger again. Don't do anything. 

891
00:59:29,081 --> 00:59:30,711
 He must be looking for the USB. 

892
00:59:30,711 --> 00:59:33,941
 I don't think she should know until we open it and check. 

893
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:37,721
 The main dish should come in after the appetizer. 

894
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:41,181
 Tell the chairman to join us.
