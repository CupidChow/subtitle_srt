 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,490


3
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,340
 That incident from ten years ago is also something I want to forget, 

4
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,350
 although I can't compare my feelings to yours. 

5
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,840
 Forget— 

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,990
Something you want to forget?

7
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,970
 This court sentences the defendant Kim Dong Gu to ten years of imprisonment. 

8
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,500
 I abandoned... 

9
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,730
 you. 

10
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,270
  Episode 12 

11
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,790
 I did my utmost to forget about my guilt toward you. 

12
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,890
  Kim Dong Gu, who raped and murdered his stepsister, was released 

13
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,910
  The true culprit, caught after one year, Kim Dong Gu acquitted 

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,640
 When you were found not guilty, 

15
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,290
 I was relieved. 

16
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,460
I can't believe this happened.

17
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,350
I thought Kim Dong Gu was the culprit.

18
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,370
It seems I got myself into trouble before retirement.

19
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,990
Is there a need to concern yourself with the past?

20
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,870
Attorney Oh, you shouldn't worry too much, either.

21
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,390
It's not even worth it.

22
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,890
A past case is meaningless, whether I won or not.

23
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,970
The present is more important.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,740
Give it to me.

25
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,200
This is why Attorney Oh is growing on me.

26
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,310
  Song Mi Rim 

27
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,560
Yeah.

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,360
Attorney Oh, the man named No Byeong Chool...

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,850
I looked into him, and he's suddenly being transferred to solitary confinement today.

30
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,340
They're usually very cautious when they're about to be released on parole,

31
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,920
 but he apparently got into a fight. 

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,770
- It's not me. 
 - Hurry up and come out!

33
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,710
Seriously. This is driving me crazy.

34
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,140
- Why would I fight right now? 
 - Don't move!

35
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,270
I didn't do anything!

36
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,250
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

37
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,290
Hold on. Bring me Seo Joon Myeong.

38
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,300
I said, bring me Seo Joon Myeong!

39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,500
  Nine years ago 

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,260
 Just because there's no one around to see or hear me, 

41
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,000
 you keep me in here for ten days... 

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,050
 I'm not someone you should take lightly. 

43
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,770
 Of course, I know. 

44
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,180
 That's why the U.S. court even sent an official notice, 

45
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,480
 asking us to immediately send you their way. 

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,580
 Send me. 

47
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,990
 Then just send me! 

48
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,290
 Do you know what'll happen if you go? 

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,120
 Some piece of shit who's just like you got caught recently. 

50
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,110
 He put up a server in the States, just as you did. 

51
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,490
 He uploaded thousands of videos of sexual exploitation. 
    

52
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,060
 He was about nineteen years old, 

53
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,120
 but he got sentenced to life. 

54
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,220
 But as soon as that young kid got to prison, 

55
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,030
 he was beaten up by some burly bastards 

56
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,420
 and was carried away unconscious. 

57
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,660
 How about it? 

58
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,660
 Now, are you willing to try having a little something called a conversation with me? 

59
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,640
 Huh? 

60
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:24,590
 The real culprit of Jeon Na Jeong's case that shook the nation last September was caught. 

61
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,060
 The real culprit, No Byeong Chool, had seven previous records of rape, robbery, and drug dealing. 

62
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,830
 He was recently arrested and charged 

63
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,010
 for creating a server in the U.S. and uploading thousands of sexual exploitation videos. 

64
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,840
 During the investigation, we had suspicions regarding the case of Jeon Na Jeong and after the interrogation, 

65
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,300
 we were able to get his confession to the crime. 

66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,630
 What will happen to Kim Dong Gu, who's currently serving time for Jeong Na Jeong's case? 

67
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,900
 Since the real culprit was identified, we will be working with haste 

68
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,110
 to withdraw the charges against and release Kim Dong Gu. 

69
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,160
 Didn't all the evidence and witnesses at the time point to Kim Dong Gu as the culprit? 

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,670
 The evidence found at the scene was planted by No Byeong Chool. 

71
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,810
 Other evidence is irrelevant to the case. 

72
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,580
 Witness testimonies were found to be based on faulty memory. 

73
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,080
 What will happen to the SBC program Unanswered Questions' coverage of 

74
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,180
 Kim Dong Gu's innocence that is airing tomorrow night? 

75
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,200
 I am not sure. Since the real culprit, No Byeong Chool, was caught, 

76
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,110
 will the program be profitable? 

77
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,250
  No Byeong Chool 

78
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,470
  Certificate of Release 

79
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,410
 Hey, I know you're excited about leaving, but you should focus when you're working. 

80
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,010
 Okay. 

81
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,700
 I'll bring some more wood. 

82
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,110
 Go ahead. 

83
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,660
 They said Kim Dong Gu was the culprit, but now it's No Byeong Chool? 

84
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,750
 They'll catch another bastard and put him in here at this rate. 

85
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,650
 How many times do I have to tell you? 

86
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,730
 No Byeong Chool is the culprit.   

87
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,980
 What the hell do you want? 

88
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:12,370
 The management fee for No Byeong Chool will be double that of Kim Dong Gu. 

89
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,390
 All right. All right. 

90
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,050
 Management fee... 

91
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,900
 The wrist tattoo. 

92
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,030
 No Byeong Chool 

93
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,800
 You're not the culprit. 

94
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,130
The guy who framed me as the culprit

95
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,690
and used you as a cover-up,

96
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,450
I'm going to catch him.

97
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,430
 Articles related to Kim Dong Gu 

98
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,430
  Inspector General Choi Tae Gook, who directed the Ungju City Step Sibling Murder Case, to honorably retire 

99
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,400
  Inspector General Choi Tae Kook became well known for his work in "Ungju City Step Sibling Murder Case"... 

100
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,960
Father...

101
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,600
What are you doing?

102
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,640
I had something to look up.

103
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,600
Of all people, you're working too hard-working under Su Jae.

104
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,920
Hyeong.

105
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,640
You want to go for a drink?

106
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,420
I didn't realize that you were so well aware of the cases that Father was in charge of.

107
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,950
I know it very well.

108
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,630
I don't know about other cases, but I know that one.

109
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,980
It turns out that Noona was totally destroyed as the public defender of that case.

110
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,630
How could she still work for Father after that?

111
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,310
Father isn't someone who'd allow that.

112
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,870
You punk. How clever of you.

113
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,200
Your law school director, Baek Jin Gi.

114
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,170
He's Father's seonbae.

115
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,970
He was also Su Jae's mentor.

116
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,680
Father sent the appropriate signs through him.

117
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,360
Sign? What...

118
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Think about it, man.

119
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,350
Father is the inspector general, and the Kim Dong Gu thing exploded.

120
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,770
When he needs to bring justice to Kim Dong Gu,

121
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,220
some public defender named Oh Su Jae gets in the way.

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,550
What do you think Father did?

123
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,380
Our father.

124
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,420
So you are saying

125
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,170
Noona did not defend him properly?

126
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,620
Not even that, man.

127
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,590
She set out to lose the case,

128
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,760
stabbing Kim Dong Gu right in the back.

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,630
Hey, the world

130
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,250
is moved with these, you punk.

131
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,950
Through the hands of our father, Chairman Choi Tae Gook.

132
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,590
You got it?

133
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,080
It turns out the world is like that.

134
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,200
The world is like that...

135
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,430
The wind feels quite nice. Drive more slowly.

136
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,920
Yes, Sir.

137
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,730
 I'll make myself clear now. 

138
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,390
 Unfortunately, I do not see CEO Choi Ju Wan as a human being. 

139
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,200
 I've also never worked for someone else's good. 

140
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,750
 It was always for my own good. 

141
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,430
 So I'll never belong to anyone. 

142
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,120
 She doesn't even know what lies in front of her. 

143
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,230
 Not even aware that she's playing into the palms of my hands. 

144
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,990
 You have too many things getting in the way, so you stop right here, but not me. 

145
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,840
 I put everything on the line to protect her. 

146
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,340
 So, have a nice life as Chairman Choi Tae Gook's son. 

147
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,430
No, Kim Dong Gu.

148
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,330
You can't, either.

149
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,870
You can never do that, either.

150
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,700
Did you come to see this child? Jeon Na Jeong. 
   Jeon Na Jeong  

151
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,340
 What brings you here? 

152
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,900
 I... 

153
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,310
 have a daughter. 

154
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,870
 She got into a big accident ten years ago. 

155
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,800
 What accident did she get into? 

156
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,620
 A girl named Jeon Na Jeong... 

157
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,840
 I found out later that she helped my daughter. 

158
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,040
 But she had already passed on from an unfortunate event. 

159
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,050
 Na Jeong... 

160
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,050
 how did you help his daughter? 

161
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,250
 I couldn't rescue... 

162
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,840
 or even help you. 

163
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,730
  Pilates 

164
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,350
So, about Jeon Na Jeong.

165
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,030
You have been watching me, haven't you?

166
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,320
Since when?

167
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,430
 Hey, 

168
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,140
 you know we made the most sales today since the opening, right? 

169
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,180
 I'm so stoked, man. Let's put up a banner and 

170
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,480
 throw a big party. A party. 

171
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,960
 Okay. 

172
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,480
  Seojung University School of Law 2018 

173
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,770
  Seojung University School of Law 2018 

174
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,530
 The admissions brochure in the mailbox... 
   

175
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,880
It was there again the following year...

176
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,320
So that was all your doing?

177
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,020
 When I saw you at the interview, 
   

178
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,630
 I was so proud of you 

179
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,460
 and I was glad. 

180
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,480
Why were you watching over me?

181
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,460
Do you think No Byeong Chool is the real culprit?

182
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,630
Why would you say something like that?

183
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,360
Do you think he is not the culprit?

184
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,120
On what basis?

185
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,270
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

186
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,340
I have to go home and get some sleep now.

187
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,250
We stayed up all night because of Chan.

188
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,380
What are we even doing?

189
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,130
Don't you think I smell?

190
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,380
Whoa, you really stayed up all night?

191
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,800
What is it, you all?

192
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,090
What made you give up sleep and call for me?

193
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,890
Kim Dong Gu.

194
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,250
 Ungju Step-sibling Murder Case Kim Dong Gu "Innocent"  

195
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,690
Gong Chan is Kim Dong Gu.

196
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,510
Ji Soon Ok is Gong Chan's stepmother.

197
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,930
Kim Dong Gu is Jeon Na Jeong's stepbrother.

198
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,170
He was framed as the culprit of the Jeon Na Jeong case ten years ago

199
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,630
and was imprisoned unjustly for a year.

200
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,820
Professor was his public defender at the time.

201
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,890
You guys found all that out, huh?

202
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,170
You knew about all this, Attorney Song?

203
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,810
I found out yesterday, too.

204
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,540
It was when I went to the police with Yoon Sang for some other matter.

205
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,810
 The Yeongpyeong District remains. That is my sister, Jeon Na Jeong! 

206
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,800
 - Hey, hey! 
 - Hurry and investigate! 

207
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,530
What?

208
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,980
Chan said the remains were his sister's?

209
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,680
What is this about now...

210
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,550
Don't you think Professor knew it all along?

211
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,570
That Chan is Kim Dong Gu.

212
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,870
That isn't the case.

213
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,950
She just found out too.

214
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,100
Right?

215
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,820
I didn't recognize Chan as Kim Dong Gu, either.

216
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,500
You've seen Kim Dong Gu before, too?

217
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,140
Yeah, when I was a newbie.

218
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,080
Our precinct was in charge of that case.

219
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,510
Ungju City Step Sibling Murder.

220
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,800
 It's not me. 

221
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,630
 - Shut up, you bastard. 
 - Why did you hit me? 

222
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,060
 You're dead if you claim that at the court, understand? 

223
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,580
 I'm telling you it's not me. 

224
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,210
 Come, you bastard. 

225
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,090
 - Come! 
 - I said take it easy, man! 

226
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,240
 Walk straight. 

227
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,290
 It's not me. Let me go. 

228
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,450
 Who are you, the newbie? 

229
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,930
 You know Kim Dong Gu, right? 

230
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,710
 The son of a bitch who raped and killed his stepsister. 

231
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,990
 He deserves capital punishment. 

232
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,010
 A fucker like him doesn't deserve rights. 

233
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,350
 I saw him, sure. 

234
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,840
But I only watched.

235
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,620
The expression on his face was of someone who was in pain and being wronged.

236
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,600
Okay. One, two, three.

237
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,670
It's done.

238
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,460
Hurry up.

239
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,840
Ready?

240
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
Lift up. One, two, three.

241
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,540
  Gong Chan 

242
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,500
  Gong Chan 

243
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,370
 Professor, I will find it. 

244
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,700
I'll find the proof that No Byeong Chool is not the real culprit.

245
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,920
There's someone who has the same idea as me.

246
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,010
He said that Na Jeong helped his daughter that night.

247
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,350
I'll be able to find something.

248
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,390
I'm not interested.

249
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,170
Kim Dong Gu.

250
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,760
I told you. Keep your distance.

251
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,430
Remember what I said.

252
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,500
Oh, Su Jae, hold on, hold on.

253
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,680
It's so heavy.

254
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,020
Hey!

255
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,540
The house entrance is so spacious!

256
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,420
Hey, look at this girl. Aigoo, aigoo!

257
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,040
Whoa!

258
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,220
It's so nice.

259
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,610
You should've called us over sooner for a housewarming.

260
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,160
Oh yeah, and

261
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,300
I have so much to consult with you right now.

262
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,580
I have to divorce and so much more.

263
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,940
Divorce, all of a sudden?

264
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,840
Hey, take a hint.

265
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,650
It's not sudden. You don't know well.

266
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,040
Su Jae knows what I'm talking about.

267
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,970
I want to get a divorce, Su Jae. It's crazy. I want a divorce.

268
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,470
Hear me out, okay?

269
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,490
All right. Just drink quietly.

270
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,020
Okay.

271
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,310
I don't think she even ate dinner.

272
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,090
Looks like it.

273
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,640
She's even skinnier.

274
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,810
She'll disappear at this rate.

275
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,710
Su Jae, we brought so much yummy food.

276
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,450
Let's have a feast.

277
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,950
Eat away.

278
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,080
Su Jae...

279
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,210
What, girl?

280
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,960
Tell Chan.

281
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,150
You didn't abandon Kim Dong Gu.

282
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,070
You didn't have any other choice back then.

283
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,230
Tell him why you did what you did.

284
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,820
He'll understand when he hears you.

285
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,790
It's not something that needs to be understood.

286
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,750
It doesn't even make sense to ask for understanding.

287
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,840
Gosh, this girl is cleaning up in this mess.

288
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,550
Just leave it. We'll clean up later.

289
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,250
Gosh. What is this? You were working, too?

290
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,240
Kim Dong Gu. 
   Kim Dong Gu, 18 at the time 

291
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,490
Jeon Na Jeong. 
   Jeon Na Jeong, September 4, 2012    

292
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:20,300
"Struck hard at the construction site but was at the beach when he came to."

293
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,290
Hey, Chan is indeed innocent.

294
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,270
Yes, he is innocent.

295
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,630
Choi Tae Gook was the inspector general, and Seo Joon Myeong was the prosecutor back then?

296
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,170
What a small world.

297
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,360
Attorney Oh, this is...

298
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,580
"When I went to get her..."

299
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,710
By chance, did Gong Chan write all this?

300
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,920
If No Byeong Chool is not the culprit.

301
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,920
If someone framed Kim Dong Gu,

302
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,540
then he must've made No Byeong Chool the real culprit.

303
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,900
Also, how No Byeong Chool was locked up in

304
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,340
solitary confinement right before his parole, after suddenly getting sucked into a fight.

305
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,460
It's most likely someone's behind all this.

306
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,380
Why would someone do that?

307
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,210
Because the remains were found.

308
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,740
When the remains were found,

309
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,920
the culprit, that person behind the scenes, must have recognized it.

310
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,050
That their work has been exposed.

311
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,340
Jeon Na Jeong... 
   Jeon Na Jeong, September 4, 2012 

312
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,100
I've heard of that name somewhere.

313
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,430
Oh, it's probably because this case is so well known

314
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,390
that even a toddler would know.

315
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,390
No, this is from 10 years ago.

316
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,500
I was so busy doing resident work at that time.

317
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,670
I barely slept.

318
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,880
I didn't even know that Su Jae took up this case.

319
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,580
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

320
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,170
I definitely have heard the name, Jeon Na Jeong before.

321
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,850
 

322
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,000
- Chief. 
 - Yes.

323
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,040
That Choi Yoon Sang...

324
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,570
Out of the blue, he asked me a few days ago to show him the Kim Dong Gu case files.

325
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,800
 Kim Dong Gu case files? 

326
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,890
 Why all of a sudden? 

327
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,080
 I find it interesting that Attorney Oh, whom I work for has a case she completely lost. 

328
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,550
 If I give you that, what can you give me, as the second son of Chairman Choi? 

329
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,260
 Although not right away, wouldn't it make me want to hand it over to you 

330
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,390
 if something is in it for me as well? 

331
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,300
 Will it suffice to say that 

332
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,250
 I'll be better than my hyeong? 

333
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,760
 Please forget what happened at the school. 

334
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,340
So... did you give him the case files?

335
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,500
No reason not to give them to him. I won the case.

336
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,650
Also, I did what Chairman told me to do on that case.

337
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,180
I'm just telling you to look into it.

338
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,930
Who knows?

339
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,100
Perhaps a reason for Chairman Choi to know about it may also come out.

340
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,500
  Police Database 

341
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,980
Nothing's coming up.

342
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,590
It was only ten years ago.

343
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,530
Shouldn't the victim's DNA be present in the police database?

344
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,300
I know. It should be there.

345
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,860
What do we do then?

346
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,470
For now, let's gather your DNA.

347
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,600
Comparing it with the DNA of the remains will take about a week?

348
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,830
Within a few days, if it's early.

349
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,760
Don't worry too much.

350
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,850
Well, since we've overcome a big obstacle

351
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,280
a bit of day drinking is fine, right?

352
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,900
Thank you for swiftly and boldly completing due diligence.

353
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,760
Let's take it easy from now on, too.

354
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,680
Okay.

355
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,430
Attorney Oh, you've also done a great job.

356
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,180
I look forward to continuing to work with you.

357
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,070
Please continue to take good care of us until the end.

358
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,200
- Sure. 
 - Oh, my.

359
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,290
What would I have done without you, Attorney Min?

360
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,380
Gosh, not at all.

361
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,900
It was all possible thanks to you, Director Han.

362
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,950
Now, a toast for the newly found close relationship between

363
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,490
SP Partners CEO Yoon Se Pil and Hansu Group.

364
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,130
 Cheers! 

365
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,610
 Delivery. 

366
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,250
Oh, is that it?

367
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,230
Yes, I was going to have it sent to your office,

368
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,990
but something nice like this should be viewed with everyone.

369
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,170
Taking it with me won't be a problem.

370
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,740
Then shall we open it?

371
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,090
Wow...

372
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,630
  Song Mi Rim 

373
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,330
Wow...

374
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,860
Yeah.

375
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,010
 Jeon Na Jeong's DNA wasn't in the police database. 

376
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,400
So, we still gathered Ji Soon Ok's DNA regardless.

377
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,100
And I'm not sure if No Byeong Chool is still in solitary confinement, but visitation is not allowed.

378
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,040
Continue checking on him.

379
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,110
Wow, this is outstanding.

380
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,850
This is a painting, right?

381
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,410
- Ph-Photo? 
 - It's a photo.

382
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,240
Aigoo, I got chills. No wonder.

383
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,740
No wonder.

384
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,570
This is not something I would boast about in front of you, but I was in the photography club in high school.

385
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,320
I was in the photography club in high school.

386
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,570
Oh, really?

387
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,670
So, I know a little bit about pictures.

388
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,210
Was this the 2:8 ratio?

389
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,280
 Director Baek almost became my father-in-law. 

390
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,760
The photo is so...

391
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,480
The photographer is...

392
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,140
Are these rain drops?

393
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,400
Distancing and everything.

394
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,990
Wow, this is really nice.

395
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,380
The mood is so nice.

396
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,690
Wow, really, really nice.

397
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,030
You said you had something to tell me,

398
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,820
but you've been silent for 15 minutes.

399
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,310
Kang Eun Seo.

400
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,000
Director Baek Jin Gi's daughter, Kang Eun Seo.

401
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,630
You had told me about her.

402
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,360
Of all people, to me.

403
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,870
What is Kang Eun Seo doing, and where is she?

404
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,640
She is currently in a nursing home because her health is not good.

405
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,850
Is that why you didn't marry her?

406
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,740
Because the woman you love is ill?

407
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,270
She got into an accident ten years ago

408
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,100
and that accident was the last of her memories.

409
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,260
Excuse me.

410
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,370
I'm in a meeting right now.

411
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,500
 I remember, Su Jae. I remember Jeon Na Jeong. 

412
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,720
I found my diary from when I was an ER resident.

413
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,770
 On the night of September 4, 2012, Jeon Na Jeong was admitted to the ER from a car accident. 

414
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,160
And then?

415
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,290
But it wasn't Jeon Na Jeong. It was someone else.

416
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,450
 She's in critical condition. 

417
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,820
 She's a hit-and-run victim. 

418
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,070
 The right leg has been fractured. 

419
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,950
 - blood pressure and pulse... 
 - She was Kang Eun Seo, not Jeon Na Jeong. 

420
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,760
 Kang Eun Seo came in with Jeon Na Jeong's clothes. 

421
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,560
 We were in such a hurry to get her to surgery first, 

422
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,200
 but there were signs of sexual assault. 

423
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,080
I understand.

424
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,830
 He said that Na Jeong helped his daughter that night. 

425
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,030
 I'll be able to find something. 

426
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,560
Ms. Kang Eun Seo...

427
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,620
was involved in an incident, not an accident, right?

428
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,230
Is that why, even now,

429
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,010
she's still trapped in that hell?

430
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,100
You're asking so straightforwardly

431
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,820
that I feel overwhelmed.

432
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,870
Let's stop here today.

433
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,440
Nothing like a sauna when your body's feeling stiff.

434
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,000
The hospital bed is such trash.

435
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,840
Aigoo. I saw on the news that your approval ratings rose again.

436
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,280
You should buy us dinner.

437
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,290
I don't know.

438
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,870
Approval ratings aren't everything.

439
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,390
There are worries even within the camp about me becoming a two-year president.

440
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,660
Just to be a president for two years, you know?

441
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,780
If you don't like it that much, you can withdraw the promise.

442
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,930
I was wracking my brain to make you president.

443
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,430
There's nothing we can do if you don't like it.

444
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,610
Come on now. Really?

445
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,930
Are you sure I can undo the promise if I don't like it?

446
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,640
Of course.

447
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,710
Instead, you won't make it to the Blue House.

448
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,510
Geez.

449
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,080
 This is Hansu Group news. 
   

450
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,170
 With the Yeongpyeong District construction resuming, 

451
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,350
 Hansu Group's sale of Hansu Bio 

452
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,290
 - is also sailing smoothly.  
 - Turn to another channel.

453
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,990
 The due diligence on Hansu Bio is proceeding smoothly. 
   

454
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,280
 We also have a good relationship with Hansu Group. 
    

455
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,270
SP Partners intend to wrap up the acquisition process as soon as possible.

456
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,030
 Thank you. 

457
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,510
Okay.

458
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,110
Good, good.

459
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,230
I think you should buy us dinner, Chairman Han.

460
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,490
Deal.

461
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,810
Let's invite Master Kim, too. It's been a while.

462
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,960
Let's tell Master Kim to write the words on Your Majesty's feet.

463
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,370
The word, "Elected."

464
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,540
Write the word "Elected" on each foot, yeah?

465
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,090
Your Majesty...

466
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,180
wait,

467
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,080
your feet are so smooth like a baby's!

468
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,890
How are they so smooth?

469
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,140
Aigoo, please stop. Come on.

470
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,970
Your feet are so smooth.

471
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,010
Prisoner 7279.

472
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,960
7279!

473
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,140
What the heck are you doing in there? Why don't you answer?

474
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,040
Emergency!

475
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,540
Somebody come!

476
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:04,310
  Kang Eun Seo, Baek Jin Gi, Yoon Se Pil 

477
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,410
  Baek Jin Gi, Yoon Se Pil 

478
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,930
 I'm trying to purchase Chairman Han Seong Beom's safe house in Samjoong-dong. 

479
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,440
 What do you think about that, Attorney Oh? 

480
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,690
He bought Chairman Han's safe house

481
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,600
and gifted Director Baek's photograph.

482
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,610
Why?

483
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,430
For what reason?

484
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,870
Yes.

485
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,740
Look at the news, Attorney Oh.

486
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,150
No Byeong Chool is dead.

487
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,000
It was a suicide.

488
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,090
 Breaking News. 
   

489
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,530
 The real culprit of the 2012 Step-sibling murder case No 
   

490
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,270
 took his own life. 
   

491
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,500
 This case became well known when the stepbrother Kim was arrested as the suspect 

492
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,540
 and sent a shock through the nation. 

493
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,250
 However, as No confessed a year later, 

494
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,590
 the truth came to surface. 

495
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,550
 No confessed that he hid the body after raping and killing 

496
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,530
 the victim Jeon at the Samjoong-dong construction site. 

497
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,830
 Next news. 

498
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,760
 No, serving his sentence as the real culprit of the Ungju Step-sibling murder case, 

499
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,930
 has been found dead by suicide. 
   

500
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:23,410
 No often mentioned his guilt toward the victim, Jeon, and her family.  
  

501
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,830
 Even though he was due for parole, his mental distress 
   

502
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,980
 caused him to feud with other inmates frequently. 

503
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,320
 Witnesses spoke of hearing him yelling and screaming every night. 
   

504
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,310
 Eventually, he was put in solitary confinement because of the frequent feuds with other inmates 

505
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:41,510
 and ultimately he chose to take his own life. 

506
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,570
Here he comes!

507
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,640
Please tell us why you agreed to the Minister of Justice position.

508
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,080
Tell us why you want to be the Minister of Justice at the end of the current administration.

509
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,040
So that there won't be people who feel

510
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,400
cheated or unprotected because the law is not working properly for them.

511
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,330
I also want to make sure that the laws are properly enforced in our society.

512
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,620
I just hope to be of even the slightest help.

513
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,480
Are you taking a leave from the Law School director position then?

514
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,680
What is the Law School's reaction?

515
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,280
Exactly what role are you looking to assume?

516
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,380
 No Byeong Chool did not kill himself. 

517
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,870
He is not someone who would kill himself.

518
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,880
He's not the real culprit, and he didn't commit suicide.

519
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,490
You know who the real culprit is, right?

520
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,550
Someone framed me

521
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,510
and even got to No Byeong Chool to cover up what they did to me.

522
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,040
Tell me who it is.

523
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,550
It's only a guess.

524
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,230
I have no proof.

525
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,530
We would've gotten him if there was proof.

526
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,100
 Rolling Bar 

527
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,890
This picture.

528
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,990
I'm trying not to forget.

529
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,870
Trying not to forget that day even for a second.

530
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,710
My daughter is still at that place from ten years ago.

531
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,430
When did you know...

532
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,390
that I am not the culprit?

533
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,090
Did you actually know that...

534
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,430
I was not the culprit before my trial?

535
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm sorry.

536
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,900
I really am sorry.

537
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,320
How could you do that while knowing that I'm innocent?

538
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,230
I didn't have any options even though I knew.

539
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,070
I was powerless.

540
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,450
I had no way to prove that you were not guilty.

541
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,350
So, I waited for the right time.

542
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,000
I thought there would come a day for me to correct the wrong.

543
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,280
When you and Su Jae came here,

544
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,630
I thought it was a chance for me to correct the wrong.

545
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,660
And like a miracle, your siste—

546
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,460
A miracle.

547
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,890
Don't use the word "miracle" for something like that.

548
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,110
When my sister, Na Jeong,

549
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,410
showed up in that devastating state,

550
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,270
don't you dare call it a miracle!

551
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,160
I apologize.

552
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,170
I just wanted to correct the wrong.

553
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,470
No Byeong Chool's death may also be telling us something.

554
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,580
No.

555
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,700
You already missed your chance to do the right thing ten years ago.

556
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,120
I'll never work with you, Director.

557
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,200
 Please... 

558
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,900
Please, I beg of you.

559
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,260
Stand up, Seonbaenim.

560
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,900
Do you really think I'll send you to jail?

561
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,820
Do you?

562
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,080
Get up. 
   Geummyeong Savings Bank Statement 

563
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,900
Seonbaenim.

564
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,500
 So that there won't be people who feel cheated or unprotected 

565
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,410
 because the law is not working properly for them. 

566
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,200
 I also want to make sure that the laws are properly enforced in our society. 

567
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,780
"I also want to make sure that the laws are properly enforced in our society."

568
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,560
 I just hope to be of even the slightest help. 

569
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,520
 Are you taking a leave from the Law School director position then? 

570
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,150
 What is the Law School's reaction? 

571
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,180
 Exactly what role— 

572
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,200
No Byeong Chool is dead.

573
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,890
He suddenly committed suicide right before the parole interview.

574
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,890
Chairman, by chance

575
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,280
was it your—

576
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,840
What?

577
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:30,270
It seems to me that you are enjoying this situation.

578
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,370
Come closer.

579
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,440
- Joon Myeong. 
 - Yes.

580
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,430
Then or now, that tongue of yours is the problem.

581
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,980
Your tongue will be the cause of your ruin.

582
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,120
I'm sorry.

583
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,440
I've said something unnecessary.

584
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,370
I heard you gave Yoon Sang the Kim Dong Gu case file.

585
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,610
Yes. He said he wanted to learn about Attorney Oh he's working for.

586
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,180
All right.

587
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,850
- That's where you stop. 
 - Yes, Sir.

588
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,700
I always have to get on his nerves to get his attention.

589
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,420
What the hell are you talking abou—

590
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,480
Excuse me.

591
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,380
  Ha Il Gu, Chief Secretary 

592
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,230
Hello?

593
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,800
How could you fail to check that in advance?

594
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,200
I'm a prison warden, you know?

595
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,420
No Byeong Chool, that bastard!

596
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,870
 That bastard is making me go through so much troubl— 

597
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,610
Watch your mouth.

598
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,700
For crying out loud!

599
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,910
So...

600
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:55,270
What's the name of the person who visited No Byeong Chool on September 4th every year?

601
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,670
Gong Chan.

602
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,250
 Last name Gong, first name Chan. 

603
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,130
 Gong Chan. 

604
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:25,510
Some of you still haven't submitted summaries of major trial verdicts,

605
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,260
the assignment that I handed out in our second class.

606
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,730
Professor, it's a lot of information.

607
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,030
Could you postpone it to the end of this week, please?

608
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,040
Of course, not.

609
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,710
Fine. Due at the end of this weekend.

610
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,600
But since you went past the original deadline,

611
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,430
the highest grade will be a B.

612
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,470
No A's will be given out.

613
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,130
Why don't you pick up?

614
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,640
I was going to let you know I'm coming.

615
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,840
How have you all been doing?

616
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,860
Choi Yoon Sang made a special request for my visit.

617
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,070
Professor.

618
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,770
I found out while analyzing and summarizing

619
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,610
the major trial verdicts that you gave us

620
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,400
are all the cases that you had won.

621
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,890
I usually won.

622
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,100
So, it got me curious.

623
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,220
Did you never lose completely?

624
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,900
Well, I found one.

625
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,490
The Ungju Step-sibling Murder Case from ten years ago.

626
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,860
Some called it the Kim Dong Gu case.

627
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:38,030
The case where the stepbrother Kim Dong Gu was arrested in September 2012

628
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,750
for raping and murdering the 17-year-old Jeon Na Jeong.

629
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,610
I assume we all remember, given how famous it was.

630
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,260
The public defender who took this case to defend the

631
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,980
suspect Kim Dong Gu and lost was you, Professor.

632
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,600
The prosecutor who won, so Kim Dong Gu would be sentenced to ten years in prison

633
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:06,050
is the current partner lawyer of TK Law Firm, Professor Seo Joon Myeong.

634
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,610
What the heck are you doing?

635
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,210
Look closely.

636
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,490
Look and realize what you missed.

637
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,940
Fine.

638
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,710
I'll give you five minutes.

639
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,550
Look up the case and gather information on your own.

640
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,400
Then you would know what to ask.

641
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,960
By the way,

642
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,120
I also caught No Byeong Chool, who killed himself recently.

643
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,080
In the end, I caught the culprit.

644
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,470
Let's see you in five.

645
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,990
Talk to me for a moment.

646
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,620
Chan.

647
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,240
Talk after the lecture.

648
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,690
You never did anything wrong.

649
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,390
You have been living right.

650
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,940
   
 I support you. 

651
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,020
 You weren't guilty ten years ago, and you're amazing now, Gong Chan. 

652
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,100
   
 Hey, it's okay. Take it easy. 

653
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,890
 So what if you're Kim Dong Gu? 

654
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,580
Then what was the reason you pleaded not guilty for Kim Dong Gu?

655
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,260
After No Byeong Chool was caught a year later,

656
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,720
your not guilty plea did end up being correct, but

657
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,700
all circumstances and evidence pointed at Kim Dong Gu at the time of the trial.

658
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,940
All circumstances and evidence pointed at Kim Dong Gu. On the other hand,

659
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:57,500
Kim Dong Gu's allegation of innocence was very specific and credible.

660
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,230
These two facts definitely collided.

661
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,650
And I believed in the defendant.

662
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,590
No, no.

663
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,940
Kim Dong Gu confessed that he had killed Jeon Na Jeong.

664
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,380
And even other inmates testified that he confessed his guilt.

665
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,460
 Die, you bastard! 

666
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,440
 I killed her! 

667
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,500
 I killed her and threw her in the ocean! So what? 

668
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,870
The police used an overnight investigation as an excuse

669
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,570
to prevent Kim Dong Gu from sleeping,

670
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:28,630
and even assaulted the parts of his body that were not visible.

671
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:33,210
 It was also revealed that he suffered from continuous assaults from other inmates. 

672
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,400
   
 Kim Dong Gu finally provided a false confession under duress  

673
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,980
 because of lack of sleep and mental instability. 

674
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,160
That's not it, either.

675
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,150
That was just a one-sided argument.

676
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,350
On the contrary, he even lost trust in himself because

677
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,810
of the back and forth in allegations.

678
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,380
Professor!

679
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,980
Was there any follow-up or investigation into the police brutality?

680
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,900
The police denied it.

681
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,880
"Kim Dong Gu strongly agreed to an overnight investigation."

682
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,650
"There was no police brutality."

683
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,720
"The injuries on his body are self-inflicted."

684
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,100
What was it like when you personally investigated Kim Dong Gu as the prosecutor in charge?

685
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,280
As a prosecutor, there are times when you just know.

686
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,020
"This guy is the culprit."

687
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,740
"This guy isn't."

688
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,270
Kim Dong Gu was the former.

689
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,330
"This guy was born dirty."

690
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,790
But he wasn't.

691
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,620
The fact Kim Dong Gu was found not guilty and got released a year later

692
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,740
means your intuition was wrong.

693
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,770
That's right. I was wrong.

694
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:28,640
I admit it.

695
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,850
I tend to admit my faults.

696
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,900
But I never accept what is not right. Why?

697
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,160
The truth is always revealed.

698
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,510
In that respect, I'll certainly restore my reputation and come back here.

699
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:50,450
Wow, a person really doesn't change.

700
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,490
How incredible of you, Mr. Seo Joon Myeong.

701
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,390
You're rude as always, Na Se Ryeon.

702
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,220
How did you catch No Byeong Chool?

703
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,000
You found out about No Byeong Chool while he was being investigated for another crime.

704
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,600
That was it.

705
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,230
Please explain in detail. Just the facts.

706
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,780
That's confidential.

707
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,570
No Byeong Chool has human rights—

708
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,630
The process by which No Byeong Chool confessed to everythin—

709
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,150
That's also confidential.

710
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,140
It became too focused on me,

711
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,730
so why don't you ask Professor Oh some questions?

712
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,970
Aren't you being too harsh to the person on the losing side?

713
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,900
Choi Yoon Sang, who arranged this meeting.

714
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,470
There must be something you're dying to ask.

715
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,210
Looking at the trial records,

716
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:44,370
I had my doubts about the thoroughness of your preparations, Professor.

717
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,040
Even the witnesses you requested ended up giving

718
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,600
disadvantageous testimonies for Kim Dong Gu.

719
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,760
Are you sure you were thoroughly prepared?

720
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,840
It seems like you lost too easily.

721
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,430
 He knows why I lost. 

722
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,310
 That's what he wants to reveal to Gong Chan. 

723
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,940
I don't think that's even worth answering, Professor.

724
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,220
You could lose a trial even if you did your best.

725
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,150
She might not have done her best.

726
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,630
That didn't cross your mind?

727
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,710
Knife.

728
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:28,690
There were Jeon Na Jeong's blood, Kim Dong Gu's DNA, and three fingerprints on the knife.

729
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,400
One was Kim Dong Gu's,

730
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,110
and one was from the officer who collected the knife from the scene,

731
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,770
but there was still one more fingerprint left.

732
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,270
An unidentified fingerprint.

733
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,970
 - An unidentified fingerprint? 
 - Really? 

734
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,740
Come on, Attorney Oh Su Jae.

735
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,410
Then or now, you're too fixated on that unidentified fingerprint.

736
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,450
In that case, whoever's fingerprint it may be is totally irrelevant.

737
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,780
Suspect Kim Dong Gu's fingerprint was found, so, end of story.

738
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,510
It's not the end of the story.

739
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:57,650
If we had focused on that unidentified fingerprint,

740
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,180
the results could've been different,

741
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,330
and if so, innocent Kim Dong Gu wouldn't have been

742
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,840
framed as the culprit and had to serve a sentence.

743
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,910
Then why didn't you look into that all the way?

744
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,470
Kim Dong Gu's attorney wasn't me.

745
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,610
It was you.

746
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,020
To someone

747
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,250
it was a matter of life or death, Professor Seo Joon Myeong.

748
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,780
But the investigation of that unidentified fingerprint

749
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,500
was not even attempted by the Prosecutors' Office or the police.

750
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,660
That's a fact.

751
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,270
Geez, is he Kim Dong Gu or what?

752
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:38,850
Regardless of whether Kim Dong Gu's fingerprint was found on the knife,

753
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:43,520
that unidentified fingerprint should've been identified.

754
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,730
The fact that you covered that up as if it was nothing—

755
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,460
Who is it?

756
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,880
I said, who is it?

757
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,000
What?

758
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,330
Who's what?

759
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,770
One year after Kim Dong Gu started serving his sentence,

760
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,500
right before the TV program covering Kim Dong Gu's possible innocence,

761
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,570
No Byeong Chool, whom you were investigating for another case

762
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,480
was revealed as the real culprit,

763
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,850
easily confessing he was guilty of everything.

764
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,670
The person who framed innocent Kim Dong Gu as the culprit

765
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,870
and went as far as to turn No Byeong Chool into the culprit.

766
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,790
It's not you, Seonbae.

767
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:28,750
You don't have the guts to do that.

768
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,250
There's someone else for sure.

769
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,840
Who is it?

770
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,280
Attorney Oh, it looks like you're a little emotional

771
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,060
while talking about your shameful defeat.

772
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,610
Stop conspiring and look at the facts.

773
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:58,330
You lost that trial completely.

774
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,410
In the end, I caught the culprit.

775
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,970
That's a fact.

776
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,310
 Kim Dong Gu... 

777
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:52,170
Let's see...

778
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,390
Purpose means   mok jeok. 

779
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,140
Purpose.

780
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,350
Experience.

781
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,000
Everything you know and suspect,

782
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,360
your plan with CEO Yoon Se Pil, tell me everything

783
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,070
without leaving out a single detail. Everything.

784
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,730
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

785
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:03,660
After hearing that Eun Seo went to

786
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,410
a club with her friends before getting into the accident,

787
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,210
 I started looking there. 

788
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:40,040
 The CCTVs in front of the club were all either broken 

789
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,730
or the recordings were deleted.

790
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,700
CCTVs were not everywhere back then,

791
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,150
so I couldn't find anything.

792
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,490
Then I was able to obtain a black box

793
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,800
from a car that was passing by the club,

794
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,080
but I wasn't able to make out any of their faces.

795
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,150
Although I couldn't make out the face,

796
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:08,420
I was able to recognize my daughter.

797
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,730
 - Are you okay? 
 - Excuse me... 

798
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,260
 Please let me borrow your phone. 

799
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,390
 My phone? 

800
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,670
 That part-timer 

801
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,900
 was Kim Dong Gu's younger sister, 

802
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,490
 Jeon Na Jeong. 

803
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:48,300
 Wait here for a moment. 

804
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,780
 Hey! Hey! 

805
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,370
 Where is that bitch? 

806
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:54,250
 Hey! Catch that bitch! 

807
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,050
 Jeon Na Jeong 

808
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:10,210
 Hey. 

809
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,200
 Let's go. 

810
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,720
 Come on. Let's go. 

811
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,870
 Who's that bitch? 

812
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,970
 That bitch saw everything! 

813
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,540
 Choi Ju Wan... 

814
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,930
 Han Dong Oh, Lee Shi Hyeok... 

815
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,430
Choi Ju Wan,

816
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:31,730
Han Dong Oh.

817
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:32,880
Lee Shi Hyeok?

818
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,770
Eun Seo, who they kidnapped,

819
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,590
got into an accident and

820
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,930
I'm sure they probably didn't leave Jeon Na Jeong alone

821
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,030
since she witnessed everything.

822
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,390
When it comes to the fathers of those three bastards,

823
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,120
especially the inspector general at the time,

824
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,890
Choi Tae Gook.

825
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,980
 Instead of his son 

826
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,810
 and his friends, 

827
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,140
 making Kim Dong Gu the guilty party 

828
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,840
 I'm sure was a piece of cake for him. 

829
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,590
 Go to the US. 

830
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:14,420
 If you go to the States first, Ju Wan will follow you. 

831
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,780
 When you come back, I'll give you a proper wedding. 

832
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,300
 I'm putting my son in charge. 

833
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,900
 To my own son. 

834
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,310
 Let it take its course. 

835
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,010
 Let it take its course. 

836
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,600
 Wrap it up and then move to that law firm. 

837
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,050
 He'll take care of you and help you grow. 

838
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,880
Attorney Oh.

839
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,570
Why did you do that?

840
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:20,230
"Let it take its course."

841
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:24,410
"I will help you move to TK Law Firm after this trial."

842
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:28,100
Then you shook me, using my mom and brothers as my weakness

843
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,230
when I still claimed Kim Dong Gu's innocence.

844
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,930
Although you knew Kim Dong Gu was innocent,

845
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,810
you told me to abandon him.

846
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:39,830
At that time,

847
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,870
Father just chose not to take on a losing battle.

848
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,240
Behind those three bastards,

849
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,980
there were Choi Tae Gook, Han Seong Beom, and Lee In Su.

850
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,800
Taking action without solid evidence against them meant—

851
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,950
Shut up!

852
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,340
Kim Dong Gu, who is completely innocent, had to spend a year in hell.

853
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,890
And I held on for dear life to forget that guilt.

854
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,230
Without even blinking an eye for the last ten years,

855
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,600
how could you cater to the fathers of the three men

856
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,890
who did terrible things to your daughter?

857
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:13,480
I was the one who stopped him

858
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,090
saying that we need to wait until we were fully prepared.

859
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:19,480
I pleaded with him.

860
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,210
I asked him to wait until

861
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,920
I develop the power to go against those three.

862
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,060
Prepare?

863
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,780
In order to avenge your daughter,

864
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,990
you're saying that you don't care what happens

865
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:37,420
to the innocent client's life during that long time it takes you to prepare?

866
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,060
I...

867
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,370
did commit a crime.

868
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,720
What?

869
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,960
Kim Dong Gu is alive?

870
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,940
Yes.

871
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,050
Kim Dong Gu

872
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,470
is that guy named Gong Chan?

873
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:11,410
I'm sorry, Chairman.

874
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:14,830
- I'll resolve everything— 
 - Ten years ago!

875
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,930
Did you forget that I entrusted everything to you?

876
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,230
I entrusted you with the task where my life was at stake!

877
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,190
And this is how it comes back to me, huh?

878
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,460
This is how it comes back?

879
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,620
I'm sorry, Chairman!

880
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,110
I will resolve it for sure.

881
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,210
I swear on my son's life that I'll resolve this.

882
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,130
What are you doing?

883
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,110
You said you'll do it with your son's life at stake.

884
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:41,630
Get out! You must be busy!

885
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,270
What were you thinking when you did that?

886
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:11,190
Going so far as to call Seo Joon Myeong over, why?

887
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,810
To let you know.

888
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:18,180
To enlighten you.

889
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,800
But you were too busy protecting Noona.

890
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,130
Well, Noona was like that, too.

891
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,700
Kim Dong Gu.

892
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:38,240
You deceived Noona, and Noona abandoned you.

893
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:43,300
Noona abandoned you.

894
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,970
  Su Jae Noona 

895
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,700
 You still don't understand what I'm saying? 

896
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,430
 Noona abandoned you at that trial! 

897
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:58,170
 Since she lost that trial, 

898
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:01,630
 she was able to come and work under my father at TK Law Firm. 

899
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,030
 Wh-What... 

900
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:05,070
 What do you mean? 

901
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,570
What are you saying? Make it clear. What are you saying?

902
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:10,900
Noona's mom and brothers were arrested,

903
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,120
and she received a deal.

904
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,030
Through her mentor, Director Baek Jin Gi,

905
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:21,050
"Don't waste your efforts on Kim Dong Gu's trial.

906
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,010
Then I will have your family freed."

907
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:28,830
Don't spew words that you can't take responsibility for.

908
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:37,460
This is why you and Noona won't work out.

909
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:44,360
Because you deceived Noona, and she abandoned you.

910
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,580
It doesn't matter.

911
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,440
It doesn't matter.

912
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:06,320
If Professor gave up on me and saved her family back then, that's right.

913
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,770
That's the right thing to do.

914
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,380
I would've done the same.

915
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,790
 Don't overreach. 

916
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,410
 If you justify her actions by saying that, 

917
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:20,290
 do you think her deeds will be erased? 

918
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,110
 Overreaching? 

919
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,510
The whole world called me the culprit.

920
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:27,480
Even my father didn't believe me.

921
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,430
Do you know how much of a hell that is?

922
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:35,660
The only person who believed me in that hell was Professor.

923
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,000
 You wouldn't know, Hyeong 

924
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,170
that a single "I believe you"

925
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:45,900
can let a person breathe and live on.

926
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,500
I'm sure you can't even imagine.

927
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:55,680
Being a sucker like that is why you got framed.

928
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,240
Being a sucker like that is why you get used!

929
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,770
So what if I'm a sucker?

930
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:05,360
I still had someone who believed me.

931
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,820
That's more than enough.

932
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:12,090
Whether she abandoned me or not at the trial,

933
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,380
it doesn't matter.

934
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,620
♫  You're here now  ♫

935
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,900
 Crazy bastard. 

936
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,820
♫  Don't get sick anymore  ♫

937
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:27,650
♫  I'll watch you, listen to you, and go through it with you  ♫

938
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:31,640
 That a single "I believe you" can let a person breathe and live on. 

939
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,860
 That's more than enough. 

940
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,720
♫  I will love you  ♫

941
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,150
  The public defender who solely believed me, Oh Su Jae  

942
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:44,890
♫  It's okay even if we're far apart again  ♫

943
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:58,480
  Why Her? 

944
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:07,520


945
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,440
 My decision threw Kim Dong Gu into hell. 

946
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,500
 It doesn't matter because I know what kind of a person you are! 

947
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,600
 I'm so, very sorry. 

948
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,340
 My daughter, thank you for coming back to me. 

949
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,150
 You recognized the remains as soon as you saw them, right? 

950
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,910
 You only had one job to do! 

951
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,240
 You bastard! 

952
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,270
 Please let me meet Chairman Choi Tae Gook. 

953
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:39,910
 Are we on the same side now? 

954
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:40,890
 No way. 

955
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:44,080
 Didn't you omit an important process to make the suspect guilty? 

956
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,300
 Not at all. 

957
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,860
 This is the verdict. 

958
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:49,320
 How did No Byeong Chool become the culprit? 

959
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,250
 Kim Dong Gu. 

960
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,870
 The one who moved all the pieces. 

961
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:54,020
 He will now focus on Gong Chan. 

962
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,400
 I've been turning a blind eye in fear of regretting that moment. 

963
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,480
 Now I'm going to out that thing called regret.
