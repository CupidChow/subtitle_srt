1
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,430
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,020
What is it that you want to say?

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,540
What is this grand exposition for?

4
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:44,380
That moment when I made the wrong decision with the excuse of saving my mother and brothers.

5
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,490
I've been looking away in fear of regret for that moment.

6
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,500
Now, I intend to try and regret it properly.

7
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,740
When the innocent Kim Dong Gu was framed because of my foolish decision,

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,000
the three suspects had been living life to the fullest.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,300
One as a presidential candidate's son,

10
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,010
one as the heir to Hansu Group,

11
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,970
and the other...

12
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,850
as the heir to TK Law Firm.

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,370


14
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,610
I don't know where you heard this crap, Su Jae,

15
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,920
but let's just say you are spewing the truth.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,800
You still can't catch them.

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,800
Especially not Ju Wan.

18
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,620
You can never catch him, Su Jae.

19
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,610
Jae Yi...

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,830
is your daughter, Su Jae.

21
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,760
   
 Oh Su Jae 

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,800
 Is it you, Su Jae? 

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,500
 Why did you do this to me? 

24
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,410
 I'm sorry for your stillbirth. 

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,750
You said it was a stillbirth.

26
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,780
Nope. It wasn't.

27
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,270
Then why did you...

28
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,010
Why?

29
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,280
You were too lacking to be my family,

30
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,890
so I couldn't let you in.

31
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,140
However, it's a different story now.

32
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,230
You qualify, and Seung Yeon wants a divorce.

33
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,160
In some ways,

34
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,850
it's great timing.

35
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,930
Nothing in the world is only all bad.

36
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,130
 Say hello, Jae Yi. 

37
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,020
 Hello, Ajumma. 

38
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,760
 My name is Choi Jae Yi. 

39
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,940
Marry Ju Wan and become our family.

40
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,030
Is it not a good thing?

41
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,800
 Ajumma! 

42
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,960
 It's a gift. 

43
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,210
The proof that you're Jae Yi's biological mother.

44
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,530
 Genetic Test Report, Haeum Bio 

45
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,330
 The probability that Sample 1 and Sample 2 are biologically related is 99.9% 

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,670
So, Su Jae,

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,940
a woman in her 20s, or Jeon Na Jeong, and what happened that night and whatnot.

48
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,640
I don't know where you heard all this crap, but you've got it all wrong.

49
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,050
Let's say that those three bastards did get involved in something.

50
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,400
You're just wasting your energy.

51
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,030
Plan your future.

52
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,160
I'll help you rise to the top.

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,300
I'll help you reach the heights you couldn't even fathom.

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,070
Truly...

55
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,270
disgusting.

56
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,620
A person...

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,010
can be this disgusting, huh?

58
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,270
You're so...

59
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,430
Yes, Father.

60
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,320
What?

61
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,960
Why tell Su Jae about Jae Yi?

62
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,530
I'll be right there.

63
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,620
 I don't know where you heard this crap, Su Jae. 

64
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,190
 You still can't catch them. 

65
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,950
 Shut up. 

66
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,050
 Especially not Ju Wan. 

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,410
 You can never catch him, Su Jae. 

68
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,350
 Shut up. 

69
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,060
I've got a lot on my mind right now,

70
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,370
so let's talk about Jae Yi some other time—

71
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,130
Shut up.

72
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,720
Don't be reckless, Su Jae.

73
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,280
I'm also about to lose my mind.

74
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,560
I can only hold back so much.

75
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,960
 Ajumma. 

76
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,930
 Me? 

77
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,150
 One, two, three. 

78
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,840
I didn't confirm it myself yet...

79
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,690
No, not yet.

80
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,610
Father.

81
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,030
Why the heck would you do that?

82
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,450
Why all of a sudden?

83
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,790
Su Jae is going after that incident that happened ten years ago.

84
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,750
What do you mea—

85
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,230
That incident... all of a sudden...

86
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,460
How can Su Jae know about it?

87
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,610
 Let's go. 

88
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,990
 The other girl besides Jeon Na Jeong that night. 

89
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,250
That girl you guys kidnapped.

90
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,760
Who is it?

91
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,730
I don't know what you mean.

92
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,470
Who are these three bastards?

93
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,090
I don't know what you mean.

94
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,370
The other girl you guys dragged from the nightclub that night besides Jeon Na Jeong, who is it?

95
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,600
Who!

96
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,460
I don't know.

97
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,100
Stop trying to spin it and spill the truth.

98
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,640
Who is it?

99
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,470
I don't know, Father. I don't know!

100
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,750
I don't know what you are talking about.

101
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,550
I don't know. I don't know!

102
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,280
 If someone ever asks you about tonight, 

103
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,360
 your only response will be "I don't know." 

104
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,440
 Only that answer. 

105
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,700
 Nothing ever happened to you tonight, okay? 

106
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,490
Do you understand?

107
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,690
  Lee In Su will create a new and fair nation  

108
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,550
I'm telling you, Reporter Kim, that is not true at all.

109
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,680
Why are you being like this? /   Assemblyman Lee In Su, Suspicions of Privilege at Yeongpyeong District 

110
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,720
What do you mean by preferential treatment? /  Advantages Given to Hansu Construction during Vendor Selection 

111
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,790
You guys are too much!

112
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,420
You can't just let that kind of fake news slide, reporter!

113
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,390
You need to fact-check with us.

114
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,130
Why is the Yeongpyeong District issue coming up right now?

115
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,640
That much should've been cut off in advance.

116
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,160
Shouldn't the Head of the Legal Department do that much, at least?

117
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,710
I'm going into an emergency meeting right now.

118
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,080
It's even more hectic over here. Geez...

119
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,230
You should've known about this news before it came out!

120
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,280
Contact Su Jae right now.

121
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,900
Su Jae is an expert on escaping these situations, okay?

122
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,520
What expert...

123
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,360
Is Su Jae a fix-it-all?

124
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,210
That's why the party should support me even more.

125
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,940
If I'm ruined, the party is ruined!

126
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,120
Come up with a plan, even if you have to stay up all night!

127
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,230
Come in right now!

128
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,660
Where is Spokesperson Jeong?

129
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,890
Yes! I'm right here, Assemblyman!

130
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,330
Come up here with Jae Yi right now.

131
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,040
I'll tell you when you get here.

132
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,550
Wait until I get there on my own.

133
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,370
I'm not even curious about why you're doing this.

134
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,690
Yeah? Is that right?

135
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,160
Listen. Jae Yi is Su Jae's daughter.

136
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,240
 See? You are speechless, right? 

137
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,740
 No need to be shocked, though. 

138
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,690
Who would be more shocked than Su Jae right now?

139
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,610
She found out today, too, that Jae Yi is her daughter.

140
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,170
You think I'm crazy?

141
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,060
Father told her. He told her that Jae Yi is her daughter.

142
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,920
So, come back right now!

143
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,140
Seriously.

144
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,270
What did I hear just now, Hyeong?

145
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,400
I said, what did I hear just now?

146
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,220
You heard it all. Stop asking again.

147
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,930
Is it true?

148
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,720
Is it true that Noona is Jae Yi's...

149
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,910
Yes. She gave birth to Jae Yi.

150
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,840
Her trip to the U.S. for training was actually to give birth, and it was Father who sent her.

151
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,030
Su Jae was naïve.

152
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,920
Father said, "Go and stay in the U.S.

153
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,190
Give birth and marry Ju Wan there before you come back together."

154
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,330
It was all Father's work.

155
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,100
He stole the baby, and Su Jae thought that she had a stillbirth.

156
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,290
How could you go on to live normally after that?

157
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,000
You still had an appetite?

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
You still went to sleep soundly?

159
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,290
How can a person do that?

160
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,010
Did I do it?

161
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,750
Father did it all! Father!

162
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,430
This bastard...

163
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,740
Go beg Noona.

164
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,520
Apologize and say sorry.

165
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,260
Apologize?

166
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,240
The only person in this world that I apologize to is Father.

167
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,630
- What? 
 - Stop acting like you're different, asshole.

168
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,960
You and I, we both are Father's pawns.

169
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,820
Stop having feelings for Su Jae, too.

170
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,040
Do you think it's normal to still like the tutor from when you were young?

171
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,210
Crazy bastard.

172
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,470
 He wouldn't think that he has shut me up completely. 

173
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,040
 He'll look into this "woman in her 20s." 

174
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,380
 Moving about frantically... 

175
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,070
Attorney Oh?

176
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,020
Should I drive for you?

177
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,530
Since I made a move, Chairman Choi will also make his move.

178
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,570
Tell everyone to be careful.

179
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,680
Is there anything else?

180
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,940
Something I can help with?

181
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,530
I can drop you off at the train station, right?

182
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,930
Yes.

183
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,480
Why did her remains come out of my land?

184
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,410
You said you would take care of it.

185
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,290
Why did it come out of there?

186
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,030
That's what I want to know.

187
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,680
Should you be so calm about this?

188
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,300
The suspicions of privilege in the Yeongpyeong District are catching on.

189
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,620
The election is right around the corner.

190
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,880
Why did that news blow up?

191
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,780
I know, right?

192
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,950
Chairman Choi! Are you high?

193
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,900
What brings you guys here?

194
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,410
Did you call them out, Chairman Choi?

195
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,940
Ten years ago...

196
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,630
you all remember the moment you met me, right?

197
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,400
 Hey... 

198
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,650
 It's not me. I told them not to do it. 

199
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,670
 I didn't do it, either. 

200
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,330
 It's Ch-Choi Ju Wan, that asshole! 

201
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,220
 That asshole went crazy and... 

202
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,850
 F-Father, that's not it. 

203
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,590
 It's not me, Father. 

204
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,130
 Father! 

205
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,870
 Move your hand. 

206
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,620
 Move your hand! 

207
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,360
 Father, I— 

208
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,040
 Father... 

209
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,050
That night, before Jeon Na Jeong,

210
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,550
you three kidnapped a woman from a nightclub.

211
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,860
Right?

212
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,610
What is this all about?

213
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,650
Ch-Chairman Choi, wait.

214
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,270
What are you talking about?

215
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,180
Where did this nonsense come from?

216
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,790
Before Jeon Na Jeong, the part-timer at the convenience store,

217
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,620
was there a woman you kidnapped or not?

218
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,410
Hey, what is this?

219
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,520
Shut the fuck up, idiot.

220
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,750
What's the name of that woman from the club?

221
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,030
How would we know?

222
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,730
It's not like we took her after exchanging names.

223
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,600
Well, that woman...

224
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,970
ran off while you three were high and were totally out of it.

225
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,630
What did you do after you realized that she ran off?

226
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,470
What did you do?

227
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,030
I think... there was a car accident while we were chasing after her.

228
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,260
- Right? 
 - I don't know.

229
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,260
Hey! Why don't you know?

230
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,970
You drove that night.

231
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,300
You dragged that part-timer first.

232
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

233
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,880
Choi Ju Wan, you bastard.

234
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,500
Are you trying to get out of this by yourself?

235
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,860
Choi Ju Wan, you crazy bastard.

236
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,970
You crazy bastards!

237
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,160
Who else was there, huh?

238
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,890
This punk! You want to die?

239
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,970
Come here, you—

240
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,980
Come here, you damn bastard!

241
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,780
Tell me! What did you do, huh?

242
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,550
You punk!

243
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,360
Do you want to see me ruined?

244
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,010
After all that crap I've been through—

245
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,240
Enough, enough!

246
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,320
That's enough!

247
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,390
Stop it and take your seats.

248
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,970
Who else was there before Jeon Na Jeong?

249
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,390
I don't know what you're talking about.

250
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,860
This is the answer.

251
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,770
Whoever was there, one person or ten people.

252
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,920
You three do not know what happened that night.

253
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,340
Understood?

254
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,410
Do you understand!

255
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,940
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

256
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,380
Leave, all of you.

257
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,500
Chairman Choi, you're working hard on a lot of different things.

258
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Chairman Choi, we'll place everything in your care.

259
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,130
We're doing this for all of us, right?

260
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,820
Exactly.

261
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,730
Crazy bastard. Don't you have a brain?

262
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,110
You fucking brought up the car accident!

263
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,400
Forget it! Get lost, you crazy bastard!

264
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,800
- You get lost, asshole! 
 - You stupid idiot!

265
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,790
What a stupid idiot!

266
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,320
Idiots...

267
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,500
 Hello. 
   

268
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,950
 I am Jeong Hui Yeong, the spokesperson for Assemblyman Lee In Su of the Everyone for the Future Party. 

269
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,820
 The recent suspicions about Yeongpyeong District advantages 

270
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,980
 are mere fake news. 

271
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,820
 - Assemblyman Lee In Su does not have any relationship  
 - Let's go now.

272
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,300
 - with Yeongpyeong District suspicions.  
 - Gosh.

273
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,680
Sirs, you need to take care of your bill.

274
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,630
 You are regulars, okay? 

275
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,610
 Aigoo. You have to make money, you know! You can't give out everything! 

276
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,880
 You're supposed to be generous to make money. 

277
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,100
 - That's why you're broke. 
 - What do you mean? 

278
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,000
- Geez, clean it up already. 
 - All right, all right.

279
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,100
 Chicken, Beer, Coffee - Legend of Dark-Zip 

280
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,820
What's the occasion?

281
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,320
What brings you here?

282
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,480
What brings you here at this hour when you didn't even come on opening day?

283
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,730
By chance, did you come to get your money back for all this?

284
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,720
Mom.

285
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,230
Are you sick?

286
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,000
Is it incurable?

287
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,950
What's bothering you?

288
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,100
Where is it?

289
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,360
Girl, how sick are you? Come on and tell.

290
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,570
What did the doctor say?

291
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,360
Is it terminal?

292
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,450
Wait.

293
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,230
You come with me tomorrow to see the doctor.

294
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,310
Let's go to the hospital.

295
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,740
That's not it.

296
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,210
I just came by.

297
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,660
You told me to come.

298
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,720
Really?

299
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,040
You really just came by?

300
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,790
I'll go now.

301
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,290
Take care.

302
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,770
Mom, Mom, she's a little weird.

303
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,600
She smiled at us. Nicely.

304
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,700
Last time I saw her smile like that was more than ten years ago.

305
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,770
That's right...

306
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,420
  Im Seung Yeon 

307
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,130
Yes.

308
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,220
 Absurd. 

309
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,340
How could you not know?

310
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,190
Your own daughter?

311
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,270
How could you be like that?

312
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,500
Are you really a mother?

313
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,010
I may not be.

314
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,740
 What did you say? 

315
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,710
How can I trust something I haven't confirmed myself.

316
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,580
I don't believe it yet.

317
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,830
Forget this. Seriously.

318
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,860
I'm not letting anyone have Jae Yi.

319
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,790
No one qualifies.

320
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,070
The night when Jeon Na Jeong died.

321
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,360
It seems that those three took a girl from the club

322
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,040
to Chairman Han's house in Samjoong-dong.

323
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,440
Apparently, that girl got hit by a car while running away.

324
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,270
Find out if she's dead or alive.

325
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,070
Even if she's alive, since she's quiet so far...

326
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,610
What?

327
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,210
Hey.

328
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,760
And?

329
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,070
Nothing, Sir.

330
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,550
I'll look into it.

331
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,680
Jeon Na Jeong...

332
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,180
Kim Dong Gu...

333
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,820
I could just fire you right now, and it wouldn't be enough, Chief Ha!

334
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,130
Go.

335
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,940
Chairman.

336
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,230
- Il Gu. 
 - Yes?

337
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,840
Go.

338
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,800
So freaking tiring.

339
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,570
 The three suspects who put a woman in her 20s in that state and 

340
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,450
 killed Jeon Na Jeong have been living life to the fullest. 

341
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,740
 One as a presidential candidate's son, 

342
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,230
 one as the heir to Hansu Group, 

343
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,360
 and the other as the heir to TK Law Firm. 

344
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,210
You don't even know your place.

345
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,890
How dare you.

346
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,390
  Installation Complete 

347
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,690
You really came.

348
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,440
I laughed a little when I got your text early this morning.

349
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,700
"Please prepare Jae Yi's hair for genetic testing."

350
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,710
Do you know how pathetic you are?

351
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,730
Mom!

352
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,450
What about Grandma?

353
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,280
She said she was going to the restroom.

354
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,420
Jae Yi.

355
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,980
Can you go to the beach with ajumma and play?

356
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,470
I'll join you with Grandma.

357
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,330
Ajumma, did you come because you missed me?

358
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,780
Yeah.

359
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,200
Ajumma, let's go play at the beach.

360
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,940
Do you want me to hold you?

361
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,590
Ajumma, am I not heavy?

362
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,780
You are.

363
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,840
Right? I grew a little taller.

364
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,830
I hope I can be tall like you.

365
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,740
 How did I not recognize you? 

366
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,750
Ajumma, there are a lot of pretty shells here.

367
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,980
Ajumma.

368
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,440
A gift for you.

369
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,570
Thank you very much.

370
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,920
Jae Yi!

371
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,680
Mom, Grandma!

372
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,430
Jae Yi.

373
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,390
I'm very glad to have met you.

374
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,800
Are you going home now?

375
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,460
Yeah.

376
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:11,210
Let's eat delicious food and play even more next time.

377
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,270
Promise?

378
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,410
Promise.

379
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,790
Mom!

380
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,610
This is Jae Yi's hair and a toothbrush she used.

381
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:59,370
Attorney Oh Su Jae, you are such a fool.

382
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:05,600
I felt my heart drop the day you and Jae Yi took a picture together.

383
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:15,460
 It was mysterious how such a timid girl was so friendly with you. 

384
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,070
 The child must've felt it instinctively. 

385
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,890
 Why do you need stuff like that? 

386
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,340
My insides churn because of how much you two look alike.

387
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,770
Attorney Oh told you to come and see me?

388
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,700
"Don't trust him."

389
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,360
"Knowingly suffering is a fool's act."

390
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,130
"A wrong decision can be turned over."

391
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,480
Those are Attorney Oh's words.

392
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,140
If turned over—

393
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,660
Oh, and she also said this.

394
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:19,490
"Trusting Seo Joon Myeong is worse than being a fool."

395
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,360
Hey, Choi Seonbae!

396
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,890
You've got so much land now!

397
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,330
Jo Kang Ja? What are you doing here?

398
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,920
Where did she come from?

399
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,440
Why did you come, too?

400
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,550
Why did I come too?

401
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,280
That means someone else was here besides me.

402
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,710
What do you mean someone else came?

403
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,940
I wonder who came.

404
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,500
Nam Seonbaenim?

405
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,410
Or Chief Kang Gil Ju, who is mentioned to be the next Chief of Police?

406
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,880
- Kang Ja, Kang Ja, Jo Kang Ja. 
 - Yes?

407
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,010
Whatever you ask, my answer is "I don't know."

408
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,230
I don't know anything.

409
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,510
I see.

410
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,260
Then let's take time to refresh your memory.

411
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,490
That's my specialty.

412
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,320
- Geez! 
 - So delicious, Seonbae!

413
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,540
Let's see. "Bon appetit".

414
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,920
- Sir. 
 - Yeah?

415
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,650
You're the same as you were ten years ago.

416
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,920
You didn't even age.

417
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,540
Oh my. Were you a customer ten years ago?

418
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,970
No, I wasn't your customer.

419
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,370
I met you at the court.

420
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,870
You were my eyewitness and testified at the time.

421
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,800
You found me passed out on the beach ten years ago.

422
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Kim Dong Gu?

423
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,780
That Kim Dong Gu?

424
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,490
Yes.

425
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,780
I'm that Kim Dong Gu from ten years ago.

426
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,550
Breathe in, and push.

427
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,690
Three more, three.

428
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,430
One.

429
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,340
Hey, call it a day.

430
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,750
Hello. 
  Creating clean streets 

431
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,730
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

432
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,840
I'm a fan of Assemblyman Lee In Su.

433
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,250
Could you please give me an autograph?

434
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,860
Since you're his son.

435
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,850
Sure, on behalf of my father, I thank you.

436
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,370
My gosh! Thank you.

437
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,080
You look better in person.

438
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,020
 A Life for South Korea, Lee In Su 

439
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,560
   
 Secured the water bottle that Han Dong Oh used. 

440
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,810
   
 Bringing the pen that Lee Si Hyeok used. 

441
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,970
   
 I'll request the comparison of the unidentified fingerprint on the knife from 10 years ago 

442
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,130
 with the fingerprints of Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong Oh, and Lee Si Hyeok. 

443
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,220
 Will take about three to five days. 

444
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,580
 I met Choi  Seonbae who interrogated Kim Dong Gu. 

445
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,740
Kang Gil Ju frequented the Prosecutors' Office back then.

446
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,360
I don't know what order he got, but

447
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,960
he was passionate about making Kim Dong Gu the culprit.

448
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,460
We had a hard time then, too.

449
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,080
 I passed Attorney Oh's words on to Han Gi Taek. 

450
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,700
  Power of Attorney: Han Gi Taek, Attorney Oh Su Jae | TK Law Firm 

451
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,120
Can Attorney Oh win against Chairman Choi?

452
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,080
I'll join your side if victory is promised.

453
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,400
 I met the sushi restaurant owner who was my eyewitness and testified. 

454
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,540
Right before the trial, the prosecutor came to see me.

455
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,170
He indirectly blackmailed me.

456
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,880
I had a hard time, too.

457
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,360
  Genetic Testing Center 

458
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,650
Yes. Are the results ready?

459
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,210
I'll be there.

460
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,510
  Genetic Testing Report 

461
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,020
 Oh Su Jae and Choi Ju Wan do not marry. 

462
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,510
 However, Oh Su Jae recognizes Choi Jae Yi as her daughter 

463
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,740
 and shall register her as her daughter. 

464
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,400
 She also assumes sole parental and custody rights of Choi Jae Yi. 

465
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,440
 Choi Tae Gook, as TK Law Firm's honorary CEO, 

466
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,710
 withdraws from managing TK Law Firm completely. 

467
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,870
 Choi Tae Gook shall register Oh Su Jae 

468
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:34,420
 as a member attorney of TK Law Firm by November 30, 2022 

469
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,170
 and appoint her as the law firm CEO. 

470
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,410
 If and only if Choi Tae Gook enforces and honors the above articles, 

471
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:46,000
 Oh Su Jae will keep all facts regarding the birth of 

472
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,810
 Choi Jae Yi as a secret. 

473
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:53,310
 In the case that Choi Tae Gook does not enforce them by the said deadline 

474
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,320
 or changes them after enforcing, 

475
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,840
 Oh Su Jae's duty to keep the secret perishes as well. 

476
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,330
You're asking for too much for a kid.

477
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,240
As the law firm CEO of TK Law Firm,

478
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,470
I'm going to raise Jae Yi well as my child.

479
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,380
So the old man behind the scenes should withdraw.

480
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,640
I'll be sure to treat you with respect as the honorary chairman.

481
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,230
I'll give you the 70 billion won you want.

482
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,000
Isn't that enough for the trade?

483
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,150
Yes! Hand it over.

484
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,360
Give me 70 billion won and sign the papers.

485
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,750
Hand everything over.

486
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,100
What you did to me is worth far more than that. You will have to give me whatever I ask.

487
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,370
Although it's Assemblyman Lee this time,

488
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:42,240
I'll take over that place using him as a stepping stone.

489
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,430
You'll rise to the top and possess far more, better things.

490
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,290
The fascinating thing is that

491
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,390
another worthless piece of garbage like him always gets nominated as the

492
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:02,930
most favorable candidate every five years. What nonsense.

493
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:06,170
Some of them even end up becoming president.

494
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,670
So, you can have hope as well.

495
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,150
And be sure to sign that paper.

496
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,380
You think I'll accept these terms?

497
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,040
Yes, since it's a deal you must accept.

498
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:28,130
The paternity certificate that Park So Yeong used to confirm the father of her fetus.

499
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,000
 Probability of Paternity: No - Client 1 and Client 2 are not biologically related 

500
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,830
Who could be the biological father?

501
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,220
I first suspected Chairman Han, but it wasn't him.

502
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,350
I was wasting my time.

503
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,100
So I changed my suspect.

504
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,430
Client 1 and Client 2.

505
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:58,160
The probability of paternity is 99.98 percent.

506
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,350
Client 1, the fetus.

507
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,550
Client 2...

508
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,090
Chairman Choi Tae Gook.

509
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,340
  Probability of Paternity 99.99%, Client 1 and Client 2 are biologically related 

510
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,400
  Probability of Paternity 99.99%, Client 1 and Client 2 are biologically related 

511
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,310
Using Park So Yeong to create a scandal with An Gang Hoon,

512
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,940
then brutally murdering Park So Yeong afterward.

513
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,000
Did you think I couldn't find the proof that you murdered Park So Yeong?

514
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,690
You!

515
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,150
"How could he have lied and said the baby I gave birth to had died?

516
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,280
How could he have not even shown it in his face all this time?

517
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,300
How could a human being do that?"

518
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,720
I was confused for a moment but realized it immediately.

519
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:54,310
The man who killed the woman who bears his child.

520
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,570
The man who is completely fine even after

521
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,580
killing the woman who bears his child.

522
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:05,340
The man who is willing to do anything for his own good.

523
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,060
The reason you shoved this in my face, when you can

524
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:20,180
surely find anything if you desire, is that this is a suggestion.

525
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,610
You're suggesting a deal.

526
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,540
I'll give you two hours to sign.

527
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,720
This is not a suggestion.

528
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,830
It's an order.

529
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,700
- Yes, yes. 
 - This is TK Law Firm Secretary Office.

530
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,810
We need to check the facts on that matter.

531
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,930
- It's a little difficult for us to answer. 
 - We'll come up with an appropriate response.

532
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,030
- Understood. 
 - One moment, please.

533
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:03,300
This is TK Law Firm Secretary Office.

534
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,690
It's hard to check the facts on that.

535
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,220
- Yes, yes. 
 - One moment, please.

536
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,030
We're checking the facts at the moment.

537
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,240
 Breaking news about Assemblyman Lee In Su. 

538
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,070
 The daughter of candidate Lee In Su, planning team leader for H, which is an affiliate of Hansu Group, 

539
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,670
 is suspected of receiving a special bonus of 4 billion won 

540
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,450
 in the name of good PR planning for the Yeongpyeong District. 

541
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,950
 Further suspicions have surfaced that 

542
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,340
 Candidate Lee's mother-in-law bought three private apartments to be built in the 
   

543
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,310
 Yeongpyeong District at a ridiculously low price. 

544
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:39,160
 It will become a major obstacle to Candidate Lee, who currently ranks first with 

545
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,340
 a 43.2% approval rating in the opinion polls— 

546
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,010
 The figures who lobbied for the formation of the consortium 

547
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,280
 after Hansu Construction won the Yeongpyeong District development project are 

548
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,800
 former Supreme Court Justice Kim Do Il, former National Tax Service Commissioner Jang Man Yeong, 

549
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,100
 former Senior Civil Affairs Officer Wu Sang Su, and former Justice Minister Chae Won Seok. 

550
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:01,030
 Suspicions are being raised that they received millions to billions of won in return— 

551
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,500
Calls regarding the advisors continue to come in from reporters.

552
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,530
Also, tabloids describing Managing Director Han Dong Oh's

553
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,600
secret videos of the women he's dated have surfaced.

554
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,650
 Hansu Construction, Under Suspicion of Lobbying TK Law Firm Advisors with Billions of Won 

555
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,350
 Hansu Construction, Hansu Bio, 

556
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:37,080
 and Hansu Group's stocks will begin to drop. 

557
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,420
 Too busy trying to recover the bomb that just dropped on them, 

558
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,970
 they won't have the manpower to focus on the case from ten years ago. 

559
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:47,760
In the end, the Yeongpyeong District will be the grave the three old men dug for themselves.

560
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,490
Those people could cover up those graves and still have strength left.

561
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,920
Let's sit back and watch until the director's hearing

562
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,440
to see what move they'll make.

563
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,830
All right.

564
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,700
We've thrown several different things at them, so we'll have fun in several different ways watching them.

565
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,460
I think you should come take a look at this.

566
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,360
I'm hanging up now.

567
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,140
There's something inside there.

568
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,460
 Yes. Hand it Over. 

569
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,510
 Give me 70 billion won and sign the papers. 

570
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,800
 Hand everything over. 

571
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,800
 Do you think that I couldn't find the proof that you murdered Park So Yeong? 

572
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,910
Father, Chairman Han and Assemblyman Lee are calling.

573
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,840
Dong Oh is going crazy, too.

574
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,370
I sent Attorney Seo to Dong Oh, and regarding Yeongpyeong District—

575
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,250
Leave for now.

576
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,690
Father.

577
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:43,560
If you tell me what the matter is—

578
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,390
Stop!

579
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,070
I said to leave for now.

580
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,600
 Yes, I was going to have it sent to your office, 

581
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,680
 but something nice like this should be viewed with everyone. 

582
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,080
 Han Dong Oh 

583
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,600
 What did the Chairman say? 

584
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,870
 I'm about to die. 

585
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:32,040
 My father says he's going to kill me! Damn! 

586
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,390
Hey, the picture that you got from CEO Yoon.

587
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,600
Send me a picture of that.

588
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,600
Crazy bastard, what the hell are you saying? I can't go into my room right now!

589
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,900
Hey. Stay outside.

590
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,930
Why does that matter right now? I said my father is throwing a fit!

591
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:52,510
 Have the Chairman call him right now, you bastard! 

592
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,970
Gosh. Why do I even bother with useless things?

593
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,930
Never mind.

594
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,130
So keep a lookout.

595
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,350
She never ever comes to see me.

596
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,800
But she came out of the blue and seemed to be hesitating to talk about something.

597
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,490
It's still bothering me

598
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,860
I understand. I'll take care of her.

599
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,550
Having you around reassures me, Mr. Chan.

600
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,710
- Let's get in the taxi. 
 - The taxi.

601
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,250
My gosh, you don't have to.

602
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,190
It's okay. Please take care of her, sir.

603
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,980
 Gong Chan 

604
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:45,610
 Let's have dinner together. 

605
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,850
 Genetic Testing Report 

606
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,980
 Biologically related... 
 Oh Su Jae, Choi Jae Yi 

607
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,610
 Probability of Paternity 99.99%, Client 1 (Oh Su Jae) and Client 2 (Choi Jae Yi) are biologically related. 

608
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,440
 Okay. 

609
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,810
 I have something to tell you, too. 

610
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,150
Gosh. Professor is a little late.

611
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,710
I guess there's traffic.

612
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:35,060
I'm going to make her stomach explode with my full-course meal.

613
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,580
Shall we have it on the rooftop?

614
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,890
The full course on the rooftop.

615
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,020
- There she comes. 
 - Yeah?

616
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,430
She's here?

617
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,800
What the heck? Why did she stop?

618
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,230
I know. Did something happen?

619
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,780
 The person you are calling is on another line. 

620
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,900
Jae Yi disappeared. Jae Yi.

621
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,200
Where? Why?

622
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,600
Seung Yeon went out briefly and came back to find her missing.

623
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,760
The kid disappeared.

624
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,860
 Im Seung Yeon 

625
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,220
 What do we do? 

626
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,230
 Jae Yi is gone. 

627
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,610
I did report to the police.it

628
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,080
What do we do now, though?

629
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,380
Where are you right now?

630
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,380
Give me the address.

631
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,380
 The number you have dialed— 

632
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,930
Mister, please step on it and follow that car.

633
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,170
Jae Yi!

634
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,640
Jae Yi! Jae...

635
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,480
Jae Yi.

636
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,820
Jae Yi!

637
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,210
Jae Yi.

638
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,990
Soo Ah!

639
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:25,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

640
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,470
You couldn't find her? No one has seen her?

641
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,930
What about the CCTVs? Did you check the management office?

642
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,540
I'll go check there, so keep looking.

643
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,770
Call me immediately if you find her, okay?

644
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,440
Why isn't she picking up?

645
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,970
You couldn't find her? No calls either?

646
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,620
What should I do?

647
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,110
It's because I said something I shouldn't have.

648
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:16,900
I told Jae Yi that I'm going to the U.S. alone

649
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,350
and that she's going to live with her father.

650
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:23,710
That I'll come and see her once in a while.

651
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,350
I thought it was right for me to tell her myself.

652
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,530
Somehow...

653
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:31,280
I thought I needed to do whatever it took to make her understand.

654
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,320
What about the CCTVs? Have you checked them?

655
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,070
Ju Wan is doing that right now..

656
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,480
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

657
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,080
Which way is Jae Yi's school?

658
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,710
It's called Rose Elementary School.

659
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,440
You can go that way, but I don't think she went over there.

660
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,330
You never know. So I'll go check there.

661
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,460
You check the other direction.

662
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,990
Let me know right away if you find her.

663
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,620
All right.

664
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,470
 Gong Chan 

665
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,870
I'll call you back later.

666
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,690
 Hold on! 

667
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,970
Just tell me where you are.

668
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,620
Please.

669
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,180
Near Rose Elementary School.

670
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,630
There. Which way is she going there?

671
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,090
I think she's going toward the playground.

672
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:22,270
The playground CCTV. Hurry.

673
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:32,200
There she is. Which way is she going?

674
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,300
I think that's toward the academies where the stores are.

675
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,840
Thank you.

676
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,170
Jae Yi! Jae Yi!

677
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,600
Jae Yi!

678
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,650
I'm sorry that I plucked you.

679
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:21,580
But my mom likes flowers...

680
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,940
Jae Yi.

681
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,890
Ajumma.

682
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,120
Jae Yi, you crossed the street and came here by yourself?

683
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,080
You crossed the street and came here by yourself?

684
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,710
It's dangerous, and you came here alone?

685
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,880
It's okay.

686
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,210
My mom is going to the US alone because she hates me.

687
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,380
I wanted to live with her

688
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,020
and she likes flowers.

689
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,900
I see.

690
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,400
You're such a good girl.

691
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,790
What a sweetheart.

692
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,420
I found Jae Yi.

693
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,260
 We're at the elementary school. 

694
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,950
Thank you.

695
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,020
I'll be right there.

696
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:38,380
Postpone the trip to the US and let's have a talk.

697
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,990
Jae Yi.

698
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:51,640
I'll... make it

699
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,070
so that you are not sad.

700
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:58,000
I want to live with Mom.

701
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,150
I also like Dad,

702
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,960
but I like Mom more.

703
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,660
Okay.

704
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:13,480
I'll think about it more and talk to your mom.

705
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,440
I'll think even more about your side.

706
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,380
Ajumma.

707
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,320
A gift for you.

708
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,420
Thank you.

709
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,700
- Jae Yi! 
 - Jae Yi!

710
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,420
Mom, Dad!

711
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:40,000
- Choi Jae Yi! 
 - Jae Yi!

712
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:46,710
Jae Yi, let's go together.

713
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,630
Jae Yi!

714
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,590
I'm sorry.

715
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:56,550
Jae Yi!

716
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,430
- No! 
 - Jae Yi!

717
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,310
No!

718
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,770
Jae Yi!

719
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,140
Jae Yi.

720
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,620
Jae Yi!

721
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,170
Please hurry.

722
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,910
In front of Rose Elementary School, hurry!

723
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,430
A kid got hit by a car.

724
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,850
Jae Yi is hurt!

725
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,960
Professor!

726
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,140
Jae Yi!

727
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,150
  In Operation 

728
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:29,490
  CentralOperating Room 

729
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,940
How did it go?

730
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:36,830
 Central Operating Room  
 - I'm sorry. We tried our bes— 
 - Dammit!

731
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:38,530
I'm sorry.

732
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,590
I'm sorry.

733
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:04,230
- You can't go in there. 
 - Ma'am, you can't.

734
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,640
 Since CEO Choi Ju Wan requested, 

735
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,430
 I made sure nobody entered the operating room. 

736
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:40,080
I apologize, Director Cha.

737
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,120
Please,

738
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,150
please let them be for a while.

739
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,850
I ask of you.

740
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,920
 Seojoong University Hospital Director Cha 

741
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,860
My child...

742
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:33,510
You finally came to me.

743
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,930
Love you.

744
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,180
I'm sorry I came too late.

745
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,970
  Why Her? 

746
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:15,350


747
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,740
 You killed Jae Yi. 

748
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,620
 You! You killed your daughter. 

749
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:27,450
 Although the ink is still wet, I'll keep my word, so you keep yours as well. 

750
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:31,610
 Did I collect my daughter's 4 billion won special bonus? 

751
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,920
 My granddaughter passed away. 

752
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,180
 Will I be able to let bygones be bygones? 

753
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,920
 Can you reach... 

754
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,340
 Where the heck did she go? 

755
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,430
 The Bar Association Disciplinary Board will be meeting Su Jae. 

756
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,860
 What level will the punishment be? 

757
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,160
 Revocation of license and permanent expulsion. 

758
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,750
 Is it true that you've been bribing the witnesses to win cases? 

759
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,750
 You may speak about the 200 million won bribery suspicion. 

760
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:56,400
 - Candidate Baek Jin Gi, at the time... 
 - Chairman Choi. 

761
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,820
  Disciplinary Subject, please profile yourself. 

762
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,650
 Oh Su Jae. Member of Seoul Central Bar Association. 

763
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:04,920
 In the midst of becoming a partner lawyer at TK Law Firm. 

764
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,580
 Not yet.
