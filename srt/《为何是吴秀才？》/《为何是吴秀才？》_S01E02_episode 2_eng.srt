1
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,480
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:37,180


3
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,510
Okay.

4
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,780
 She didn't recognize me. 

5
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,780
 What a relief. 

6
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,270
 Episode 2 

7
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,590
Do you remember your first day at the Judicial Training Institute?

8
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,350
I saw right through you then.

9
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,290
 Jail 

10
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,370
 I will never send my client to jail 

11
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,130
 I will never send my client to jail. 

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,450
 That Oh Su Jae is the dumbass in this class. 

13
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,690
That was when I used to be innocent.

14
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,480
Not knowing I'd be so tainted like this.

15
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,490
 Legal Clinic Center Launch 

16
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,510
I heard the director position at the center hasn't been filled.

17
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,830
I'll take that position.

18
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,720
That position isn't good enough a position for you to covet.

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,600
Small issues will arise that will be a hassle for you.

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,760
They say I caused Park So Yeong's death.

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,990
I was driven out because of the crappy public opinion.

22
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,700
I need the help of public opinion in order for me to return quickly.

23
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,400
Public opinion that's friendly to me.

24
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,540
Friendly public opinion?

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,360
I guess a Legal Clinic could be helpful.

26
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,160
But another professor already has an eye on that position. What do I do?

27
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,630
 The phone is off... 

28
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,590
Geez, where did this girl go?

29
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,460
 Rolling Bar | WAY 25 

30
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,070
Excuse me.

31
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,530
Are you sure you don't know where Na Jeong went?

32
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,130
I told you. She wasn't here when I got here.

33
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,260
What if our boss finds out? Gosh...

34
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,750
"Gosh"?

35
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,230
Did you just say "gosh" to me?

36
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,940
Tell Na Jeong to call me right away when she comes back.

37
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,420
Got it?

38
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,750
Who are you to ask that?

39
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,870
I'm her oppa. Why?

40
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,640
Her biological brother? 
 (T/N: Oppa means both "true/real" or "biological")

41
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,830
I asked if you are her biological brother.

42
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,620
Of course, I am her real brother.

43
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,250
Are there fake brothers?

44
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,320
Pay attention.

45
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,700
Jeon Na Jeong!

46
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,790
Na Jeong!

47
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,230
Jeon Na Jeong!

48
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,050
 Green Junkyard 

49
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,170
 - Your call cannot be connected.  
- Geez, Jeon Na Jeong, you just let me catch you!

50
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,980
I'll tell ajumma about her working part-time.

51
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,090
Na Jeong!

52
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,740
Jeon Na Jeong!

53
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,530
Na Jeong!

54
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,820
Na Jeong...

55
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,690
Na Jeong!

56
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,560
Na Jeong, wake up!

57
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,430
Hey! Wake up!

58
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,860
Anyone here?!

59
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,220
Somebody, help!

60
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,680
Hey, Na Jeong, wake up!

61
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,640
Help! Help...

62
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,190
- Thank you. 
  - Thanks to you, we ate well! 

63
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,550
- Thanks, Hyeong. 
  - Thank you! See you! 

64
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,750
- Come back often! 
 - Okay!

65
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,980
- I'll give you lots of food on the house! 
 - Sounds great!

66
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,620
Bye! 
  Open until just now! Let's see each other again soon. 

67
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,000
I wonder if Chan's going to be late again tonight.

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,680
- I guess he's got a lot to study. 
 - Hey...

69
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,660
Today is that day.

70
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,960
- You know. 
 - Right...

71
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,340
Hey, Chan is coming.

72
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,910
Don't let it show.

73
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,800
Hyeong, I get so angry whenever he's like that because I feel so sorry for him.

74
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,450
Hey! Law school student!

75
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,530
He'll probably purchase Hansu Bio

76
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,520
and generate Assemblyman Lee In Su's presidential election fund.

77
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,030
As for money laundering,

78
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,460
Chief Han Gi Taek will be in charge of it.

79
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,100
And the evidence for that must be in here.

80
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,950
However, finding the evidence won't be easy.

81
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,880
Our job was to hide all that info.

82
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,340
We worked pretty hard on hiding it meticulously.

83
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,700
And I heard that Chairman Han's private funds

84
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,900
are personally handled by Chairman Choi Tae Gook.

85
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,200
Our chairman handles Chairman Han's slush funds?

86
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,520
Please organize everything the two of you hid.

87
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,480
And another thing.

88
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,580
Find things you both don't know about.

89
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,710
 Those files will contain things that are beyond your imagination. 

90
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,420
 Be sure to find them. 

91
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,900
"Things beyond my imagination."

92
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,330
"Find them."

93
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,930
 TK Law Firm 

94
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,400
 Law Firm CEO Choi Ju Wan, Congratulations on your installation! 

95
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,130
My apologies. You're restricted from entering the building, Attorney.

96
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,330
What are you talking about?

97
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,190
 Oh Su Jae, Partner, On Vacation  
 It says you're currently on vacation.

98
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,340
As you know, our policy is to restrict access for those on vacation.

99
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,650
Are you telling me that I'm on a vacation that I'm not aware of?

100
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,690
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,410
You should take a break. You are on vacation.

102
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,490
What is it, Su Jae?

103
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,040
I noticed you moved the Hansu Bio files to the office.

104
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
Are you here to hand them over?

105
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,820
I can't even go in due to a vacation I didn't even request.

106
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,800
The person who took my position is talking about a handover and whatnot.

107
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,950
It's getting more interesting.

108
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,400
Lift the restriction on Attorney Oh for today.

109
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,460
Yes, Chairman.

110
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,520
CEO Choi Ju Wan, congratulations!

111
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,780
Thank you.

112
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,000
Congratulations!

113
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,120
Thank you.

114
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,490
- Congratulations! 
 - Thank you!

115
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,370
 - CEO, congratulations! 
 - Congratulations! 

116
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,150
 - Congratulations! 
 - Congratulations! 

117
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,760
Thank you! I'll put my best effort forward for TK Law Firm.

118
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,400
A round of applause for the law firm CEO!

119
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,860
I have to go pee! I have to pee!

120
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,230
I have to go pee! I have to pee!

121
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,920
I'm sorry, Attorney Oh!

122
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,770
Who dareâ€” a child to the office?!

123
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,170
I have to pee! Pee!

124
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,000
 But Su Jae, would I feed the porridge I made for myself to a dog? 

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,060
 I'd rather dump the pot. 

126
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,960
 I noticed you moved the Hansu Bio files to the office. 

127
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,010
 Are you here to hand them over? 

128
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,480
Grandpa!

129
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,020
Oh, my little pup!

130
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,350
All right, all right. Where did you go?

131
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,710
- I went to the restroom. 
 - You did?

132
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,050
Oh, Je Yi, let's say hi to her.

133
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,150
To Oh Su Jae. Say hi to Attorney Oh Su Jae.

134
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,040
Hello, ajumma.

135
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,910
I'm Choi Je Yi.

136
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,070
I'm starting elementary school.

137
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,080
I got my uniform tailored.

138
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,680
Je Yi, where did you go?

139
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,650
The files and whatnot. Hand them over to Ju Wan and rest a bit.

140
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,420
He'll do a good job.

141
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,370
Oh, my, let's go.

142
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,160
Je Yi, did you get your uniform?

143
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,590
You're all grown up, Je Yi.

144
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,520
Yes.

145
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,170
Professor, this is TA Park.

146
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,580
What should I do?

147
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,290
Your class might get canceled.

148
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,930
 Everyone is causing a ruckus saying they won't take the class. 

149
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,290
Why didn't you change classes?

150
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,120
I like Professor Oh Su Jae.

151
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,930
So, is this class getting canceled?

152
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,850
I heard the class will be canceled if less than five people show up.

153
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,590
You're talking about Oh Su Jae.

154
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,720
I'm pretty familiar with the legal circle.

155
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,240
That Oh Su Jae is someone who would never let this class get canceled.

156
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,180
 Here's a message from Professor Oh Su Jae. 

157
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,860
Oh, great!

158
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,990
 Out of the Practical Fundamentals for Lawyers class, 

159
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,810
 whoever ranks first this semester 

160
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,010
 will get hired as an intern at TK Law Firm, 

161
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,270
 and the professor will pay out of her pocket 

162
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,800
 20+ million won, which is a year's worth of tuition. 

163
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,550
The responsibility for collecting and submitting the facts and evidence

164
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,440
for the person...

165
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,110
What's going on with them?

166
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,640
You guys? Hey, guys...

167
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,970
Whoa...

168
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,610
These are rulings from various trials in the last five years.

169
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,860
Submit an analysis on them by the end of the semester.

170
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,630
The lectures will happen sporadically.

171
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,480
Your grades will be worth

172
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,390
50% from the verdict analysis and 50% from the examination.

173
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,290
You'll give lectures every once in a while?

174
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,810
So how do you analyze a verdict?

175
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,670
You figure it out.

176
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,200
 What in the world? 

177
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,950
 What the heck? She doesn't tell you how? 

178
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,110
All right, before you receive the verdicts,

179
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,790
I'll announce your freshman academic advisors for each group.

180
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,920
Group 1 is Professor Jeong Hui Yeong.

181
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,660
Group 2 is Professor Seo Jun Myeong, and Group 3 is Professor Hong Gi Pyo.

182
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,110
Group 4 is Professor Jang Jae Soon, Group 5 is Professor Park Sang Jin,

183
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,230
Group 6 is Professor Yang Ji Yong, Group 7 is Professor Lee Jang Hyeok,

184
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,420
and Group 8 is...

185
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,680
Professor Oh Su Jae.

186
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,930
At the Seojung University Legal Night Event,

187
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,110
you can sit with your academic advisors.

188
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,660
Gosh, this is crazy. Why are things getting so twisted?

189
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,430
Gosh, they said my four pillars (fortune) this year are good.

190
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,750
It's much better than last year.

191
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,690
You're not a freshman? I mean... you're not, sir?

192
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,940
Oh, me? I'm a sophomore. I got all F's, so I'm taking the classes again.

193
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,650
We're all in the same group, right?

194
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,270
Right, ma'am?

195
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,630
Everyone, you shouldn't hang out with me.

196
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,920
You'll be infected with bad student disease.

197
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,600
Assemblyman Lee In Su, what's your next scheduled event?

198
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,360
Why did you visit the National Cemetery as your first stop for the presidential campaign?

199
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,420
I will work hard to live up to the people's expectations.

200
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,630
Assemblyman Lee In Su!

201
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,330
No, it's okay. Let him be.

202
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,270
 Hansu 

203
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,900
Welcome.

204
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,360
Oh my,  you're all working hard.

205
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,910
You should stay inside. Why are you standing out here?

206
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,430
- Chairman. 
 - Yes?

207
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,260
 Hansu Bio Financial Statements 

208
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,950
Fuck!

209
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,170
 TK Law Firm 

210
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,400
Chairman.

211
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,410
- Open this, Attorney Song. 
 - Pardon?

212
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,110
What are you doing? Hurry up and open it.

213
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,490
But without Attorney Oh's permissionâ€”

214
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,600
Don't you know that Attorney Oh works for me?

215
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,620
What are you doing? Open it now, Attorney Song. Hurry!

216
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,020
Hurry!

217
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,080
Wow!

218
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,270
She took the Hansu file and replaced it with  manwha  (comic books) instead?

219
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,440
I got chills. Oh Su Jae sure has guts (specifically liver). I'll give her that.

220
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,250
Respect.

221
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,030
Su Jae sure is acting up.

222
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,270
 Gosh, Attorney Oh! 

223
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,510
Gosh, seriously! You should've at least tipped me off!

224
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,770
I almost peed myself!

225
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,370
You like comics. It's a gift for you.

226
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,230
 Chairman was so enraged. 

227
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,740
 I got so scared. I was about to die! 

228
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,840
 2022 Seojung University Law School Night 

229
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,990
 2022 Lawyer of the Year, TK Law Firm, Choi Tae Guk 

230
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,460
Is the world a fair place?

231
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,050
Unfortunately, the world is never fair.

232
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,540
So is it impartial? Not even for a moment.

233
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,200
The era of unfairness and impartiality will continue.

234
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,000
Perhaps it may become worse.

235
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,950
However, everyone, we have our last bastion.

236
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,310
That is the law. In the world that's never fair,

237
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,400
where things have never been impartial.

238
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,390
While applying the law to everyone fairly and impartially,

239
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,250
all of you must fulfill your duties and responsibilities.

240
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,940
Lawyers must rectify the law that wavers in the face of money and power

241
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,870
and defend justice.

242
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,840
That is the path for me and my law colleagues at 
Seojung University.

243
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,900
I sincerely hope that my beloved juniors will also feel the same way.

244
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,330
I will assist you in every way possible. Please utilize me as much as you want.

245
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,700
For all of you, I'll be fully cooperative in being utilized by you.

246
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,940
Thank you so much for coming to Seojung University Law School.

247
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:12,150
We have two guests who have given their precious time to be with us today.

248
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,640
Executive Director Han Seong Beom, who is always so supportive of us.

249
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,250
And our proud alumnus, Assemblyman Lee In Su, is here with us.

250
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,710
Welcome them with a round of applause.

251
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,070
Congratulations, Chairman.

252
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,730
I should've brought you a bouquet.

253
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,490
Why did you do it?

254
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,940
Why did you provoke the two of them like that?

255
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,990
  To be frank, Chairman Choi drove you out. Isn't that right, Attorney Oh?  

256
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,340
 Give back the files you took and do a good job on the sale. 

257
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,590
 Then I'll set up a decent law firm for you, Attorney Oh. 

258
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,950
 I raised Chairman Choi, too. You know that. 

259
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,670
 If you hand over those files to me, 

260
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,890
 I can set up a nice position for you. 

261
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,970
 "Attorney Oh is too good to only be working for Chairman Choi." 

262
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,510
 I always thought that. Once I form my election camp, you can start as my spokesperson. 

263
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,560
 I'll take you to the Blue House if you want. 

264
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,550
 One thing at a time... 

265
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,270
What are you thinking?

266
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,150
What exactly are you trying to do?

267
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,020
Chairman, what are you thinking?

268
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,480
Don't you know why I sent my people

269
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,800
to Hansu Group and took all those files?

270
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,300
Yes...

271
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,330
The law firm CEO position, and sole control of the sale.

272
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,390
You took their files to get those things.

273
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,260
And you're about to lose both of them. So you're angry.

274
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,130
But Su Jae...

275
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,290
I'm putting my son in charge. I'm giving it to my own son.

276
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,660
More than 2 trillion won will be exchanged and 70 billion won just in commissions.

277
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,260
Do you think

278
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,220
CEO Choi Ju Wan would be able to handle such a massive task?

279
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,030
So what is it you want to do? Should I give you back the law firm CEO position?

280
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,690
Oh, no. That would be too embarrassing for me.

281
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,520
Everyone in the field knows that I was driven out and got exiled to the law school.

282
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,270
I'll go back on my own.

283
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,670
Except...

284
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,900
the sale.

285
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,020
I'm the one in charge of it.

286
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,420
I won't stop CEO Choi from joining the team.

287
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,650
Chairman Choi Tae Guk's son CEO Choi Ju Wan.

288
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,600
That name goes over well on the outside.

289
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,560
You shocked me with the manwha books.

290
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,870
You shocked the two of them with pieces of the file.

291
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,270
You stopped my son dead in the water.

292
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,750
You've come a long way.

293
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,750
Because I learned from the best teacher.

294
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,300
I'm always so grateful to you, Chairman.

295
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,120
Thanks.

296
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,560
Hey, Attorney Oh!

297
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,150
Is it Professor Oh now?

298
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,040
How come you're so pretty?

299
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,600
Wow, do you get treatments? Your complexion looks like you're still in your twenties.

300
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,760
Seonbae, you've still got that bad habit.

301
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,570
Why don't you act your age?

302
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,760
Why bother with old age?

303
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,670
People should live with a youthful attitude.

304
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,900
Hey, let's go.

305
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,360
Let's go and grab a drink.

306
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,690
You want to go to jail?

307
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,930
Move it right now.

308
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,370
Gosh, why are you being so sensitive about it?

309
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,050
Other people might think I'm sexually harassing you.

310
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,420
What's with you? You're embarrassing me.

311
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,250
I'm just glad to see you.

312
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,150
Are you all right?

313
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,070
Bastard, who the hell are you?

314
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,620
Are you okay?

315
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,580
Hey bastard, who the hell are you?

316
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,760
I'm first-year Gong Chan, Professor Seo Joon Myeong.

317
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,030
A first-year?

318
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,980
Punk, how dare you? You arrogant bastard.

319
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,000
Should I call the police?

320
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,490
Or...

321
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,250
Would you like to go with me and watch it?

322
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,880
Look at this punk. He's a total dumbass. Hey!

323
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,120
Just go, Seonbae.

324
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,440
I'm not doing anything because I don't want to create noise. Just leave quietly.

325
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,700
What a sight.

326
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,780
Apologize before you go.

327
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,140
How dare you grab me, punk!

328
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,750
Don't let me see you around campus. Okay?

329
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,110
If you're in my class, don't bother coming in at all.

330
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,890
Got it?

331
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,140
Why did you just let him go?

332
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,500
- What? 
 - You should've received an apology from him

333
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,770
so that he'd know what he did wrong.

334
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,870
How come you're not asking me to apologize to you?

335
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,390
Excuse me?

336
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,150
I had...

337
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,530
slapped you. Twice.

338
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,390
Because I was okay with it.

339
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,410
 That day you looked like you were having a rough day. 

340
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,400
If doing that made you feel better,

341
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I'm fine with that.

342
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,150
That's what I thought.

343
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,980
But still, I'll apologize.

344
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,370
I shouldn't have done that. I felt sorry.

345
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,410
And as for today's incident, pretend you didn't see it.

346
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,590
Okay.

347
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,740
One more thing.

348
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,840
Don't ever butt into my business again.

349
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,820
Whatever that may be.

350
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,700
I don't like it when other people meddle in my business.

351
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,910
Excuse me for a moment.

352
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,670
Choi Yoon Sang!

353
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,510
Is this the only way we get to see each other?

354
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,680
You should've come home for your mom's memorial day.

355
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,410
You should've cared for her like that while she was alive.

356
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,860
Your older brother became the law firm CEO.

357
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,430
You should make up your mind at some point and join us, too.

358
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,560
Do you think Hyeong (older brother) is capable of handling that position?

359
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,090
If you want to manage the firm properly, you should've just given that position to Noona (older sister).

360
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,320
Why give it and take it back? It's not like a kids' game.

361
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,380
Ju Wan could do it, too.

362
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,870
Don't denigrate him like that.

363
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,840
To me, Choi Ju Wan is just trash.

364
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,240
How could you say that about your hyeong...

365
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm leaving, Father.

366
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,270
Noona!

367
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,420
Hey!

368
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,810
What?

369
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,000
You're a second-year student in a first-year class. Good going.

370
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,280
It took you two years to get into college, too.

371
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,220
I have one thing to thank my father for.

372
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,100
When I had to prep for college again,

373
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,670
he hired a great tutor for me.

374
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,150
I think I'll do exceptionally well in my study this year.

375
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,620
Thanks to you, Noona,

376
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,020
school has become so fun all of a sudden.

377
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,310
Don't call me noona at school.

378
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,470
You'd better not make a mistake.

379
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,240
If you slip, you're dead meat.

380
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,400
You're coming to the after-party, right?

381
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,770
Are you just leaving?

382
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,430
Noona!

383
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,070
She's so thorny.

384
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,240
 Singing Practice Studio Noreaebang 

385
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,090
 - What's going on? 
 - What's this? 

386
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,470
Oh, my, what in the world?

387
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,100
Is this for real?

388
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,460
Sexual harassment?

389
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,400
 "I'm exposing Professor Seo Joon Myeong for sexual harassment." 

390
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,560
 "I'm proud to say that I'm first year Na Se Ryeon at Seojung University Law School." 

391
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,730
 "At the Seojung University Law School Night after-party" 

392
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,270
 Professor Seo Joon Myeong sexually harassed me. 

393
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,400
 "He touched a part of my body and kissed me, etc." 

394
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,150
 "He made me feel humiliated." 

395
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,950
 You touched me! 

396
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,420
 What are you talking about? 

397
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,910
 I just brushed by you. 

398
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,050
 Hey, did I sexually harass you or something? 

399
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,930
 Yes. You just touched my breasts and went down to my waist 

400
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,210
 and even touched my butt. 

401
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,660
 I did? 

402
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,080
   
 Hey, Na Se Ryeon. 

403
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,260
 You're gravely mistakenâ€” 

404
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,510
 Mistaken? 

405
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,970
 What a bunch of bullshit! 

406
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,150
 Hey, Nam Choon Poong. 

407
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,750
 Say something. You saw it, too. 

408
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,020
 Yeah... 

409
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,360
Hey, punk, how long has this been up?

410
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,860
Huh?

411
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,580
I said how long has this been up?

412
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,350
What are you doing that you're not hurrying to take it down!?

413
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,110
Okay, I'll take it down.

414
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,210
She sure wrote out all that nonsensical bullshit with such care.

415
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,400
She's a total dumbass, isn't she?

416
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,220
Don't be too nervous. You can talk to us comfortably.

417
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,760
We took down your statement from the bulletin board for now. 
  Student Council 

418
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,400
Our school reputation is on the line

419
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,460
and besides, you could get hurt for defamation if you're not careful.

420
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,700
Professor Seo is always a top-ranked in professor in evaluations.

421
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,230
He gives good lectures and is great at job connections for us after we graduate.

422
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,720
You know, right?

423
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,280
He used to be a deputy prosecutor.

424
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,330
So, what about it?

425
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,520
What does that have anything to do with me?

426
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,320
Before we called you here, we checked with Professor Seo.

427
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,920
The karaoke bar was a bit dark.

428
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,850
It's true that I was drunk.

429
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,700
Maybe I swaggered because I was drunk.

430
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,790
I think I might've fallen toward Na Se Ryeon.

431
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,600
Maybe I brushed up against her then.

432
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,780
I don't even remember that well.

433
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,060
That's the fact.

434
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,180
Oh, Nam Choon Poong was there.

435
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,240
Check with him about this.

436
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,680
Professor Seo said those were the facts.

437
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,590
Is that true?

438
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,300
Think carefully before you speak.

439
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,150
Carefully?

440
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,320
If you don't, both of you could get sued by Professor Seo.

441
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,070
The school could expel you.

442
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,610
Yes.

443
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,910
Those are the facts.

444
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,590
Choon Poong?

445
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,250
Choon Poong said that?

446
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:13,510
So, all you need to do is admit that you were mistaken and apologize to Professor Seo.

447
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,080
Wow.

448
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,140
What a load of bullshit.

449
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,170
- What? 
 - Hey, Na Se Ryeon.

450
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,550
We're trying to help you outâ€”

451
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,620
What a bunch of foaming nonsense!

452
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,980
Sunbaenims, forget it.

453
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,800
Just sit back. Okay?

454
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,540
Hey, Na Se Ryeon.

455
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,240
Na Se Ryeon!

456
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,250
Na Se Ryeon?

457
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,170
Why did you do such a thing?

458
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,220
How could your misunderstanding run so deep?

459
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,620
I'm so baffled and angry about it, but

460
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,120
I decided to think that you're only a first-year,

461
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,570
and you don't know how things are.

462
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,200
So, post a public apology and don't ever make a mistake like that again.

463
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,570
Do you understand?

464
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,660
You should be the one to apologize.

465
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,580
You should post the apology statement!

466
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,370
I guess you haven't sorted out your feelings yet.

467
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,870
I understand why that would be the case.

468
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,340
But the fact is that you've misunderstood.

469
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,600
Don't deny that.

470
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,310
Everyone, go on.

471
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,320
Se Ryeon will be more tormented if you guys do this.

472
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,320
You really have no clue how the world is.

473
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,540
Anyway, the ones who are born low can't help themselves.

474
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,150
Is it because of sheer stupidity or a tainted bloodline?

475
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,470
 You dirty bastard. 

476
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,630
   
 You killed her. 

477
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,380
 You raped your stepsister, 

478
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,960
 killed her, and threw her body in the ocean. 

479
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,820
 Look. 

480
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,980
 Look at it, bastard. 

481
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,760
 No, I didn't. 

482
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,040
 I'm not the culprit.  

483
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,160
 I really didn't do that! 

484
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,640
 Look!  

485
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,380
 You dirty scumbag. 

486
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,000
 You were born low. 

487
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,770
 Your blood is tainted. 

488
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,230
 Look! 

489
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,730
 Look at it, bastard! 

490
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,630
Think carefully.

491
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,140
You bastard, what's with you?

492
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,660
People like you...  shouldn't be here.

493
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,290
What?

494
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,420
"You"? 
  (T/N It is disrespectful to use this form of "you" to someone higher ranking.) 

495
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,680
Huh? "You"?

496
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,780
You low born scum!

497
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,570
I told you to stay out of my sightâ€”

498
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,370
You bastard!

499
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,360
Damn...

500
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,430
Come over here, man! Who the hell are you?

501
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,200
Please stop, Professor. Please stop!

502
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,540
-  Who the hell are you? 
 -  Professor!

503
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,720
- Professor, stop! 
 - Let go, let go! Come over here, you punk!

504
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,060
- Get over here! Let go! 
 - Let go of me.

505
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,150
- Please stop! Stop it. 
 - Get over here!

506
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,200
- Let go! 
 - Please calm down!

507
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,240
Get over here, you bastard! Get over here! Come over here!

508
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,600
- Get over here! 
 - Stop it!

509
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,170
Who is it? Just tell me.

510
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,750
Tell me who the hell it is!

511
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,280
Tell me his name now.

512
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,730
I'll call out all my seniors and juniors and go kill him right now.

513
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,410
Are you a thug? Which district?

514
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,090
I know pretty much all the thugs in the capital area.

515
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,170
This noona used to be a cop.

516
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,360
Oh, Noonim.

517
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,850
We're not thugs. Right, Hyeong?

518
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,550
- Hyeong. 
 - Huh?

519
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,850
- We're really good, aren't we? 
 - We're good.

520
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,370
We're good, so let's go and serve them some tasty food.

521
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,400
What would you like?

522
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,030
- Everything. 
 - Okay.

523
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,960
What?

524
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,400
She says she eats everything.

525
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,930
I'm excited.

526
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,650
Meddling in other people's business is the last thing I want to do.

527
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,220
But let me ask you one thing.

528
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,730
Did you see it or not?

529
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,120
What?

530
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,650
Professor Seo had a similar incident like this last year.

531
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,600
The girl quit school back then, and it ended like that.

532
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,810
That's right. That's a habit, you know.

533
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,690
You don't just do that all of a sudden.

534
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,580
Hey. Look me in the eyes.

535
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,800
Look at me straight!

536
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,870
Did you see Professor Seo do that or not?

537
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,030
Se Ryeon did misunderstand and Professor isn't a sexual harasser.

538
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,380
That's the fact, Noona.

539
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,880
And I don't want to get mixed up in this any further.

540
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,080
I won't let my life get twisted over this.

541
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,630
Anyway, how scary are they?

542
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,940
They say you'll have your answer when you see their background.

543
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,050
I mean, how could they make up a story and accuse you, Professor Seo?

544
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,210
They said they'll take legal action. It's clever and well written.

545
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,520
What did the director say?

546
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,340
He didn't say much. He hates any commotion.

547
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,350
He hates getting his hands dirty even more.

548
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,180
We can just sort things out among ourselves.

549
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,690
Let's limit the admission of the low class again next year.

550
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,140
Let's do that.

551
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,100
That's why she stayed back at the drinking party.

552
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,760
Gosh, I hate the sight of them all acting so desperate.

553
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,690
They're all from Group 8, right?

554
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,950
Those leftovers who are under Professor Oh Su Jae.

555
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,510
Let's try being on time for meetings, shall we?

556
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,940
I guess my group is made up of leftovers?

557
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,390
Na Se Ryeon.

558
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,090
You're the professor in charge of her. Take responsibility and make her apologize to Professor Seo.

559
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:54,700
- Why should I? 
 - She keeps making up a story and making things difficult for Professor Seo.

560
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,050
Our Professor Jeong Hui Yeong,

561
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,060
you disgrace the judge's position.

562
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,020
What?

563
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,530
Excuse me, worst-case scenario, let's have Na Se Ryeon

564
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,150
take a leave of absence or drop out voluntarily.

565
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,620
I mean, if she went to a place like that with a professor,

566
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,630
she could liven up the mood and play the tambourine.

567
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,190
She could play the role of a server, too.

568
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,090
She's the one who followed him there, and she's throwing a fuss now?

569
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,260
I thought the puddle I played in had the most dirt in it.

570
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,310
The school is filled to the brim with dirt.

571
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,340
True, our industry is so small

572
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,330
that the same circle of people goes round and round. Right?

573
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,990
- Geez... 
 - My goodness...

574
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,140
A bunch of losers.

575
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,700
 Seojeong University Law School 

576
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,250
Professor.

577
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,540
Please help me.

578
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,670
I want to get an apology from Professor Seo Joon Myeong.

579
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,660
You can't

580
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,780
Last spring,

581
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,030
 the female general affairs employee who reported sexual molestation 

582
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,300
 by an intern lawyer to upper management and got fired 

583
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,290
 was you, right? 

584
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,910
You should've come to your senses if you had gone through it once already.

585
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,230
You were victimized again?

586
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,360
And you ask for help?

587
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,450
In South Korea,

588
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,460
when you become a victim of a sexual crime, the law is not on the woman's side.

589
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,580
Do you think school is any different?

590
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,940
You should be the one to apologize to Professor Seo.

591
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,790
Putting up a handwritten poster, and uploading a voice recording.

592
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,220
Beg.

593
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,740
Soften up that moron's feelings no matter what it takes. That's your answer.

594
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,400
You could get sued and expelled for defamation.

595
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,750
You didn't come to the law school to be treated like that.

596
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,660
The reason  why  you came here.

597
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,410
Focus on that only.

598
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,830
Professor.

599
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,170
The person who's in the wrong should apologize.

600
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,500
Why do you tell Se Ryeon to do it?

601
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,350
You know how Professor Seo Joon Myeong is. That day, he also...

602
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:22,290
Regarding what happened that day, I asked you to pretend you didn't see it

603
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,320
and not to meddle in my business.

604
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,300
I don't like people meddling in my business.

605
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,510
I don't like you, Professor.

606
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,400
I don't know what type of work you did at TK Law Firm

607
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,500
and how you've lived thus far.

608
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,870
But telling her to apologize to a moron like Seo Joon Myeong...

609
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,840
That really sucks.

610
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,600
You were not like that before, Professor.

611
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,680
- Before? 
 - If Professor Seo Joon Myeong gets away with this, he'll do it again.

612
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,120
Then it won't be Professor Seo Joon Myung's wrongdoing but ours.

613
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,220
Do you want to let that happen?

614
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,600
That really sucks.

615
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,900
Se Ryeon is powerless, so even if she gets angry,

616
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,490
it doesn't work. She gets attacked.

617
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,120
But you have that power, Professor.

618
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,130
Get angry with that power.

619
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,570
Professor, you're actually a remarkable person.

620
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,110
Do you...

621
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,850
Do you like Na Se Ryeon?

622
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,280
Are you interested in Na Se Ryeon? Is that why you're doing this?

623
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,640
No, that's not it.

624
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,570
If you want to do something for a woman you like,

625
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,190
fight with something indisputable in your hand.

626
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,760
If you want to attack Seo Joon Myeong, find an indisputable piece of evidence first.

627
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,190
Handwritten poster, a voice recording. What use are they?

628
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,320
If I find something indisputable for the woman I like,

629
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,400
would you help me?

630
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,950
If at all possible, I wasn't going to step forward.

631
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,940
Attorney Oh.

632
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,890
My son-in-law is in such a bind.

633
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,890
Mom!

634
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,520
My daughter hasn't been eating for days now...

635
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,950
My husband is so attentive to our daughters.

636
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:45,540
My kids are in such shock that they refuse to go to school and won't eat.

637
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,120
I put in a call to Director Baek Jin Gi

638
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,990
to hold a meeting to sort this matter out.

639
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,240
I ask for your care, Attorney Oh.

640
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,660
We'll compensate you generously.

641
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,090
Our company's contract renewal with TK is coming up soon.

642
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,410
Yes, Chairwoman.

643
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,760
Saying he's a law school professor and a former prosecutor,

644
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,770
he was so arrogant.

645
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,320
He told me to hand it over to him or erase it immediately.

646
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,310
So, I pretended to wipe it clean and put it away.

647
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,410
As expected of our hyeongnim!

648
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,860
He was always super at reading the room ever since he was in the prison cell.

649
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,960
Hyeongnim, save a law school student.

650
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,380
Chan, heaven really helped you this time.

651
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,840
Who would've known that this hyeongnim would be the owner of this place?

652
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,530
Thank you so much, sir.

653
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:35,860
Take out that brazen son of a gun with this.

654
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,890
Take him out!

655
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,330
You, look me in the eyes.

656
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,430
Look me in the eyes and tell me again. Be honest!

657
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,670
I'm sorry.

658
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,620
I'll do anything you tell me to do.

659
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,110
It was so tough watching Se Ryeon go through this.

660
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,670
Noona, you can just kill me.

661
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,320
Ouch, wait!

662
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,500
Noona, I'm losing my hair!. I was wrong. I was wrong.

663
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,190
Hyeong, I have a boil on my butt!

664
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,540
What a piece of work you are!

665
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,710
Why did you do that?

666
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,600
You knew Se Ryeon was struggling alone.

667
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,650
Well...

668
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,610
I failed as soon as I debuted as an idol at the age of seventeen,

669
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,060
and my teen years and twenties got really twisted up.

670
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,220
I was always struggling with nothing working out.

671
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,050
It took a lot for me to get here.

672
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,170
Noona, Hyeong.

673
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,270
Do you know the reason I came to law school?

674
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,700
 - What is it? 
 - What is it? 

675
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,330
- To become president. 
 - Look at this crazy guy.

676
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,400
It's true!

677
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,580
I barely made it into law school.

678
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,480
The student body president said I could get expelled for saying something wrong.

679
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,850
And the incident kept getting bigger.

680
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,640
I didn't want my life to get twisted up again.

681
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,100
Student Se Ryeon.

682
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,170
My husband adores our daughters.

683
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,950
He'd never sexually harass a woman. He's not like that.

684
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,680
And I'm a judge. 
  Seojung University 

685
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,760
I'll put my career on the line...

686
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
 Seojung University 

687
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,340
What are you guys doing here?

688
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,030
How dare you come in here?

689
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,490
What's going on, you guys?

690
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,670
We have something to show you.

691
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,820
What's that?

692
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,290
Are you guys crazy?

693
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,580
How care you bring in crap like this?

694
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,170
I don't think it's crap, Professor.

695
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,670
What?

696
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:38,710
"The evidence that was gathered without following legal procedure cannot be submitted as evidence."

697
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,480
I'm sure you know that much.

698
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,690
This is not a courtroom but a school, Director.

699
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:47,330
The school should be a bit different.

700
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,410
Professor, when you were a prosecutor, you got caught with a prostitute.

701
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,900
What? How dare you spew such bullshit?

702
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,220
Bullshit?

703
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,140
My hoobae was in that crackdown squad

704
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,240
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency: Soliciting prostitution | Prosecutor Seo Joon Myeong  
 and he still remembers it clearly.

705
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,780
The customer who got caught redhanded

706
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,460
was Mr. Seo, who was an incumbent prosecutor.

707
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,850
- Mr. Seo! 
 - Are you crazy?

708
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,660
Why not live quietly if you quit your prosecutor position and became a professor?

709
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,270
In March 2019, you raped a TA in a campus research lab.

710
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:25,550
In June 2020, you sexually harassed a student saying, "You're pretty. Let's go for a drive."

711
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:30,120
In May 2021, you raped a student at a new student welcoming party.

712
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,280
- Additionally, well... 
 - Don't listen to him, Honey.

713
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,130
They're all nonsense. A bunch of bullshit.

714
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,350
Since the sources did not appear in person to testify, those stories are not admissible evidence.

715
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,190
The noraebang CCTV footage was also obtained illegally.

716
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,420
You'll use that to charge my husband?

717
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,970
On top of that, the footage shows that

718
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,620
Na Se Ryeon walked out of the room my husband was in, clutching her clothes.

719
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,770
That's all.

720
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,270
That's right, Director.

721
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:57,790
This video clip is inadmissible as evidence.

722
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,560
It would never be accepted in a courtroom.

723
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,500
Attorney Oh,

724
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,900
what are your thoughts?

725
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:14,780
I'd like people not directly involved to leave the room briefly.

726
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:20,070
Please make it public.

727
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,740
That would be good.

728
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,070
If you insist.

729
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,940
What's that?

730
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,880
What's that?

731
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,200
Professor Seo is hugging Professor Oh...

732
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,600
On the night of the Seojung University Law School gathering,

733
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,500
Professor Seo harassed me in the hotel hallway.

734
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,990
As a victim, I personally requested cooperation from the hotel

735
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,920
and obtained this video legally.

736
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,210
What do you think?

737
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:15,290
In your opinion, does this video clip qualify as sufficient evidence, Your Honor?

738
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,110
No, I was just holding her back to grab a drink...

739
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,110
I can't stand watching this any longer, Professor Seo.

740
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,170
What did I do so wrong?

741
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,860
When a man gets drunk, he makes mistakes!

742
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,770
Hey, did I do something to you?

743
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,570
I was just asking you to grab a drink with me.

744
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,880
My hand happened to brush up against you.

745
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,460
Should I chop off my hand then?

746
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,450
Fine. I touched you a bit.

747
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,550
You were seducing me and flirting with me first.

748
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,100
You were acting loose. That's why I did that. So what?

749
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,300
Professor!

750
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,620
Professor Seo!

751
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,290
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

752
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,880
You just confessed now to sexually harassing Na Se Ryeon.

753
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,630
Right?

754
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,720
This bastard! Seriously!

755
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,140
Let's stop this, Professor Seo.

756
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,350
I'll tell the President that due to personal reasons,

757
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,610
you submitted your resignation letter and I processed it.

758
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,560
Keep that in mind.

759
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,150
Dean!

760
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,090
Crazy bastard.

761
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,000
When you were a public defender,

762
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,470
Seo Joon Myeong crushed you in Kim Dong Gu's case, right?

763
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:59,980
Is that your trauma for a lifetime?

764
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,050
Is that why you're paying back this way?

765
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:07,800
You were humiliated because of that case and yet you were recruited by TK out of the blue.

766
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,110
People loved to talk about it back then.

767
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,120
"How did that cheap girl get into that firm?"

768
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,180
"Did she sleep with Choi Tae Guk?"

769
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,850
Why? So you can't ignore girls like Na Se Ryeon?

770
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,390
Console your husband so he doesn't do anything stupid.

771
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,550
If you don't, you'll get to see

772
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,900
these pictures on the courthouse blog.

773
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,150
 I won't just take this and walk away. 

774
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,140
 I'll take legal action. 

775
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,050
 We did not find the victim's, Jeon Na Jeong, body yet. 

776
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,260
 The total amount of blood at the site where Kim Dong Gu was found 

777
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,600
 and on the victim's ripped clothes, underwear, 

778
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,610
 and the blood on the murder weapon 

779
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:18,090
 was estimated to be 1,500 cc. 

780
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,300
 Also, the victim's blood as well as Kim Dong Gu's DNA 

781
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,530
  were on the knife in Kim Dong Gu's hand.  

782
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:28,560
 Especially, Kim Dong Gu's DNA was found on the victim's underwear. 

783
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,350
 This means Kim Dong Gu either ripped the victim's clothes and underwear and raped her 

784
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:35,040
 or at the least tried to rape her but failed. 

785
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,950
 It's more than enough to establish that he murdered the victim with the weapon. 

786
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:43,750
 Also, the fact that Kim Dong Gu was the last person that the victim spoke to before her death. 

787
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,970
 More than anything, we're focusing on the fact that Kim Dong Gu and victim Joon Na Jeong 

788
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:52,610
 were not biologically related siblings but step siblings. 

789
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,930
 No, Dad. 

790
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,240
 Dad, I didn't do it! Really! 

791
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,440
 Ajumma, I didn't do it. 

792
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,840
 Why would I kill Na Jeong...? 

793
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,720
 I really didn't do it! 

794
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,450
 I went to get Na Jeong, but over there, he... 

795
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,550
 You bastard. 

796
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,740
 Die. 

797
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,920
 Go to hell. 

798
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,420
 Crazy bastard. 

799
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,970
 Stand up, man! Stand up! 

800
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:52,250
 You bastard! Bastard... 

801
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,630
 Hey, crazy bastard! 

802
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:58,120
 Bastard, how dare you rape your stepsister and kill her? 

803
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,920
 Damn you! 

804
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,290
 You're not even human, man! 

805
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:06,030
 - Come here! 
 - How could bastard like this pollute this place? 

806
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,500
 Right. I did that... 

807
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,090
 I killed her... I did... 

808
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,720
 I killed her! 

809
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,030
 I killed her and threw her into the ocean! So what? 

810
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,920
 Hey, come here! 

811
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,990
 You bastard! 

812
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,210
 Now, now, now! 

813
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,340
 Hyeongnim, he'll die at this rate. 

814
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,630
 Yong Cheol, stop it now. 

815
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:36,050
 Now, now, let's finish up Go-Stop from earlier. 

816
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,060
 - Go-Stop! 
 - You bastard! 

817
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,650
 Let's play Go-Stop. 

818
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,790
 Okay, come here. Come here. 

819
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,450
Why did you do that?

820
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:22,620
The CCTV footage.

821
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,640
You didn't have to take it that far.

822
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,830
I didn't want to suck.

823
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,740
You were really cool.

824
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:43,090
Would you like to eat with me?

825
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,370
What?

826
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,210
Well, that's no good, huh?

827
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,100
I guess that sucked again.

 Seojung University 

829
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,860
I didn't do that because I liked Se Ryeon.

830
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,600
I like you, Professor.

831
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:34,880
 This court sentences the defendant Kim Dong Gu to TEN years of imprisonment.

 and you must have substance. 

837
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,790
 Both, you... 

838
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:14,820
 and me. 

839
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,570

849
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,600
 The culprit of the murder of a female middle schooler 

850
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,500
 that shocked the nation a year ago has been caught. 

851
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,170
 The culprit wasn't her stepbrother 

852
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:00,040
 but a third person who was not even on the suspect list. 

853
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,040
 As the culprit was caught after a year,  
    

854
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,350
 - the rape of his stepsister... 
 - The culprit No Byeong Chool was arrested... 

855
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,830
 - Unfairly imprisoned... 
 - However, the prosecution... 

856
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,800
 states that all the investigation and trial procedures were legal... 

857
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,810
 With this, Kim Dong Gu was able to clear his name from being a violent criminal 

858
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,940
 who raped and murdered his step-sister, 

859
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,120
 - although it's late in the case. 
 - He's coming out!

 He's coming out! 

861
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,130

 You're released with a not guilty verdict. How do you feel?

 - A word, please! 

866
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:34,680

 How could you come out? How?

 Why do you want to attend law school? 

895
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:10,420
 There is someone I really want to find.

â™«  I made a promise to myself since that day  â™«

906
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:13,560
 Park So Yeong. How did you get in here? 

907
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,030
 Why are you still here? 

908
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:16,090
 So I can die. 

909
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,630
 I've been framed as a gold digger because of you. 

910

 I feel such injustice. So I want to die right here.

 Professor Oh Su Jae is a criminal!

 She drove my sister to her death! 

913
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:30,770
 Could you charge a lawyer for abetting suicide? 

914
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:31,980
 So, what do you think now that you've looked into it? 

915

 Is it true that I caused Park So Yeong's death? 

916
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:36,690
 Do you have someone else in mind as the culprit? 

917
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,610
 If you're curious, you should look into it yourself.
