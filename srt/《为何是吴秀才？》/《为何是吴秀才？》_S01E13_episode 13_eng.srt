1
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,600
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,280
I...

3
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,510
was guilty of a crime.

4
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,850
Chairman Choi led the investigation team on the Financial Savings Bank corruption

5
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,230
fifteen years ago.

6
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,230
I was the one who introduced the illegal loan broker to

7
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,920
the CEO of the savings bank.

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,470
And I received the payment from the broker.

9
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,430
When investigations began, I knelt down in front of Choi Tae Kook, begging for my life.

10
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,440
 I begged like a dog on my knees. 

11
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,860
You are telling me that, because of this flaw,

12
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,030
you knew that those three bastards were culprits, and yet you didn't do anything?

13
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,160
For this long time, like a dead man?

14
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,990
I needed a bit of money.

15
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:29,050
I wanted to buy a home for Eun Seo and her mom.

16
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,190
All you have are trashy excuses,

17
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,710
and you want to team up against them?

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,410
Reopen a finished case with a fabricated culprit

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,230
and try to win without any proof?

20
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,530
Please help.

21
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,960


22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,470
Those knees of yours are...

23
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,910
so cheap.

24
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,070
Knees that go down whenever needed.

25
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,590
Who else do you plan to kneel for?

26
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,740
If I can get them,

27
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,860
I can kneel down ten times, a hundred times if necessary.

28
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,280
As long as I can get at them.

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,440
Han Dong Oh, Lee Shi Hyeok, and Choi Ju Wan.

30
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,890
They need to be caught.

31
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,250
We can capture them together!

32
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,320
Oh Su Jae!

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,930
 That's why I bought that house. 

34
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,700
 The shreds of evidence from that day should be there. 

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,850
 I'll find them for sure. 

36
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,590
 Evidence. 

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,250
 - That part-timer 
 - Are you okay? 

38
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,900
 was Kim Dong Gu's sister, Jeon Na Jeong. 

39
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,290
 - My phone? 
- Okay. 

40
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,450
 Wait here for a moment. 

41
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,780
 Hey! Where is that bitch. 

42
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,730
 Hand Dong Oh, Lee Shi Hyeok, and Choi Ju Wan. 

43
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,530
 Eun Seo, who they kidnapped, 

44
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,390
 got into an accident and 

45
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,750
 I'm sure they probably didn't leave Jeon Na Jeong alone 

46
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,870
 since she witnessed everything. 

47
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,220
 Who's that bitch? 

48
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,790
 That bitch saw everything! 

49
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,230
 Hey! Get that bitch! 

50
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,840
 When it comes to the fathers of those three bastards, 

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,580
 especially the inspector general at the time, 

52
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,270
 Choi Tae Kook. 

53
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,400
 Instead of his son 

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,410
 and his friends, 

55
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,870
 making Kim Dong Gu the guilty party 

56
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,780
 I'm sure was a piece of cake for him. 

57
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,970
 You go on ahead. 

58
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,970
 I'll go as soon as I wrap up some work here. 

59
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,540
 With that piece of trash 

60
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,340
 I... 

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,770
 Episode 13 

62
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,730
 Choi Yoon Sang 

63
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,130
 Noona, I need to tell you something about Chan. 

64
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,760
 Answer the call. 

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,640
Choi Yoon Sang, what do you think you are doing?

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,240
 Kim Dong Gu. 

67
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,950
 You deceived Noona and 

68
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,790
 Noona abandoned you. 

69
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,320
 Choi Yoon Sang 

70
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,640
 Noona abandoned you. 

71
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,630
 You still don't understand what I'm saying? 

72
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,800
 Su Jae Noona  
 Noona abandoned you at that trial!

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,670
Since she lost that trial,

74
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,820
she was able to come and work under my father at TK Law Firm.

75
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,020
Wh-What...

76
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,740
 What do you mean? 

77
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,830
 What are you saying? Make it clear. What are you saying? 

78
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,350
Noona's mom and brothers were arrested,

79
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,850
and she received a deal.

80
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,220
Through her lecturer, Director Baek Jin Gi,

81
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,390
"Don't waste your efforts needlessly on Kim Dong Gu's trial.

82
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,090
Then I will have your family freed."

83
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,700
Don't spew words that you can't take responsibility for.

84
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,080
This is why you and Noona won't work out.

85
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,660
Because you deceived Noona,

86
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,780
and she abandoned you.

87
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,320
It doesn't matter.

88
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,490
 It doesn't matter. 

89
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,250
If Professor gave up on me and saved her family back then, that is all right.

90
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,930
That's the right thing to do.

91
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,420
I would've done the same.

92
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,670
 Don't overreach. 

93
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,510
 If you justify her actions by saying that, 

94
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,910
 do you think her deeds will be erased? 

95
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,710
 Overreaching? 

96
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,820
The whole world called me the culprit.

97
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,060
Even my father didn't believe me.

98
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,630
Do you know how much of a hell that is?

99
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,310
The only person who believed me in that hell was Professor.

100
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,380
 You wouldn't know, Hyeong 

101
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,030
 That a single "I believe you" 

102
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,780
 can let a person breathe and live on. 

103
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,710
 I'm sure you can't even imagine. 

104
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,910
Being a sucker like that is why you got framed.

105
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,070
Being a sucker like that is why you get used!

106
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,740
So what if I'm a sucker?

107
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,190
I still had someone who believed me.

108
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,480
 That's more than enough. 

109
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,330
 Whether she abandoned me or not at the trial, 

110
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,470
 it doesn't matter. 

111
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,040
 Crazy bastard. 

112
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,610
♫  You're here now  ♫

113
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,580
♫  Don't be hurting anymore  ♫

114
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:33,500
♫  I'll watch you, listen to you, and go through it with you  ♫

115
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,110
 The public defender who solely believed me, Oh Su Jae 

116
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,530
 The public defender who solely believed me, Oh Su Jae 

117
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,870
♫  It's okay even if we're far apart again  ♫

118
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,230
How come everything is okay with you?

119
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,430
How does nothing matter to you?

120
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,050
Does this not matter to you as well? 
  Recent Calls - Noona Su Jae 

121
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,470
Is it also not a big deal?

122
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,480
 Recent Calls - Noona Su Jae 

123
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,360
What did you do?

124
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,230
What did you do to the Professor—

125
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,040
Are you worrying about Noona even now?

126
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,260
I'm telling you she abandoned you.

127
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,350
I feel so...

128
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,410
disgusted.

129
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,180
 Closed for the day, Thank you 

130
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,870
In fact,

131
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,470
I did question whether Professor gave up on the trial or not.

132
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,730
What? When?

133
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,180
When?

134
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,060
During the trial?

135
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,330
I was mindless then.

136
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,520
While I was studying for law school

137
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,350
I suddenly got curious about my trial history.

138
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,410
Did you see anything that was out of place?

139
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,390
The witnesses called by Professor

140
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,850
overturned their testimonies.

141
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,690
Thinking back,

142
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,730
I think she also felt the same way.

143
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,690
That it's a trial set for her to lose.

144
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,020
No matter what she does, she's set to lose the trial.

145
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,040
So she did stab you in the back.

146
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,330
That's abandoning you, man.

147
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,460
Go up to sleep if you're going to keep rubbing salt on his heart.

148
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,060
Go up, go up. Hurry.

149
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,470
Come on, Hyeong.

150
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,710
It just burns me up. Are you okay, Hyeong?

151
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,920
Are you okay, Hyeong?

152
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,400
- You're just as pissed as I am. 
 - I should just!

153
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,700
My life is so...

154
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,120
pathetic, Joon Hui.

155
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,040
It's not your fault.

156
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,520
Don't think like that because it's not your fault.

157
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,930
No. It's my fault.

158
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,580
My decision threw Kim Dong Gu into hell.

159
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:30,340
My decision pushed my life down into the gutter.

160
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,050
Not even knowing that it's a gutter.

161
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,170
Thinking that it's a place full of flowers.

162
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,310
So embarrassing.

163
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,920
So regretful.

164
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,880
So shameful.

165
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,280
Chan.

166
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,400
I heard that Professor heard your conversation with Yoon Sang earlier.

167
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,620
Even if you say that you don't mind,

168
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,190
Professor won't be able to see you.

169
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,300
Geez. Of course, she can't see him.

170
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,330
If it were me, I'd be avoiding him.

171
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,380
I'd never run into him.

172
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,650
How can a person live and always be right?

173
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,690
If you get to know that person...

174
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,180
 Kim Dong Gu? 

175
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,530
 It's so messed up. 

176
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,670
 But you know... I believe you. 

177
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,790
If you find out that she is a good person,

178
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,900
your feelings for that person don't change

179
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,880
even if you realize that she did you wrong.

180
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,460
How can I be shaken up so easily

181
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,770
when I know what kind of person she is?

182
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,440
We are like that, too.

183
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,290
We rub each other the wrong way sometimes, but we're still okay.

184
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,570
Of course, we're okay.

185
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,850
Rubbing the wrong way is no big deal.

186
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,400
That's right.

187
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,290
It's not a big deal.

188
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,080
No need to walk me out.

189
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,770
Gosh. Gosh... Look at your smile. Geez.

190
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,440
Everyone regrets.

191
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,270
That's not embarrassing.

192
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,150
The ones who should really be ashamed...

193
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,120
Shame those morons even more.

194
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,360
Make sure they certainly suffer the consequences.

195
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,000
That's who Oh Su Jae is!

196
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,280
That's my friend, Oh Su Jae.

197
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,010
As expected, you were right, Attorney Oh.

198
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,210
Chief Ha was caught right in your foot traffic.

199
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,640
 I barely managed to secure a CCTV footage. 

200
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,570
 I will send it to you right away. 

201
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,790
 He listened to your lecture and stood there afterward 

202
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,710
 but hid somewhere else when people came out. 

203
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,240
 Then he went to TK Law Firm after the Law School. 

204
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,580
 Nothing after that. 

205
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,520
 Please keep working at it. 

206
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,720
Gong Chan

207
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,820
What's the matter at this hour?

208
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,490
Let's call it even.

209
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,130
I hid from you that I'm Kim Dong Gu.

210
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,690
I have my share of mistakes.

211
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,050
So let's call it even.

212
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,160
What?

213
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,510
I know Hyeong Yoon Sang made you hear everything last night.

214
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,310
Is this something we can do that with?

215
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,760
What I did to you...

216
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,070
Leave.

217
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,130
I don't care!

218
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,740
I don't care because I know what kind of person you are. It doesn't matter.

219
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,600
 Profesor Oh Su Jae 

220
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,810
Come in.

221
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,480
Come in and talk.

222
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,370
I abandoned you.

223
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,550
Hiding that you're Kim Dong Gu is nothing in comparison.

224
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,640
What I did to you—

225
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,240
Director Baek told me everything.

226
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,010
Who the suspect is and who was behind him.

227
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,360
Let's get them together.

228
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,450
The people who ruined my life and disturbed your life.

229
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,470
Let's get them together.

230
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,110
Leave now.

231
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,180
 Jeon Na Jeong's clothes that night 

232
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,670
 Suicide? 

233
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,880
 The Yeongpyeong District remains? Suspect homicide. Who? Why? 

234
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
 Choi Tae Kook, Seo Joon Myeong, Min Young Bae 

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 The reason I was hired by TK Law Firm 

236
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,060
 All my evidence and witnesses made to be useless 

237
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,140
 Samjoong-dong Chairman Han's Home? Evidence? 

238
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,530
They're thoughtless doodles—

239
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,290
What's this?

240
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,430
Tell me. What's this?

241
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
That night...

242
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,110
I heard that Na Jeong helped Director Baek's daughter.

243
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,640
By chance, is his daughter's name...

244
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,070
Kang Eun Seo.

245
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,240
 Kang Eun Seo, Baek Jin Gi, Yoon Se Pil  
 Their last names are different, but she is his daughter.

246
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,580
That night, Kang Eun Seo was hit by a car

247
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,910
 and was admitted to a hospital where Jun Hui was working as a resident. 

248
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,640
 With a convenience store uniform 

249
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,220
that has a tag with Jeon Na Jeong's name.

250
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,340
Joon Hui said 
  Jeon Na Jeong, Yoon Se Pil 

251
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,520
that Kang Eun Seo was victimized from 
  Kang Eun Seo, Baek Jin Gi, Yoon Se Pil 

252
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,250
some other incident before the car accident.

253
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,130
Even that incident...

254
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,300
 That day, Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong Oh, Lee Shi Hyeok  
 was caused by these people...

255
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,400
These people killed my Na Jeong.

256
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,540
 Jeon Na Jeong, September 4, 2012 

257
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,120
 Jeon Na Jeong, September 4, 2012 

258
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,950
She was a good girl.

259
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,890
Although I didn't do her any good.

260
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,300
I was...

261
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,000
sorry...

262
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,150
Whenever I thought of you, here and there, I felt guilty.

263
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,450
But I tried to ignore that feeling.

264
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,210
I thought that I must.

265
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,380
Because I was afraid of regretting.

266
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,270
I'm...

267
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,060
so, so...

268
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,950
sorry.

269
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,580
Director.

270
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,050
I have a favor to ask.

271
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,810
Here is the gathered information on the incident ten years ago.

272
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,130
Are we now on the same team?

273
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,470
No way.

274
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,340
We just share the same goal.

275
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,960
Tell Director for me.

276
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,450
He should meet the consequences of his cowardice on his own.

277
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,020
That is my condition.

278
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,970
The suspects of that incident are really...

279
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,250
these three people...

280
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,010
No,

281
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,530
these three bastards?

282
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,230
We need to find surefire proof.

283
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,430
It won't be easy because so much time has passed.

284
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,940
We must find it.

285
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,130
One more thing.

286
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,860
Those bastards are not capable of moving and resolving things on their own.

287
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,690
Even more so ten years ago.

288
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,340
Those kinds of people are dreaming of becoming a law firm chairman,

289
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,310
a corporate chairman,

290
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,000
and the president?

291
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,620
After ruining an innocent man's life,

292
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,200
and your life, too, Attorney Oh.

293
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,170
Are you okay?

294
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,690
I'm not okay.

295
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,160
 A Just Country, A New Country, Assemblyman Lee In Su will achieve it 

296
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,330
Yes.

297
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,350
The approval ratings went up seven percent over the weekend.

298
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,430
I have five interviews scheduled just today.

299
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm thrilled.

300
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,810
You dressed well, right?

301
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,840
Go to the salon.

302
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,420
Get your hair styled nicely, too.

303
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,430
Of course, I went already.

304
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,700
How are things over there? Yeongpyeong District is fine, right?

305
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,290
Did the remains get taken care of?

306
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,490
I just came back from the site.

307
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,210
Perfect, okay?

308
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,950
We're identifying the remains right now.

309
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,770
The family should come up or something.

310
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,100
Nothing to worry about.

311
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,700
Oh, right, when is Director Baek quitting the school?

312
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,530
 Today is probably his last day. 
     

313
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,230
 He could just leave quietly on his last day, 

314
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,880
 but I think he's hosting some odd event. 

315
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,070
 A case about abuse of power by a prosecutor that resulted in unfair prison time for an innocent person 

316
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,380
 Victim Kim 

317
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,800
Victim Kim?

318
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,340
Hey, my attorney.

319
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,780
Good.

320
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,460
 Seojung University 

321
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,120
Victim Kim

322
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,480
 was arrested for murdering his wife 

323
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,130
 using a hammer because he suspected his wife of cheating. 

324
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,780
 He was investigated by Prosecutor Han 

325
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,730
 and was sentenced to capital punishment at the trial. 

326
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:42,410
 It was because all the evidence was pointing to him. 

327
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,860
 Kim, who was serving unfair prison time, three years later 

328
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,800
 was found innocent three years later 

329
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,210
 when Choi, who was imprisoned for robbery, confessed to the killing. 

330
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,900
 Then Kim sued Prosecutor Han who framed him as the culprit. 

331
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:04,530
Defendant, what do you think about Kim who had to serve unfair prison time?

332
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,140
 You're seeing yourself in Victim Kim. 

333
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,500
 That is why you are asking me this question. 

334
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,730
 You're right. 

335
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,400
 You're the same as Prosecutor Seo Joon Myeong who framed me as the culprit back then. 

336
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,840
Personally speaking, I feel regretful.

337
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,750
Do you have any intention of apologizing?

338
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,160
None at all.

339
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,560
 The research states that Assemblyman Lee's approval ratings for those in their twenties and thirties 

340
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,300
 has increased more than eight percent. 
    

341
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,400
 The groundbreaking home mortgage policies aiming at the young generation— 

342
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,560
- Secured the young voters. 
  - As the Minister of Justice hearing nears, /   

343
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,850
 minister candidate Director Baek Jin Gi 

344
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,930
 formally announced his resignation from his director position at Seojung University Law School today. 

345
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,370
 Minister of Justice candidate Baek Jin Gi, as soon as he resigns— 

346
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,810
- Chairman. 
 - Yeah?

347
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,190
Chief Han Gi Taek had called earlier.

348
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,050
 What you promised when you had me locked up in here... 

349
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,820
 I still didn't hear about it. 

350
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I didn't come in here for charity.

351
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,650
If you keep it up like this, I don't know when I might just spill it, Chief.

352
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,200
Got it?

353
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,050
Do you think you'll be unscathed?

354
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,230
Say I don't know when I'll start running my mouth.

355
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,260
Be sure to tell Chairman.

356
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,700
 Do you understand? 

357
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,570
Gosh, this money bug-like punk.

358
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,210
Tell him to wait quietly.

359
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,790
He should know that I'll give it to him when it's the right time.

360
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,850
Understood, Sir.

361
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,640
All the investigation processes regarding Kim were

362
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,300
carried out via legal and appropriate methods.

363
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,390
I'll ask the witness who was the suspect at the time.

364
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:59,550
Were you ever abused or forced to confess during the investigation?

365
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,700
No, ma'am.

366
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,130
Did you ever feel you were unfairly treated during the trial?

367
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,650
Nobody gave an ear to my plea for innocence.

368
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,510
No one... believed me.

369
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,350
 No one believed me. 

370
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,030
Of course not,

371
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,260
because your words kept changing.

372
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,040
 Because you changed your testimony. 

373
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,650
 Your reversal of testimony was your downfall. 

374
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,140
 But the Professor still trusted me. 

375
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,100
Right after the time of the incident, the victim was mentally weak from the shock

376
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,940
of seeing the body of his wife who had been brutally murdered.

377
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,110
Because he was arrested on the spot in a state of mental weakness,

378
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,970
he became even more anxious and suffered from seeing and hearing hallucinations,

379
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,110
which is why he falsely confessed to murdering his wife.

380
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,270
However, Your Honor, the psych evaluation that was done per the victim's request

381
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,310
concluded that they did not find any medical issues with him.

382
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,330
Seojung University School of Law

383
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,410
 Judge 

384
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,630
Looks like we came in uninvited.

385
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,350
I apologize, Your Honor.

386
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,090
Gosh, not at all, Director.

387
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:24,440
I was pondering about what to gift to you all before I leave

388
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,590
and I thought I should invite Chairman Choi from TK Law Firm

389
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,630
that everyone wishes to work at.

390
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,530
So, at my sudden request, he agreed to come.

391
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,630
Thank you for warmly welcoming a gate-crasher like me.

392
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,530
Then I believe, Chairman Choi, you should be sitting here instead of me.

393
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,460
- What does everyone think? 
  - We agree! 

394
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,540
Prosecutor.

395
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,160
Begin witness examination.

396
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,010
Witness, what did you do after finding Kim's car during the investigation?

397
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,270
When a wife is killed, the husband becomes the primary suspect.

398
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,220
Of course, I searched the car because I considered it to be the suspect's

399
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,310
and I found a hammer in the trunk.

400
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,690
As you know, the blood of the deceased Shim and the DNA of the husband Kim were found on the hammer.

401
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,950
And everything was completed perfectly.

402
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,630
Witness, this trial is open because it was not perfect.

403
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,310
You still say so?

404
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:43,410
It was perfect at the time. Only back then, okay?

405
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,660
Although he's in the defendant's seat,

406
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,260
Prosecutor Han also trusted our investigation very much as well.

407
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,250
 Court in session  
 According to the NFS report,

408
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,260
they found the victim Shim's blood,

409
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,340
Kim's fingerprints and DNA, and

410
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,180
an unidentified fingerprint on the hammer.

411
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,460
Prosecutor Han, you must've known about it since you were in charge.

412
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,650
However, Defendant, in order to frame Kim as the culprit,

413
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,890
you didn't even check the unidentified fingerprint

414
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,900
as a possible suspect and dismissed it.

415
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,230
That is not true, Your Honor.

416
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,270
There was no need to look further because that fingerprint was identified

417
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,410
as one of the police officers who was at the scene.

418
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,300
Objection, Your Honor.

419
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,480
There was more than one unidentified fingerprint.

420
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,600
Proceed.

421
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,850
There was one more unidentified fingerprint beside the police officer's.

422
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:42,700
The process of identifying the additional fingerprint's owner was omitted

423
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,500
and the innocent Kim had to spend three long years,

424
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,910
a hellish time in the cold cell of a prison.

425
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,350
 The unidentified fingerprint on the knife was dismissed by you lot. 

426
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,700
Defendant.

427
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,100
What is the reason you omitted this process to identify the fingerprint?

428
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,900
Because it was not important.

429
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,540
Kim, at the time, confessed his crime and his fingerprint was found on the hammer.

430
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,560
Therefore, I requested his arrest warrant

431
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,470
and asked for capital punishment at the trial.

432
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,990
I processed everything legally and appropriately.

433
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,850
What do you mean that the unidentified fingerprint is not important?

434
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,070
Identifying all fingerprints on the crime tool is obviously the next process.

435
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,800
Didn't you omit it intentionally in order to frame the suspect as the culprit?

436
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,060
That is a very insulting statement.

437
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,420
That is not so, at all.

438
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,910
You should've identified that fingerprint.

439
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,790
Why did you omit it!

440
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,950
Because it was a trivial fact after Kim confessed.

441
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,080
Why do you make us say the same thing?

442
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,220
Instead of repeating the same answe—

443
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,800
Silence.

444
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,680
Silence, please.

445
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:02,440
Okay. What is the prosecutor's argument currently?

446
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,880
Of the investigations or the trial proceedings at the time, which one are you arguing to be faulty?

447
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,950
The investigation was not done legally.

448
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,780
What exactly was not legal about it?

449
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,130
The defendant intentionally fabricated a report that made it look like

450
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,150
only Kim's fingerprint was found.

451
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:23,070
He also abused his power to fabricate a false testimony that reported

452
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,640
a police officer's fingerprint being on the hammer to arrest Kim.

453
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,820
This is article 124 clause 1 of the criminal penal code

454
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,510
which is a crime of confinement by abuse of power.

455
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,500
Defendant.

456
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,130
Is it true that you fabricated the investigation report and the testimony report?

457
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,930
I did not.

458
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,140
One of the police officers at the scene accidentally touched the hammer

459
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,970
and worried about his fingerprint coming out.

460
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,100
I only wanted to make sure that part didn't become an issue.

461
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,060
So I received his testimony as a report.

462
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,110
Hence, that is why when an unidentified fingerprint came out,

463
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,910
he considered it to be that of the police officer and dismissed it as trivial.

464
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,450
There were no intentions to hide it.

465
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,710
Dismissing it as trivial itself is the issue.

466
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,780
I don't understand why you claim that as an issue.

467
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,840
A hammer that was surely the confessed suspect's crime tool, was found in his car

468
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,220
and if his fingerprint was found on the hammer.

469
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,900
It more than suffices as reinforcing evidence for the confession.

470
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,100
Does it not?

471
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,630
What more is needed?

472
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,920
If enough evidence was found,

473
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,350
it is trivial whether another one or ten other fingerprints

474
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,980
are found and there is no need to continue the investigation.

475
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,730
 The Judge's Bench 

476
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,790
Here is the verdict.

477
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:57,300
As a result, it is admitted that Kim was innocent

478
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,650
and the real culprit existed elsewhere.

479
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,500
However,

480
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,260
this was found because of the real culprit's confession.

481
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,000
There is not enough evidence

482
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,690
to say that there was an intentional abuse of power in arresting Kim,

483
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:20,180
although, the Criminal Procedure Law states that you should not arrest a single innocent person

484
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,720
even if you may miss ten criminals.

485
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,610
Just because the investigation and the trial proceedings failed to see the actual

486
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,540
innocence of the defendant that was later found, like this case,

487
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,360
the according investigator is not

488
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,080
responsible nor are his previous investigation

489
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,600
methods an abuse of power.

490
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,340
If so,

491
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,620
the investigating agency's authorities will be overly diminished.

492
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,580
Then when they can't prove a suspect guilty 100 percent,

493
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,670
the arrest and punishment of a criminal will become difficult,

494
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:59,350
which will bring about larger social unrest and chaos in the long term.

495
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,500
Most of all, the defendant

496
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,940
seems to have done everything in his power

497
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,970
in the investigation process and

498
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:13,630
the reasons and situation for his omittance of the unidentified fingerprint

499
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,670
is understandable.

500
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,980
Besides those claims,

501
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,680
there is no other way to prove that the defendant intended to arrest

502
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,070
while knowing the victim to be innocent.

503
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,500
Hereafter, the defendant

504
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,710
is not guilty.

505
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:41,070
Now, a round of applause

506
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,110
for Chairman Choi of TK Law Firm

507
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:47,520
who gave us a great verdict!

508
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,850
You don't need to worry about the hearing, Sunbaenim.

509
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,660
As for me, I'm just going with it trusting you, Chairman Choi.

510
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,710
I had a great time today, thanks to you. It was valuable.

511
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,080
It was valuable, huh?

512
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,330
The trial is over.

513
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,520
Ten years ago.

514
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,350
Ungju Half-sibling Murder Case.

515
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,100
Also known as the Kim Dong Gu case.

516
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:14,650
I have a question for you who were the inspector general at the time, Chairman Choi Tae Gook

517
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,680
since today's mock trial case is similar.

518
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,410
Can't you guess what I'm going to say already?

519
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,450
I remember that Kim Dong Gu confessed and there were no issues in the investigation

520
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,340
or the trial proceedings.

521
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,310
How did No Byung Chool become the culprit?

522
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,890
Who made him so, and why did he die?

523
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,560
Why before the parole?

524
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,950
You came to the wrong address. That is not a question for me.

525
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,470
Was it Prosecutor Seo Myeong Joon

526
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,330
who made Kim Dong Gu the culprit

527
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,060
and then made Noh Byung Chool the real culprit?

528
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,800
Or is there someone else behind him?

529
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,310
Kim Dong Gu.

530
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,150
If you were Kim Dong Gu, right?

531
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:08,060
After ten years, the culprit No Byung Chool killed himself out of guilt.

532
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,370
At this point, what would you do if you were Kim Dong Gu.

533
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,880
I'd find the culprit.

534
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,600
The one who made Kim Dong Gu the culprit,

535
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,470
made No Byung Chool the second culprit, and led him to his death. The real culprit.

536
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,470
I'd search for him until the end.

537
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,390
Kim Dong Gu is doing all that.

538
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,150
So foolish that it breaks my heart.

539
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,010
Because foolish acts always meet unfortunate consequences. That is the nature of this world.

540
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,320
If you ever meet Kim Dong Gu, please pass these words on.

541
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,980
please pass these words on.

542
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,300
If you know the real culprit, please pass these words,

543
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,700
that he'll meet the consequences of taking someone else's life so lightly.

544
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,340
Arrogant brat.

545
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,070
How dare he stop me?

546
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,370
I'm sorry, Chairman.

547
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,810
I'll make sure to get rid of him this time.

548
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,740
Let him be. Let's see how far he takes this.

549
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,520
It'll be fun to watch how far he makes it.

550
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,220
If he messes with me, then Su Jae will, too.

551
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:20,450
If I trample Su Jae, he'll be powerless, too.

552
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,550
That will be fun to watch.

553
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,050
 Seojung University Law School, Director Baek Jin Gi 

554
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,580
Come in.

555
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,400
Choi Yoon Sang.

556
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,490
Good job today.

557
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,000
Chairman Choi was also satisfied.

558
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,460
Why did you host an event like that?

559
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,100
Assigning roles and all that.

560
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,000
 I have a favor to ask. 

561
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,140
Please let me meet Chairman Choi.

562
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,450
I wanted to get a mock trial as a present rather than a meaningless retirement ceremony.

563
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,390
Exactly.

564
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,840
Why with such a case,

565
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,360
give Chan and me such roles?

566
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,910
Is that what you want to know?

567
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,360
Is there something on your mind?

568
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,530
You remind me so much of Chairman Choi.

569
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,270
But also very different from him.

570
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,510
That was always on my mind.

571
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,190
It'll be hard for you to live an easy life.

572
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,120
Always so lonely.

573
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,250
I'm not sure what you mean.

574
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,280
When I heard that you were quitting Legal Clinic Center

575
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,060
and starting as an intern at TK Law Firm,

576
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,900
I felt a little troubled.

577
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,420
"What'd be his reason?"

578
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,050
"Does he have some other motive?"

579
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,940
I just made the obvious choice as my father's son.

580
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,850
I hope it helps you find the answer.

581
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,330
Gosh. I wanted to wear the prosecutor's uniform, too.

582
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:32,290
Look at you, Noo-nim Kang Ja. Your charisma!

583
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,450
Hey, you also look like a real lawyer.

584
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,320
What's this? What's with you two?

585
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,940
Is this mock trial aftermath?

586
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,690
Yes, yes. Yes, it is.

587
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,840
Hey.

588
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,700
I'm in a foul mood since I lost. At least, you won.

589
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,510
It's because I feel uneasy about my victory.

590
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,680
How is that not guilty?

591
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,300
When the victim had to serve three unfair years in prison,

592
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,550
how is the prosecutor who brought that on not guilty?

593
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,050
Oh, yeah. "If all those cases are guilty,

594
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,430
then it diminishes the investigating agency's power too much."

595
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,540
"Then when they can't prove a suspect guilty 100 percent,

596
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,750
the arrest and punishment of a criminal will become difficult,

597
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:15,170
which will bring about larger social unrest and chaos in the long term."

598
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,720
He's right.

599
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,090
Even so, he should've at least been fined.

600
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,670
Yes, that is it!

601
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,480
Beautiful.

602
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,850
It's possible for criminal trial prosecutors and defense attorneys to be on the same side like this.

603
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,160
   
 There is a meeting at Professor's building in one hour. 

604
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,180
- The Professor's building? 
 - All of a sudden?

605
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,350
What can it be?

606
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,540
Excuse me.

607
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,550
Shouldn't we have brought something?

608
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,320
Yeah. We came empty-handed.

609
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,210
Is that right? Well, she's rich.

610
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,250
What a nice house.

611
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,310
This is Chan's handwriting.

612
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,160
You wrote it, right?

613
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,060
Yeah.

614
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,210
This looks like the Professor's handwriting.

615
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,730
She added to Chan's thoughts.

616
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,050
What is this, Chan?

617
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,180
- I have a favor to ask. 
 - What is it?

618
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,740
This is a formal request to the Legal Clinic Center.

619
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,200
I want to catch Na Jeong's murderer.

620
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,790
Let's catch him.

621
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,800
Let's do it.

622
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,290
- Sure. 
 - Call (deal).

623
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,630
You're all here.

624
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,740
You've arrived.

625
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,740
 What did they offer Han Gi Taek? 

626
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,980
 Finding truth and catching the culprit is important, 

627
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,030
 but make sure to practice caution after caution. 

628
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,660
 In all situations, never get hurt. 

629
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,510
When is the acquisition going to be completed?

630
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,800
The final agreement will be written this week.

631
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,030
How is Su Jae doing?

632
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,390
Well, nothing much going on with her.

633
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,120
Is there an issue with Su Jae?

634
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,300
What about Seung Yeon?

635
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,750
She went to the in-laws in Ulsan with Jae Yi.

636
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,850
She'll be back in a few days.

637
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,020
"In-law?"

638
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,840
Oh, not anymore.

639
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,820
She said it's her last wish before going to the U.S.

640
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,570
I should do that much for her, at least.

641
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,550
Check on her regularly so nothing happens.

642
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,190
Yes.

643
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,580
Well, Father.

644
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,340
Chairman Han's Samjoong-dong house.

645
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,580
Do you know who bought it, by chance?

646
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,280
Dong Oh said some American corporation bought it.

647
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,800
Why do you care?

648
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,220
Are you bothered by it, Father?

649
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,080
- That house? 
 - Why should I be?

650
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,840
Why should you?

651
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,920
Chairman!

652
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,200
You must see this.

653
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,320
 The Yeongpyeong District remains' identity 
    

654
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,610
 has been found to be the victim of the Ungju Half-sibling Murder 

655
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,760
 ten years ago, Ms. Jeon. 
    

656
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,080
 Although the stepbrother Kim was arrested as the suspect at the time, 

657
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,480
 it broke our hearts that her body was never found. 

658
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,470
 However, while Kim was serving prison time, 

659
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:36,780
 it was also found that No, who was arrested for a different case, was the real culprit 

660
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,450
 shocking the nation again. 
    

661
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,830
 TK Law Firm 

662
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,510
Father.

663
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,680
Wasn't it taken care of by you, Chief Ha?

664
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,890
I'm sorry.

665
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,530
You knew all along.

666
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,610
You recognized the remains right away, right?

667
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,010
Since you did the job yourself.

668
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,380
 So, that was why you did that to Father. 

669
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,320
You couldn't handle that one job.

670
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,500
Just one job!

671
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,680
Hey, you!

672
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,960
 The Yeongpyeong District remains that were found on the construction site 

673
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,350
 were found with a gunny sack and 

674
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,030
 the police were identifying the remains right away in case 

675
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,070
 it was connected to a violent incident. 

676
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,390
  In the midst of all this, the real culprit, No 
    

677
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,840
 took his own life before parole. 

678
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,760
 Some suspicions arose about the background motives of his suicide. 

679
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,700
 Would it mean that his death is related to the excavation of the remains? 

680
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,220
 That is correct. 

681
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,400
 If you look at No's time of death, 

682
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
  it is right after the remains were found.   

683
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,200
 It is assumed that he had a change of heart after hearing 
    

684
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,040
 that the remains were found and took his own life. 

685
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,400
Heol, Daebak. S University? He must've done really well in his studies.

686
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,720
I feel like people will find out fast that Gong Chan is Kim Dong Gu.

687
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,580
- That's why we're doing this. 
 - What?

688
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,080
Shouldn't we be hiding this instead of exposing it?

689
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,710
That's how he will be safe.

690
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:43,230
 Han Seong Beom | Choi Tae Kook 

691
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,760
The one who moves all the pieces.

692
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,390
That person will now focus on Gong Chan.

693
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,170
If they announce that the remains are indeed Jeon Na Jeong,

694
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,170
then let it be known that Gong Chan is Kim Dong Gu.

695
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,480
So that people can connect the dots on their own.

696
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,590
If everyone knows, they can't mess with Chan that easily

697
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,430
since all eyes are on him.

698
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:11,390
 Jeon's Mother Voluntarily Requests DNA Cross-Examination 

699
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,510
 Doesn't it mean something since the real culprit died all of a sudden? 

700
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,310
 What about the chances that the real culprit is not real? 

701
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,570
 If it isn't Kim Dong Gu or No Byeong Chool, then who is it? 

702
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,810
 Somebody might be getting nervous watching the news right now. 

703
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:26,820
 Go to hell. 

704
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,110
 If you had your normal ten years, then it's time for you to go to hell. 

705
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,470
 Didn't No Byeong Chool go to hell? 

706
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,860
 Maybe not. 

707
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,510
 Things beyond imagination happen in the world. 

708
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,460
 Whoa. 

709
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:42,320
 Then someone framed Kim Dong Gu, No Byung Chool, and made him kill himself? 

710
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,200
Hello.

711
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,210
Mother, this way.

712
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,860
This way. This way.

713
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,270
My daughter...

714
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,890
Thank you...

715
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,430
My daughter...

716
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,520
Thank you for coming back to me...

717
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,090
I'm...

718
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:12,220
so, so thankful to you.

719
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,530
 Yeongpyeong District Remains Identified 

720
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,840
What does it matter whether it's Jeon Na Jeong or not?

721
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,800
No Byeong Chool is dead anyway.

722
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,530
Isn't that right, Chief Kang?

723
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,130
It looks like her mother came in without my knowledge.

724
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:09,470
I should've been the one to see to it. I'm sorry, Chairman.

725
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:10,930
You got the wrong person.

726
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:15,230
Instead of calling me, you should let the press know.

727
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,580
 Pardon? 

728
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,290
"No Byeong Chool killed himself because the remains were found.

729
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:24,480
He saw the remains, remembered his crimes,

730
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,850
and killed himself because of a guilty conscience."

731
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,000
Shouldn't you point that out for them?

732
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,860
Yes, yes, Chairman. I haven't thought that far.

733
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,890
I'll be sure to come up with something, Chairman.

734
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,860
What a useless piece

735
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,430
What about Su Jae?

736
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,670
I'm sorry.

737
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:49,290
She is not able to be in contact for some reason.

738
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:56,230
 Hansu Construction, Yeongpyeong District Development under Fire for Corruption 

739
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:01,510
 Suspicions of Hansu Construction receiving benefits for the Yeongpyeong District development 

740
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,400
 have been made. Although LH has been promoting 

741
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,550
 public housing since 2007 in Yeongpyeong District,  

742
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:08,940
 Assemblyman Lee In Su at the time 

743
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,880
 constantly worked to dismiss the said business.
    

744
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,280
 He even influenced the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MLIT) to allow 

745
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,790
 the construction despite the problems. 

746
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:18,630
 You can't even stop a news report? 

747
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:21,220
 Just quit, all of you! You parasites. 

748
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,330
 Just quit and get out of my fac— 

749
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,580
Oh, my. Chairman!

750
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,650
 What is this? What just busted? 

751
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,910
Assemblyman Lee! Assemblyman Lee!

752
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,050
 Hansu Conference Room 1  
 Come on.

753
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,140
Director, you should've stopped the young reporters from messing around.

754
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,680
What benefits at Yeongpyeong District are yo—

755
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,250
Hello? H-Hello?

756
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,870
Darn it!

757
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:13,480
It contains parts of the documents on the suspicions of benefits received in the Yeongpyeong District.

758
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,840
Why give this to me?

759
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,790
I'm sure you don't quite like me.

760
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,240
Because a person who would attack me that much

761
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,070
would also see anything to the end.

762
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,400
Just as I guessed,

763
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,240
it was you who reported the Yeongpyeong District privilege suspicions.

764
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,800
I do have all the confidential documents regarding the matter.

765
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,460
They will figure out your movements for sure.

766
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,760
I'm throwing it out there first.

767
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,400
Who were the suspects in the case ten years ago?

768
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,350
Also, the fact that there was another victim in that incident besides Jeon Na Jeong.

769
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,060
We don't even have sure proof.

770
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:58,350
Acting rashly like that can get you hurt.

771
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,450
How long will you continue in your cowardice?

772
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:08,620
Chairman Choi Tae Kook already figured out that Gong Chan is Kim Dong Gu.

773
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:12,000
That means Gong Chan could be in danger.

774
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,200
I can't let Gong Chan be in danger again.

775
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,630
How did it go?

776
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:33,340
The funeral is over and I took Ji Soon Ok home.

777
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:38,050
And Chan is probably at the memorial park.

778
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:43,220
He kept standing out of sight.

779
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:52,720
 Jeon Na Jeong 

780
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,060
Na Jeong,

781
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,220
what took you so long?

782
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,030
 Geez, Jeon Na Jeong, you just let me catch you! 

783
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,150
 I'll tell ajumma about you working part-time. 

784
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,870
Is it because I said,

785
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,660
"just see what happens when I catch you"?

786
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,390
Is that it?

787
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,200
I'm sorry.

788
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,840
I should've been there sooner.

789
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,030
I'm sorry.

790
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:49,160
 Jeon Na Jeong 

791
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,640
 Is it you, Dong Gu? 

792
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:07,230
"Who keeps leaving food here from time to time?"

793
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,260
"Could it be Dong Gu's father?"

794
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,180
"He was still an affectionate person."

795
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,000
That's what I thought.

796
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,880
At some point, there was milk, too.

797
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,840
Because you always packed me milk.

798
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,510
I heard from Attorney Song that you stayed with me

799
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:34,510
throughout the whole funeral for Na Jeong.

800
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,640
Thank you.

801
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:44,970
Ajumma.

802
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,900
I'll catch the culprit for sure.

803
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,600
So health— don't let your health slip.

804
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,940
Dong Gu.

805
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,880
I know you didn't do it.

806
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,000
I really believed it was you at first.

807
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,330
I was able to go on if I could curse you out.

808
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,190
When I found out the truth later,

809
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,050
I...

810
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,490
I hated you because I hated myself.

811
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:30,140
Dong Gu.

812
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,070
I'm sorry.

813
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,860
I am so sorry.

814
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,660
Wait a little longer, Ajumma.

815
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,510
I...

816
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:55,410
Since Na Jeong is home now,

817
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,820
you should stop coming here.

818
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,520
 TK Law Firm 

819
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:58,980
 Han Seong Beom, Lee In Su 

820
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,200
Come in.

821
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,220
I have something to tell you.

822
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,660
Go ahead.

823
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:25,460
There must be a reason when you couldn't be reached all day.

824
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,070
Ten years ago, on September 4th, 2012.

825
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,720
The day when Jeon Na Jeong, whose remains were

826
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,470
found in Yeongpyeong District, died.

827
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,340
On that day,

828
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,770
a woman in her twenties was hospitalized in the middle of the night after a car hit her.

829
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,780
Before she was hit,

830
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,100
she was kidnapped by three men from a club in Seoul.

831
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,720
 They surely must have drugged her 

832
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:08,490
since the sight of her powerless body being dragged was recorded on the footage.

833
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,380
What are you talking about?

834
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:30,310
The men took her to the outskirts of Seoul and raped her.

835
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:34,330
The woman came to and ran for dear life

836
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:38,010
 and bumped into the part-timer, Jeon Na Jeong. 

837
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:42,440
 While Jeon Na Jeong was trying to help her, the men followed in pursuit. 

838
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:48,450
 The woman got hit by a car while trying to run away again and was taken to the hospital. 

839
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,210
The men, afraid of their crimes being exposed,

840
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:56,340
 took the witness, Jeon Na Jeong 

841
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,320
and killed her.

842
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,580
 Chairman Choi does not know about Eun Seo. 

843
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:10,000
 Those bastards did not tell him about her. 

844
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,600
The three suspects who put a woman in her twenties

845
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,590
in that state and killed Jeon Na Jeong.

846
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,650
Han Dong Oh,

847
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,440
Lee Shi Hyeok,

848
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,620
and Choi Ju Wan.

849
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,740
What do you think, Chairman?

850
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,810
What is this dogshit you're talking about?

851
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:38,430
The part-timer Jeon Na Jeong's stepbrother Kim Dong Gu.

852
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,600
You must've already figured out that Kim Dong Gu is Gong Chan.

853
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,700
What is it that you want to say?

854
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,530
What is this grand exposition for?

855
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,760
That moment when I made the wrong decision

856
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,840
for the excuse of saving my mother and brothers.

857
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,890
I've been looking away in fear of regret for that moment.

858
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,840
Now, I intend to try and regret it properly.

859
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:15,040
When the innocent Kim Dong Gu was framed because of my foolish decision,

860
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:20,010
the three suspects had been living life to the fullest.

861
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,260
One as a presidential candidate's son,

862
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,070
one as the heir to Hansu Group,

863
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:27,090
and the other...

864
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,040
as the heir to TK Law Firm.

865
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:53,610
I don't know where you heard this crap, Su Jae,

866
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:56,970
but let's just say you are spewing the truth.

867
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:00,020
You still can't catch them.

868
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,060
Especially not Ju Wan.

869
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,920
You can never catch him, Su Jae.

870
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,990
Jae Yi...

871
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,670
is your daughter, Su Jae.

872
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:43,530
 Why Her? 

873
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:52,480


874
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,390
 Let's talk about Jae Yi later. 

875
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:05,770
 Shut up. 

876
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:08,180
 Did you miss me? 

877
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,170
 How did I not recognize you? 

878
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,080
 How can a person do that? 

879
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,600
 Father did it all! Father! 

880
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,460
 Stop acting like you're different, asshole. 

881
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,730
 You and I, we both are Father's pawns. 

882
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:22,100
 Stop trying to spin it and spill the truth. 

883
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,720
 I don't know. I don't know! 

884
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,870
 If I'm ruined, the party is ruined! 

885
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,980
 You crazy bastard! Who else was there? 

886
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,330
 Can Attorney Oh win against Chairman Choi? 

887
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:34,750
 You're asking for too much for the kid. 

888
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,950
 I'm going to raise Jae Yi well as my child. 

889
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:40,280
 I'll give you the 70 billion won you want. Isn't that enough for the trade? 

890
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,870
 Yes. Hand it over. 

891
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:44,720
 Give me 70 billion won and sign the papers. Hand everything over. 

892
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,990
 You think I don't have the proof? 

893
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:47,960
 You! 

894
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,070
 I'll give you two hours to sign. 

895
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:52,200
 This is not a suggestion. It's an order .

896
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,870
 Since I made the move, Chairman Choi will also make his move. 

897
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,420
 Tell everyone to be careful. 

898
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,040
 Jae Yi disappeared! 

899
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,120
 Tell me the address. 

900
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,480
 Where are you right now? 

901
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,640
 What do we do?
