1
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,540
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:38,470


3
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,900
The bakery is... I have to buy a chocolate cake.

4
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,610
What cake? Don't do that.

5
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,820
No, it's...

6
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,950
I hate stuff like that. Don't you dare.

7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,260
Go ahead and try.

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,260
I'm not going!

9
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,000
Hyeong Hyeong Chil likes chocolate cakes.

10
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,810
If he doesn't get to eat chocolate cake on his birthday,

11
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,500
he could leave the house.

12
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,170
I'll get it!

13
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,010
Wait for me! I'll buy it.

14
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,610
 Episode 9 

15
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,390
Come in.

16
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,700
 Professor, don't worry about anything and stay here. 

17
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,450
 We'll take good care of you. 

18
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,920
 After the sunset, 

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,860
 I'll tie Chan up tightly on the third floor. 

20
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,130
 Loyalty! 

21
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,820
 Don't expect the rent to be free. 

22
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,920
 I'll take payment on food, too. 

23
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,870
Yeah.

24
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,280
Don't think about anything, and just stay there.

25
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,740
Did you install a CCTV on the back of my head?

26
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,870
Gong Chan came by to ask me about it.

27
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,810
He said he wants you to stay there.

28
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,750
Nonsense.

29
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,030
I'll just stay at your place for a while.

30
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,680
No. I lost.

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,740
Not my house.

32
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,590
Wait, Joon Hui—

33
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,170
Did you meet Joon Hui?

34
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,450
Yes.

35
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,990
Whoa! Attorney Oh, I'm here.

36
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,570
All right.

37
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,520
Song Mi Rim?

38
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,490
That's mine.

39
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,810
You're right.

40
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,110
I brought them from your house.

41
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,470
I put in everything you'll need.

42
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,650
Why?

43
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,960
Oh, as expected, you followed my recommendations to the fullest.

44
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,140
I told them you'll need a study space, no matter what.

45
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,540
I asked them to get the highest quality desk and chair.

46
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,080
Especially... the sofa.

47
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,310
I told them to get a nice big one.

48
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,160
Why? Because Attorney Oh loves to sleep on the sofa.

49
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,840
Oh, my. It's great. So high quality!

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,410
This is so nice!

51
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,270
Song Mi Rim!

52
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,720
Let's remodel my building.

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,860
Remodel?

54
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,500
You're going to remodel? Why? How?

55
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
So, I could live there.

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,880
Turn the second and third place into a living space for me.

57
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Professor, well...

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,210
Remodeling does take time...

59
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,690
- Right? 
 - Yeah, well...

60
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,830
To fix up both the second and third place, it would take about two weeks?

61
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,990
No, no.

62
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,010
Perhaps a month?

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,160
That's right.

64
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,130
Would it be okay if I stayed here until then?

65
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,230
Yes.

66
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,090
Then should we go have the birthday party?

67
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,570
My birthday? My birthday.

68
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,490
Oh my, really.

69
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,720
All right, all right.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,940
Please.

71
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,780
You see "On" here? Press it hard.

72
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,610
- M-Me? 
 - Yes.

73
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,290
Wait, wait, wait.

74
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,840
One, two, three.

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,520
Happy Birthday

76
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,470
Whoa! Who did all this?

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,220
- I did. 
 - What?

78
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,360
I did!

79
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,840
Hyeong Chil always wanted to do this.

80
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,210
Hyeong!

81
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,390
♫  What about us  ♫

82
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,500
♫  We could have all  ♫

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,290
♫  We could have all the things we liked  ♫

84
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,520
♫  Forget about that  ♫

85
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,400
♫  When I lose control, I want to see you again  ♫

86
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,210
♫  What about us  ♫

87
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,860
♫  What about us today  ♫

88
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,980
 - All right. Have a drink. 
 - Ah, yes! 

89
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,290
Geez, Joseon was always giving me a headache.

90
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,900
Chairperson Son stepped forward

91
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,080
and took care of all the rotten fruit with the support of the FSC (Financial Services Commission).

92
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,580
He says he'll help us all the way with the Hansu Bio acquisition subsidy.

93
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,000
I think I'll still digest even if I eat rocks.

94
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,070
- Okay, Chairperson Son. 
 - Yes?

95
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,380
- Take a cup from me. 
 - Oh, Seonbaenim!

96
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,830
I'll never forget what you did. It's a great honor for me and my family.

97
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,230
Thanks.

98
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,270
Chairman Choi, how did you discipline your hoobaes in high school

99
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,700
that the FSC chairperson is kneeling in front of you?

100
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,250
Did he beat you up with a bat?

101
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,450
Oh, no!

102
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,000
Seonbaenim Choi Tae Gook was like a god by his mere existence.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,100
Being at the top of the entire school was given.

104
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,010
He ranked number one in the entire country as if it was nothing.

105
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,680
He entered Seojung University Law School as the number one student.

106
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,180
He passed the bar as the top student.

107
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,550
A rare person to come out once in a century. He's a god!

108
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,140
Back in my college days, there were two types of people.

109
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,320
- Either activists trying to change the nation or those wanting to get wasted and chase after women. 
 - Right.

110
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,610
But our seonbaenim was always consistent and was in the library.

111
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,030
I'd see him like that yesterday but then see him again just like that today.

112
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,050
Then, in the end, he passed the bar with the highest score at a young age.

113
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,670
Respect to you always, Seonbaenim.

114
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,330
Geez, there's no charm in it. You were a model student.

115
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,650
- The drinks are on you, Chairman Choi. 
 - Yes, sir.

116
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,420
Come in.

117
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,400
Hello, I'm Han Dong Woo.

118
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,080
Gosh, here comes our Managing Director Han.

119
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,770
Come here and pour a glass for everyone.

120
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,500
I'll pour you a glass.

121
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,200
So, you're taking over the Hansu Bio acquisition in place of Chief Han Gi Taek?

122
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,060
Yes, Chairperson. I thank you in advance.

123
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,560
I'll do my best, Deputy Prime Minister.

124
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,790
Here, take a glass.

125
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,600
Look how handsome you are.

126
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,210
That Deputy Prime Minister...

127
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,220
How dare he tap my precious son's shoulder like that. What the hell?

128
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,040
That bastard.

129
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,510
You're late, Your Majesty.

130
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,760
Did you run late because you were looking after the people?

131
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,940
My campaign meeting ran late.

132
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,130
Looks like you've had enough to drink, Chairman.

133
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,350
Yes, you know...

134
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,280
What did Deputy Prime Minister say?

135
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,330
Did Chairperson Son say he'll help?

136
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,340
Yes.

137
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,400
You're worrying too much, Your Majesty.

138
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,450
Your Majesty, you should just focus on raising your approval rating.

139
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,170
Speaking of...

140
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,030
I'm so frustrated because my approval rating is stuck in the box!

141
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,090
When is the Hansu Bio acquisition going to finalize?

142
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,900
Must I worry about that, too?

143
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,540
Why the hell are you worrying about that unnecessarily!

144
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,500
Did I ever make you worry about money, Assemblyman Lee?

145
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,850
I even summoned my son

146
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,800
and had him pour drinks to those dirtbags, humor them, and pass cute farts for them.

147
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,070
What are you complaining about?

148
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,580
Right...

149
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,310
I spoke nonsense, Your Majesty.

150
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,310
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,120
This is all Gi Taek, that motherfucker's fault.

152
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,850
Shouldn't the two of you help me out in every way possible?

153
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,080
I have to get elected, so you, Chairman Choi, could become the Minister of Justice, too.

154
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,530
I never wanted that position.

155
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,990
Your approval rating is at a standstill right now, but you're currently number one.

156
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,370
Do you think it's all due to your abilities alone?

157
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,360
The continuous policy failures of the ruling party,

158
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,470
the internal dissension within the incompetent opposition party.

159
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,980
On top of that, An Gang Hoon, who came up most threateningly had dropped out.

160
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,580
Before we got rid of An Gang Hoon,

161
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,440
your approval was a humiliating 9%.

162
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,500
Did you forget that?

163
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,180
That An Gang Hoon.

164
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,420
Who got rid of him for you?

165
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,740
Hong Seok Pal, who caused a huge commotion using that as an excuse...

166
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,890
Who got rid of him for you?

167
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,970
We should tell the dishwasher to do the dishes.

168
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,280
I did what you asked for, Assemblyman Lee.

169
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,430
Dirty dishes for the dishwasher.

170
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,500
That's not it, Chairman Choi.

171
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,240
There was more to that.

172
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,920
After she does the dishes,

173
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,340
why don't you get rid of the dishwasher, too?

174
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,490
I asked you to get rid of Oh Su Jae,

175
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,580
but you got rid of Han Gi Taek instead.

176
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,550
Why did you do that?

177
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,710
What are you trying to do here?

178
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,540
The videos that Hong Seok Pal put together.

179
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,780
I'm telling you that they're safely in my possession.

180
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,940
You're holding onto an object you should dispose of?

181
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,150
Tell me what you want, Chairman Choi.

182
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,640
What is it?

183
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,140
Are you saying you're not satisfied with a minister position?

184
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,720
Yeah.

185
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,340
The prime minister of a parliamentary (system).

186
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,630
Push ahead with the constitutional amendment as soon as you get elected.

187
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,480
You'll declare the parliamentary transition.

188
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,290
Eighty percent of the Korean people want a constitutional amendment.

189
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,420
More than 70% agree that the presidential system needs to change.

190
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,910
If you declare an administration that propels toward a parliamentary system,

191
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,190
your approval rating that is stuck in a box will go straight up.

192
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,000
If an ambition crosses the boundary,

193
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,090
you could lose something that's obtainable.

194
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,420
Don't you think your dream is way over the top?

195
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,090
You were unknown ten years ago, and take a look at yourself now.

196
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,060
I've begun to have this dream thanks to you, Assemblyman.

197
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,970
There is no such thing as an over-the-top dream in this world.

198
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,700
 Choon Poong: Professor, congratulations! 

199
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,590
 Choon Poong: I knew you'd be released. 

200
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,560
 Kang Ja Noona: You've been through so much. Take care of yourself. 

201
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,180
 Se Ryeon: I think I'm going to cry! 

202
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,620
 Se Ryeon: Hurry back and shut down the kids who put you down, 

203
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,930
 Se Ryeon: alumni and professors associations. All of them. 

204
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,440
But Noona hasn't seen these.

205
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,800
I wonder if she's sick.

206
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,100
 Gong Chan 

207
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,040
 Hyeong, Professor Oh will stay on the second floor of our building for now 

208
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,340
 because her place isn't safe. 

209
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,700
 You're doing okay, right? 

210
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,720
Even asking me how I'm doing?

211
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,340
That upsets me even more.

212
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,440
It used to be my dad's company building.

213
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,910
To a seven-year-old kid,

214
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,280
my dad, who built that building was the coolest of them all.

215
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,510
It became someone else's when I was eighteen.

216
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,040
My dad was kind and had thin ears (gullible).

217
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,350
He went bankrupt all of a sudden.

218
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,720
He cried every night on the rooftop over there.

219
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,200
 I hated it because it was so sad, 

220
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,520
 and I hated him because he looked so weak. 

221
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,100
 I think that's when I made up my mind. 

222
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,230
That I'll never lose.

223
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,750
I'll win it all.

224
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,440
When did you get it back?

225
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,220
Three years ago.

226
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,500
They said they'll never sell, so I paid double.

227
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,870
But it didn't feel like a waste at all.

228
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,480
 The day I put my name on it, 

229
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,230
 I sat where my dad used to sit 

230
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,030
 and bragged to him. 

231
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,990
 Look, Dad. 

232
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,680
 I told you I'd get it back. 

233
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,260
 I told you I'd beat them. 

234
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,260
 How cool. 

235
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,060
How could you be so cool?

236
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,580
For corporations having temporary financial difficulties,
    

237
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,970
the financial authorities decided to subsidize 2 trillion won.
     

238
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,460
 At the policy meeting for emergency funds today, 

239
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,800
an enterprise asset acquisition support program was revealed.
     

240
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,780
They will provide the funding necessary by taking over the
     

241
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,460
 real estate properties or vessels that the corporations own— 

242
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,790
I guess Hansu Joseon, those rotted vessels, will bring in some money.

243
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,500
As for the funeral, we cremated him.

244
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,310
Saying they're burning someone already burnt, his mother was—

245
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,630
Chief Ha, how old do you turn this year?

246
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,160
I'm ten years younger than you, Chairman.

247
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,190
Are you going through andropause?

248
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,300
Why are you talking to yourself so much?

249
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,720
Has your son been in the hospital for ten years already?

250
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,460
Yes. If it weren't for you, Chairman,

251
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,000
he'd have gone into the netherworld a long time ago.

252
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,620
My apologies.

253
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,000
I became chatty to no good use.

254
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,770
 What? 

255
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,820
Professor is staying at your place?

256
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,640
Really?

257
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,720
Yeah. Until the remodel of her building is finished.

258
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,650
But why is it your place out of the blue?

259
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,220
She's got a friend's place, her mom's house, and there's a hotel, too.

260
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,090
Why? Why? Why?

261
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,040
What do you mean? I totally get it. Got it.

262
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,630
Me, too. I'd go there myself if I were her.

263
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,950
Wh-What's with this very cool (aloof) reaction?

264
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,520
Are you guys making me out to be the weird one?

265
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,950
Wait. I'm confused all of a sudden.

266
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,220
Am I the country bumpkin?

267
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,560
- What is it? 
 - I'll buy food for the country bumpkin.

268
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,300
- Let's go. 
 - Wait a minute.

269
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,340
I'm not  that  country.

270
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,760
- Bye. 
 - See you.

271
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,860
Bye.

272
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,910
 Our terrace is open until 10 pm tonight 

273
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,210
It's Chan again, huh?

274
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,700
Tell him he could die if he sends another Katalk message.

275
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,000
He thinks he's the only one who cares about her.

276
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,960
We're, you know...

277
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,430
doing this so that Professor can get some good sleep.

278
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,000
My hyeongs are so cute.

279
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,590
 Due to personal reasons, I'll no longer be a member of Legal Clinic Center. 

280
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,160
 I'll always cheer you on. 

281
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,630
Did you see it? Did you?

282
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Is it because we listed Chairman Choi Tae Gook as one of the suspects?

283
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,060
On top of that, we were suspicious of Seonbae's hyeong, too.

284
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,950
I thought it was all over now,

285
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,240
but there's the after storm.

286
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,370
How is Noona doing?

287
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,470
She's fine.

288
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,890
You told Noona everything, right?

289
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,060
Yes.

290
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,670
You looked through Chief Ha's desk with Yoon Sang?

291
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,300
And then Hyeong called Chief Ha,

292
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,140
telling him to tell his father.

293
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,340
My father will make his move soon.

294
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,590
Then you don't have to release this right away.

295
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,300
Give it to Noona when she comes out.

296
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,360
Did you give Noona what we brought out last time?

297
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,260
I'm back at my father's house.

298
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,570
I left that house determined not to ever go back there.

299
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,020
But my father truly caught a big weakness of mine.

300
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,420
I just kneeled to him and went in.

301
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,350
Since I kneeled and went in already, I'm thinking I'll just inherit the firm.

302
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,040
I'm going to be an intern at TK

303
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,820
working under Noona.

304
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,190
I'll go now.

305
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,010
Heong.

306
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,400
Come by my place to eat.

307
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,550
You can do that much.

308
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,020
I don't want to.

309
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,190
Why?

310
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,750
I don't want to see... Noona staying there.

311
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,330
I won't go.

312
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,040
I've never seen Attorney Oh sleep as deeply as this before.

313
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,920
Let's go down now.

314
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,390
 25 Unread messages 

315
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,870
 Chairman Han Seong Beom: Attorney Oh, I'll give you the Chief of Legal Affairs position 

316
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,400
 Chairman Han Seong Beom: that Han Gi Taek left vacant. Come and work under me. 

317
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,470
 Assemblyman Lee In Su: This is Lee In Su. 

318
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,720
 Assemblyman Lee In Su: I'd like you to be the spokesperson for our camp. 

319
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,930
 Assemblyman Lee In Su: Call me. 

320
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,630
Those who are destined to meet will meet. Just like us tonight.

321
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,120
Are you alive?

322
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,620
I thought I was going to die from the heat.

323
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,920
It's too late to eat a meal, though.

324
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,080
Right. It's too late, huh?

325
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,630
But Dr. Chae Joon Hui said to feed you and make you sleep.

326
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,450
I had no idea Joon Hui and Mi Rim had come by.

327
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,830
I picked this up on my way over.

328
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,300
Hey, be sure to feed her nice and good. Pak pak.

329
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,220
I caught it on my way over.

330
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,990
The sunset was a long time ago.

331
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,700
How nice...

332
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,990
This place, the rooftop here.

333
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,140
The stew you made for me.

334
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,550
Hyeongs who put this and that into the stew.

335
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,850
And the second floor you prepared for me with those hyeongs.

336
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,820
If I stay here,

337
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,990
I'll forget about bad people and bad things that happened somewhat.

338
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,500
Staying here is totally out of question, but

339
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,690
I'm here because I like it here.

340
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,070
I like it here a lot.

341
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,220
Shall we eat this?

342
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,370
Ajumma!

343
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,120
A present for you.

344
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,060
Mom!

345
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,080
 Divorce Settlement 

346
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,360
I had requested the maximum amount of alimony

347
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,720
and Choi Ju Wan's official apology.

348
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,230
I had told you that I would focus on your alimony.

349
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,760
If I focus only on alimony, will I be able to get the amount I want?

350
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,750
It would be possible if you hand over your weapon.

351
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,340
Do I have a weapon?

352
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:24,120
When you lived in the United States, you consulted a divorce lawyer.

353
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,360
Not once, but several times.

354
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,350
Alcohol, women...

355
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,470
CEO Choi Ju Wan was addicted to drugs at one point.

356
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:38,410
CEO Choi's flaws probably became your weapon, Ms. Im Seung Yeon.

357
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,480
Had you wanted,

358
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,260
you probably would have plans to obtain everything that was saved on CEO Choi's computer.

359
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,760
Life is quite interesting, isn't it?

360
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,950
Unbearably painful times become my weapon.

361
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,180
I'm worried...

362
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,820
about how I should tell her that Mom and Dad are getting divorced.

363
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,900
Would you do it for me?

364
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,440
Mom! Mom, come here!

365
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,530
Come here and take pictures together.

366
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,910
One, two, three.

367
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,450
She wants that much?

368
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,300
Yeah.

369
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,600
Im Seung Yeon is gutsy.

370
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,700
I thought she was just quiet. She's got quite a punch.

371
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,460
 Divorce Settlement 

372
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,070
 Reason for Request 

373
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,030
Come in.

374
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,910
Father.

375
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,720
Seung Yeon is hoping for quite a lot.

376
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,280
That woman is gutsier than I thought.

377
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,310
Makes me wonder if Su Jae is trying to screw me over

378
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,520
in the middle and playing games.

379
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,980
Oh, that's not all.

380
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm sure she's mad at you too, Father

381
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,320
She was locked up in a detention center,

382
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,160
but instead of helping her, you tried to ditch her.

383
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,370
Get out if you're drunk.

384
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,130
Let's talk tomorrow, clear-headed.

385
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,870
Oh, Father...

386
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,450
I'm curious, Father.

387
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,550
About Hong Seok Pal.

388
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,040
 Even if everyone in the world died, 

389
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,620
he would cling on and survive.

390
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,560
He'd grab onto his money. He'd never die, that punk.

391
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:55,050
But he committed suicide and Su Jae was there.

392
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,170
And Han Gi Taek helped him do that.

393
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,080
Su Jae was locked up for inciting murder, yet she returned unscathed.

394
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,990
This feels just like this.

395
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,770
You know what a marionette puppet is, right?

396
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,940
The hands...

397
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,630
I'm so curious to know whose hands are controlling the puppet.

398
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,440
But I think you know, Father.

399
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,040
You're asking me what you should ask the dead guy.

400
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,560
Right?

401
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,060
They're Hong Seok Pal's hands, right?

402
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,930
That's it, right, Father?

403
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:37,190
As expected, there's nothing you don't know, Father.

404
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,860
I respect you.

405
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,620
You...

406
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,010
Do you have anything Seung Yeon is holding against you?

407
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,690
The fact that Seung Yeon is wanting this much means she's got something.

408
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,560
And it has gone to Su Jae's hands.

409
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,310
What is that?

410
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,390
Is it woman problems?

411
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,890
You want to grab a drink?

412
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,660
Let's grab a drink to celebrate that you and I have a commonality.

413
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,700
I think this is the first time this has happened.

414
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,700
Makes me think we're brothers after all, Hyeong.

415
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,880
What are you talking about?

416
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,300
You and I are curious about the same thing.

417
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,740
 Today we are thankful, too. See you tomorrow. 

418
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,000
Coming home now?

419
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,110
- Did you eat? 
 - Hello. I haven't eaten yet.

420
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,970
Oh, my. Let me prepare something for you quickly.

421
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,900
No! I'm okay!

422
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,680
What's this?

423
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,480
Is she a regular at this pub?

424
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,950
What's with her now?

425
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,690
Wow, Professor, you're no joke.

426
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,470
Your hand movements are no joke.

427
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,180
Wow.

428
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,960
What are you doing?

429
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,320
Professor, were you a thug?

430
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,900
Just know that I used to be a real thug.

431
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,430
What? What? Wait!

432
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,940
No! No, no, no!

433
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,230
You're dead. How dare you do that to Professor...

434
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,240
Geez, what the heck?

435
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,990
You crazy punk! Seriously!

436
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,090
You want to die?

437
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,280
It's your fault! I just...

438
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,890
Hey.

439
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,320
What are you doing to Professor Oh right now?

440
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,250
I told you that you have a restraining order after sunset!

441
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,130
This isn't going to work. We can't let this go.

442
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,600
I was playing this game...

443
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,160
Come here. I'll teach you a lesson.

444
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,350
Teach him right.

445
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,960
 - Game? What the? 
 - Come on! 

446
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,650
 What did I do? 

447
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,110
 TK Law Firm 

448
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,660
What?

449
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,950
You're at it again?

450
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,930
That's an illness. An illness.

451
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,850
 This one's for real. 

452
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,800
She went late at night into a pub that a student runs.

453
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,270
I noticed this morning on my way in that her car was still parked there.

454
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,660
She must've drunk, got drunk, and taken a taxi home.

455
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,340
Even though I saw her come out of there this morning?

456
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,490
 If others saw her, they'd think she's renting out the second floor. 

457
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,660
Really?

458
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,790
I'm going to throw it out there at the professor's meeting later.

459
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,730
Let me see if I can put her on the spot.

460
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,670
You're right. I live there.

461
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,930
You all know already.

462
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,360
They searched and seized everything at my home and office.

463
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,920
I don't want to live in a house that people combed through.

464
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,420
The company gave that place to me, so I had no regrets about leaving.

465
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,300
Even so, you live in a student's place?

466
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,050
A male student at that?

467
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,480
Hey, this is the picture.

468
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,480
You're a female professor, and he's a male student.

469
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,250
It's weird. Am I the only one who thinks so?

470
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,140
Well, if weird rumors spread...

471
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,070
It's a good subject matter for people to gossip about.

472
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,820
Well, the students could start talking as well.

473
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,050
The kids these days are so noisy.

474
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,290
I own a building in the vicinity, but it's being remodeled.

475
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,740
It's close to school, and it's convenient for me to monitor the remodeling every now and then.

476
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,820
They were about to rent the space out, so I decided to stay there.

477
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,100
What's so weird about it?

478
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,320
I don't know what you're thinking...

479
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,670
Are you going through puberty?

480
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,140
Puberty?

481
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,640
The rent. How much do you pay for rent?

482
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,140
Did you ask for cheap rent since you're his professor?

483
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,860
Do I have to show you my rental contract or something?

484
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,860
Gosh, not necessary...

485
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,420
But we have to clarify issues surrounding Legal Clinic.

486
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,970
You realize that's the main topic of discussion today, right?

487
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,790
When you got arrested without a warrant and were sent to the detention center,

488
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,720
the school flipped out, the law school association flipped out,

489
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,410
even the alumni association flipped out.

490
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,500
"How could a criminal be the center director?

491
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,750
Who'd come and visit a legal clinic like that?

492
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,910
No one will come! Not even an ant!"

493
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,010
Did you hire part-timers to show up here?

494
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,800
What did you do?

495
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,460
I didn't do it, but we all pulled together.

496
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,630
 Since Professor Oh is locked up, shouldn't they shut down Legal Clinic, too? 

497
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,770
 Professor Jeong Hui Yeong mentioned that as well. 

498
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,500
 That they should shut down Legal Clinic, too. 

499
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,630
 I don't think the Professor Oh matter should be left alone. 

500
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,100
 The entire alumni association is noisy about it, 

501
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,180
 saying we should kick Professor Oh out and shut down the legal clinic. 

502
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,150
So, I called all the police stations that I consult

503
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:54,300
and told them to send us people who need urgent consultations.

504
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,670
And I had no idea this would be so daebak (awesome).

505
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,790
 Assemblyman Lee In Su 

506
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,820
 Assemblyman Lee In Su 

507
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,750
 Lee In Su! 

508
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,740
- Fairness and common sense, Lee In Su! 
  - Lee In Su! 

509
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,240
How come it's so hard to reach you?

510
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,310
I asked you to be my spokesperson.

511
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,410
May I recommend someone else?

512
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,630
I'll stand behind the person I recommend.

513
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,240
You should keep a fox close by if a tiger overwhelms you. That's the answer.

514
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,860
I'll stand behind the person I recommend, Chairman.

515
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,950
Until the acquisition is completed and even after that,

516
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,060
I'll be accountable to Hansu Group.

517
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,320
What's with this guy again?

518
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,150
Last time, when Ju Wan took Hong Seok Pal

519
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,740
to break into Su Jae's building, they failed because of him.

520
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,470
But...

521
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,650
Su Jae is living in this guy's place?

522
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,790
Partner Lawyer Oh Su Jae

523
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,840
Your face doesn't look like you've been through the wringer.

524
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,940
You look even better.

525
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,120
Wow, this is much better than my office.

526
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,130
- Your office? 
 - You haven't heard?

527
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,870
I'll start here next week.

528
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,870
Seonbaenim!

529
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,410
- I heard you're joining us. 
 - Hi, Yeong Bae!

530
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,580
I see that you're aging, too.

531
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,330
Your age shows now.

532
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,500
I do hear that I've got a baby face. But true.

533
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,340
Hey, set up a get-together when I start next week.

534
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,780
You must know a few close partners.

535
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,150
Of course, Seonbaenim!

536
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,730
I'll set the whole course up. Go all out.

537
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,040
Have a good one.

538
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,980
Oh, during work dinner, let's grab a drink.

539
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,680
Good day!

540
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,980
Geez, I'm so annoyed!

541
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,450
I don't like him.

542
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,260
He came onto Hui Yeong in the past, too. That SOB.

543
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,500
Why did Chairman let him in?

544
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,980
Does he have something on him?

545
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,510
Let go of me!

546
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,750
What are you doing?

547
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,570
I said let go of me!

548
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,470
Geez, come on. What are you doing!

549
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,840
You can't do this! You can't...

550
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,940
I'm sorry, Chairman. My apologies.

551
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,600
- Get up! 
 - Let go! Let go!

552
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,930
- Let go of me! 
 - Leave him there and go.

553
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,290
Will you stay lying down?

554
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,620
Please save me, Chairman.

555
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,470
I got fired from the school, and my wife divorced me.

556
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,600
My life is miserable.

557
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,540
You're the only one who can save me, Chairman.

558
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,500
- Me? 
 - I'll be loyal to you with my life.

559
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,100
I'll do anything you tell me to do.

560
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,730
Be loyal with your life?

561
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,370
There's no such thing in this world.

562
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,350
It's all just jibberish.

563
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,200
I think you're deeply mistaken about something.

564
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,250
Why are you doing this, Chairman?

565
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,320
Shouldn't you be warmhearted toward me if you consider our old attachment?

566
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,530
Did you forget?

567
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,310
As Chief Prosecutor Choi Tae Gook instructed ten years ago,

568
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,010
As Chief Prosecutor Choi Tae Gook instructed ten years ago,

569
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,900
I took care of all the details for you.

570
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,090
Must I bring this up?

571
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,740
Chief Prosecutor Choi Taek Gook?

572
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,000
You're still the same, Joon Myeong.

573
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,790
It's simpler for you to talk to me this way, man.

574
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,610
Did you eat?

575
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:52,150
 Seo Joon Myeong, Partner Lawyer 

576
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,930
Don't be like that and talk to Chairman.

577
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,360
Tell him he's a scumbag. He shouldn't let him in here.

578
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,480
He'd still listen to you, won't he?

579
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,680
Do you know the Chief of Legal Affairs position at Hansu Group?

580
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,450
Yeah.

581
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,310
Chairman Han is asking me to recruit someone for it.

582
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:16,640
But you said you'd bury your bones here at TK, right?

583
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,220
M-Me, me, me?

584
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,020
You don't work for a company all your life in this day and age.

585
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,630
I can bury my bones elsewhere.

586
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,710
Really?

587
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,920
Don't be like that, Su Jae.

588
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,270
Please consider me seriously for that job.

589
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,600
Okay.

590
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,830
Oh, yeah, I forgot to ask Hui Yeong earlier.

591
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,460
Assemblyman Lee In Su needs a spokesperson for his camp.

592
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,360
I thought of Hui Yeong for a moment there.

593
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,090
- What do you think? 
 - You...

594
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,810
You're, you're so—

595
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,980
We were... we had no idea you'd be so thoughtful toward us.

596
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,570
I-I... how did I not know this?

597
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,200
Geez, I got goosebumps. 
  Chairman Choi Tae Gook 

598
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,580
 Chairman Choi Tae Gook 

599
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,190
It's confidential until it's final, Seonbae.

600
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,870
Yeah, yeah. Confidential.

601
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,980
Don't worry.

602
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,070
Thank you!

603
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,690
I got goosebumps.

604
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,360
Thanks!

605
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,090
Really?

606
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,180
That's right! I think Su Jae will recommend us.

607
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,630
Amazing! We've got it made!

608
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,450
My goodness...

609
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:23,780
I had no idea about that, and I was going to kick her out of Legal Clinic.

610
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,390
Darn it. That's crazy!

611
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,210
Apologize to Su Jae immediately.

612
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,240
Beg her for forgiveness right now!

613
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,480
Text her and say thanks in advance!

614
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,160
 We'll both bury our bones there. 

615
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,500
You're working hard on a late lunch because of me, everyone.

616
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,040
Gosh, sorry.

617
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,140
It's okay, Chairman.

618
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,830
I prepared your favorite, the best quality grilled sea bream for you, Chairman.

619
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,300
Of course, eating at home is the best.

620
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,590
And here.

621
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,300
Give everyone at least some snacks.

622
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,610
- Thanks. 
 - Sure.

623
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,340
Grilled sea bream is the best as far as grilled fish is concerned.

624
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,390
Try it.

625
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,110
I'm sure you didn't summon me for grilled sea bream.

626
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,770
Chairman Han says he'll use Min Yeong Bae.

627
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,290
I asked him if he could recommend anyone for a position that was offered to me

628
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,330
and he jumped at the chance.

629
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,700
And Min Yeong Bae's wife will join Assemblyman Lee's campaign?

630
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,600
That position was also offered to me.

631
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,400
Do you know

632
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,710
what I think when I'm with those two gentlemen?

633
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,360
 That greasy and ignorant face. 

634
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,000
 That arrogant and lowborn face. 

635
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,310
How should I grill and chew on those faces?

636
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,840
How can I rip them up and eat them?

637
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,130
Why are you so blatant?

638
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,400
I'm being honest.

639
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,020
Why not be more honest?

640
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,320
Hansu Group's USB copy.

641
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,000
- Do you have it? 
 - Yes.

642
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,550
Do you have everything you got from Chief Ha's desk?

643
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,380
Everything, including footage that reveals how the three of you partied.

644
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,700
I have what you've got

645
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,490
and you have what I've got.

646
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,750
That's why those two men became more attentive to your words.

647
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,560
A slanted field just became level. That's all.

648
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,430
It's level, huh?

649
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,010
You took what you wanted

650
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,700
and moved what you wanted to move.

651
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,960
But I remain.

652
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,970
I need you. That's why I let you remain.

653
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,220
I also need you, Chairman.

654
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,740
What's why I returned like this.

655
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,100
It sure is good to be honest.

656
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,110
Son, come here. Let's have lunch together.

657
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,070
I'll leave after I say hello, Father.

658
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,150
I have other plans.

659
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,330
Yoon Sang says he wants to work under you as an intern.

660
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,720
Teach him lots of stuff.

661
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,210
I'll start next week, Attorney Oh.

662
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,700
Why?

663
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,640
Excuse me?

664
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,100
You quit Legal Clinic on your own

665
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,160
and now you want to be an intern?

666
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,230
I don't understand.

667
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,110
There are so many things that are not understandable.

668
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,910
Please buy me some coffee, Attorney.

669
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,700
She wants to come into the game I've built

670
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,070
and shake it up, huh?

671
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,690
Why do you want to be my intern? What are you thinking?

672
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,640
Why are you staying at Chan's house? What are you thinking?

673
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,970
You can go to a hotel.

674
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,050
Why are you staying there, of all places?

675
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,850
Aren't you uncomfortable in a house with only men?

676
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,390
It's nice.

677
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,180
I just like it there.

678
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,650
The rooftop is nice, and the food is delicious.

679
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,200
It's fun.

680
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,760
I think my insomnia is gone.

681
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:13,630
I found out I could sleep for 23 hours a day.

682
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,170
You must really love it there.

683
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,530
Yeah.

684
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,120
But Noona,

685
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,930
get out of that house fast if you can.

686
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,290
Chan fell into Father's field of view.

687
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,950
And if you stay at Chan's house—

688
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,230
It won't be good.

689
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,500
Okay.

690
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,880
Thanks for your concern.

691
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,880
Okay...

692
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:44,800
Thanking me sounds like you're drawing the line.

693
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,580
It makes me so sad

694
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,020
and disappointed, Noona.

695
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,780
Anyway,

696
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,730
please take good care of me while I intern with you, Attorney Oh.

697
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,000
And I'm very sorry,

698
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,770
but I'll start in a few days.

699
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,210
Hello, Ms. Oh Su Jeong.

700
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,280
Attorney Oh Su Jae sent me here.

701
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,750
I'm Attorney Song Mi Rim.

702
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,540
Oh Jae Su (Unlucky – nickname)

703
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,550
is really helping me out?

704
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,210
 A Better Tomorrow, Hopeful Correctional Facility 

705
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:51,080
Yes, I'm on my way out after meeting with Oh Su Jeong.

706
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,450
The prosecutor sentenced her to two years at the trial.

707
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,700
I believe her past conviction worked against her.

708
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,330
 But still if you get two years for stealing running shoes, 

709
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:06,250
 those chaebol chairmen who stole billions of won should all get life sentences. 

710
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,210
Release her public defender, and you and I should put our names down.

711
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,210
Okay.

712
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:16,940
In any case, Oh Su Jeong was so touched, saying she never thought you'd help her.

713
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,610
 I got her son's number and spoke to him. 

714
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,030
 And her son is so kind. 

715
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,010
He said he's working at a construction site.

716
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,550
He said he'll work hard and pay us our fees.

717
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:32,480
 But I'll keep your nickname a secret, Attorney Oh. 

718
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,400
 CEO Yoon Se Pil 

719
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,180
I'm getting a call. Let's hang up.

720
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,100
Yes, Attorney Oh Jae Su (Unlucky).

721
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,440
 Civil Law Lectures 

722
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,580
Gosh, there were more than 100 people who came to see us in the last two days.

723
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,710
Do you think we can take care of all these cases?

724
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,790
We should try.

725
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,390
This is proof that Attorney Song is competent.

726
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:00,930
How cool.

727
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,700
A competent woman.

728
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,410
So charismatic.

729
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,980
Just tell her your feelings then.

730
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,500
Noona, you knew? That I like Attorney Song?

731
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,970
You just said so with your mouth.

732
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:15,160
You like Attorney Song, and Chan likes Professor.

733
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,660
This isn't Legal Clinic. It's the "Melo" Clinic.

734
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,520
Of course, Eonni, you're a born detective.

735
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,660
You were born with it.

736
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,080
It's so tough. Really. 
  Hyeong Hyeong Chil 

737
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,670
Hi, Hyeong.

738
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,780
Chan! Hurry up and run over now!

739
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,230
Some man came looking for Professor.

740
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,910
In a very expensive car.

741
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:44,340
He gave me a business card. He says he's a CEO. Wait...

742
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,180
 CEO Yoon Se Pil, SP Partners  
 SP Partners? CEO Yoon Se Pil.

743
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,660
Hey, hey. The professor is here.

744
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,860
Hurry up and come.

745
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,780
 Mom 

746
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,470
This place is good.

747
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,680
I'll become a regular here.

748
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,880
No. Should I just take over this restaurant?

749
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,330
You seem happier than usual tonight.

750
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:30,610
It looks like my dream will come true, slowly but surely, without a doubt.

751
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,000
Your dream...

752
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,590
 My dream is to have all three of them destroyed. 

753
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:40,410
 In one day, at the same time. Completely ruined. 

754
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,740
I didn't ask you then, but I want to ask you now.

755
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,300
Why is that?

756
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,880
Why did their destruction become your dream?

757
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,610
Attorney Oh, how do you think you'd feel if you couldn't get 70 billion won?

758
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,680
Please answer my question first.

759
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,020
Why do you hope for their destruction?

760
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,090
It's not appropriate timing for me to tell you why.

761
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:06,230
But I'll tell you from when.

762
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,340
It started ten years ago.

763
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,560
Excuse me.

764
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,600
 Director Baek Jin Gi 

765
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,820
Yes, Father.

766
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,780
Yes, please do that.

767
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,910
Yes. I'll call you.

768
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,020
Yes. Good night.

769
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,900
Didn't I tell you that I'm pretty close to Director Baek?

770
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,930
Not at all.

771
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:41,240
Director Baek almost became my father-in-law.

772
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,070
Director...

773
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,290
I didn't think he had a daughter.

774
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:50,040
No, he has a daughter.

775
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,900
Pretty and very good at painting.

776
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:57,050
Eun Seo.

777
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,340
Her name is Kang Eun Seo.

778
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,100
Kang Eun Seo.

779
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,750
I answered you.

780
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,410
Now, it's your turn, Attorney Oh.

781
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,500
How do you think you'd feel if you couldn't get 70 billion won?

782
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,500
One, you'd be pissed.

783
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,580
Two, you'd be pissed and go crazy.

784
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,090
Three, you'd be pissed, go crazy,

785
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:25,630
and you'd destroy Yoon Se Pil who destroyed those three

786
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,390
and made you lose that money.

787
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:31,230
Four, I'll get it no matter what.

788
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,560
Don't drink too much.

789
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,300
Don't offer her too much to drink, either.

790
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,990
He's the owner of this place and also a law school student.

791
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,630
What an interesting owner.

792
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,510
Forget it.

793
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,090
Don't worry about it.

794
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,760
Well, that's nothing...

795
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,820
How could I not worry?

796
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,680
Why should I not worry?

797
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,400
It's okay.

798
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,550
It's sturdy.

799
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,080
Jo Gap Hyeong said...

800
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,690
You were here.

801
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,020
It feels so cool here.

802
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,320
 Mom 

803
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,940
So what's over there? Storage?

804
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,220
It's nothing much.

805
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:30,170
It's nothing much, yet you have a lock on it?

806
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,280
That could happen.

807
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,990
Yes.

808
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,280
Yes, that's my mom.

809
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,280
Ganghwa Police Station?

810
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,480
 Drunk driving? 

811
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,350
 Yes, I'll be right there. 

812
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,330
Gosh, I drank beer...

813
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,800
Professor, Chan started the car engine. Hurry up and go.

814
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,900
You had a drink earlier, so you'll be in trouble if you drive.

815
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,550
 The person who caused the accident from drunk driving 

816
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,690
 keeps refusing the blood alcohol level test. 

817
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,200
 So, she was arrested on the spot and is at our station. 

818
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,260
 She says her daughter is a successful lawyer. 

819
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:43,140
 She caused such a commotion saying her daughter must be there. 

820
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,320
 So, why didn't you answer your mom's calls?
    

821
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,080
 Traffic Crimes Investigation Team  
 It's fortunate that the car owner, the victim, is kind.

822
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,070
Or else, you'd be sitting in that cell.

823
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:53,770
He didn't get hurt at all!

824
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:54,960
Only his rear bumper fell off.

825
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,800
Why would I sit behind bars just for that?

826
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,240
- Geez, please be quiet! 
 - Mom!

827
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:04,040
Hey! I didn't drink much.

828
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,310
I only drank one glass of beer while having dinner with my friends.

829
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,470
I drove after I got sober. What drunk driving?

830
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,150
That's called drunk driving, ahjumma!

831
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,310
I'm sorry.

832
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,530
We'll be sure to compensate for the damages.

833
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:18,950
Still, she has to take a breathalyzer test so we can wrap up our investigation.

834
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:21,310
Yes, of course, she should.

835
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,100
Do it. I'll do it.

836
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:27,100
Please blow it. Here.

837
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,200
Blow hard, Mom.

838
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,050
Mr. Chan.

839
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,480
Did you come together?

840
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,520
Yes.

841
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,710
I didn't even drink and drive, but they keep saying I did.

842
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,660
What kind of law is this?

843
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,570
There are lots of problems with the law.

844
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,000
That's right.

845
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,680
Please get in.

846
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,600
In any case, Mom's sorry.

847
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,920
But I really didn't drink and drive.

848
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,530
I got it. Be careful going home.

849
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,340
So, what happens to my car?

850
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,700
I have to change the bumper.

851
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,270
I'll sell it. You got your license revoked.

852
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,480
Don't sell it!

853
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,770
I'm a bit hungry. Should we grab something to eat?

854
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,480
We can go somewhere up high and see the sunrise.

855
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
Let's just go home.

856
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,820
Okay.

857
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:44,670
Where are we?

858
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,200
I got hungry.

859
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,770
I had to eat something before we go.

860
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,310
All right.

861
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,490
Ta-da!

862
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:23,190
I have something else to show you. Go to the front.

863
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,540
What's this?

864
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:45,380
Don't people hang at least one of these on their cars?

865
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:52,420
It's neat. I like it.

866
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,550
Right?

867
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,670
It's super nice if you eat cup ramen from here.

868
00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:00,490
I meant you're neat and I like you.

869
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,180
You knew already.

870
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:11,540
Why do you act like you didn't know?

871
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,850
How could someone be so cute?

872
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,530
What? "So cute"? Hey, did you just—

873
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,560
Are you crazy?

874
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,660
How could you say that to someone who wants to kiss you?

875
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,030
Is that what you say to someone who just confessed her feelings?

876
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:16,230
Do you have a wish?

877
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:18,060
A wish?

878
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,180
I never thought of having a wish.

879
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,980
Except for when I was very little.

880
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,360
But still, say a wish.

881
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,050
You're wishing for it anyhow. I'm sure it'll come true.

882
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,650
Anyhow?

883
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:54,200
You'll get to know me more and more.

884
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,430
 I couldn't tell it to anyone, but... 

885
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,520
 the story I wanted to tell you, 

886
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,230
I'm sure I'll tell you someday.

887
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,040
 I didn't want... 

888
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,960
anyone to find out, but...

889
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:23,060
 trying to do my darnest in life. 

890
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,710
I'll get to show you that side of me.

891
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:34,780
Even if you don't understand that side of me, and it's not very good,

892
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,620
even so...

893
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:44,620
I hope your heart

894
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,130
doesn't get too upset.

895
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,300
How about you?

896
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,730
I have something I couldn't tell you as well.

897
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:07,270
I don't want you to find out, but I still have to tell you.

898
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,670
I know that I have to tell you.

899
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:15,460
But I am still hesitant.

900
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:23,200
I'll tell you for sure, but you'll hate me for sure.

901
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:26,430
Even so, stay by my side.

902
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:32,490
You can hate me, so don't go elsewhere.

903
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,110
Don't go elsewhere.

904
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,820
Same for you.

905
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:50,680
♫  I will fall down  ♫

906
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:58,460
♫  Lost your head in a twinkle  ♫

907
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:04,680
♫  The floor was frozen  ♫

908
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:12,080
♫  We've gotta find another way, the way we were holding together  ♫

909
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,140
♫  It keeps pull me in deep water  ♫

910
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,760
♫  And it feels like kingdom without an  ♫

911
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,300
♫  Exit...  ♫

912
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:25,670
♫  Exit  ♫

913
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:29,050
♫  Tell me how...  ♫

914
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,960
 Why Her? 

915
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:36,140
♫  So we can hold our hands again  ♫

916
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,860
♫  Again  ♫

917
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:47,400
♫  And your eyes showed me the way  ♫

918
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,170
♫  Your breath  ♫

919
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,020
♫  It makes me invincible  ♫

920
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:55,650
 If I feel like someone is messing with my people, I just flip out, Father. 

921
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:57,180
 You take after me more. 

922
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,340
 Give up my position? Never. 

923
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,440
 This isn't Hansu Group. It's TK Law Firm. 

924
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,320
 If it weren't for my father, there'd be no TK! 

925
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,860
 What will you do? You're weaker than I am. 

926
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,190
 No, Hyeong. I put everything on the line to protect her. 

927
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:11,350
 He's not Kim Dong Gu. 

928
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:14,590
 - Ma'am, he's not. 
 - Kim Dong Gu! 

929
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,670
 I have something to say. Give me five minutes. 

930
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:17,590
 Sorry. 

931
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,610
 There's been a collapse in Yeongpyeong District! 

932
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,270
 Why do you make me look bad! 

933
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,200
 They rescued another person, but he's unconscious. 

934
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,700
 What do we do, Attorney Oh? 

935
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:32,350
