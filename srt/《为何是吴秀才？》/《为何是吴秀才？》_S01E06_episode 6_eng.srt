1
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,560
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,970
You turned down the CEO position.

3
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,000
Tell me what you want.

4
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,790
Seventy billion won ($70 million).

5
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,010
What?

6
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,710
Choose, Chairman.

7
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,140
Would you like to see me shit all over the big picture that you're working hard on,

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,240
or would you like to hand over the entire commission

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,620
of 70 billion won from the Hansu Bio sale?

10
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,010
You say you won't shit all over it, but you want the cost of your name.

11
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,000
And the cost of your name is 70 billion won?

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,460


13
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,700
With what guarantee?

14
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,120
You're signaling to me that you can bring everyone down. Why would I believe you?

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,260
I don't want to bring everyone down, Chairman.

16
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,040
I wish success to all three of you.

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,180
Chairman Han will get his hands on a load of money for selling Hansu Bio,

18
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,820
and Assemblyman Lee will become the president riding on that support.

19
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,310
And you, Chairman,

20
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,040
you'll have to prepare your next move by putting those two front and center.

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,360
"The person who is blatant about his personal interest

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,800
is more trustworthy than the person who isn't."

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,860
Is this how you use my own words against me?

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,160
For my personal gain,

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,450
I'll tightly protect the USB so its content doesn't get leaked.

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,310
After the sale is completed, I'll put it in your hands, Chairman.

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,000
The moment you hold it in your hand,

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,310
you get to hold the flaws of Chairman Han

29
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,400
and Assemblyman Lee, who will become the president.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,870
That's what you're after, isn't it?

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,030
How will you convince me that you won't keep a copy of the file?

32
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,960
I'll return a favor with a favor.

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,110
If you promise me that you'll give me the cost of my name, I won't make a copy.

34
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:34,330
So, I'm supposed to pay 70 billion for that tiny USB?

35
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,420
I thought I had raised a playful puppy.

36
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,040
You are making a good business deal going up against me.

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,340
A business deal...

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,440
I should've done it sooner. I'm a little late.

39
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,680
And I was never a pup.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,840
If I were just a playful pup,

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,680
you would've already kicked me out.

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,480
Wrap up Joo Wan's divorce proceedings quickly.

43
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,100
At the least, you could do that for me. You're taking 70 billion won, after all.

44
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,260
  Episode 6  

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,680
I told you to squash Su Jae, but you lit a fire under her instead?

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,910
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,550
Do everything Su Jae says on the sale.

48
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,960
You got that?

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,460
Wh-What do y-you mean...

50
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,060
Su Jae knows about the accounts in the Bahamas with her name on them.

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,790
As for you, do what I say if you want to keep your 27 billion won.

52
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,120
Do what you've always been doing.

53
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,520
Don't try too hard for no reason.

54
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,160
Yes, Sir.

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,120
Chief Ha, what were you doing all this time?

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,400
Su Jae had the USB.

57
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,380
What were you doing all this time?

58
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,990
My apologies.

59
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,450
I learned that the files that were moved to Gong Chan's house

60
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,480
were brought back to Attorney Oh's place.

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,580
My apologies.

62
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,400
Who the hell is this Gong Chan?

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,260
 He's running a pub with some friends he considers brothers. 

64
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,870
 I heard he ran a business in a fish market for quite some time. 

65
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,750
 Aside from the fact that his building is close to Attorney Oh's, 

66
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,090
 there is no other connection. 

67
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,090
 But I'll look into it further. 

68
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,500
Why bother?

69
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,400
There's no need.

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,960
Since Su Jae is a lawyer from TK Law Firm,

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,840
he must be one of the young kids who want to impress her.

72
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,240
Worthless garbage.

73
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,770
  Jeon Na Jeong: September 4, 2012 
 17 years old at the time of the incident 

74
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,520
  Murdered by a step-sibling, Kim confesses to the murder 

75
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,570
  Kim Dong Gu, 18 years old at the time of the incident 

76
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,000
  Kim Dong Gu, 18 years old at the time of the incident 

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
  Neither the police nor the prosecutors believed me and made me a murderer 

78
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,170
  Choi Tae Gook, Inspector General 

79
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,690
  The public defender, the only one who believed me 

80
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:09,390
  The public defender, the only one who believed me 
 Oh Su Jae 

81
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,940
  The public defender, the only one who believed me 
 Oh Su Jae  
 So it was the professor.

82
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,090
Geez, I thought you were being so fussy for some reason.

83
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,830
Bringing her in to prepare a meal for her

84
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,750
and fussing over bringing all those boxes from her place in the middle of the night.

85
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,970
When did you find out?

86
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,490
That Professor Oh was that public defender?

87
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,950
After I got into the school, on the first day of the lecture.

88
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,840
You had no idea before then?

89
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,230
Not at all.

90
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,700
You already know

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,270
I don't even watch the news or read the papers because I'm afraid

92
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,860
they'll mention the case and the name Kim Dong Gu.

93
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,420
Geez...

94
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,430
Hyung, compared to when I used to be Kim Dong Gu,

95
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,510
I liked it much better when I started living as Gong Chan.

96
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,840
I don't feel inferior when people call my name

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,930
and I've felt more at peace

98
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,540
since I became Gong Chan.

99
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,970
Yet you still hang onto all this stuff?

100
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,170
Wow, all these people are much more successful now.

101
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,240
That inspector general became a law firm chairman. 
   Choi Tae Gook, Inspector General 

102
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,720
That prosecutor who treated you like a dog was that sexually harassing professor. 
   Seo Joon Myeong, Seojung University Law School Professor 

103
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,400
And the professor was working at that law firm owned by that chairman? 
  Oh Su Jae 

104
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,200
How come everyone is all tangled and connected? What a mess.

105
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,860
It's a small world, you know.

106
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,550
The legal profession is like that, too.

107
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,430
Forget it.

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,390
Geez! Get rid of all this, man!

109
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,130
Look.

110
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,650
No Byeong Chool is the killer. 
  "Ungju City Step Sibling Murder," The culprit No Byeong Chool arrested, Innocent Kim is released from prison 

111
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,340
He confessed to everything.

112
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,120
He said, "I killed Jeon Na Jeong." 
   No Byeong Chool, caught as the real killer, currently in prison, but he's not the one, the day I got released... 

113
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,580
"After I killed her, I abandoned her body in the ocean so that no one could find her."

114
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,850
He's been saying all that and has been in prison for nine years.

115
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,260
You're the only one insisting that he's not the one, you stupid idiot!

116
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,610
Get rid of all this!

117
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,190
I said no!

118
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,350
I said he's not it.

119
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,570
He's not the killer.

120
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,220
I know. I know it.

121
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,580
He's definitely not the killer.

122
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,270
Fine.

123
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,920
Let's say he's not the killer, as you say.

124
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,720
Let's just say it's all good since you were found not guilty and were released.

125
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,600
Then you just live quietly as Gong Chan. You said you like being Gong Chan.

126
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,700
Isn't that why you're deceiving the professor?

127
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,110
You're hiding the fact that you're Kim Dong Gu.

128
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,440
But Chan, you shouldn't deceive someone you like

129
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,330
for too long.

130
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,470
You shouldn't have drunk so much.

131
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,200
You're going to pass out here.

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,860
Yes.

133
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,490
You're right.

134
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,340
Thank you.

135
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,860
My gosh, Oh Su Jae.

136
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,960
Gosh, Oh Su Jae.

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,900
What about me?

138
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,180
Hey.

139
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,940
Seventy billion won is no joke.

140
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,200
I'm sure because your chairman is cornered,

141
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,120
he probably said, "Yes, I'll give it to you."

142
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,380
But do you think he'll give it to you that easily?

143
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,550
You might die, trying to get that money from him, bitch.

144
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,780
Do you... know what my name means in Chinese characters?

145
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,220
Probably "brilliant Su" and "talented Jae."

146
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,890
I know all of your siblings' names.

147
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,390
Cheon Jae (genius), Yeong Jae (gifted), and Su Jae (brilliant mind).

148
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,990
You said your father gave you your name.

149
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:52,360
My dad used "talented Jae" for Chun Jae and Young Jae.

150
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,110
But he used a different character for "Jae" in my name.

151
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,400
Really? What did he use?

152
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,950
"Brilliant Su" and "clear Jae."

153
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,490
"Be a brilliant person."

154
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,740
Your father...

155
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,640
But they used that name thoughtlessly.

156
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,650
They used that name recklessly on accounts to launder the money they stole.

157
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,750
For a moment there, I thought of revealing everything to the world.

158
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,640
But then I'd have to take the fall and might end up in prison.

159
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,360
That was their intention behind using my name.

160
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,470
It'd be so easy to send me off to prison.

161
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,910
So, revealing it isn't the answer.

162
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,340
I can't ruin my own life.

163
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,920
I'm going to shake it and eat it.

164
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,560
I don't know what you're going to shake up and eat up.

165
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,630
Just sleep.

166
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,010
Gosh, she's completely out. How can I wake her up right away? That's so mean.

167
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,980
It's been about 15 minutes.

168
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,300
I'll let her sleep five more minutes and wake her up.

169
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,930
Okay, get the campfire going.

170
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,720
You'd better not let it die.

171
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,490
Okay.

172
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,020
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,340
Gosh, Oh Su Jae, you have a call. Who is it?

174
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,050
 Gong Chan 

175
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,560
Gong Chan.

176
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,590
 He found out too much about me already, 

177
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,470
 and I think he'll get to know everything. 

178
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,730
 And that embarrasses me to no end. 

179
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,370
It'd be good if I left you with him and took off,

180
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,660
but I can't embarrass you more and let him see you this way.

181
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,970
I'll hold myself back.

182
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,100
Gong Chan, bye-bye.

183
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,980
Sorry.

184
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,510
Isn't that...

185
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,670
Professor Oh Su Jae's cell phone?

186
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,860
Oh... G-Gong... Gong Chan?

187
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,710
- What's going on? 
 - Well...

188
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,280
Why are you sitting here like this?

189
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,380
What?

190
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,790
No, Gong Chan called when you had dozed off.

191
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,420
So, did you ask him to come?

192
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,940
But I don't want to see him.

193
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,880
How could you say that to his face?

194
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,180
Oh, I'm sorry to say this to your face.

195
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,870
I don't know about you.

196
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,640
I don't want to see you.

197
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,460
Especially tonight, right this minute.

198
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,870
So, just leave.

199
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,210
I feel the same way.

200
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,610
Tonight, I don't know about you, either.

201
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,560
I didn't really want to see you tonight, either, Professor.

202
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,410
So, let's just call it even and eat stir-fried eel together.

203
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,970
The two of us, who don't want to see each other.

204
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,300
And your friend didn't ask me to come.

205
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,280
The owner of this place told me to come and eat stir-fried eel. That's why I came.

206
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,180
Ma'am, give me some stir-fried eel, please!

207
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,700
 I'm grilling it now!  

208
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,630
 Don't rush me! 

209
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,450
Hey, I'm so embarrassed.

210
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,190
You were totally overreacting. You know that, right?

211
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,380
Is that him? Gong Chan, who likes you?

212
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,900
Yes.

213
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,320
I'm that Gong Chan.

214
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,500
I see.

215
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,490
- He's cute. 
 - Be quiet.

216
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,070
- I'm Chae Joon Hui. 
 - Quiet!

217
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,630
- Get home safely! 
 - Let's go.

218
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,050
 Dried Fish, Grilled Yellowtail, Seafood Pancake, Late Night Noodles 

219
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,470
 I told you to chop up the green onions. 

220
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,020
 I never told you to cut them so big! 

221
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,110
Wow! Gosh, what a nuisance you are!

222
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,100
Hurry up and come!

223
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,740
I actually wanted to see you.

224
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,010
I lied when I said I didn't want to see you.

225
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,510
Because you said that you didn't want to see me in front of your friend,

226
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,190
it hurt my pride a little bit.

227
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,870
But now that I see you, I'm happy to see you.

228
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,370
I really have no self-respect.

229
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,150
I wasn't even like this when I chased the ice store owner's youngest daughter.

230
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,820
The ice store owner's youngest daughter?

231
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,460
The ice store owner's youngest daughter was so popular in the fish market.

232
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,600
Her nickname was Ice Princess.

233
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,900
She had a small face and was so cute.

234
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,900
You should've gone to see that Ice Princess then. Why are you sitting here?

235
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,900
She's your girlfriend?

236
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,630
Girlfriend?

237
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,830
But, Professor Oh,

238
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,360
why did you say you didn't want to see me?

239
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,580
You seem angry.

240
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,350
Do you know

241
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,340
what it feels like to have your name roll around on the ground?

242
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,630
 Isn't that Kim Dong Gu? When did he come out? 

243
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,740
 Don't look at him. He's got a weird look in his eyes. 

244
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,740
 Kim Dong Gu? 

245
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,530
 Don't even mention that name. 

246
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,620
 It will bring you bad luck. 

247
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,010
But you let me know about that.

248
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,350
 The paper company that's set up in the Bahamas. 

249
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,000
 As the money was sent to that paper company, 

250
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,990
 the name on the foreign account used for money laundering  

251
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,200
  was Oh Su Jae. 

252
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,080
Although I'm glad I found out about it,

253
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:30,410
I feel like you caught me once again.

254
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,640
I feel embarrassed once again.

255
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,510
That's why I didn't want to see you.

256
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,780
I have something like that, too.

257
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,880
I wish you'd just find out somehow.

258
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,010
But I also wish you would never find out.

259
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,520
I'm saying you're not the only one who feels that way.

260
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,900
So, let's just call it even again.

261
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,420
Sometimes, it feels like bad things come your way all at once.

262
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,660
But if you wait a little bit and look around,

263
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,970
good things have come to you as well.

264
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,050
In your work as well as in people.

265
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,850
In my work... as well as in people.

266
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,310
 Song Mi Rim 

267
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,860
 Song Mi Rim 

268
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,990
Hey.

269
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,190
CEO Yoon Se Pil said he couldn't reach you.

270
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,980
So, he called me instead.

271
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,060
He wants to move up tomorrow morning's 9 am meeting to 8 am.

272
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,580
He's asking for a breakfast meeting.

273
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,490
All right.

274
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,480
  Snacks and Toasts 

275
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,170
Attorney.

276
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,970
- Whoa, it's so crowded here. 
 - Here you go.

277
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,340
- One more ham and cheese, please. 
 - Okay.

278
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,620
Is the food here good?

279
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,820
Try it.

280
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,460
- Oh, thank you. 
 - Enjoy.

281
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,280
It is good!

282
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,250
I used to come here every other day while I was studying for the bar.

283
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,720
- Every other day? 
 - I couldn't afford to eat it every day.

284
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,360
It's on me today. Eat as much as you want.

285
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,140
How much does it cost?

286
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,150
At least 1.8 trillion won.

287
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,430
I should actually get 2 trillion won for it.

288
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,490
What do I get out of it?

289
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,440
A top-secret document that guarantees the approval of Hansu Bio's third clinical trial on its new medicine.

290
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,080
And the news is a secret to be released right after the acquisition goes through.

291
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,870
You seem satisfied, so I'll add one more condition.

292
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,470
As for the contract fee, you'll pay 25% of the entire cost.

293
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,450
Gosh, I'm sorry.

294
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,130
I've never even heard of such a contract fee.

295
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,840
If word gets out that I agreed to this, I'd be called a nut job.

296
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,490
If you don't like it, don't agree to it.

297
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,170
If you agree and people call you crazy, my gosh, that'd be the best publicity.

298
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,600
Okay. Let's do it like this.

299
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,870
The contract fee will be 20%, but instead,

300
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,200
if hidden flaws, including corruption, and other serious issues surface during the inspection,

301
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Hansu Bio will pay double the contract fee to SP Partners, and the contract will fall through.

302
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,580
- Deal. 
 - Before the payment due date,

303
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,000
if Hansu Bio's stock prices fall more than 8% for any reason,

304
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,740
Hansu Bio will pay double the contract fee to SP Partners, and the contract will fall through.

305
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,600
Please include that.

306
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,690
Fifteen percent.

307
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,840
- Ten percent. 
 - Sixteen percent.

308
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,490
Eleven percent.

309
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,710
Seventeen percent.

310
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,170
You wish Hansu would crumble.

311
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,840
If you set your mind to it, dropping that much in stock prices would be a piece of cake.

312
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,100
Are you planning to plummet the stock prices and run off with double the contract fee?

313
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,050
The short-term debt that Hansu Construction needs to pay off immediately is over 400 billion won.

314
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:55,100
But it's difficult to find a bank that will lend money to Hansu Group with over a 500% debt ratio.

315
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,170
They definitely need the contract fee that I'll be paying them.

316
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,280
Please accept the offer.

317
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,050
Thirteen percent.

318
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,220
Deal!

319
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,300
The last condition.

320
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,740
Attorney Oh Su Jae will be the legal representative,

321
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,540
who oversees the contract and implementation process of the Hansu Bio sale.

322
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,900
So, the deal is off without Attorney Oh Su Jae.

323
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,600
I guess that's what you mean, right?

324
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,280
I don't want to toss all my hard work out the window.

325
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,240
If the sale goes through,

326
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,730
TK Law Firm will take at least 70 billion won.

327
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,820
It was laid out to benefit the firm greatly.

328
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,250
How much do you get to take as the lead, Attorney Oh?

329
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,320
Ten percent?

330
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,180
Seven percent?

331
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,350
Why not come over to our side? It's not too late.

332
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,730
I'll guarantee you up to 20%.

333
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,370
I don't have to go over to you. I'll take it all.

334
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,870
- Thank you, ma'am. 
 - Sure.

335
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,490
- Take care! 
 - Thank you!

336
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,890
President Kim, 200 billion won ($200 million) of Hansu Construction's short-term debt.

337
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,240
What will you do with that?

338
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,290
Hey! Three years ago, you said that

339
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,900
as long as we purchase Daesung Construction and grow our size,

340
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,700
we'd be the top construction company in Korea.

341
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,800
First of all, we began the construction in Yeongpyeong District,

342
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,020
and the stock prices are on the rise, Chairman.

343
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,360
As for the short-term debt problem,

344
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,600
if the Hansu Bio sale goes through

345
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,180
- the funds should flow— 
 - Hey!

346
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,570
Why do you care about the Hansu Bio sale?

347
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,670
Are you asking me to sell that and pay off your debt or what?

348
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,530
Hey, if Yeongpyeong District began its construction,

349
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,490
your job is to come up with a cash flow as the president.

350
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,950
Why the heck would you beg for more money from me!

351
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,710
- My apologies. 
 - Geez, these pieces of trash. 
  Hansu 

352
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,120
- Hey, Han Gi Taek. 
 - Yes?

353
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,330
Why don't you put your thinking cap on at times like this?

354
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,500
I do have my thinking cap on, Chairman.

355
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,440
First, during the preferred bidder selection process,

356
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,080
if we sign the contract with a bidder who makes an unprecedented bid,

357
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,260
based on the info I gathered, Naeun Group bid 1.1 trillion won ($1.1 billion),

358
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,850
H&amp;T bid 1.3 trillion won (~$1.3B),

359
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,430
and SP Partners bid 1.8 trillion won (~$1.8B) plus something extra.

360
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,610
Up to 2 trillion won ($2B) is a possibility.

361
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,330
We can select SP Partner as our preferred bidder

362
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,490
and receive more than 20% in the contract fee.

363
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,830
What? Twenty percent?

364
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,120
In exchange, the announcement of the approval of Hansu Bio's third clinical trial on its new medicine,

365
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,250
will be made after the sale.

366
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,130
Are you crazy?

367
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,240
Why would we turn over that honey pot to someone else?

368
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,350
That's crazy.

369
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,680
What are you trying to do, Hyeong?

370
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,130
What's this?

371
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,100
"If there are any issues with the contract,

372
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,650
we will pay double the contract fee, and the contract will fall through"?

373
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,240
Geez... Read it.

374
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,160
Hey, are you saying let's blow 700 billion won (~$700M), which is my blood and sweat?

375
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,940
Father, we could lose up to 800 billion won ($800M).

376
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,440
Hyeong. This is a crazy contract. We're not playing around here.

377
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,620
Are you naive or just incompetent?

378
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,470
The terms are too risky.

379
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,460
There won't be any risks.

380
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,710
There won't be any risks.

381
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,130
You think Chairman Choi will be okay with those terms?

382
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,090
He got caught with bank accounts with my name on them.

383
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,170
He has to okay the terms.

384
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,230
Attorney Oh Su Jae will be in charge and TK Law Firm is behind this.

385
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,770
We can have TK Law Firm be liable for it.

386
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,580
The structure is set up in a way that TK Law Firm will appoint the accounting firm.

387
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,990
To start off, seventy billion won ($70 million) will be paid to TK Law Firm.

388
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,650
If any issues arise, TK Law Firm should repay triple the amount of the commission.

389
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,390
Three times 70 billion won. That's 210 billion won ($210 million).

390
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,240
We make it so that TK Law Firm has to pay 210 billion won.

391
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,640
I mean, I like the amount, but...

392
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,490
why are all the terms so drastic?

393
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,600
Do you think Chairman Choi will go for it?

394
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,380
You think that man, as cunning as a fox, would go for terms to repay 210 billion won?

395
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,060
We just need you to decide, Chairman.

396
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,080
Attorney Oh will take care of SP Partners and TK Law Firm.

397
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,940
So, it's been worked out with Attorney Oh?

398
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,380
Yes.

399
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,780
I've never seen terms like this before in my life.

400
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,320
Gi Taek, you did have your thinking cap on the first time in a while.

401
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,700
One thing, they want to include in the terms to say Attorney Oh

402
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,150
will be the legal representative overseeing the process of Hansu Bio sales.

403
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,420
Who says? Attorney Oh?

404
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,390
Yes.

405
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,940
I did think it was a bit over the top.

406
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,840
Well, she's already doing that anyway. It's hardly necessary.

407
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,650
Tell her we'll add something to the contract.

408
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,130
Okay.

409
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,160
Just tell him that I'm here.

410
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,330
Please come back after making an appointment with the secretary's office.

411
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,800
That Chief Secretary Ha Il Gu.

412
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,330
Tell that hyeong that Hong Seok Pal came to see Chairman regarding the Park So Yeong issue.

413
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,730
Try telling him that.

414
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,440
Someone named Hong Seok Pal is here to see you.

415
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,840
Yes.

416
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,030
See? You just wasted my time.

417
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,320
Wow, you're working hard.

418
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,430
Don't you know who I am?

419
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,650
You speak in such a charming manner today.

420
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,450
Why? You should just act yourself.

421
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,910
Park So Yeong's cell phone.

422
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,560
Did someone order you to bring it to him?

423
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,570
Or did you steal it as your form of insurance?

424
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,350
What kind of bullshit is this?

425
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,390
Now that I see you're here barking, your situation must be pretty dire.

426
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,670
If you need any help, you can call me. Wait...

427
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,460
be prepared to pay for my medical bill.

428
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,200
  Song Mi Rim 

429
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,100
You said you're close to Ms. An at Chairman's secretary's office, right?

430
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,840
 Yes, we grab beer together here and there. 

431
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Go to the secretary's office right now, pretend to chat up Ms. An, and watch someone.

432
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,050
Ms. An, you paid last time, so I'll treat you this time.

433
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,100
What are you craving?

434
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,680
- How about tripe? 
 - Let's just talk in your office, Hyeong.

435
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,340
We're not kids. Why go to the men's room? Geez...

436
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,080
Aren't you extra busy these days since Attorney Oh goes to the law school?

437
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Gosh, I still have time to eat with you, Ms. An.

438
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,700
Did you think I'd be scared of what you said?

439
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,990
I'll expose everything!

440
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,360
So, Hyeong, don't look down on me!

441
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,580
What the hell are you staring at? Damn!

442
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,830
Attorney Oh, that man was totally pissed off.

443
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,660
He was yelling and screaming.

444
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,170
You still can't reach Mr. Go?

445
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,010
No. It's been several days now.

446
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,020
I want to find out more about this man.

447
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,170
The case went over to the Prosecutors' Office, but they're moving very slow.

448
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,670
Even so, we could investigate that?

449
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,810
How do we do that?

450
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,750
Aren't you guys curious? I'm curious.

451
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,940
Do you have a personal reason?

452
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,380
The reason you're curious?

453
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,900
- The reason you must know? 
 - Of course.

454
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,080
- What is it? 
 - No comment.

455
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,650
Pardon?

456
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,960
Are you saying, "Shut up and find out"?

457
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,310
It's a trade.

458
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,120
I'm suggesting a trade.

459
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,990
You can stay out of it if you're uncomfortable about it.

460
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,700
If you want to do it, tell me one thing you want from me.

461
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,370
After I graduate and pass the bar, I want to work at TK Law Firm.

462
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,270
On your team, Professor.

463
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,120
Only if you score higher than 1,200 points on the exam.

464
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,210
What? Gosh, that's a daunting score.

465
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,900
- 1,000 points. 
 - 1,300.

466
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,700
1,200!

467
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,830
It's a confidentiality agreement saying you'll keep everything about this case to yourself.

468
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,560
Write out your terms on the last page and sign it.

469
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,960
Okay.

470
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,270
  Working at TK Firm after law school and passing the bar 

471
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:40,010
If I ever face a situation where I need a lawyer, please help me just once.

472
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,620
Do you plan to get yourself in trouble?

473
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,990
Of course not.

474
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,730
My dream is to become the president. I'd never cause trouble.

475
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,290
Your dream is so...

476
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,200
So grand and impressive, right?

477
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,580
I believe your dream should be grand.

478
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,690
  Nam Choon Poong 

479
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,960
There's a case I could use your help on, Professor.

480
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,630
It will be going to trial. Please help me.

481
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,200
Without telling me what kind of case it is? No questions asked?

482
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,810
I'll tell you about it when the time comes.

483
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:10,340
You also wanted to find out who killed Park So Yeong, so you just threw it out to us.

484
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,770
I'm sure you've got your own reasons.

485
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,840
If I catch the culprit,

486
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,080
you also have to grant my request, Professor.

487
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,180
Will you get me a cup of coffee?

488
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,630
Sure.

489
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,740
- Stay out of this case. 
 - Why?

490
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,560
- It'd be good for you to stay out of it. 
 - Why?

491
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,840
I guess I must know one of the suspects you're thinking of.

492
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,540
I'm curious to know who you're thinking of as the suspect, but I'm sure you won't tell me.

493
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,570
Let me ask you one thing.

494
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,590
Noona, do you feel guilty about Park So Yeong's death or something?

495
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,710
Feel guilty?

496
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,150
- No. 
 - Then why?

497
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,800
Why would you want to find out?

498
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,180
They're dragging their feet. So I thought it would be useful to me if I found out who did it.

499
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:16,600
If the person I'm thinking of is the culprit, that would serve me quite well.

500
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,200
At times, you seem so cold, Noona.

501
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,750
I thought about if that's how you really are

502
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,800
or if you became that way working under my father.

503
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,300
When I met you as my tutor in the past, you were definitely very different from how you are now.

504
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,380
That was so long ago.

505
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,960
People change.

506
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,490
That's right.

507
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,280
But whenever I see you, I keep searching for the you from back then.

508
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,680
You're still there.

509
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,100
The Noona from back then is still inside you.

510
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,440
You stay out. That'd be best.

511
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,920
Don't get into a relationship with Chan. That's my condition.

512
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,280
What?

513
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,650
I saw you two together.

514
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,670
 - Ma'am. 
 - Yeah? 

515
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,130
 - One bottle of soju. 
 - Okay. 

516
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,370
 It's my first time seeing you laugh like that. 

517
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,720
 I don't think I've ever seen you smile like that before. 

518
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,330
So, you know how to smile like that.

519
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,260
Chan...

520
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,460
He's so peculiar.

521
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,960
I liked him from the get-go.

522
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,950
"Whoa, I like this guy."

523
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,950
I thought I finally found someone I'd like to be friends with.

524
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,320
But he started to bother me at some point.

525
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,080
Noona, do you like Chan?

526
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,910
Do you like Chan as a man? Do you?

527
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,190
Get out if you're going to ramble.

528
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,030
I guess you're not clear about that yet.

529
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,840
What a relief.

530
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,940
I clearly told you.

531
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,210
Don't get into a relationship with Chan.

532
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,290
Hyeong!

533
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,590
Hey.

534
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,210
I'm a little nervous about making a one-on-one deal with the professor.

535
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,880
How was it?

536
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,010
Everyone says they're doing it but won't say anything more.

537
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,870
You're good at being with her one-on-one.

538
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,690
I'm off.

539
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,850
Is there some type of pressure or problem relevant to that case?

540
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,610
About someone connected to the case...

541
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,790
For example, if you have someone in mind as the suspect,

542
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,530
are you trying to grab hold of that person's weakness?

543
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,170
Why do you think that?

544
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:20,260
For some reason, I'm worried about you.

545
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,610
What's your condition?

546
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,660
  Confidentiality Agreement 

547
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,480
  Gong Chan 

548
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,260
I don't have any.

549
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,820
No questions asked.

550
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,740
I'll do it unconditionally.

551
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,430
What was that?

552
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:59,500
How come my heart skipped a beat when he said "unconditionally"?

553
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,470
  Confidentiality Agreement 

554
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,860
So I signed up for life insurance.

555
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,830
For 300 million won ($300,000) if I die.

556
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,180
She says she won't lend me money if we don't sign up for it.

557
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,840
Oh, my! That Oh Su Jae is so immoral!

558
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,650
I'm sorry, Mother!

559
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,250
Oh, no! You're right.

560
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,590
She's my daughter, but it makes me wonder if I actually gave birth to her.

561
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,990
Oh, Attorney Song! Su Jae is in, right?

562
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,850
Yes, ma'am. What brings you here—

563
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,680
Attorney Song?

564
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,250
Attorney Song Mi Rim from TK Law Firm?

565
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,320
Oh, yes. Who's asking?

566
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,610
Me?

567
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,840
Because you stabbed his back at the last minute,

568
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,460
he dropped out of the running for TK Law Firm CEO.

569
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,410
Attorney Min Yeong Bae's wife.

570
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:57,010
The assistant director of this place, Jeong Hui Yeong.

571
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,040
Oh, well, I didn't stab him in the back.

572
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,150
He didn't really know my intentions and jumped the gun...

573
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,790
I signed up because you said so! Why are you saying that now?

574
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,870
I signed up for the insurance! The insurance!

575
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
 Hey, girl! 

576
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,330
 Your brothers are at that stupid building right now! 

577
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,870
They won't budge until you open a store for them, girl!

578
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,390
She was inattentive to her family.

579
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,900
Ma'am, you can't do this here.

580
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,030
Let go!

581
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,950
She doesn't even care about her family. What kind of lawyer could she be?

582
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,670
What a professor!

583
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,810
 How could you even teach students? 

584
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,550
 Let go of this, Attorney Song. 

585
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,470
 I'll put an end to this today! 

586
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:43,720
 I know how things go because I run a store on the front side of that building. 

587
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,470
To find out what type of business would be a success,

588
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,580
I analyzed that entire area.

589
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,150
Who are you?

590
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,910
This student sits in the professor's lectures.

591
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,710
He's very resourceful when it comes to business.

592
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,770
He even runs a store nearby, ma'am.

593
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,100
He owns the building.

594
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,250
Really?

595
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,780
Come with me for now.

596
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,300
Someone could call the police on you.

597
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,100
The professors are former prosecutors and judges.

598
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,470
Fine. Let's go.

599
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,400
Let's go.

600
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,530
Hello.

601
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,170
That Gong Chan is so sociable.

602
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,560
I was going to step in, but he took care of her.

603
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,160
What a relief.

604
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,660
My apologies.

605
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,990
What do you mean?

606
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,250
Why should you be sorry?

607
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,880
But you know, why are you looking for him?

608
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,340
 But you know, why do you insist on a not guilty verdict? 

609
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,820
 Because that's the answer. 

610
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,460
 I'm striving for an answer. 

611
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,820
Because that's the answer.

612
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,290
I'm striving for an answer.

613
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,910
Striving for an answer?

614
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,520
Looking for the man who killed Park So Yeong,

615
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,140
going as far as mobilizing Legal Clinic students

616
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,460
is striving for an answer?

617
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,040
Is it worth it?

618
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,400
 The answer is that Kim Dong Gu is not guilty. 

619
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,710
 Is that worth it? 

620
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,180
 Let it take its natural course. 

621
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:45,720
 Inspector General Choi Tae Gook will retire as soon as this case is closed. 

622
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,060
 And then he'll open up a law firm. 

623
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,880
 Let things come to their natural conclusion. 

624
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,300
 Then move to that law firm. 

625
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,450
 He'll take care of you and help you grow. 

626
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:04,500
Rather than letting it take its course, I can go down a path that doesn't seem right.

627
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,320
When else could I do this if not now?

628
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,900
Are there any other reasons?

629
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,790
Should there be any other reason?

630
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,130
I know, right?

631
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:20,370
Geez, this is how my habit as a prosecutor comes out.

632
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,150
"Does that person have any other reasons?"

633
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,550
There goes my habit.

634
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,860
 It's daebak (awesome), Attorney Oh! 

635
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,650
 Gong Chan is so mature and experienced. 

636
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,280
 Your mother has become such a gentle lamb. 

637
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,240
 I've never seen your mother so focused before. 

638
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,380
She's totally focusing on what Gong Chan says.

639
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,150
She's nodding.

640
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,910
All right.

641
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,240
She's coming out. I'm hanging up.

642
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,310
Hello, ma'am.

643
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,560
When did you come, Attorney Song? You should've come in!

644
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,940
I mean, Mr. Chan.

645
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,530
You're the best!

646
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,870
He owns the building and is a business owner.

647
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,580
He's so successful.

648
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,330
But you know what's even greater than that?

649
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,350
He says he'll give a franchise to my sons.

650
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,240
He'll reveal all the trade secrets and recipes.

651
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,200
Right?

652
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,430
But in return, your sons must work hard at the fish market for six months.

653
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,730
No reason they can't do that!

654
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,660
I'll make sure they do that.

655
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,390
They spent ten months in jail.

656
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:28,070
Six months is no big deal.

657
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,270
Pretend you didn't hear that.

658
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,470
Get home safely.

659
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,760
My goodness!

660
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,340
If Su Jae was ten years younger, I'd take Mr. Chan as my son-in-law.

661
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,440
Right, Attorney Song?

662
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,810
  TK Law Firm 

663
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:53,900
 They experienced some difficulties when the sale halted two weeks ago. 

664
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:59,650
 SP Partners who submitted the highest bid in taking over Hansu Bio 

665
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,350
 has been selected as the preferred bidder.  
      

666
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,400
 Reporter Han Seung Goo, the takeover of Hansu Bio has become even more interesting.   
    
 

667
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,670
 What are your thoughts? 

668
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,770
 The preferred bidder means that 
   

669
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:14,510
 they submitted the most favorable bid among competitive bidders 
   

670
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,520
 and has qualified to make the first negotiation. 

671
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:24,100
 Within the industry, it's been said that SP Partners has bid 2.1 trillion won. 
   

672
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,770
 And if this deal comes to fruition, 

673
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,910
 Hansu Bio's capital will increase to more than 3 trillion won. 
   

674
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,620
 Yes. 
    

675
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,920
 The current debt ratio of 550% is expected to go down to half of that. 
    

676
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,340
 It looks to be a very favorable move for Hansu Group. 

677
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,400
Yes, then Reporter Sin Jeong Eun,

678
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,190
besides Hansu Group,

679
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,020
is TK Law Firm, who handled the sale

680
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,820
ultimately the victor in this? 
   TK Law Firm, proving their expertise as they handle Hansu Bio merger and acquisition 

681
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:52,060
Yes, that's right. The organizer for the Hansu Bio sale, TK Law Firm's power is quite impressive. /   TK Law Firm, proving their expertise as they handle Hansu Bio merger and acquisition 

682
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,830
 TK Law Firm that survived due to fierce behind-the-scenes work among other firms, 

683
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:00,740
 looks to walk away with more than 70 billion won in commission from this deal. 

684
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,370
 If that's the case... 

685
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,100
Wow, did you see her?

686
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,440
She just made 70 billion won, and she's so calm.

687
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,690
She's not human.

688
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,350
In any case, she's amazing.

689
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,320
I'll admit it. Respect.

690
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,960
But the legal representative for the takeover is CEO Choi Ju Wan.

691
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,200
Honestly, he just put his name on it. Attorney Oh did all the work.

692
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,130
I thought she'd be weak after getting pushed out of the CEO position.

693
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,240
Is she gaining ground again with this?

694
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,390
What's up? Aren't you guys working?

695
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,600
I'm sorry.

696
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,310
Get back to work...

697
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,200
Good work.

698
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,910
If any issues arise, we have to repay three times the amount of the commission.

699
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,270
Are you okay with that condition, Father?

700
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,820
Su Jae...

701
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,280
found out that her name was on the Bahamas accounts.

702
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,350
That bothered me the most when she took all the files.

703
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,970
She ultimately found that out.

704
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,960
I'm sorry, Father. I should've gotten that back.

705
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,110
She would be the worst traitor if she were roaming around outside.

706
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,950
And a formidable trooper if she's part of the family.

707
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,880
So, we should let her in.

708
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,100
That's the answer.

709
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,090
Wrap up your divorce, and marry Su Jae.

710
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,450
Father.

711
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,480
Don't go against me, Ju Wan.

712
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,540
 Here is the news on Hansu Group. 

713
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,940
 Chairman Han Seong Beom's bold leadership is gaining attention. 
    

714
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,150
 Chairman Han Seong Beom of Hansu Group sold Hansu Bio... 

715
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,270
Who do you think will control the world if Lee In Su becomes the president?

716
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,740
  Assemblyman Lee In Su, number one in polls as the leader for presidential candidate / Hansu Bio sale, Chairman Han Seong Beom's gutsy decision 

717
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,120
Attorney Oh Su Jae?

718
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,520
I always wondered what kind of person you were. I've been wanting to meet you.

719
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,200
This is how we meet.

720
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,510
Let's talk about what you want.

721
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,890
My job is to mediate that concern.

722
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,280
Let's enjoy our conversation after my job is done.

723
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,710
As much alimony as possible.

724
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,750
Choi Ju Wan's official apology.

725
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,180
 File his divorce. 

726
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,480
 My daughter-in-law wants both child custody and parental rights. 

727
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,830
 There is no way. 

728
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:09,220
I heard you wanted child custody and parental rights.

729
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,090
Isn't that right?

730
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,400
Gosh, Father can't take a joke.

731
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,980
Why would I want child custody and parental rights?

732
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,100
She's not even my child.

733
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,020
Why would I?

734
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,680
Hi, Jae Yi.

735
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,110
 Mom, I went to grandma's grave site. 

736
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,770
Good job.

737
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,730
Grandma must've been happy.

738
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:46,230
 Mom, I get to sleep at your place tonight, right? 

739
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,630
 You'll come pick me up, right? 

740
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,340
Yeah, of course.

741
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,600
I'll see you later.

742
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,700
She's smart and pretty.

743
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,700
Enough to wish she was my daughter.

744
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,840
You have an attachment from raising her.

745
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,410
The child must think you're her birth mom.

746
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:13,950
I lost my baby because of Jae Yi.

747
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,850
Teun-Teun.
  (T/N: Means healthy and strong) 

748
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:22,870
I gave him that nickname hoping he'd grow healthy and strong in my womb.

749
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,930
But one day, Teun-Teun's heart stopped beating inside the womb.

750
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,790
After finding out about Jae Yi's existence,

751
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,160
I cried and vomited every day.

752
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,880
I couldn't even sleep.

753
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,230
I spent two months like that...

754
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,330
My baby died because of Jae Yi.

755
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,110
But Father said this to me.

756
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,750
"I'll let the world think that you gave birth to Jae Yi.

757
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,430
Wouldn't you want that, too?"

758
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:08,200
At times, I think Father is like a sociopath.

759
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,070
Don't you think so?

760
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,570
Choi Ju Wan, who inherited the same blood, is the same kind of man.

761
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:22,480
I lived acting as though I was happy with people like them.

762
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,020
I won't live like that anymore.

763
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,680
My life would be too much of a waste if I did.

764
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,510
But I'm really curious about this.

765
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:38,180
How did you even open your heart to someone like Choi Ju Wan?

766
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,240
Attorney Oh...

767
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,160
I've met you only for a moment, and you don't seem that easy.

768
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,840
I cared about his background.

769
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,150
How about you, Ms. Im Seung Yeon?

770
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,410
You're charming, Attorney Oh.

771
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,580
I can see why Father favors you.

772
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,120
Since it's our first day today, let's wrap up here.

773
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,230
Let's discuss realistic terms in detail next time.

774
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,640
Yes, let's do that.

775
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,710
 If you go to the States first, Ju Wan will follow you. 

776
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,390
 Have the baby there and you two could have an informal wedding. 

777
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:49,460
It's s-so p-pretty...

778
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,380
Ha Neul... 
  (T/N: the name Ha Neul means sky) 

779
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,260
 Ms. Oh Su Jae! 

780
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,080
 Yes. 

781
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,250
 What's the baby's nickname? 

782
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,180
 - Excuse me? 
 - You haven't made one up yet? 

783
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,810
 Tell me next time then. 

784
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,660
 - Ha Neul... 
 - Ha Neul? 

785
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,940
 Ha Neul is a pretty name. 

786
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,280
 Yes... 

787
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,100
 A pretty name. 

788
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,810
 I had forgotten it all this time. 

789
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,640
 So that I could go on... 

790
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,380
 I never told anyone. 

791
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,400
 I didn't want anyone to know. 

792
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:04,910
  Office 

793
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:08,570
  Office 

794
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,580
 Good work. 

795
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,890
 Bye now. 

796
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,480
  Suspect 

797
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:01,170
 Oppa, do you want to drink more soda? 

798
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,170
 Be nice to her, man. 

799
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,480
 Geez, stop introducing me to stepmoms. 

800
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,230
 Aren't you embarrassed? 

801
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:14,400
 Ahjumma, don't trust my dad. You'll ruin your life. 

802
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,220
 Hey. Hey, man! 

803
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,720
 Where are you going? Hey! 

804
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,050
 Hey. 

805
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,040
 Eat some meat before you go. 

806
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:39,110
 I'd love it if you'd be a good older brother to my Na Jeong. 

807
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:08,150
There's something I haven't told you.

808
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:12,000
 I should've told you. 

809
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,880
I wanted to tell you many times.

810
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,620
I even tried to tell you.

811
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,490
But I couldn't.

812
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,780
 But the baby was stillborn, 

813
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,410
 and the man who was supposed to join her didn't come. 

814
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:31,470
 And that unwed mother even tried to kill herself. 

815
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,320
What a lousy excuse for a moron. Such a loser.

816
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,960
 With a baby you made when my son made a mistake playing around one night, 

817
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,260
 your intention of trying to get something out of it. 

818
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,440
 I let you off. 

819
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,880
I hate the fact that people who tred to control my life whenever they could

820
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,190
are the only ones who know about this.

821
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,280
I want good people to know about this.

822
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,800
What's wrong?

823
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,570
Something's the matter with you, huh? What is it?

824
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:11,060
I just want good people to know about it.

825
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,040
I just wanted to talk about it all of a sudden.

826
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:25,540
But Joon Hui, can I tell someone else about this?

827
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,210
 Besides you. 

828
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,670
Yeah, you can. Totally.

829
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:32,570
I have lots of things I don't tell you.

830
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,930
I just feel like...

831
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,380
he'll say it's okay.

832
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,230
I think he'll just let it go like it's nothing.

833
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,180
Could I do that?

834
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,200
I don't have to know anything about it ever.

835
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,390
Just tell Gong Chan.

836
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,930
You must tell him. Got it?

837
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,740
Who is it?

838
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,030
  010-1620-9751 

839
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,270
  010-1620-9751 

840
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,270
Yes, this is Oh Su Jae.

841
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,610
 This is Hong Seok Pal. 

842
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,360
 Meet me right now. 

843
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,360
- Look, do you know what time it is? 
  - Park So Yeong. 

844
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,080
 What if I told you I killed Park So Yeong? 

845
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,090
What?

846
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,490
Why? Are you interested now that I tell you I killed Park So Yeong?

847
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:46,100
Of course, you're partly responsible for So Yeong getting killed like a dog.

848
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,740
- What the hell are you talking— 
  - Right this minute, 

849
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,490
come look for me at Seokpo Fishing Grounds.

850
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:08,430
 We're Open 

851
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:38,070
  Seokpo Fishing Grounds 

852
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,430
  010-1620-9751 

853
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:16,370
 I heard from Park So Yeong's OB/GYN coordinator. 

854
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,500
 She said that the baby's father is a very wealthy man. 

855
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,040
 Park So Yeong took a taxi in front of the hostess bar, 

856
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,170
 and I've confirmed that Hong Seok Pal followed her in his car. 

857
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,420
 As of now, Hong Seok Pal is very likely. 

858
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,000
 Hong Seok Pal? 

859
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,020
  Gong Chan 

860
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,290
Where are you?

861
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,720
What's wrong with your voice?

862
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,020
Is something wrong?

863
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,050
I was going to go...

864
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,930
 What? 

865
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,780
I was...

866
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,890
going to go to you...

867
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,490
Something's wrong, right?

868
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,510
- Where are you? 
 - Chan, where are you going?

869
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,870
If you don't know where you are, tell me what you see.

870
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:46,190
 I can find where you are. Just tell me what you see! 

871
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:03,530
 Why Her? 

872
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:13,490


873
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,970
 Who's Hong Seok Pal? 

874
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,950
 The hostess bar owner where deceased Park So Yeong worked. 

875
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,390
 If it wasn't a suicide? 

876
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:30,970
 What if it was a murder that resembled suicide, just like Park So Yeong? 

877
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,810
 Do you think you're the only one worrying about Noona? 

878
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,800
 I'm so angry that Professor was alone in that situation last night. 

879
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,260
 No, Eun Seo. No... 

880
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,660
 Excuse me! Help me! Help me! 

881
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,330
 It was your fault that he died. 

882
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:45,540
 How well do you think you can protect yourself? 

883
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,570
 The police are here. 

884
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:48,640
 They couldn't reach you, so they came personally, Attorney Oh. 

885
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,820
 Get Noona out of there now! 

886
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,900
 That's why I came here. 

887
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,130
 Because something bad is going to happen to me soon.
