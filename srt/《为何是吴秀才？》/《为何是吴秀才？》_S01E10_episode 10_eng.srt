1
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,740
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,450
 Episode 10 

3
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,540


4
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,330
What a nice scene.

5
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,730
But if you look into their lives,

6
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,100
they all go through ups and downs,

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,470
They get angry and fight, too.

8
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,590
Even though they get angry and fight, they call each other and eat together.

9
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,040
While they eat together, their anger usually fizzles.

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,550
Then they'd laugh and work together.

11
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,590
That's what probably happens.

12
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,710
So different from the world I live in.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,720
Later... Way down the road, I wonder what it would be like to live in a place like this.

14
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,590
I wonder if these people would let me join them.

15
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,580
I think they'd welcome you.

16
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,260
You'd give consultations

17
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,130
and you'd receive dry seaweed instead of getting a consultation fee.

18
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,530
You could even get freshly caught fish.

19
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,020
And make spicy fish stew with that and make side dishes, too.

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,890
Sounds nice. I'm excited just thinking about it.

21
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,150
I make really great spicy fish stew.

22
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,530
You make the rice too.

23
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,790
I'll just give out consultations and hang out with them.

24
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,330
All right.

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,320
It's fascinating.

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,850
To obtain more than anyone else, to go further ahead,

27
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,520
go higher than anyone else.

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,490
I have lived determined to do so.

29
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,110
I can't believe I'm having these thoughts.

30
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,520
Should I turn on the radio?

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,350
I didn't doze off.

32
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,210
I was just thinking.

33
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,800
Got it.

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,470
Don't laugh.

35
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,960
Of course not.

36
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,500
 But, Chan, you shouldn't deceive someone you like for too long. 

37
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,720
- Father. 
 - Yeah?

38
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,320
When I said I'd move back home,

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,240
Noona, Chan, Legal Clinic team members...

40
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,920
You remember I asked that you not mess with any of them, right?

41
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,980
I'm your son, so I'm pretty patient.

42
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,660
But I'm also Mom's son, so I'm quite emotional as well.

43
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,310
If I feel like someone is messing with my people,

44
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,710
I just flip out, Father.

45
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,030
You take after me more.

46
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,790
Hyeong, you don't believe that Hong Seok Pal really committed suicide, do you?

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,990
Just eat. Stop spewing nonsense early in the morning.

48
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,940
Gosh, come on.

49
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,040
I know you're super curious, Hyeong.

50
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,000
- What is it you want to say? 
 - Don't mess with them, Father.

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,200
Is this the attitude of someone making a request?

52
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,590
It's not a request, though...

53
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,790
I'm your son, Father.

54
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,860
As much as you're doing, Father...

55
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,220
Perhaps I'm capable of doing more than that.

56
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,350
Now that you say I take after you more than Mom.

57
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,690
  Chairman Han Seong Beom 

58
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,740
Yes, what is it, Chairman?

59
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,850
Chairman Choi, I released a few articles. 
   Construction Information 

60
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,470
Yoon Se Pil, that slippery loach (mudfish)...

61
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,440
I think he'll make his move if I sprinkle some salt. 
 (T/N: You use salt to wash loach.) 

62
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,950
They're the ones who halted the process in the middle,

63
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,190
and they keep saying it was our fault for not cooperating.

64
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,600
They're playing that up in the press.

65
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,150
Those bastards must've thought that I'd sit back and watch.

66
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,300
 I've thought of denying them the preferred bidder status 
   

67
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,700
 but since Oh Su Jae will do her thing, I'm just waiting to see what happens. 

68
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,080
Seeing how she recommended Min Yeong Bae to Han Gi Taek's position,

69
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,860
it's a sign that Su Jae will make aggressive moves.

70
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,640
Well, there's one more pawn on our chess board.

71
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,310
It'll be interesting to wait and see what happens.

72
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,940
 Chairman Choi, 

73
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,140
 Do you know what's cute about Oh Su Jae? 
    

74
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,100
 She doesn't know that she's a pawn. 

75
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,970
 It's cute. That pawn. 
   

76
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,820
 That's the limit for pawns. 

77
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,840
Since we're talking about chess, it's a long time since we played.  Let's get together for a game.

78
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,880
Okay!

79
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,320
Cute. Wait...

80
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,190
What's that?

81
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,660
- Well... 
 - What's leaking over here?

82
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,310
We've had instances of underground water surfacing.

83
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,000
- I think we should have another thorough inspection... 
 - Damn it!

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,110
What inspection?

85
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,840
We've had some underground water and buried objects surfacing lately.

86
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,230
But they're not too serious, Chairman.

87
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,410
- They're pretty common. 
 - That's it, right?

88
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,870
Hey, Manager Park, sit.

89
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,350
Hey, man, you're good in everything else but you're not gutsy enough.

90
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,950
Be gutsier. Play it big.`

91
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,390
Okay, sir.

92
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,910
On a site this size, the water bursts and the ground collapses.

93
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,810
That's how things are out in the field. Isn't that right?

94
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,400
Yes, you're right, sir.

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,020
 According to Hansu Group officials, 
   

96
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,810
 Hansu Bio took on the management pressures 

97
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,730
 while eagerly cooperating in the inspection process. 
    

98
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,350
  But SP Partners single-handedly halted the acquisition process, 

99
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,090
 dragging out time. Hansu Group emphasized their extreme disappointment. 

100
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,620
 Also, Hansu Group expressed Hansu Bio's... 

101
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,990
Gather the Hansu Bio acquisition team. Now.

102
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,560
 Since the preferred bidder has been determined... 

103
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,230
Yes.

104
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,390
 This is Yoon Se Pil, Attorney Oh. 

105
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,090
Let's start working again today.

106
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,520
He's giving me a justification to do so.

107
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,110
I should respond with an appropriate reaction.

108
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,740
You know that Attorney Min Yeong Bae became Hansu Group's chief of Legal Affairs, right?

109
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,970
He'll attend the meeting as a Hansu employee.

110
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,020
Yes. Let's do that.

111
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,440
Is something the matter?

112
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,700
No, it's okay.

113
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,990
- Are you leaving now? 
 - Yes.

114
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,130
Well...

115
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,620
later tonight I'll see you on the rooftop.

116
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,190
Sure.

117
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,560
Shall we go?

118
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,270
Hey.

119
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,290
Professor, did you take care of your business?

120
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,630
I'm sorry. You couldn't even use your car because of me.

121
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,520
No worries. Did you eat?

122
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,440
- Eat before you go. 
 - It's okay.

123
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,690
I ate cup ramen on the beach with Professor Oh.

124
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,850
- Cup ramen? 
 - On the beach?

125
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,400
- Mushy, mushy, puffy, puffy. 
 - What are you saying?

126
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,800
Well, uh, I'm running late, so...

127
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,950
I have to go to school, too. See you.

128
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,620
Eating cup ramen on the beach, and your heart went mushy, mushy.

129
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,830
The cloud was puffy, puffy.

130
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,530
- The seagulls... 
 - Squawk.

131
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,240
- Squawk, squawk? 
 - What do you mean squawk?

132
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,490
- I'm off. 
 - Squawk...

133
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,150
Go.

134
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,960
I'm so jealous!

135
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,530
Gosh! So jealous!

136
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,930
Just think of it as going there temporarily.

137
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,500
Since Chairman Han says he's in a rush, I told him I'd lend you to him.

138
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,530
Look... you're my person.

139
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,870
Thank you, sir!

140
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,900
- Be sure to assist Chairman Han well. 
 - Yes.

141
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,570
- You'll be back here often anyway. 
 - Yes.

142
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,420
I'll see you around, okay?

143
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,950
Yes, Chairman.

144
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,230
"You're my person." I got chills!

145
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,490
- Hello, Chairman! 
 - Hey.

146
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,250
Goodness, our chief of Legal Affairs is still here.

147
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,010
Is Chairman Choi not letting you go?

148
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,840
No, sir. I just bid him goodbye and was on my way out.

149
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,230
And there's an acquisition-related meeting here today.

150
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,440
- Oh, is that so? 
 - Yes, sir. I'll report to you as soon as the meeting is over.

151
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,300
Okay, okay.

152
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,480
Professor Jeong, good work. You've done a lot all this time.

153
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm so happy for you.

154
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,770
By the way,

155
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,390
if this goes well, is our Professor Jeong

156
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,110
going to become the press secretary for the Blue House? 
  (T/N: Korean equivalent to US White House.) 

157
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,160
Gosh! Don't let me jump to conclusions!

158
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,440
The Blue House press secretary? My gosh!

159
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,760
I heard your husband switched positions, too.

160
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,170
I heard Professor Oh also referred him to that job, too.

161
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,680
That's what I mean.

162
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,660
Su Jae sure is considerate of my husband and me.

163
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,440
- She's a good person. 
 - What?

164
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,720
Sure, sure, sure.

165
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,470
It's a good friend if they benefit me.

166
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,550
- Right? 
 - Right on.

167
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,520
Let's drink.

168
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,120
All right, all right. Congratulations!

169
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,320
  Blue House Chief of Staff  

170
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,380
It's him. Chief of Staff.

171
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,770
What is it?

172
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,640
What about the director?

173
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,510
 Su Jae, you're the first person I'm telling this to. 

174
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,530
 Director Baek Jin Gi is with the Blue House Chief of Staff. 

175
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,580
 On 23rd, Minister of Justice Hwang Sang Gyu personally stated that he'll resign. /   
 

176
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,520
 He stated that he needs to contemplate more on issues involving the general election 

177
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,360
 and that it's a difficult issue. 

178
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
 But according to his close circle... 

179
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,960
- I'll see you soon. 
 - Yes.

180
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,700
 I told Director Baek Jin Gi that 

181
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,630
 it comes 100% from the President. 

182
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,440
Yes, I'm glad you did.

183
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,430
 For Director Baek, he's been bestowed with fortune in his later years, no? 

184
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,380
 Even if the administration is nearing its end, Minister of Justice? 

185
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,960
Even during the hearing,

186
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm sure nothing will come out. I guarantee it.

187
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,720
Yes, I understand.

188
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,310
So...

189
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,550
if Director Baek becomes the Minister of Justice,

190
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,140
let's get our Gi Taek released quickly.

191
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,190
Even dog poop is a rare commodity when you need it for medicine.

192
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,410
He's just that.

193
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,890
  Chariot to  Soldier   
 I know, right?

194
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,100
Anyway, he takes after his father.

195
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,790
Oh my, what an idiot.

196
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,930
After the acquisition is finalized,

197
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,460
I was going to make him vomit my money he stashed away

198
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,870
and cut him off for good.

199
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,860
How could he crawl into prison while helping Hong Seok Pal die?

200
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,430
  Horse &amp; Chariot   
 Geez, what the hell...

201
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,960
We'll have him released at an appropriate time

202
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,560
  Cannon   
 and have him wrap up the cruise issue.

203
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,390
Attorney Oh sent

204
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,760
Min Yeong Bae to me

205
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,700
and sent his wife to Assemblyman Lee.

206
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,980
Anyway, that girl is as sly as a fox.

207
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,760
She's just so cute when I look at her.

208
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,580
  Cannon   
 Hey, Chairman Choi,

209
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,390
you lost your Chariot and Cannon.

210
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,570
  Horse  

211
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,470
  Horse  

212
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,640
  Soldier  

213
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,050
The acquisition commission, 70 billion won.

214
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,310
We'll contribute some to Assemblyman Lee's campaign funds,

215
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,730
put some away in the Bahamas,

216
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,040
make up the loss for Hansu Construction,

217
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,030
and how much of it goes to you after all that?

218
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,620
Well, wouldn't it be around 25%?

219
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,050
Geez, you're the one with all the tricks

220
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,770
and you don't even take half of that. What do we do about that?

221
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,270
You should've moved your Horse

222
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,030
but you moved your Soldier.

223
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,220
You lost another one.

224
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,240
It was intended that way from the beginning

225
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,550
It's okay.

226
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,510
No, no.

227
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,560
You should have enough to take home, so you'll be even more motivated.

228
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,480
That can't be.

229
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,920
Even if I have to shake off my wallet,

230
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,750
  Elephant 

231
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,360
I'll give you half. So, Chairman Choi,

232
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,740
the clips of me out of the two that the scumbag Hong Seok Pal collected,

233
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,180
destroy them in front of me right now.

234
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,140
You know that it's safest for me to keep it, Chairman.

235
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,170
I know. I know that, but...

236
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,680
what if some rat steals and spreads it all over?

237
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,740
Remember a year ago?

238
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,870
Chairman Seong of Seongmyeong Group?

239
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,880
He was fooling around with women in a safe house

240
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,850
and got caught by a hidden camera. He was utterly humiliated.

241
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,350
Their stock prices crashed.

242
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,500
He ended up having to quit managing the company.

243
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,930
After seeing what he went through,

244
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,280
I put the safe houses in both Samjoong-dong and Hannam-dong up for sale.

245
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,200
There were no offers yet, and

246
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,260
I heard someone just showed

247
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,700
interest in purchasing them.

248
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,040
Anyway, Chairman Choi, as for me,

249
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,980
even if I have to die, I'll never stop running the company.

250
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,460
I'd rather die.

251
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,300
I'll never step down from my position.

252
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,980
I'll never.

253
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,410
Never.

254
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,960
  Chairman Han Seong Beom | Assemblyman Lee In Su 

255
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,200
You don't have to give me that money, Chairman.

256
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,560
Chairman Choi!

257
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,470
What would you like me to do for you?

258
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,130
Tell me anything.

259
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,960
I'll grant it.

260
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,660
I can trust you, right?

261
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,090
The situation has changed quite a bit since the beginning.

262
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,200
Poor management, which was revealed during the inspection,

263
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,750
the lawsuits by the subsidiaries,

264
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,710
unreasonable clinical trials during new pharmaceutical development,

265
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,830
and even criminal acts committed by Chief Han Gi Taek.

266
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,400
Now that these problems we were unaware of are exposed, we're quite anxious.

267
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,200
Have you ever seen corporations with

268
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,310
all these subsidiaries without such issues?

269
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,480
Poor management?

270
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,470
We all know the ways the SP Partners

271
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,630
have been hunting corporations to enlarge in size.

272
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,240
That's not going to work with us.

273
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,860
Now, now, let's take it down a notch.

274
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,620
The company taking over wants all the intel,

275
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,830
and the selling company won't oblige.

276
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,390
This is nothing new, right?

277
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,670
Let's give in a little bit and find a consensus.

278
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,860
Attorney Oh.

279
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:21,000
Indeed, SP Partners demanded unreasonable content as a prerequisite all this time.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,050
Verification of phase three of the clinical trials,

281
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,560
a partnership agreement with a German pharmaceutical company, Barc,

282
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,900
repayment of 50 billion won ($50 million) in convertible bonds,

283
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,190
and to reach 110,000 won ($110) per share in stock prices.

284
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,030
Hansu Bio did its best to meet the regulatory preconditions imposed by SP Partners.

285
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,280
- Do you acknowledge it? 
 - As for that...

286
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,920
If Hansu is showing that much effort,

287
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,910
you should reciprocate in order to have a beautiful give-and-take.

288
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,310
But all your demands are too urgent.

289
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,140
Please adjust your speed.

290
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,020
We were never urgent in our request.

291
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,630
You conducted one-sided interviews with Hansu Bio employees.

292
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,530
Under the guise of hearing general information about the company.

293
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,230
However, most were about putting out feelers for information close to being top secret.

294
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,190
Interviews of such a nature undermine the trust between the two companies.

295
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,590
Based on where you're coming from, I understand why you would feel that way.

296
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,170
- But from our perspective— 
 - That's what I mean!

297
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,440
The difference between the two company positions is becoming greater, and things are flaring up.

298
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,170
To better control the issues, we even have a new chief of legal affairs.

299
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,160
Yes, Chief Min Yeong Bae, thank you and we're counting on you.

300
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,670
Yes.

301
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,990
You say our demands are unreasonable.

302
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,580
Soaring debt ever since we were decided as the preferred bidder

303
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,950
and additional loans taken out without the buyer's agreement.

304
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,290
Some dubious issues are present.

305
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,090
I'm also nervous about issues surrounding the new medicine.

306
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,070
What is so dubious and making you nervous?

307
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,560
By continuing to pick out flaws,

308
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,370
aren't you trying to come up with reasons to get out of it?

309
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,200
Managing Director Han, please talk to me in private.

310
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,250
- I mean, right now... 
 - Director Han.

311
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,910
Everyone knows Director Han Dong Oh is hot-tempered.

312
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,510
Please filter what's necessary.

313
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,410
We'll eagerly cooperate in the second inspection.

314
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,100
Please complete it in two weeks.

315
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,740
Two weeks is too short.

316
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,380
We added "eagerly cooperate" in our condition. Please agree to that.

317
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,020
What do you think?

318
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,230
Let's do that.

319
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,640
Except "eagerly cooperate"...

320
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,650
You must keep your word.

321
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,560
Yoon Se Pil, that know-it-all punk.

322
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,390
So what if he's buying Hansu Bio?

323
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,970
Just because he's buying it,

324
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,630
how dare he discuss great Hansu Group's management system and all?

325
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,210
Hey, don't get worked up in a meeting like that.

326
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,630
No need to give him reason to find fault.

327
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,030
KG Airlines was uncooperative in the inspection and the acquisition fell through.

328
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,340
You saw how the entire conglomerate was shaken in the end.

329
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,270
Hansu Bio should watch out, too.

330
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,540
- If not— 
 - Hey, Choi Ju Wan.

331
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,230
I'll raise your commission on the sale.

332
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,760
I'll make sure you get 300 million won more.

333
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,500
No, no.

334
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,860
Even if I have to spend my own money,

335
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,080
I'll add about 500 million won more.

336
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,060
So, what I'm saying is...

337
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,870
just shut up and listen.

338
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,070
You just listen and side with me.

339
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,760
That's your job.

340
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,600
I'll give you the money for doing just that!

341
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,390
Let's not raise our voices.

342
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,180
This isn't Hansu Group.

343
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,690
It's TK Law Firm.

344
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,170
TK?

345
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,620
Hey.

346
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,010
Did TK Law Firm fall out of the sky?

347
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,030
If it weren't for my father, there'd be no TK!

348
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,690
Damn it!

349
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,120
What's that?

350
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,290
  It's their eighth year delivering briquettes. 
   

351
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,210
How ridiculous. 
    

352
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,170
 Executive Director Lee Shi Hyeok, the son of candidate Lee In Su 

353
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,100
 - delivered 1900 briquettes for residents who live on  
 - How lame...

354
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,390
 streets where it's tough for the trucks get around,  

355
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,580
 showing in action how to love your neighbors. 

356
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,350
Hey, stop it already with the briquette show.

357
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,900
I'm cracking up here, you crazy punk.

358
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,680
I got it, man.

359
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,450
I'm with Ju Wan right now.

360
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,850
Come out. I'll buy you drinks.

361
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,950
You two go. I'm not going to drink.

362
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,940
Yeah, Ju Wan says he's coming, too.

363
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,220
I'm trying to purchase Chairman Han Seong Beom's safe house in Samjoong-dong.

364
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,260
What do you think about that, Attorney Oh?

365
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,140
I'm not a real estate expert.

366
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,960
It's been empty for about ten years.

367
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,680
I heard it's been on the market for a little over a year.

368
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,610
Because it's so large, in size and price, it wasn't selling.

369
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,780
I found out by accident. It would've been nice if I had known sooner.

370
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,970
Why are you interested in that house?

371
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,620
Well, you know how it is at times.

372
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,040
You see something you want for no reason.

373
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,800
- You figure it doesn't matter how much that would cost. 
 - And?

374
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,750
For some reason, I think it would come in handy someday if I purchased it.

375
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,500
I don't think you're looking for advice but giving me information.

376
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,150
"I'm buying that house. It'll be useful."

377
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,140
I've made my decision, thanks to you.

378
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,420
It's the best location in Samjoong-dong.

379
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,830
Chairman is very interested in feng shui.

380
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,740
He said he prospered greatly after building this house.

381
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,270
It was built 27 years ago.

382
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,410
About 9 or 10 years ago, I heard he remodeled it extensively.

383
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,420
Even though it's been empty for quite some time, it's been maintained well.

384
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,400
- Please come this way. 
 - Okay.

385
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,340
Chairman Han's Samjoong-dong house?

386
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,650
Find out quietly. I think there's a reason.

387
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,510
By chance...

388
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,200
do you think CEO Yoon...

389
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,510
likes you, Attorney Oh?

390
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,370
- What? 
 - You know, men do this sometimes.

391
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,570
My friend said her husband suddenly started showing her apartments while they were dating

392
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,910
and said he'd buy it and appealed to her and proposed to—

393
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,800
Never mind.

394
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,660
Find out the connection with that house, Chairman Han, and CEO Yoon.

395
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,170
There has to be something, even if it's small. Find out.

396
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,580
I bought this house.

397
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,510
Stop!

398
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,580
I'll find it.

399
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,770
I'll tear up the wallpapers, remove the floors,

400
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:10,240
search between each and every tile. I'm sure it's still there somewhere.

401
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,470
 When are you coming home? 

402
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,210
 Arriving soon. 

403
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,400
Hyeong. Noona isn't here?

404
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,570
I'm home.

405
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,780
You're here, right?

406
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,050
What's this?

407
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,760
- Why is this... 
 - I told you

408
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,410
to be careful because Chan is on Father's radar.

409
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,540
But you ignored what I said and are staying here, Noona.

410
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,090
So, are you saying Chairman hired someone to take these photos?

411
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,520
Then why do you have them?

412
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,930
Because I took them.

413
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,470
 - Hand over your camera. 
 - Wh-What? 

414
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,630
 I'll give you three times the amount promised to you. 

415
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,490
 Hand it over to me. 

416
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,510
What's the big deal about getting a few of these photos taken?

417
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,330
Why did you go around unnecessarily like that?

418
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,010
Unnecessarily?

419
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,240
This is where it stops. I came here to say that.

420
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,990
I'll live as my father's son from now on.

421
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,030
First, I'm studying the sale of Hansu Bio.

422
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,470
I reviewed the contract, and it was unbelievable.

423
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,370
How did you ever reach that deal?

424
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,610
Tell your father this.

425
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,240
- If he does this again— 
 - What will you do about it?

426
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,930
Do you think you could do anything?

427
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,760
It's my father you're going up against.

428
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,550
Fine.

429
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,600
Protect Noona as best as you can.

430
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,370
But you'll have put in more effort than my very best.

431
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,500
You're weaker than I am.

432
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,700
No, Hyeong.

433
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,980
You have too many things getting in the way, so

434
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,800
you stop right here, but not me.

435
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,830
I'll put everything on the line to protect her.

436
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,050
So, have a nice life as Chairman Choi Tae Gook's son.

437
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,970
  Inspector General —&gt; TK Law Firm Chairman 

438
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,810
 TK Law Firm 

439
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,750
Why aren't you asleep? It's late.

440
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,960
I can't believe the things you go through because of me.

441
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,110
I'm sorry.

442
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,640
I'm sorry, too.

443
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,980
No...

444
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,950
I'm more sorry than you.

445
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,990
Why?

446
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,360
For now, let's get some sleep.

447
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,760
Let's stop being sorry.

448
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,240
 Soong Hwa Elementary School. 
 1st Grader - Kim Ji Ah 

449
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,380
  Children's Art Class with Mimesis 

450
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,180
Jae Yi grew so much!

451
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,890
Father, will you give me Jae Yi?

452
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:14,530
Having a dad who's like garbage on the streets would be so sad for Jae Yi.

453
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,630
Just give her to me.

454
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,050
Both child custody and parental rights.

455
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,310
You'd say you want them, then suddenly you say you don't need the kid.

456
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,950
Then you want us to grant you another condition.

457
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,850
Now, you just want us to give you the child?

458
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,170
Is it that light of an issue for you to be so fickle?

459
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:41,330
Father, I lived like that for eight years.

460
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,550
At the whim of Ju Wan and you, Father.

461
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,240
So why are you getting so mad with just this one time?

462
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,030
If you want to get the divorce you desire, tell me what you gave to Su Jae.

463
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,090
If you want to know what that is, Father,

464
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,940
tell me who Jae Yi's birth mother is.

465
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,970
Why do you want to know that now?

466
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,080
What's the use of finding out something like that now?

467
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,970
That something...

468
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,500
tormented me nonstop for eight years.

469
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,490
I want to make sure.

470
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,620
 Not "find out" but "make sure." 

471
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,890
There isn't much going on with Attorney Oh and that student Gong Chan.

472
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,690
I'll continue to check on them.

473
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,380
Okay.

474
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,190
Let's go to Seojoong University Law School.

475
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,090
Yes, got it.

476
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,030
Yes, it's me, Seonbaenim.

477
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,700
I never imagined that I'd be in a position like that.

478
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,960
All the more reason you should take it.

479
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,990
Not like Minister Hwang who left

480
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,750
his post suddenly to run in the general election, but

481
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,970
someone like you, who defended the law all your life

482
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,510
with uprightness and integrity should take the position.

483
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,350
Geez, although it seems this came to you a little late in life.

484
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,240
You should've gone there sooner.

485
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,090
My goodness. Your compliments are over the top.

486
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,690
I don't know what to say, Chairman Choi.

487
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:15,710
I'll help so your hearing goes through without a hitch, Seonbaenim.

488
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,340
Gosh, this is hopeless.

489
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,000
I'll get going now.

490
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,090
I'll call you, Seonbaenim.

491
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,790
I'll call you.

492
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,440
 Where is it? 

493
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,710
- Where is it? 
 - Are you looking for something?

494
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,640
Yes, we're looking for... what was it, legal?

495
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,510
We're looking for some center.

496
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,730
I think it was some clinic or something...

497
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,160
Legal Clinic Center?

498
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,560
- Yes! 
 - Yes, that's right!

499
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,400
Hello, Director.

500
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,300
Here's the perfect person for that.

501
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,840
You can follow this student.

502
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,740
They came looking for the legal clinic center.

503
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,890
I see. You can come with me.

504
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,730
 - Thank you!  
 - Bye now.

505
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,250
Professor comes in today, too. You came on a perfect day.

506
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,160
- You can do this way. 
 - Thank you.

507
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,610
These ladies were scammed.

508
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,470
Oh, my! This cosmetic company is such scum.

509
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,060
- That way. 
 - Have a seat here.

510
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,850
Oh, my...

511
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,180
Soon Ok has poor vision.

512
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,540
Really?

513
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,840
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

514
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,150
I hope you weren't uncomfortable because of me.

515
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,670
Not at all.

516
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,530
I came here comfortably thanks to your help.

517
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,870
She recognizes shapes.

518
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,960
She knows whether it's a person or a car.

519
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,980
Right, Soon Ok?

520
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,620
It was hard to get here, right?

521
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,950
Drink this and take your time telling us what happened.

522
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,440
We're coworkers working in the same factory.

523
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,590
- Yes. 
 - One day, a cosmetics company

524
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,100
called us saying they were giving out samples, so we said, sure.

525
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,220
When they arrived, there were a bunch of things.

526
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,430
Well, everyone was so excited.

527
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,280
But then they started asking for money.

528
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,790
And 700,000 won ($700) at that!

529
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,220
If you write down your personal information, we'll help you.

530
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,670
I heard Professor Jeong Hui Yeong is quitting.

531
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,390
Really? We have guests.

532
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,790
People seeking legal consultation?

533
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,240
Yeah. I bumped into them, so we came in together.

534
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,660
Hello. Please relax as you tell us what happened.

535
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,350
Kim Dong Gu?

536
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,010
Kim Dong Gu.

537
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,730
Right?

538
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,400
Kim Dong Gu?

539
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,600
Who's Kim Dong Gu?

540
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,360
It's Dong Gu.

541
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,580
Kim Dong Gu!

542
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,300
- No... 
 - N-No.

543
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,390
His name is Gong Chan. Gong Chan.

544
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,470
She can't see very well.

545
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,980
I think she just heard your voice and is mistaken.

546
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,630
Kim Dong Gu!

547
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,030
They say he's not.

548
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,820
He's not Kim Dong Gu.

549
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,900
Kim...

550
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,180
Dong Gu!

551
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,870
- Ma'am! It's not him! 
 - Kim Dong Gu!

552
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,160
No! No!

553
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,870
Wait a minute! Ma'am, calm down!

554
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,880
- Kim Dong Gu! 
 - Get out. Hurry!

555
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,670
Wait a minute! Please calm down!

556
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,510
Kim Dong Gu!

557
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,070
Where are you, Kim Dong Gu?

558
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,540
- Please calm down! 
 - Calm down!

559
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,790
  A collapse in Yeongpyeong District construction site 

560
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:31,470
 Kim Dong Gu! 

561
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,750
 She can't see very well. 

562
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,520
 I think she just heard your voice and is mistaken. 

563
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,360
Her eyes...

564
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,240
That's why she did that then.

565
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,360
How come...

566
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,310
How come...

567
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,510
How come she can't even see now? How come?

568
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,860
 Ma'am, are you okay? 

569
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,040
 I can't really take you all the way there. 

570
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,590
 Please look out for her. 

571
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,580
Yes. Bye now!

572
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,820
Goodbye.

573
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,730
- Oh, my. 
 - Oh, my.

574
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,520
 My gosh. Oh, no... 

575
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,550
 Oh, my... 

576
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,630
Yeah?

577
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,790
 It's crazy, Su Jae! 

578
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,840
 - There's been a collapse in Yeongpyeong District!  
 - What?

579
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,000
 President Kim of Hansu Construction is bawling and everything. It's crazy! 

580
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,510
Go to the field right now. And...

581
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,550
Why would I go there now?

582
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,590
You should go and figure out what's going on there—

583
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,760
What are you talking about?

584
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,900
If problems arise from this, the Hansu Bio acquisition will be directly affected.

585
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,240
You have to be there!

586
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,400
Hurry up and come. Got it?

587
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,770
Excuse me.

588
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,240
Yes, Chairman.

589
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,600
Hey.

590
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,560
Please, hurry and handle the accident in Yeongpyeong District

591
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,300
so that it won't affect the acquisition.

592
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,520
Yes, will do.

593
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,560
I have something to say.

594
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,180
In Yeongpyeong District...

595
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,580
No. Something urgent came up. I have to go.

596
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,560
Five minutes will do.

597
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,380
No, three minutes.

598
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,070
  Song Mi Rim 

599
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,980
I'm sorry. Let's talk at home later.

600
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,770
I heard.

601
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,460
I'm on my way to the site.

602
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,870
Brief me on my way over.

603
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,400
  They planned on developing reclaimed land and supporting 8,000 households /   

604
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,550
  as well as building a smart tourist destination by securing foreign capital. /    

605
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:49,100
 There's been a soil collapse at a Yeongpyeong District site that had had a fantastic beginning. /   

606
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,380
My apologies, Chairman.

607
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,820
Why are you telling me that now, you bastard!

608
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,240
You should've known better! Why cause people do die!

609
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,480
I told you to make sure it's safe! Safety!

610
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,430
I'm sorry...

611
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,210
 Along with heavy equipment and civil engineering frame structures, 

612
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,130
 it's been confirmed that nine workers are buried underneath. 

613
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,620
- How are you handling the press! 
  - Six out of nine workers were rescued 

614
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,000
 and were transferred to the nearby hospital. 

615
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,590
- What are you doing? What! 
  - As for the remaining three workers... 

616
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:18,640
Why don't you say Yeongpyeong District and Lee In Su have nothing to do with each other!

617
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,500
What the hell are you doing! Wake up!

618
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,540
 The high volume of obstacles in the way 

619
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,790
 and the use of coal ash waste to plug up the mud flat while constructing the reclaimed land, 

620
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,530
  are making the rescue efforts difficult. 

621
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,400
 The authorities convey that they're trying to locate the three remaining workers 

622
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,590
 and are doing their best to locate the missing. 

623
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:43,070
Some say underground water burst through several times since the construction began

624
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,120
and that small sinkholes occurred several times.

625
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,760
But there are no precise facts yet.

626
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,870
Anything on the buried workers?

627
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,510
Most of them are subcontractors.

628
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,590
They could be sub-tier contractors.

629
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,650
I came across an article saying they pushed construction schedules excessively.

630
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,400
  Breaking news: Yeongpyeong District collapse, rescued one worker, unconscious 

631
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,760
What do we do, Attorney Oh?

632
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,880
They just rescued another worker, but he's unconscious.

633
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,440
I understand.

634
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,010
  Ungju Free Economic Zone, Yeongpyeong District Site Construction 

635
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,860
  Yeongpyeong District Rescue Command Station 

636
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,440
 Open! Open the door! 

637
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,200
 Come out and beg for forgiveness! 

638
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,670
 Please save my husband! 

639
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,490
 Come out and apologize! 

640
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,260
  Yeongpyeong District Rescue Command Station 

641
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,480
This is the site of the collapse.

642
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,670
The early part of the collapse was not that large.

643
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,240
As the soil continued to collapse around the initial area—

644
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,270
Besides the container that's buried,

645
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:51,130
civil engineering frame structures collapsed with it.

646
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,650
So, there are lots of obstacles.

647
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,930
What is the golden time for the remaining two workers?

648
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,500
Maximum 72 hours, but

649
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,030
if they were injured while the container and frame structures collapsed...

650
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,780
Anyway, as fast as possible,

651
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,660
we need as much equipment and manpower as possible for the rescue efforts.

652
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,870
Yes. Chairman also said to do everything we can.

653
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,190
All right then.

654
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,500
Underground water seepage kept occurring lately

655
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,620
and soils surrounding the area kept collapsing.

656
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,320
When they formed this land, I'm sure they used that coal ash waste.

657
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,700
I think they used too much of it.

658
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,690
I felt like that was going to cause problems from the get-go.

659
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,750
Are you going to say that in front of the reporters, too?

660
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,500
Are the buried workers subcontractors?

661
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,590
I think some are subcontractors and also sub-tier contractors.

662
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,020
What are you talking about?

663
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,300
You mean, you don't even know who's buried?

664
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,300
Go out and figure that out first.

665
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,870
Yes sir.

666
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,100
They should've never invested in construction in the first place.

667
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,940
Why did they buy Daeseong Construction to begin with?

668
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:53,060
There seem to have been quite a few incidents of soil collapsing and groundwater seepage lately.

669
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,690
Let's quickly figure out what could be problematic first.

670
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,250
I'm sure the press will start attacking.

671
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,500
Geez! Can't believe an accident like this happened as soon as I joined the company.

672
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,200
I'm totally stepping into a load of crap. So stinking crappy.

673
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,150
They must've found them!

674
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,580
 At the Yeongpyeong District construction site with two missing workers due to a collapse, 

675
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:15,400
 a worker in his 60s, Kim, was found seven hours after the accident and transferred to the hospital. 
   

676
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,350
 Kim, who was unconscious at the time of the discovery 
   

677
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:23,120
 was rescued below the civil engineering equipment... 

678
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,130
Did you work overtime?

679
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,740
How come you work so late?

680
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,940
Did you eat dinner?

681
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,940
Have a late-night snack. I'll make it quick.

682
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,300
No, it's okay.

683
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,930
But where is Gong Chan...

684
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:37,290
Not home yet. He'll be home soon, though.

685
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,330
Okay.

686
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,380
- I'll go on ahead. 
 - Okay.

687
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,060
Good night.

688
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,530
 In order to bring them out before the collapse... 

689
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,050
 Reaching 24 hours of rescue efforts for Yeongpyeong District... 
    

690
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,650
 - they are still digging out soil...  
 - A 19-year-old.

691
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:59,610
 - but due to piled debris, the rescue is difficult.  
 - His poor mom and dad.

692
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,330
 I'm sending you buried workers' personal information. 

693
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,940
 And her son is so kind. 

694
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,900
 He said he's working at a construction site. 

695
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,720
 He said he'll work hard and pay our legal fees.  

696
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:34,200
Oh, no. They look alike.

697
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,040
What an amazing menu this is.

698
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,100
They're serving me porridge as if to say "make porridge" (get screwed, ruined, destroyed) because of the accident. Shit...

699
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,870
Hey! The punk who made this porridge! Fire him now!

700
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,070
I'm sorry, Chairman.

701
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,330
We tried to prepare a dish that's easy on your stomach. We didn't think it through.

702
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,330
Stop it before I slap you upside the head.

703
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,980
- Hurry up and get rid of it. 
 - Yes, sir.

704
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,710
They're clueless...

705
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,160
How do you think it'll turn out?

706
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,060
Well, it's not that great, but he's not a Hansu Construction employee

707
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,650
and he's not even a subcontractor. I'm relieved.

708
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,490
People were trashing us for hiring sub-tier contractors from subcontractors.

709
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,610
Just receive criticism and avoid liability. Then that's it.

710
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,040
- Su Jae will take care of it. 
 - Right?

711
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,960
Hey! Bring back that porridge.

712
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,170
- It did taste good. 
 - Yes, Chairman.

713
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,120
Assemblyman Lee!

714
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,090
Bring us one more bowl of porridge.

715
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,610
 Collapsed Yeongpyeong District, Assemblyman Lee In Su's local business 

716
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,030
What's this?

717
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,900
Why did you cause the accident and have it affect me?

718
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,740
Cause the accident?

719
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,640
I know the two of you are hard at work

720
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,230
and you're trying to support me with Yeongpyeong District business.

721
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:02,130
But officially, I'll say I have nothing to do with this business.

722
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:04,370
I'll make that announcement.

723
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,600
Enjoy your porridge.

724
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,110
Assemblyman Lee!

725
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,370
Officially, it has nothing to do with him?

726
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,550
Hey! Get rid of the porridge!

727
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,790
Looks like I'll throw my porridge to the dogs. 
  (T/N: Idiom for tossing out his hard work out the window.) 

728
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,760
Geez, is that guy crazy?

729
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,680
I'm totally baffled.

730
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,890
We're in the middle of the election season.

731
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,410
He must be losing it with his approval rating stuck in the box.

732
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,920
Even if you want to scold him, do it later.

733
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,520
Do it after we get him elected.

734
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,680
Okay, okay.

735
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,780
So look for another chance, right?

736
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,880
- Yes. 
 - Got it, got it.

737
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,910
Yeah.

738
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,550
Tell me.

739
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,510
What?

740
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,060
- Turn on the TV. 
 - Yes, sir.

741
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,530
 Around 6:35 pm on the 7th, 

742
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:59,100
 the driver who disappeared after running into two vehicles while driving a sports car 
   

743
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,710
 worth 500 million won in the middle of Gangnam 
   

744
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,880
 has been identified as Managing Director Han Dong Oh of Hansu Group. 
   

745
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,690
 Based on footage from a citizen informant, 

746
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,660
 even after causing the accident, Director Han continued to... 

747
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,890
Where is that bastard Dong Oh!

748
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,480
No, Father. I didn't go there.

749
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,260
They got together for Si Hyeok.

750
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,800
I'm sure Si Hyeok went.

751
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,710
  Driver of Gangnam sports car accident turns out to be Director Han Dong Oh of Hansu Group 

752
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,910
But this isn't good for the acquisition.

753
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:29,870
Check up on SP Partners

754
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,620
and check up on the inspection team that went into Hansu Group.

755
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,440
Yes, sir.

756
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,690
Crazy bastard.

757
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,420
You need to come to your senses, punk. 
   Driver of Gangnam sports car accident turns out to be Director Han Dong Oh of Hansu Group  

758
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,480
It'll definitely be a risk factor for the acquisition.

759
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,330
 That's why we should stop it. Leave Dong Oh's case to someone else. 

760
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,330
Tell her to get Dong Oh out right away!

761
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,830
Focus on wrapping up Yeongpyeong District without any noise.

762
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,590
Yes, sir.

763
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,990
  CEO Yoon Se Pil 

764
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,640
 Han Dong Oh is riskier than Yeongpyeong District. 

765
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,110
 I hear Lee Si Hyeok was also at that drinking party. 

766
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,880
   
 Please keep that in mind. 

767
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,320
- Yeah? 
 - Su Jae.

768
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,230
Assemblyman Lee would like to visit the Yeongpyeong District site

769
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:14,540
to encourage the rescue team and console families of buried workers.

770
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,260
It's his local area.

771
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,780
That's not urgent right now.

772
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,500
You know that Director Han Dong Oh of Hansu Group got himself in trouble, right?

773
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,660
I heard Lee Si Hyeok was also with him.

774
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,890
- Look into that. 
 - What?

775
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,000
That crazy psycho!

776
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,560
Hold off going to the site for now. I'll hang up.

777
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:39,500
  Correctional Facility 

778
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:48,460
- It's him, huh? 
 - Oh Su Jeong...

779
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,760
She cried so much and couldn't even speak well.

780
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,700
She bore and raised him by herself.

781
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,660
That's why he took after his mom's surname and his name is Oh Pil Seung.

782
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,060
What should we do?

783
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,290
How about her request for temporary leave?

784
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:07,240
I did, but the evaluation is next week. 
   Temporary leave: A legal exception allowing a person with certain circumstances to leave for a pre-defined period of time. 

785
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,170
As for special temporary leave, it's not like he's been rescued.

786
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,860
They say it's only possible if he's dead.

787
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,370
Gosh, what nonsense.

788
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,660
They still haven't found Oh Pil Seung? 
   Yeongpyeong District Rescue Command Station 

789
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,040
They think he's stuck underneath the container.

790
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,980
He could get hurt even worse during the container removal process.

791
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,480
So we're doing our best to lift it cautiously.

792
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,860
It will take some time as well.

793
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,950
If 13 hours have passed,

794
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,350
the golden time or situations like that...

795
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:46,200
Realistically speaking, it's not looking good.

796
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,360
But you never know.

797
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,530
- When I think of rescues in the past— 
  - I found him! 

798
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,660
- You found him? 
  - We found him! 

799
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,380
- Did you find Oh Pil Seung? 
  - We found him! 

800
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,680
 - We found him! 
 - Bring a stretcher! 

801
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,300
Oh Pil Seung?

802
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,540
Oh Pil Seung?

803
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,100
Can you hear me?

804
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,590
Bring a stretcher! A stretcher!

805
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,060
You could injure him more so do it slowly.

806
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,960
Request special temporary leave for Oh Su Jeong. Hurry!

807
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,660
- Tell them it's an emergency. 
 - Okay.

808
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,010
Over here.

809
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,740
What's this?

810
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,450
Wait, Captain!

811
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,000
- Captain! 
 - Captain!

812
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,580
Why? What's going on?

813
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,260
This...

814
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,760
I looked into it and learned that there are lots of scams like that lately.

815
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,100
They say they'll give you samples, so for you to give them your address.

816
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,950
And the ajummas don't know anything.

817
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:04,340
They think, "They must be giving out samples!" and give out their addresses right away.

818
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,140
But when they receive it, the sample box is huge.

819
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,030
They send regular products along with the samples.

820
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,680
Regular products? Why?

821
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,760
As if they made a mistake.

822
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,350
Then ajummas say, "Whoa!  The samples are this good?" And they keep using them.

823
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,240
Gosh, those scumbags.

824
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,710
They send ajummas regular products and if they use them,

825
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,680
- they ask for money? 
 - Bingo!

826
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,170
So why aren't the police worried about this at all?

827
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,270
As for the police, they don't want the hassle and going through the trouble of proving them illegal.

828
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:32,370
And it's not like the company employees will testify.

829
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,110
To infiltrate the company—

830
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,640
- The loss is too small? 
 - Yeah.

831
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,310
Chan, you know that ajumma who called you Kim Dong Gu?

832
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,920
She can't even see well, and she lost the money working in the factory.

833
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,710
Let's take care of this case for her.

834
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,940
- Okay. 
 - Great! Sounds good.

835
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,870
What should we do first?

836
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,920
First, we should pretend to receive sponsorship on the makeup

837
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,520
and go to that den of fraudsters.

838
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,720
Sponsorship?

839
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,210
I have 32,000 followers on Instagram.

840
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,000
- Why? 
 - Come on now.

841
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,040
  Makeup sample   
 I used to be a former idol. My stage name was Taepoong.

842
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,860
I still have loyal fans.

843
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:10,190
My fans still call me Baby Taepoong. Baby Taepoong. 
  Human remains found at Yeongpyeong District accident site  

844
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,570
Baby Taepoong!

845
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,680
I'm going to tell this to Attorney Song.

846
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,950
Please accept Baby Taepoong's feelings.

847
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,810
Hey! You'd better stop!

848
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:23,300
Hey, what the heck? Are you leaving? Ignoring Baby Taepoong?

849
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:30,650
  Human remains found at Yeongpyeong District accident site 

850
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,130
 - Congratulations. 
 - Thank you. 

851
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,590
 Ta-da! 

852
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,870
 I made this since it's your birthday, Mom. 

853
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,670
 Really? 

854
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,800
 - For you, Mom. 
 - So pretty! 

855
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,000
 For Dad. 

856
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,330
 And for you, Oppa. 

857
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,670
 It's pretty. Thank you. 

858
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,680
 Thank you! 

859
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,510
 Put this all away! 

860
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,550
 Stop! 

861
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,370
I came to get it, so wait, Seonbae.

862
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:45,020
So why are Yeongpyeong District-related files with you?

863
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,650
You should've turned them over to me from the get-go.

864
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,980
It was confidential, and I was the one in charge.

865
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,810
I'm hanging up.

866
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,790
Here it is. I found it.

867
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,630
  Regarding Special Law on Yeongpyeong District 

868
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,190
Professor!

869
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,310
Chan?

870
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,640
Hello.

871
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,410
- Hello. 
 - You haven't had lunch, right?

872
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,450
- Yeah. 
 - Eat lunch before you go.

873
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,590
I thought Chan was home earlier, too.

874
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,060
Chan!

875
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,330
Chan!

876
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,030
Geez, is he on the rooftop?

877
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,830
I'll bring him down.

878
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,360
- Go down. 
 - Okay.

879
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,410
Gong Chan! Are you in here?

880
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,110
 Jeon Na Jeong, September 4, 2012, 17 years old at the time of the incident 

881
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,110
  Evidence possibly fabricated 

882
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,080
  Na Jeong's blood, my DNA 

883
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,350
  The day of release... 

884
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:41,620
  TK Law Firm Chairman 

885
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,340
  The public defender who solely believed me, Oh Su Jae 

886
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,780
  The public defender who solely believed me 

887
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:16,520
  Gong Chan 

888
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:30,240
 Kim Dong Gu? 

889
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,990
  A male teenager arrested for raping, killing, and abandoning the body of his stepsister  

890
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:37,360
 Kim Dong Gu 
 A male teenager arrested for raping, killing, and abandoning the body of his stepsister  

891
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,780
 Chan was Kim Dong Gu  

892
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,300
  Why Her? 

893
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:59,520


894
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,890
 I told you to tell the Professor that you're Kim Dong Gu! 

895
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,780
 You've had enough of that incident ruining your life. 

896
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,960
 Don't tell anyone that you're Kim Dong Gu. 

897
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,020
 Chairman ordered that I should assist you well. 

898
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,910
 I am Kim Dong Gu, Ajumma. 

899
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:27,080
 No, my Na Jeong is alive. 

900
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,150
 The remains found in the Yeongpyeong District are my younger sister Jeon Na Jeong! 

901
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,680
 Hurry up and go! 

902
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,290
 Hurry up and take care of the Hansu Bio acquisition and marry Ju Wan. 

903
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,480
 Don't say anything to me. 

904
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,350
 She knows who I am. 

905
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:42,220
 She knows.
