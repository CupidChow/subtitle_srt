 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,590
 Jae Yi is your daughter, Su Jae. 

3
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,690
 I've got a lot on my mind right now, 

4
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,690
 so let's talk about Jae Yi some other time— 

5
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,690
 How could you not know? 

6
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,220
 Your own daughter? 

7
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,650
 As the CEO of TK Law Firm, 

8
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,560
 I'm going to raise Jae Yi well as my child. 

9
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,570
 Jae Yi disappeared. Jae Yi. 

10
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,440
 I told Jae Yi that I'm going to the U.S. alone 

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,300
 and that she's going to live with her father. 

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,010
 I found Jae Yi. 

13
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,940
 A gift for you. 

14
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,230
 Thank you. 

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,660
 Jae Yi! 

16
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,610
 - No! 
 - Jae Yi! 

17
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,310
 No! 

18
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,510
 It felt like a dream. 

19
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,090
 The day I embraced you in my arms. 

20
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,180
 If this is a dream 

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,450
 let it never end. 

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,550
 In that dream, 

23
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,910
 I had so many things 

24
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,060
 that I wanted to do with you. 

25
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:12,480


26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,900
 Episode 15  
 Jae Yi died because of Su Jae, Father.

27
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,150
If only Su Jae had been holding onto Jae Yi.

28
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,530
If only she hadn't gone digging here and there, Jae Yi wouldn't have died.

29
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,400
Be calm?

30
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,920
Father, Jae Yi died.

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,290
She was alive just a few hours ago.

32
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,340
Now, she's dead all of a sudden.

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,790
In front of my eyes, ridiculously...

34
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,670
You want me to be calm?

35
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,800
Father, how can you?

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,940
How can you...

37
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,210
 She was holding onto the dead child in the operation room and wouldn't come out. 

38
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,490
 I'm sure she's Attorney Oh. 

39
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,920
The Director told us to keep our mouths shut.

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,620
The parents are outside, but Attorney Oh isn't coming out of there.

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm on my way,

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,750
so I'll call when I get there.

43
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,490
Restricted to Unauthorized Personnel

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,410
I apologize, Chairman.

45
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,260
We also have our surgery schedules.

46
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,260
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,380
One moment, please.

48
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,070
Please. Let me go.

49
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,230
Let me go!

50
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,410
Professor. Professor!

51
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,120
Let Go!

52
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,480
 Mom. 

53
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,460
 Jae Yi. 

54
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,300
 ER Visitor Restrictions  
 She has ventricular tachycardia and unstable blood pressure.

55
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,570
Even if she had arrhythmia already, her condition is bad.

56
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,370
I recommend that she stays in the hospital for a few days

57
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,540
for necessary tests and EKG monitoring.

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,070
Jae Yi... was Noona's daughter.

59
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,600
She had just met her daughter, whom she thought was dead.

60
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,810
 Fingerprint Report 

61
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,970
 Analysis Results: Fingerprint A on water bottle, Fingerprint B on pen, and beverage can fingerprint C 

62
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,320
 Analysis Results: Fingerprints A, B, and C do not match fingerprint D 

63
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,850
 The results said that none of the fingerprints match. 

64
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,160
 Please contact me when you see this. 

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,500
Professor.

66
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,620
Why do you do this?

67
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,140
Things are going to get worse if you keep this up.

68
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,280
Lie down first, okay?

69
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,150
I have to go.

70
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,540
Please let me go, Joon Hui.

71
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,420
 Seojung University Hospital 

72
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,380
Hansu Group Chairman, May you easily enter Nirvana, Presidential Secretary for Personnel Affairs

73
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:56,240
I talked to... Attorney Seo Joon Myeong regarding the hidden camera incident.

74
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,840
When the girls

75
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,670
start speaking out, it'll be a headache he said.

76
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,990
This crazy fucker.

77
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,360
- Geez. 
 - Are the approval ratings out?

78
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,620
Yes.

79
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,620
They fell seven percent because of the Yeongpyeong District benefits suspicions.

80
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,420
Fuck.

81
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,820
Did I collect my daughter's 4 billion won special bonus?

82
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,560
My mother-in-law's three apartments.

83
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,170
Are they mine or something?

84
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,670
It's the same as yours.

85
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,560
That 4 billion won was given to be used for your campaign.

86
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,840
The apartments were to be used for the same purpose.

87
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,190
Hey. Did we ask for it?

88
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,030
Why change the story when they were given voluntarily?

89
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,470
Change the story?

90
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,720
- I'm lost for words. 
 - Are you...

91
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,160
Are you saying that to my father?

92
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,610
Why? Am I wrong?

93
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,390
My granddaughter passed away,

94
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,930
and this is what you do in front of me, you unrefined bastards?

95
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,130
I made you two punks live like human beings.

96
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,180
You forget that and dare to do this here?

97
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,890
You sons of bitches.

98
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,870
Chairman Choi. Beg for forgiveness, you asshole.

99
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,050
Why are you being so rude at a funeral?

100
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,880
What are you doing, not begging already?

101
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,590
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

102
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,460
Chairman Choi.

103
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,870
It's not that we don't know of your heartbreak right now.

104
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,450
When the valley is deep, the peak is high.

105
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,200
Everything will be fine as long as we get through this one, right?

106
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,840
He is right.

107
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's pull through this crisis, Chairman Choi.

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,900
We're almost there.

109
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,980
Don't slip anything to the press.

110
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,710
Don't react to anything.

111
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,370
Just wait patiently.

112
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,370
I'll fix it. Of course, we'll pull through.

113
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,280
We have to stand on top.

114
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,530
The apex is near.

115
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,510
We can't stop here.

116
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,400
That's right, Chairman Choi.

117
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,760
How dare you come into this place?

118
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,980
How dare you?

119
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,310
Noona.

120
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,570
I know you've been telling nonsense to Father.

121
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,640
"The incident ten years ago... the three of them are the suspects..."

122
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,700
That's why Father spilled it to you about Jae Yi being your daughter.

123
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,160
Because you guys are the suspects.

124
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,480
That's why he was shaken.

125
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,940
You killed Jae Yi.

126
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,790
You. You killed your daughter.

127
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,060
- Stop, Hyeong. 
 - Let me go, asshole.

128
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,450
What do you mean stop? Jae Yi died because of this bitch.

129
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,850
When Oh Su Jae this fucking bitch killed Jae Yi!

130
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,030
Enough!

131
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,370
Please.

132
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,470
I've had enough.

133
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,730
Please stop showing how low you can go

134
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,900
in front of me.

135
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,520
Get off your high horse.

136
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,350
You're the same.

137
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,300
Just wait and see.

138
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,600
I'm not letting you go with this.

139
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,130
I'll be the one to end you.

140
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,140
Hyeong!

141
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,370
Hansu Group, Lee In Su, Seojung University, JRTI

142
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,010
 I'm sorry. 

143
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,650
 I can't describe 

144
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,480
 how sorry I am... 

145
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,250
 As your mom, I 

146
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,110
 failed to recognize you, Ha Neul, 

147
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,490
 and made you sad. 

148
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,840
 I'm sorry for all that, my baby. 

149
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,020
 Farewell, my baby. 

150
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,550
 My daughter... Ha Neul... 

151
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,890
 My daughter... 

152
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,900
 Ha Neul... 

153
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,430
What exactly do you have?

154
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,590
Chief Han told me some interesting stories.

155
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,410
 I heard from Hong Seok Pal that the An Gang Hoon scandal... 

156
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,420
 That was the gentlemen who made Park So Yeong do that. 

157
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,190
Since Assemblyman Lee wanted to get rid of An Gang Hoon,

158
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,710
Chairman Choi used his beloved So Yeong.

159
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,830
He's something else, really.

160
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,190
Then he should've at least paid her properly for the work.

161
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,230
Poor girl.

162
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,940
Then, you must also know who killed Park So Yeong and Hong Seok Pal, Chief.

163
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,650
I can't say I know even if I do

164
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,180
or say I don't know even if I don't.

165
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,420
Oh, that was Chief Ha—

166
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,550
Never mind.

167
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,280
Ask Chairman Choi Tae Gook.

168
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,240
 See what he says. 

169
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,010
 Confidentiality Agreement 

170
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,230
 Oh Su Jae 

171
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,270
 Choi Tae Gook 

172
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,040
 Choi Tae Gook 

173
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,650
 Oh Su Jae 

174
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,230
Although the ink is still wet,

175
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,790
I'll keep my word, so you keep yours as well.

176
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,600
Noona.

177
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,210
 I found that CEO Choi's late daughter 

178
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,580
 could be Attorney Oh's daughter. 

179
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,530
 Oh, and Father, 

180
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:45,270
 Eun Seo's earring was found in Chairman Han's house garbage bags. 

181
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,800
It's the one that I had gifted her

182
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,620
ten years ago.

183
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,140
Traces of blood were found on the earring.

184
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,010
 Bloodstain Analysis Results Report  
 Is it... Eun Seo's blood?

185
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,300
No.

186
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,120
We didn't finish the analysis yet.

187
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,030
It's difficult to extract the DNA since it's from ten years ago.

188
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,230
It'll take some more time.

189
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,190
Multiple fingerprints were found on the pressure tape.

190
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,380
It means several people tied someone up together.

191
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,330
The fingerprint analysis will also take more time.

192
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,950
But why did that come out from there?

193
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,920
In the garbage bag, within the wall.

194
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,840
Construction workers apparently discard waste inside walls.

195
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,250
 Although a lot of time passed, 

196
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,160
 it was preserved within the wall, inside the bag. 

197
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,360
Seojung University Hospital

198
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,490
Wards, Clinical Testing, Lecture Halls, Research Offices

199
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,650
 Oh Su Jae 

200
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,050
 I'm TK. 

201
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,650
 TK is me. 

202
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,690
 Oh Su Jae 

203
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,080
 I believed that if I endured and climbed to that end 

204
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,130
 I would see my world. 

205
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,350
 It was actually nothing. 

206
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,700
 What does it mean to breathe? 

207
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,730
 Being alive? 

208
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,390
 I made your life insufferable with my foolish decision. 

209
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,460
 Was I nothing but a fool again? 

210
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,230
 I'm going home for a second - Gong Chan 

211
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,000
 I lost your life and mine... 

212
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,520
 Now, I even lost my child. 

213
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,920
 Being alive like this 

214
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,740
 is utterly humiliating. 

215
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,840
 Will I be able to 

216
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,750
 let bygones be bygones? 

217
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,940
 To Gong Chan 

218
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,510
 I believed that if I endured and climbed... 

219
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,500
 Next news is about Assemblyman Lee. 

220
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,880
   
 A new talk that pities 

221
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,460
   
 Assemblyman Lee for his daughter's 4 billion won special bonus 

222
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,500
   
 and his mother-in-law's three cheaply gained apartments. 

223
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,390
 As such, his approval ratings are recovering. 

224
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,690
 Assemblyman Lee announced this morning that he apologizes 

225
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,030
 for disturbing the national sentiment, although he did not violate the law. 

226
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,680
The law finds me innocent,

227
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,170
but I still apologize for disturbing the national sentiment.

228
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,660
   
 With the benefits suspicions 

229
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,960
 and Managing Director Han Dong Oh's hidden camera rumors, 

230
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,020
 Hansu Group, whose stock price plummeted, 

231
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,280
 regained their trust by stating they'll parcel out half-cost housing for people. 

232
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,190
 The stock price also rose 3.4 percent in comparison to last week, 

233
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,220
 showing signs of recovery. 

234
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,170
 Some prospects suggested that the Hansu Bio acquisition will be canceled. 

235
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,540
 However, SP Partners officially announced that the acquisition cancellation was never considered. 

236
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,560
 Many concluded that the problems which could've been 

237
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,750
 detrimental to Hansu Group were resolved quickly 

238
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,220
 thanks to Chairman Han Seong Beom's honest leadership. 

239
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,000
I went to the places you told me about, but she wasn't there.

240
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,340
Yes.

241
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,680
Call me right away if you find anything.

242
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,530
- I meant to go see you. 
 - I can come, it's fine.

243
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,760
I can come, it's fine.

244
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,000
Things are hectic for you right now.

245
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,670
By the way, did you reach her?

246
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,970
Where the heck did she go to?

247
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,340
What a mean bitch.

248
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,790
She has a knack for making people worry.

249
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,200
Not even caring about people who are looking for her.

250
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,120
I... told her to quit TK and all that shit,

251
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,900
and just live with you happily.

252
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,800
I'm sorry. I'll call you later.

253
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,280
She's the woman the three sons took from the club

254
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,490
to Chairman Han's house the night Jeon Na Jeong died.

255
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,330
A nursing home...

256
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,320
Her name is Kang Eun Seo.

257
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,420
After a car accident ten years ago,

258
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,350
her intelligence became that of a child and she lost all memories.

259
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,700
- Any family? 
 - The mother's name is Kang Myeong Ju.

260
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,580
She was a single mother.

261
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,650
Kang Eun Seo took her mother's last name

262
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,770
and Ms. Kang Myeong Ju died six years ago.

263
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,740
Who's paying for the nursing home cost?

264
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,560
Before Kang Myeong Ju died,

265
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,130
she gave some money to the nursing home for her daughter

266
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,240
and there are no other family members.

267
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,900
Nothing for you to worry about in particula—

268
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,510
What about workers and volunteers who are friendly with her?

269
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,640
Did you secure the list of people who have visited her so far?

270
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,850
I'll... look into that further.

271
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,810
What's with you? This is not like you, Chief Ha.

272
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,360
I'm sorry. My son's condition

273
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,750
worsened a lot lately, so I'm a bit...

274
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,560
That's not something new from yesterday or today.

275
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,340
Work needs to get done, you know.

276
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,900
My apologies.

277
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,950
As I expected, Han Gi Taek refused to see me.

278
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,060
Han Gi Taek refused to see me.

279
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,820
So I met his wife.

280
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,810
As for Managing Director Han Dong Oh's hidden camera case,

281
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,840
I gave 200 million won to each woman who wanted to sue him.

282
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,110
It's all been taken care of.

283
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,210
Su Jae.

284
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,330
As for her, the Bar Association will have a Disciplinary Board meeting.

285
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,210
- Pardon? 
 - The Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee is...

286
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,870
Wh-What?

287
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:26,280
How would that work when there are assigned committee members and even reserves already?

288
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,520
I trust you all.

289
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,670
 If Chairman of the Seoul Central Bar Association Nam Geon Joon notifies all of the Korean Bar Associations 

290
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,540
 about the reason for disciplinary action against Su Jae, 

291
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,330
 the President Yu Dong Chu of the Korean Bar Association will assemble a disciplinary committee. 

292
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,590
 Deputy Chief of Court Administration Kim Ji Wook and 

293
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,040
 Acting Minister of Justice Oh Hyeong Seok will also be included 

294
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,650
 among the nine disciplinary committee members. 

295
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,660
 Out of them, Hwang Hyeon Ho, Kang Gil Ju, Hong Gi Pyo, and you. 

296
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,610
A total of four people will go in.

297
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,040
If this case is put to the vote, we need five of the nine people

298
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,180
on our side.

299
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,070
The Chairman should bring at least one person, right?

300
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,110
Your ex-wife is there, too.

301
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,920
Yes. But...

302
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,610
she's a little bit...

303
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,300
Bring in whoever it is, ex-wife or not.

304
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,950
Yes, Sir.

305
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,880
By the way, how much disciplinary action are you considering for Su Jae?

306
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,100
Revocation of license and permanent expulsion.

307
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,330
Chief Ha has a habit of looking back on the place he left.

308
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,310
Another one of his habits is

309
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:15,840
that he searches everywhere around for a clue that he finds.

310
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,780
Everything in this world can be found out if you search thoroughly.

311
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:35,070
Including what absurd thing

312
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,230
Su Jae is doing with these small punks. 
 Fingerprint Forensics Analysis 

313
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,950
Going after my son?

314
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,850
Chairman Han's and Assemblyman Lee's sons?

315
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,850
Should I call her cute or immature, huh?

316
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,010
We're just going after the truth.

317
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,780
Don't you belittle that, Chairman.

318
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,450
That case from ten years ago.

319
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,850
Kim Dong Goo was framed and No Byeong Chool is not the culprit, either.

320
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,730
You know better than anyone, Chairman.

321
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,130
Since the results don't show those three as the culprit, you move on to Chief Ha?

322
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,030
When the culprit No Byeong Chool is dead?

323
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,500
Take my fingerprint, too, if you need it.

324
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,290
"When the suspect confesses and the fingerprint is found on the crime weapon,

325
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,590
the existence of other fingerprints is not important."

326
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,740
You know that much as well, right?

327
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,700
I do.

328
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:41,070
I also know that I must stop those with power

329
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,800
that downtrodden, deceive,

330
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,190
and ruin the lives of those without power and expose the truth.

331
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,010
I know that very well.

332
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,210
I'll do that for sure.

333
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,830
They call you Oh Su Jae junior.

334
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,230
They're right.

335
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,870
Daring and entertaining.

336
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,930
Su Jae was just like that.

337
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,890
She then crossed the line and is about to be thrown out like a dog.

338
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,200
Go and tell Su Jae

339
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,880
the Korean Bar Association will hold a disciplinary meeting.

340
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:23,040
Breaking the legs of a rabid dog and being thrown out is the answer.

341
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,990
Thank you for the pen, Chairman.

342
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,870
Go.

343
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,110
 Later... 

344
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,500
 Way down the road, I wonder what it'd be like to live in a place like this. 

345
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,090
Chan needs to find Su Jae.

346
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,860
He'll find her.

347
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,690
He'll search the whole world if he has to and show up with Professor.

348
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,400
Chan will find Professor for sure, but what do we do?

349
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,180
There really is something for sure, right, Doctor?

350
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,390
I'm so sorry.

351
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,210
My memory is trash, so I hoard everything.

352
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,400
You'll find something if you keep looking. So sorry.

353
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,910
It just needs to show up.

354
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,390
It just needs to be here.

355
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,040
Choon Poong, can you help me with this?

356
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,270
- Yes, sure. 
 - Gosh, this...

357
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,440
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

358
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,360
My goodness, what do I do...

359
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,590
I suck at organizing. Sorry.

360
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,220
 Jeon Na Jeong 

361
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,800
 Doctor. 

362
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,010
Thank you for your hard work.

363
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,480
No problem.

364
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,940
Isn't that Patient Kang Eun Seo's clothes?

365
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,030
I keep forgetting to put them away.

366
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,090
The police didn't take them as evidence?

367
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,420
No. They said they got in touch with the family so to just throw them out.

368
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,570
 Jeon Na Jeong 

369
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,450
Hello.

370
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,390
I'm looking for someone. Have you seen this person?

371
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,240
 We found it. 

372
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,510
 We found Jeon Na Jeong's part-time uniform, Chan. 

373
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,090
 We found it, Chan. 

374
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,610
 So you make sure to find Professor and bring her. 

375
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,570
 Please, please come back, Professor. 

376
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,840
Be there.

377
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,130
Please be there.

378
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,560
 Our work on identifying the fingerprint was busted. 

379
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,680
 Please request the analysis of the uniform elsewhere, Kang Ja. 

380
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,030
 Pay the utmost caution. 

381
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,670
Stop!

382
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,260
What are you doing?

383
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:17,800
Let me go!

384
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,440
- Let me go! 
 - Be still.

385
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,850
Let me go.

386
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,110
Let me go!

387
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,170
Stop.

388
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,040
Let me go.

389
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,220
Let go!

390
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,580
What are you doing? What are you thinking?

391
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,030
Let it be. It's my life.

392
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,210
It's my life that I ruined.

393
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,170
Pull yourself together, Oh Su Jae!

394
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,140
You got hurt because of me

395
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,800
and even my own child.

396
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,120
My child, whom I just met, too!

397
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,570
That's not it. None of it is your fault.

398
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:06,330
No. It's my fault.

399
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,950
Everything is a result of all of my choices.

400
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,690
Foolish choices.

401
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,950
I'm paying the consequences

402
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,960
like this.

403
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:29,480
I can't know all what it means for your child to die, and how much it hurts.

404
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,900
But don't think that it's your fault, Professor

405
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,230
Every time I blamed myself for what happened to Na Jeong, it was hell.

406
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,470
Please don't fall into that hell.

407
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,810
I beg of you.

408
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,150
And my life.

409
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,450
This much, I'm content with.

410
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:54,470
The reason why my life was hard is not your fault.

411
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,840
It's because of the people who think nothing of other people's lives.

412
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,110
That doesn't mean that my blame is gone.

413
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,050
My responsibility isn't gone.

414
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,060
Then take responsibility.

415
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,660
Make them realize how much of a sin it is

416
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,650
to trample on other people's lives

417
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,060
and not to be ashamed of your crimes.

418
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,980
Expose them to the world.

419
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,270
You can take responsibility that way.

420
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,360
You can do it.

421
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,030
Oh Su Jae is someone who can.

422
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,590
Because you are a cooler and stronger person than anyone,

423
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,220
and you do not back down.

424
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,270
I could be foolish again.

425
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,020
You could get hurt again.

426
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,600
I don't care.

427
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,480
I'll be with you to the end, Oh Su Jae.

428
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,860
Let's go.

429
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,860
Let's go together.

430
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,830
They're all waiting.

431
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,370
 Minister of Justice candidate Baek Jin Gi is facing an 

432
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,120
 unfavorable factor right before the confirmation hearing. 

433
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,660
 It's a suspicion that he received a large amount of bribery from Geummyeong Savings Bank. 

434
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,140
 Candidate Baek denied the allegations 

435
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,720
 and stated that he'll reveal the truth at the confirmation hearing. 

436
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,960
   
 Candidate Baek graduated from Seojung University Law School and 

437
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,280
 served in Cheongju District Court and Suwon District Court... 

438
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,910
It looks like the savings bank stuff will be an obstacle.

439
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,330
I'll prove your innocence, Sunbae-nim.

440
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,260
Request me as the witness.

441
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,720
Gosh. How can I be so shameless?

442
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,290
When you become the minister,

443
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,010
catch who I tell you to catch

444
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,360
and cover what I tell you to cover.

445
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,810
That's all I ask.

446
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,570
Well, that's a piece of cake.

447
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,990
You don't ask for absurd things anyway.

448
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,410
There will be a disciplinary meeting at the Bar Association against Su Jae.

449
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,480
Disciplinary meeting? What did Su Jae do?

450
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,220
She's gotten too big.

451
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,400
It's past her exit.

452
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,310
By the way, you need to give me some support.

453
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,850
If I were to give you support,

454
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,350
when Su Jae refutes the disciplinary committee's decision

455
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,380
and appeals to the Ministry of Justice? That's when I come in?

456
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,870
Veto.

457
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,820
Okay.

458
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,040
- I'll be off to another meeting. 
 - Okay.

459
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,730
Sure thing.

460
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,730
Chairman Choi did let the press know about the savings bank case.

461
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,020
He calculated that I'd come to him for help

462
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,760
if I'm in a bind.

463
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,850
He only did it to make you

464
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,210
go against Attorney Oh in this disciplinary case,

465
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,180
pretending to help you.

466
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,990
In the worst-case scenario,

467
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,030
the committee might order permanent exclusion.

468
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,510
Not the worst-case scenario.

469
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,800
That's probably the intended goal.

470
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,060
He's trying to make Su Jae unable to do anything by tying her up.

471
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,630
He is a cruel and meticulous human being.

472
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,130
We need the bloodstain analysis results before the hearing.

473
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,050
The amount of blood is so small

474
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,620
and too much time has passed, too.

475
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,180
It'll come out.

476
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,850
It'll come out for sure.

477
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,530
Hearing and the disciplinary meeting.

478
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,800
We're playing two games at the same time.

479
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,140
Passing the hearing is not hard with my testimony.

480
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,700
The police, the prosecution, and the Ministry of Justice.

481
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,850
We'll control all of them.

482
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,810
Just prepare for the disciplinary meeting thoroughly.

483
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,760
To order permanent exclusion at the meeting,

484
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,700
we'll need more than a couple of items.

485
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,360
A case where the person had disciplinary action against her twice already

486
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,790
and yet it's a third time around.

487
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,840
A case where the nature of crime is bad enough to find

488
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,000
her unable to practice law.

489
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,510
The nature of Su Jae's crime is bad.

490
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,290
Isn't that right?

491
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,690
Of course, she is unable to practice law.

492
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,590
Of course, she is.

493
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,470
Nature of the crime. It's very bad.

494
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:21,990
The history of past permanent exclusion shows

495
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,520
violation of the obligation to maintain dignity,

496
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,330
violation of the obligation to prohibit title lending, and

497
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,940
violation of the obligation to prohibit partnership with a person who is not a lawyer.

498
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,510
Showing multiple violations overlapping

499
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,400
and the meeting was held on the premise that the violations have been found.

500
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,200
There was also a case where an appeal

501
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,240
to the Ministry of Justice was accepted.

502
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,320
An appeal to the Ministry of Justice will be certainly denied.

503
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,900
Unconditionally.

504
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,510
She is being permanently excluded, unconditionally.

505
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,140
Yes, of course, CEO.

506
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,850
If I make a title and search everywhere with a net...

507
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,600
You know I was also a former planning expert in Special Prosecutor's Office.

508
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,640
I already have an additional committee member on our side as well.

509
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,690
Don't worry.

510
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,610
The cases that Su Jae took as a TK lawyer.

511
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,950
The associate lawyers who Su Jae kicked out. Look into all of them,

512
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,300
so we can

513
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,370
end Oh Su Jae completely.

514
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,800
Yes.

515
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,280
Also, look into

516
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,480
the cases that Su Jae took before

517
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,070
she joined TK Law Firm.

518
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:23,550
We need to use that case as our last resort.

519
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,220
Yes.

520
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,620
Blue Real Estate

521
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,470
My gosh. We just need two more things.

522
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,920
We found the connection between Jeon Na Jeong and Kang Eun Seo.

523
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,040
Behind the deaths of Park So Yeong and Hong Seok Pal,

524
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,760
is Chairman Choi Tae Gook. That too we have found out.

525
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,590
Even this much will be enough to move the press.

526
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,610
There'll be pressure to start investigations,

527
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,190
and the investigating agencies won't stay quiet either.

528
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,050
Even that much should do to turn the tables on them.

529
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,110
Oh, my, Professor.

530
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,830
You've done a great job.

531
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,530
Petition to Discipline.

532
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,700
I'll take this fight from here.

533
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,530
Whether I lose or win.

534
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,460
Whichever side falls.

535
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,340
I'll take it on entirely.

536
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,240
Those who don't know their place and act out.

537
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,290
Those who are shameless and try me.

538
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,520
Not knowing that they're all sitting in the palm of my hand.

539
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:06,430
 Chief Ha: Chairman, my son is... 

540
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,200
 A confirmation hearing for Justice Minister nominee Baek Jin Gi 

541
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,590
 will be held at the National Assembly this morning. 

542
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,200
 The Great Citizens' Party announced its own thorough investigation 

543
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,050
 into the bribery scandal at the Geummyeong Savings Bank. 

544
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,680
 Candidate Baek requested as a witness 

545
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,350
 TK Law Firm Chairman Choi Tae Gook. 

546
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,210
 Father, 

547
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,970
 the bloodstain analysis results should come out soon. 

548
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,890
 I'll bring it directly to the hearing. 

549
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,150
- She's coming! 
 - She's here. She's here.
  Korean Bar Association 

550
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,230
Do you agree with the disciplinary committee being held?

551
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,110
Is it true that you committed illegal acts while working at TK Law Firm?

552
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,910
Is it true that you made a deal for a favorable trial?

553
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,980
Is it true that you told the students that you lose the first trial on purpose?

554
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,690
Is it true that you've been bribing witnesses for trial?

555
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,750
 Please say something! 

556
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,780
Please give us an answer!

557
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,890
Please answer us!

558
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,970
Please say a word!

559
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,170
 Korean Bar Association Disciplinary Committee for Lawyers 

560
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,200
Disciplinary Allegation Holder Oh Su Jae

561
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,760
Korean Bar Association; Lawyer Song Mi Rim

562
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,900
 You wanted to chew up TK like this, so you endured and climbed up thus far. 

563
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,890
 I know that better than anyone else. 

564
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,660
 But Su Jae, 

565
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,660
 would I feed the porridge I made for myself to a dog? 

566
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,520
 I'd rather dump the pot. 

567
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,200
 As for a dog, 

568
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,340
 he must be loyal, 

569
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,420
 know his place, and bear shame under any circumstances 

570
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,720
 in order to be loved. 

571
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,640
Starting now,

572
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,790
we will begin the disciplinary committee meeting of the Korean Bar Association

573
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,800
against Attorney Oh Su Jae.

574
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,220
I'm Attorney Seo Joon Myeong, the chairman of the disciplinary committee.

575
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,440
Normally, we would proceed in private,

576
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,840
but because Attorney Oh Su Jae, the subject of disciplinary action, requested a public hearing,

577
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,410
and since the journalists and reporters are here as well,

578
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,760
the disciplinary committee will be broadcast live.

579
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,160
Has the disciplinary action subject received notice of disciplinary commencement

580
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,680
and a request for disciplinary commencement?

581
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,890
Yes, she has.

582
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,150
Then we will start the disciplinary committee against Attorney Oh Su Jae,

583
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,420
subject of disciplinary action.

584
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,820
Disciplinary Action Subject, please personally tell us your personal information.

585
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,940
Disciplinary Action Subject,

586
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,490
please tell us your personal information.

587
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,420
 Subject of Disciplinary Action, Oh Su Jae 

588
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,080
Oh Su Jae.

589
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,880
Born on May 15, 1985.

590
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,140
23 Yulsuro 2-gil, Seoul.

591
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,250
I'm a member of the Seoul Central Lawyers Association,

592
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:43,930
and I'm working as a partner lawyer for TK Law Firm...

593
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,400
at least for now.

594
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,050
Oath.

595
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,970
As a candidate for public office,

596
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:56,260
I swear to tell the truth according to my conscience,

597
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,710
without hiding or adding to the fact.

598
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,530
Candidate for office, Baek Jin Gi.

599
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,460
The breeze is nice.

600
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,140
 Personal Details 

601
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,540
First, the Hansu Bio Chemical Complex Air Pollution Victim Compensation Case.

602
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:28,530
I'll refer to Attorney Oh's illegal actions taken during the second trial.

603
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,260
Attorney Park Yeon Wu, please proceed to the material witness seat.

604
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,560
What you're seeing now

605
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,550
is the second trial verdict of the Hansu Bio Dust Damage Lawsuit.

606
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:49,460
 An insider's bribery charges and the child victim's adoption reveal 

607
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,360
blurred the nature of the trial, which was Hansu Bio's industrial dust damage.

608
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,240
We brought the prosecuting attorney at the time as a testifier.

609
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,950
I'm Park Yeon Wu.

610
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:06,500
You said that the disciplinary action subject committed a violation at the trial.

611
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,650
- What was it? 
 - The disciplinary action subject

612
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:16,010
secretly confirmed the paternity of Yang Ji Ho and his adoptive parents without our consent.

613
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,650
So I questioned, "Isn't it illegal without our consent?"

614
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,280
 That's why we can't submit this one. 

615
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,170
 But there are abundant pieces of evidence. 

616
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,670
So she definitely stated that she won't be able to submit it as evidence.

617
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:34,230
This is evidence that the disciplinary action subject herself was aware of the illegality.

618
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,400
In relation to Yang Ji Ho's case,

619
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,370
the disciplinary action subject did things that lawyers should not do,

620
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,810
such as illegally identifying Yang Ji Ho's biological parents.

621
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:48,640
Allegations so far correspond to the Attorney Act Section 24 (1) Breach of duty to maintain dignity,

622
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,710
Section 24 (2) Breach of Concealment of Truth and Prohibition of Perjury,

623
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:57,610
and Article 1 (1) violation of basic human rights protection.

624
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,500
Disciplinary Action Subject. Do you admit it?

625
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,060
Disciplinary Action Subject, do you admit it?

626
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,850
I'll not answer.

627
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,840
Well then. We'll move on to the next case.

628
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,600
 National Assembly of Korea  
 Candidate,

629
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,100
speak about the suspicions that you received 
  Minister of Justice Candidate: Baek Jin Gi Personal Information 

630
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,570
200 million won in bribes while serving as the head of the legal training center in 2008.

631
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,690
First of all, I apologize to 
  National Office Candidate 

632
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,800
the citizens for causing national concern.

633
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,310
Assemblywoman, a witness who will

634
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,860
objectively testify for me about the rumors is present.

635
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,480
You see,

636
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,650
why would you lay it on the witness to speak for you when you should be the one talking?

637
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,250
Are you taking the assembly hearing lightly?

638
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,300
One moment, please. One moment. 
  Lee In Su 

639
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,950
Most respected Assemblywoman Lee Yeong Hui, he said the witness is here.

640
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,430
We can just hear from the witness.

641
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:00,560
Why are you butting in? 
  Lee Yeong Hui 

642
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,250
What do you mean "you"?

643
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,070
Mind your manners!

644
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,000
Be quiet!

645
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,060
That kind of speech is diminishing the quality of this hearing.

646
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:11,510
- Who do you think you are? 
 - What do you mean?

647
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,970
 Chair, Jo Nam Hui  
 Assembly persons.

648
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:21,680
Silence. Please tone it down.

649
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,760
What are we even doing here?

650
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,280
Witness. Come in.
  Chairperson Cho Nam Hui 

651
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:44,000
I'm Choi Tae Gook.

652
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,790
Assemblywoman, please question the witness.

653
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,420
Witness?

654
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,170
You were the head of the Special Investigation Unit

655
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,960
during the 2008 Geummyeong Savings Bank corruption scandal, right?

656
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,900
Please tell us about the situation at the time in detail.

657
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,430
At the time Candidate Baek Jin Gi

658
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,420
received a bribe at the time.

659
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:11,380
He received a bribe?

660
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,500
Chairman Choi,

661
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:22,200
what are you saying right now?

662
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,100
Let me tell you clearly.

663
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:29,100
Justice Minister candidate Baek Jin Gi

664
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,790
received 200 million won from broker Kim Seok Chae in 2008

665
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:36,030
in exchange for connecting Chairman Geum Se Yeong,

666
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,660
chairman of Geummyeong Savings Bank.

667
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:41,610
When Chairman Geum Se Yeong was tried on another case,

668
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:46,580
he even requested his junior, the judge, to give him a weak sentence.

669
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,680
I had no idea about it at the time,

670
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,510
but I found out recently from an anonymous tip-off

671
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:54,750
and evidence that I had received.

672
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,780
I apologize to the lawmakers and the public

673
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:03,490
that the investigation at the time was insufficient.

674
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:25,930
 Kang Eun Seo's biological father is Director Baek Jin Gi. 

675
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,380
 She's an out-of-wedlock child? 

676
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,580
 CEO Yoon Se Pil seems to have been Kang Eun Seo's lover. 

677
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,680
 What is this? 

678
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,750
 And also, 

679
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,220
 the American enterprise that purchased Chairman Han's 

680
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:48,420
 Samjoong-dong house that you told me to look into had 

681
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,370
 a president whose name is CEO Yoon Se Pil's American name. 

682
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,000
 What? 

683
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:03,460
 The day when Jeon Na Jeong, whose remains were found in Yeongpyeong District, died. 

684
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,080
 On that day, 

685
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,450
 A woman in her 20s was taken to the hospital at night after a car hit her. 

686
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,930
Baek Jin Gi.

687
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:16,110
Yoon Se Pil.

688
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,610
Oh Su Jae.

689
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:24,510
How dare these things...

690
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,790
The candidate took bribery in order to

691
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,480
take care of an illegitimate daughter and her mother.

692
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,210
After that daughter was hit by a car 10 years ago,

693
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:42,250
he became delusional about her being involved in another case before she was hit.

694
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,750
He even became obsessed with

695
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,800
the fact that his daughter was hit near

696
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,970
Hansu Group Chairman Han Seong Beom's house

697
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:53,590
and said that my son, who hung out at the house every now and then,

698
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,770
along with Chairman Han's son, and

699
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:01,670
Presidential Candidate Lee, who is sitting here, his son were the suspects.

700
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:05,170
He even spread false rumors.

701
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,840
Those bastards are indeed the suspects.

702
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,410
They kidnapped my daughter and did horrible things to her.

703
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:19,090
My daughter became a little kid after being hit by a car while running away.

704
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,700
- Is that true? 
 - What is he saying?

705
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,000
Nonsense.

706
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,660
Regain your senses, Sunbaenim.

707
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,090
Those bastards are suspects.

708
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,010
I have evidence.

709
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,030
The evidence is on the way.

710
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,020
- What is this about? 
 - Bring him down.

711
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,870
- Who let him speak? 
 - It has nothing to do with me.

712
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:39,820
- What are we waiting for? 
 - It says right here.

713
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,470
Bring him out right now!

714
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:00,600
 You dare think... 

715
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:05,900
 that you can beat me, Sunbaenim? 

716
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,560
 Material Witness Seat 

717
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:15,310
When she was alive, Park So Yeong told me that she wanted to die.

718
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,810
She was cornered that terribly.

719
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,500
 Was this your dream? 

720
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,610
 Push the victim into a corner, and make me want to die. 

721
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,240
 Was this your dream? 

722
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,210
 Why would you die? 

723
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,340
 You should live. 

724
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:46,640
 Curse me and live. 

725
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,170
Park So Yeong was in a very unstable state at the time.

726
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:54,030
While Park So Yeong was in that state, she showed her family picture

727
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,670
 and made a threatening statement saying that she'll let her family know. 

728
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,860
She strongly pressured her

729
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,710
to say that she never even met An Gang Hoon and agree to the terms.

730
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,660
 Let's say Park So Yeong indeed is a victim, and we go to trial. 

731
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,990
 Do you think you can beat me in the courtroom, Ninth Class? 

732
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,400
 Ms. Park So Yeong? 

733
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,850
 That you misjudged under the influence of alcohol. 

734
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,010
 You never even met An Gang Hoon. 

735
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,610
 The end. 

736
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,350
 Okay? 

737
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,000
However, Chairperson,

738
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,850
the reason why the disciplinary action subject kept pressing Ms. Park So Yeong

739
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,610
was because as the attorney acting on behalf of

740
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:37,840
the suspected rapist had to make clear a certain point.

741
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,180
It's something that every lawyer must do.

742
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:44,470
There's something else we have to make clear, Attorney.

743
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:03,240
The disciplinary action subject cornered Park So Yeong because

744
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,600
she had a private relationship with An Gang Hoon.

745
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,780
Chair.

746
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,510
Mindlessly revealing irrelevant facts to the meeting like that

747
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,540
is violating the rights of the disciplinary action subject.

748
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,860
- Please stop it. 
 - Well?

749
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:18,570
It doesn't seem that violating.

750
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,860
Chair.

751
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,210
I request an adjournment.

752
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,380
I request an adjournment while expressing regret about

753
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:52,060
unshared evidence and a meeting that has digressed from its nature.

754
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:02,270
Sure. Then, we'll hold the second disciplinary meeting tomorrow.

755
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,060
- She's here! 
 - Here she comes!

756
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,720
Do you admit to the issues that were in focus in today's disciplinary meeting?

757
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,600
Did you really illegally confirm the paternity?

758
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,410
Do you admit that you threatened her by talking about her family?

759
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,780
Why did you avoid answering?

760
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,240
Why did you request to adjourn?

761
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,740
Please answer!

762
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,820
 - Please answer! 
 - A comment, please! 

763
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,710
 A star attorney, right? 

764
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:55,420
 TK Law Firm's Attorney Oh Su Jae's disciplinary meeting will be held again tomorrow. 

765
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:59,750
 It is said that even permanent exclusion is being sought for the verdict. 

766
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:00,780
 Confirmation Hearing news. 

767
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,670
 During the hearing today for Minister of Justice candidate Baek Jin Gi, 

768
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,970
 it was found that the candidate took bribery from a savings bank broker. 

769
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:14,170
 An unidentified fire broke out at Chairman Han's former residence at Samjoong-dong. 

770
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,620
 Since a blockade is installed... 

771
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,660
I should've burned that house down sooner.

772
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,980
Yoon Se Pil that rat bought the house for that reason.

773
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,990
Baek Jin Gi is even more of an eyesore.

774
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,920
Acting all foolish.

775
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,010
That motherfucker has been aiming at our backs the whole time.

776
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,760
The biggest eyesore is that bitch, Oh Su Jae.

777
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,110
That little bitch took sides with them, and you know?

778
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:40,200
Come in.

779
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,430
Come on in, Chairman Choi. Welcome!

780
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:44,740
You showed up here, there, and everywhere today.

781
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,000
Is your name Choi Gil Dong? 
  (T/N: Reference to a folk tale hero, Hong Gil Dong.) 

782
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,600
Gosh. When did you prepare everything?

783
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,130
You're amazing, Chairman Choi!

784
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,690
Please sit, our hope.

785
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,780
Announce the cancellation of the acquisition?

786
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:03,100
I know we should behead Yoon Se Pil that rat, but

787
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,170
it's our responsibility if we cancel first.

788
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:09,720
The cancellation charge is 800 billion won, too. Eight hundred.

789
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,620
TK Law Firm also has to pay three times the acquisition fees.

790
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:18,790
That contract line that Yoon Se Pil and Oh Su Jae schemed together to add.

791
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:21,040
We don't have to pay them a penny.

792
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,810
Not a penny?

793
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,840
How is that possible?

794
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,750
Don't you have to pay at least the down payment?

795
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,530
Paragraph 5 of Article 9 of the Acquisition Agreement.

796
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,620
"If, by the buyer's fault,

797
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:39,430
mutual trust is damaged or a credit reputation risk is caused,

798
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,120
the seller may cancel the agreement.

799
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,850
In this case, down payment or the cancellation charge

800
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,340
are attributed to the seller."

801
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,680
So?

802
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,610
Yoon Se Pil broke our mutual trust.

803
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:55,590
Right.

804
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,790
He hid his intention to stab us in the back.

805
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,860
We have a reason why we cannot trust him.

806
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,440
I finished the internal and legal preparations.

807
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,880
Now, just announce the acquisition cancellation officially.

808
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,620
The 400 billion won down payment can rest in your pocket.

809
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,770
You're about to swallow

810
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:24,470
400 billion won while resting in your chair, Chairman.

811
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,700
Wait, wait, wait.

812
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,100
I'm about to go nuts.

813
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,060
Chairman Choi.

814
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,460
Four hundred billion won!

815
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,030
I love you.

816
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:45,480
You know how it goes.

817
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,490
Thank you.

818
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:53,420
The atmosphere is so defeated.

819
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,820
What are they going to do about tomorrow?

820
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:00,120
I heard even the special counsel is joining tomorrow.

821
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,190
I'm worried.

822
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,060
But you know...

823
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,600
doesn't it look like they're all waiting for something?

824
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,420
So it seems.

825
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,270
Your son. Did you let him go properly?

826
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:38,930
Thanks to your consideration, I sent him well.

827
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,320
I'm also busy after losing my granddaughter,

828
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,200
but we need to carry on in this world.

829
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,930
The hearing and the disciplinary meeting are keeping me busy.

830
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,100
What is it that you need to tell me?

831
01:02:53,900 --> 01:03:01,000
Although I was able to stop Baek Jin Gi, Yoon Se Pil, and Su Jae, that gang thanks to you,

832
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,850
if things don't go the way I want,

833
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,700
you're going to have to carry all the blame, Chief Ha.

834
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,440
Park So Yeong, Hong Seok Pal, No Byeong Chool.

835
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,900
Getting rid of Jeon Na Jeong ten years ago and even everything about Kang Eun Seo.

836
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,130
Yes.

837
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:30,030
I'll carry everything.

838
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,520
Having a failure of a father,

839
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,960
my son suffered and died without a mom.

840
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:43,270
Without him in this world, I have no regrets.

841
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:44,850
Okay.

842
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,450
If you do that, I'll get your back.

843
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:49,630
Don't worry about that part.

844
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,980
 Next news. 

845
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,290
 The second disciplinary meeting for Attorney Oh Su Jae will proceed today at the National Lawyer Association. 

846
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,490
 Attorney Oh failed to respond to 

847
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:28,240
 the allegations against her during the first meeting and requested an adjournment. 

848
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,470
 There is a possibility of her receiving permanent exclusion 

849
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,750
 which is a severe disciplinary action. 

850
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,790
 Assemblyman Lee In Su said that Minister of Justice candidate 

851
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:41,330
 Baek Jin Gi falsely and baselessly cornered his son, Lee Si Hyeok 

852
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,270
 as the subject of the incident ten years ago. 

853
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:45,830
 As the election day approaches, his enemy forces are attemptin... 
     

854
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:49,110
 Hansu Group officially announced the cancellation of the acquisition agreement 

855
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:50,480
 with SP Partners. 
    

856
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,660
 According to Paragraph 5 of Article 9 of the agreement, 
    

857
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,680
 this incident qualifies as a just cause to cancel the agreement. 

858
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,080
 The contract is canceled and the down payment will be attributed as the cancellation of the agreement fee. 

859
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,460
 According to the Confidentiality Agreement, 

860
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,050
 CEO Yoon Se Pil's cause of damaging mutual trust cannot be revealed. 

861
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:04,870
 We ask for your understanding in that matter. 

862
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:08,780
 Also, we'll hold another press conference regarding 

863
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:14,360
 future Hansu Bio acquisitions after an internal review. 

864
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,420
 Greetings. 

865
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:20,210
 We'll now commence the second disciplinary meeting 

866
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:23,190
 for the disciplinary action subject, Attorney Oh Su Jae. 

867
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:30,650
 Of the disciplinary action suspicions from yesterday, 

868
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:34,000
 there'll be an additional pleading about the first suspicion by the defense. 

869
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,810
 About Yang Ji Ho of the Hansu Bio Industrial Dust Victim's Lawsuit, 

870
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:40,700
 the disciplinary action subject helped Yang Ji Ho get away 

871
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:44,210
 from his abusive adoptive parents, regardless of winning or losing the case. 

872
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:47,140
 In doing so, she protected a child's human rights. 

873
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:51,040
 The adoption agency that is taking care of Yang Ji Ho after disengagement 

874
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,060
 attended today as a material witness. 

875
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,640
 Material witness? 

876
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,450
 Please proceed to the Material Witness Seat. 

877
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:04,460
 My name is welfare worker Park Jeong Min. 

878
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,250
Right after the trial,

879
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:11,150
Attorney Oh Su Jae contacted me, saying that she'll sponsor Ji Ho.

880
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:15,690
She has been sponsoring Ji Ho ever since

881
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:19,480
and provided legal counsel for us, free of charge.

882
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,080
That is not the nature of this meeting!

883
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,410
The problem is that the disciplinary action subject

884
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:26,470
failed to keep things that a lawyer needs to keep during Yang Ji Ho's trial.

885
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:27,520
That's right.

886
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,760
The fact that she violated human rights

887
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,330
doesn't go away just because she sponsored him after the trial.

888
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:33,460
However, I see the significance

889
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,570
in the fact that she did not violate a child's rights but protected

890
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,980
a child's rights resultantly.

891
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:42,340
Committee Member Sim Min Joo, what are you saying right now?

892
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,220
Are you also going to say that

893
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:48,240
she protected a woman's rights in Park So Yeong's death, not violated them?

894
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,910
Chair, why do you slap it on there?

895
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:52,080
What? Slap it on?

896
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,250
Didn't you slap it on there just now?

897
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,440
What did you just say, Committee Member Sim Min Joo?

898
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,630
You're still the same person, Chair. Let's stop here.

899
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,640
- Committee Member Sim Min Joo! 
 - Let's call it quits.

900
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,850
Let's stop it here.

901
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:08,410
Chair.

902
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:13,200
I thank you for bringing up Park So Yeong's death first.

903
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,070
What is that?

904
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:33,360
I'm trying to let you know about the nature of Park So Yeong case.

905
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:37,460
The nature is that you cornered her too harshly

906
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,040
and did something a lawyer should never do.

907
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,280
That's why Park So Yeon—

908
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,260
"That's why Park So Yeong died."

909
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,060
- Is that what you still think? 
 - No.

910
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:50,850
The one who killed Park So Yeong is Hong Seok Pal.

911
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:54,940
The one who killed Park So Yeong is not Hong Seok Pal.

912
01:07:55,900 --> 01:08:00,880
It's TK Law Firm's, Chairman Choi Tae Gook.

913
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:15,240
 Why Her? 

914
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:24,480


915
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:38,270
 You don't have the evidence that Chairman Choi killed Park So Yeong. 

916
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:41,330
 You don't have it. It's only a claim. 

917
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:42,380
 What is that? 

918
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:46,720
 I request that you call Kim Dong Gu, who was the defendant, to the Material Witness Seat. 

919
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,730
 Kim Dong Gu? He came here? 

920
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:49,630
 My name is Kim Dong Gu. 

921
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:52,480
 The allegations were proven with Kim Dong Gu's fingerprint! 

922
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,330
 - Did you find out? 
 - Yes, I found out. 

923
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:58,550
 I hope they all receive the right legal judgement. 

924
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,880
 It's been exposed in broad daylight. 

925
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,000
 See for yourself.
