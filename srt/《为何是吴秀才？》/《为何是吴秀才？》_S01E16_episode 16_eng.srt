00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,400
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real.

00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,290
 Last Episode 

3
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,950
What is that?

4
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,250
I'm trying to let you know about the nature of the Park So Yeong case.

5
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:51,980
The nature is that you cornered her too harshly and did something a lawyer should never do.

6
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,110
- That is why Park So Yeon— 
 - "That is why Park So Yeong died."

7
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,920
- Is that what you still think? 
 - No.

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,810
The one who killed Park So Yeong is Hong Seok Pal.

9
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,400
The one who killed Park So Yeong is not Hong Seok Pal.

10
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,840
It's TK Law Firm's Chairman Choi Tae Gook.

11
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,450


12
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,570
 Park So Yeong's cell phones, Han Seong Beom/Lee In Su recordings... 

13
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,460
 Han Seong Beom, Lee In Su 

14
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,830
 With this, my brother... 

15
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,170
 father, Lee In Su, Han Seong Beom, Lee Si Hyeok, Han Dong Oh... 

16
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,910
 You'll be able to make them pay for their crimes. 

17
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,950
 The fact that you had a tough time because of Father and Hyeong... 

18
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,210
 I'm very sorry about that, Noona. 

19
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,230
 Disciplinary Action Subject. 

20
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,540
What is your reason for claiming that Chairman Choi Tae Gook killed Park So Yeong?

21
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,500
 I visited the hospital. 
    

22
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,840
 I'm pregnant. 

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,680
 Do you have evidence that it is my child? 

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,760
 I never saw you like that, but you're really acting like trash. 

25
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,960
Park So Yeong was pregnant with Chairman Choi Tae Gook's child.

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,110
 Create a scandal with An Gang Hoon. Something irrefutable. 

27
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,500
 You're telling me to do something like that while I'm pregnant? 

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,890
 You're the real trash. 

29
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,600
 I'll give you the money you want. 

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
 Get rid of the baby with that money and live quietly doing something else. 

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,240
Chairman Choi Tae Gook ordered pregnant Park So Yeong

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,390
to create a scandal with Assemblyman An Gang Hoon

33
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,530
with the intention to remove the rival of Assemblyman Lee In Su.

34
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,080
 Keep your promise, 

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,180
 or else, the fact that I'm pregnant with your child 

36
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,800
 and that you're the one who created An Gang Hoon's scandal... 

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,190
 I'll expose everything! 

38
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,780
And Park So Yeong used her pregnancy and An Gang Hoon's scandal

39
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,890
to ask for a large sum of money.

40
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,600
What nonsense.

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,540
Commissioner, that is a one-sided argument.

42
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,310
It is slander.

43
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,940
 Recent files 

44
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,090
 Since I was able to eliminate that bastard, An Gang Hoon, thanks to you, 

45
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,510
 I owe you a big debt, Chairman Choi. 

46
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,310
 Now, you just need to put on your wings and become President. 

47
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,180
 Of course, you need to put on your wings and fly. 

48
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,300
 Lee In Su, Choi Tae Gook, Han Seong Beom, we Three Musketeers. 

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,620
 All of us will fly together. 

50
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,630
However, isn't this all just speculation?

51
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,960
Circumstantial and situational, speculation cannot be evidence.

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,620
According to the police investigation,

53
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,610
the person who murdered Park So Yeong is Hong Seok Pal

54
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,580
and Hong Seok Pal committed suicide from guilt.

55
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,570
Han Gi Taek, who assisted his suicide,

56
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,510
confessed everything and has been arrested.

57
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,590
So doesn't this mean that there is no evidence that Chairman Choi Tae Gook murdered Park So Yeong?

58
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,020
Isn't that right, Disciplinary Action Subject?

59
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,130
There is nothing. It's just her argument.

60
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,190
Please stop the disciplinary action subject from making absurd statements.

61
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,330
If you don't, this disciplinary committee will also be punished for violating the rules.

62
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,040
  Beloved Son, Ha Seung Yoon 

63
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,650
 When Jae Yi left this world, 

64
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:25,840
 all the shameful moments I lived through unfolded in front of my eyes. 

65
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,520
 "Why did I live like that?" 

66
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,850
 "For what reason?" 

67
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,370
 "How should I go on living?" 

68
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,230
 For my child, who must be watching me from somewhere, 

69
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,870
 how to live from now on... 

70
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,520
 so that I won't be ashamed. 

71
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:57,550
 What happens next depends on your decision. 

72
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,330
 That's... 

73
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,850
 not something I can decide. 

74
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,430
 Check for yourself. 

75
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,450
 What Chairman thinks of you. 

76
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,890
 And then decide. 

77
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,160
 Chief Ha Il Gu 

78
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,160
 Attorney Oh, 

79
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,190
 I'll give you... everything that I possess. 

80
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,500
 So Yeong. 

81
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,270
 What did you come all the way here for? 

82
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,400
 You're always like that. 

83
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,640
 You're the one who called me and yet says, "What did you come all the way here for?" 

84
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,750
 Can't you just speak without any twisted meanings or feeling me out for once? 

85
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,310
 I warned you that it wouldn't be a good idea for you to come here. 

86
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,410
 I liked you because you were smart, but why are you disappointing me like this? 

87
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,280
 So you liked me? 

88
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,470
 I didn't like you at all. 

89
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,860
 How funny. 

90
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,460
 Why don't old geezers know their place? 

91
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,800
 They don't have any shame, either. 

92
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,210
 I told you. 

93
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,320
 I told you more than a dozen times! 

94
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,650
 I'll abort the child and leave this country if you give me money. 

95
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,850
 Do my words not sound like words to you? 

96
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,890
 Must you show your ugly true colors like this? 

97
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,300
 That's right. 

98
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,030
 So make a deposit. 

99
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,250
 Or else I'll jump off from here and die. 

100
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,950
 What are you doing? 

101
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,810
 If I die pregnant with your child, 

102
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,340
 it would be so entertaining, right? 

103
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
 Make a deposit! 

104
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,550
 Or else I'll jump off and die from the great TK Law Firm that you're so proud of! 

105
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,970
 All right, I understand. 

106
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,730
 I understand, so come down. All right? 

107
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,590
 Don't do anything dangerous. 

108
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,470
 Stop acting like you're worried all of a sudden and make the deposit first. 

109
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,460
 Five billion won. 

110
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,410
 You should at least give me that much. 

111
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,510
 Disciplinary Committee of Oh Su Jae: 2nd live broadcast 

112
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,870
 Material Witness Seat 

113
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,630
 I am TK Law Firm's Chief of Secretary, Ha Il Gu. 

114
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,110
 I was planning to dispose of the CCTV footage of Chairman Choi Tae Gook 

115
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,380
 pushing Park So Yeong, 

116
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,880
 but I held onto a separate copy, just in case 

117
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,220
 and recently handed it over to Attorney Oh Su Jae directly. 

118
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,430
 Resignation Letter 

119
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,540
 Chairman, 

120
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,890
 my son wrote me a letter before he died. 

121
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,850
 "Dad, please live comfortably now." 

122
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,500
  So you're saying to even go so far as to record a suicide note? 

123
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,750
 So do you have a body to put in my place? 

124
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,270
 You think I can't find one? 

125
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,500
 I made arrangements for the death of a younger friend of mine 

126
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,920
 I've known for a long time to follow your orders. 

127
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,890
 Drink that and be quiet. 

128
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,760
I'll let you go tomorrow.

129
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,410
For real? Right?

130
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,120
Thank you!

131
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,500
 I trusted you and followed your command 

132
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,270
 to hurt Kim Dong Gu and even let No Byeong Chool die. 

133
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,630
 If you do that, I'll take responsibility for the rest. 

134
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,400
 Don't worry about that part. 

135
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,070
 Upon seeing you dumping everything on me, 

136
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,020
 I was able to make a decision. 

137
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,760
 Of course, I will pay for my crimes. 

138
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,870
 From, Ha Il Gu. 

139
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,240
- Father. 
 - Yes, Son.

140
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,110
The things that were in the secret space in your library,

141
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,820
I'm the one who handed them over to Noona.

142
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,470
What?

143
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,020
You did?

144
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,540
Why would you?

145
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm sorry, Father.

146
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,410
Please stop all of this here.

147
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,070
What?

148
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,230
Do you know how I have lived?

149
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,500
You, my own son.

150
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,170
- You dare to— 
 - Father!

151
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,900
There's not a single moment of my life that I'm ashamed of.

152
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:52,290
I was always fierce and always did my best.

153
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,100
Father.

154
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,820
Please pay for your crimes.

155
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,640
Get out!

156
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,760
I never want to see you again.

157
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,030
Get the hell out now.

158
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,510
Assemblyman, ten years ago, the disciplinary action subject

159
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,440
made a deal regarding the trial she represented as a public defender.

160
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,630
Director Baek Jin Gi proposed to the disciplinary action subject,

161
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,900
 that if she gave up the active defense of the Kim Dong Gu trial, 

162
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,260
  he would let her join the TK Law Firm and 
   

163
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,380
and as a result, the disciplinary action subject was able to enter TK Law Firm.

164
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,680
She made a deal with something as sacred as a trial.

165
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,150
If that's true,

166
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,710
that's a violation of Paragraph 2 of Article 24 of the Attorney Act,

167
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,920
Breach of Concealment of Truth and Prohibition of Perjury.

168
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,460
This is an issue where heavy punishment can be imposed on the disciplinary action subject,

169
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,200
regardless of who killed Park So Yeong.

170
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,620
Isn't that right?

171
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,820
Well...

172
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,140
doesn't that reflect Chairman Choi's opinion?

173
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,090
That means Chairman Choi also took part in the deal.

174
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,890
That's not true. Father did not know about the deal at all.

175
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,470
It was between the disciplinary action subject and Director Baek Jin Gi.

176
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,070
Director Baek used Father's name

177
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,000
to better his own life and suggested the trade.

178
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,590
Disciplinary Action Subject.

179
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,610
Do you admit to these claims?

180
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,290
I admit to them.

181
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,740
 Chair 

182
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,410
I request that you call the defendant at the time,

183
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,880
Kim Dong Gu to the Material Witness Seat.

184
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,890
If the incident ten years ago is mentioned,

185
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,120
Gong Chan will come forth as Kim Dong Gu.

186
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,430
Have that in mind.

187
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,140
Gong Chan?

188
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,230
Gong Chan was Kim Dong Gu?

189
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,470
You didn't know?

190
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,770
That arrogant brat was Kim Dong Gu?

191
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,480
Catch up on your studies and conduct your investigation.

192
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,200
If that case is mentioned along with No Byeong Chool,

193
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,820
you will also be sweating since you put No Byung Chool in jail.

194
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,330
Are you going to let them see that you're sweating in the Chair's seat?

195
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,020
Kim Dong Gu?

196
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,700
Kim Dong Gu is here?

197
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,910
Let's call him over if he is here. 
 Hong Gi Pyo 

198
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,570
We need to hear from the party concerned as well.

199
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,390
Kim Dong Gu.

200
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,840
Please proceed to the Material Witness Seat.

201
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,750
My name is Kim Dong Gu.

202
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,370
 Ten years ago, I was forced to falsely confess 

203
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,010
 because of the abuse from the police and the prosecution. 

204
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,620
 No one was willing to listen to me 
    

205
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,840
 or believe my story. 
    

206
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,110
 Everyone tormented me so that I would say 

207
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,830
 that I was the culprit. 

208
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,120
 I knew then how much of hell it is 

209
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,970
 when no one listens to or believes you in this world. 

210
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,820
And then...

211
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,020
I met a person who said she believed me.

212
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,190
That is the disciplinary action subject,

213
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,860
Attorney Oh Su Jae.

214
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,570
After I met her as my public defender,

215
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,550
I was able to plead not guilty.

216
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,970
 But it was difficult to prove 
   

217
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,100
 that the false confession was because of the abuse from the police and prosecution. 

218
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,570
The investigation room did not have a CCTV at the time

219
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,930
 and the abusive acts toward me 

220
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,990
were done in secret.

221
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,680
However, we found out that there were abusive acts at the time.

222
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,620
I was also the newbie detective of the team at the time.

223
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,270
 At the time, Chief Kang Gil Ju ordered us to 

224
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,080
 get the confession from Kim Dong Gu, 

225
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,960
 saying he's the culprit by whatever means possible. 

226
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,190
 Chief Kang also had close relationship with the prosecution, 

227
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,800
 and the prosecutor in charge was Prosecutor Seo Joon Myeong. 

228
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,480
That crazy bastard.

229
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,650
The reason why Kim Dong Gu was found guilty

230
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,110
was because his DNA and fingerprints were found on the knife.

231
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,980
We had his confession and his fingerprint as reinforcing evidence

232
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,090
which more than sufficed to prove him guilty!

233
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,510
However, the confession was falsely provided due to abusive acts

234
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,780
and doesn't qualify as evidence according to Section 309 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

235
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,630
Besides Kim Dong Gu's fingerprint,

236
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,100
two additional unknown fingerprints were found on the knife.

237
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,080
Since his confession was found to be false,

238
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,670
the unknown fingerprints' identities become more crucial.

239
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,370
Did you find out the owners of those two fingerprints?

240
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,430
We did.

241
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,730
Fingerprint 1 belongs to the late Jeon Na Jeong.

242
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,090
Fingerprint 2...

243
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,870
belongs to Chairman Choi Tae Gook.

244
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,310
 - What is this? 
 - What does this mean? 

245
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,910
This shows the possibility that Jeon Na Jeong

246
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,420
instinctively blocked the knife with her hands and

247
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,370
that Chairman Choi Tae Gook had stabbed and killed Jeon Na Jeong, who was still alive.

248
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,200
That's not true!

249
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,570
We killed Jeon Na Jeong.

250
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,930
Han Dong Oh, Lee Shi Hyeok, and I killed her.

251
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,560
We killed her!

252
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,240
CEO, please calm down.

253
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,440
Calm down.

254
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,530
Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong Oh, and Lee Si Hyeok.

255
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,720
Those three might have believed that they killed Jeon Na Jeong

256
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,520
up until now, but it is not true.

257
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,220
 The three of you brought the girl here. 

258
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,640
 The three of you also killed her. 

259
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,450
 Is that right? 

260
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,660
 Is that right! 

261
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,870
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

262
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,680
 Get lost. 

263
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,120
 I'm really sorry father. 

264
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,240
 You listen to me right now. 

265
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,820
 If someone asks you about today, 

266
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,690
 your answer is "I don't know." 

267
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,830
 Only that one answer. 

268
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,090
 Nothing happened to you today, okay? 

269
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,140
 Do you understand? 

270
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,420
 Yes. 

271
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,430
 Yes, Father. 

272
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,820
 After arriving at the scene, Chairman Choi 

273
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,300
 sent Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong Oh, and Lee Si Hyeok home. 

274
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:15,200
 He noticed that Jeon Na Jeong who he assumed was dead was actually alive. And then he killed her. 

275
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,280
Are you writing a novel right now?

276
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,380
These are mere speculations! You have no evidence!

277
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,700
I do have the evidence.

278
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,460
 Chairman Choi Tae Gook's Chief of Secretary, Ha Il Gu. 

279
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,270
The evidence is the video that he secretly recorded that night.

280
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,610
Chairman Choi killed Jeon Na Jeong with a knife that was in Chairman Han's house

281
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,010
and wiped the blood with a handkerchief that Ha Il Gu gave him.

282
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,280
 Ha Il Gu kept that handkerchief until now and 

283
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,330
gave it to us.

284
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,380
No...

285
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,240
The handkerchief has a particular print on it.

286
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,340
 Disciplinary Committee of Oh Su Jae: 2nd live broadcast 

287
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,220
 You can see that the print matches the pattern on Chairman Choi's ring that he always wears. 

288
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,170
Please proceed to the Material Witness Seat again, Ha Il Gu.

289
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,800
What relationship did you have with Chairman Choi at the time,

290
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,410
and how did you end up taking that hidden video?

291
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,110
Long before the incident,

292
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,200
I'd been doing the errands and

293
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,300
providing information for Chairman Choi while I was in a crime organization.

294
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,600
I had a bad feeling about how he called

295
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,680
me over to Chairman Han's house that night.

296
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,610
I filmed that video

297
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:27,500
out of fear that I might be used as a scapegoat for everything.

298
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,150
What did you do after?

299
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,480
Jeon Na Jeong, who was killed by Chairman,

300
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,110
 was tied up with compression tape. 

301
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,170
 I took the tape off of her and 

302
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,840
 while I was abandoning the body at the construction site, 

303
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,100
 - Someone help! 
 - Kim Dong Gu came and found the body. 

304
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,830
 Please hel— 

305
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,210
 I had to frame him as the culprit. 

306
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,250
I would like to offer Kim Dong Gu...

307
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,330
my sincerest apologies for what I did.

308
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,510
I'm sorry.

309
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,760
 This is where you bastards trampled on 
   

310
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,220
 my daughter, Jeon Na Jeong, and Kim Dong Gu.  

311
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,390
 How foolish of you not to recognize the place even with the photo. 

312
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,810
 You'll pay for your shamelessness. 

313
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,460
Yesterday, you all must have heard the name

314
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,720
Kang Eun Seo at the confirmation hearing of Candidate Baek.

315
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,700
On the day of Jeon Na Jeong's death,

316
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,520
 the reason why the three men kidnapped Jeon Na Jeong 

317
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,730
 and dragged her to Chairman Han's house was because of Kang Eun Seo. 

318
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,980
 Kang Eun Seo, who was taken to Chairman Han's house, 

319
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,360
 lost her earring while running away from the house. 

320
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,620
This is a picture of Kang Eun Seo's earring that I found at Chairman Han's house

321
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,200
which I had purchased.

322
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,640
Kang Eun Seo met the

323
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,870
 part-timer Jeon Na Jeong while running away. 

324
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,100
 Jeon Na Jeong then put on her uniform on Kang Eun Seo. 

325
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,030
This is Jeon Na Jeong's uniform that

326
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,280
 Attorney Oh's team found. 
   

327
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,230
This analysis result shows that the bloodstains

328
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,470
on the uniform were identified as Kang Eun Seo's.

329
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,110
Kang Eun Seo, who is the daughter of Candidate Baek and also my fiancée,

330
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:22,350
was kidnapped and violated by Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong Oh, and Lee Si Hyeok.

331
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,070
Jeon Na Jeong was also kidnapped by them.

332
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,770
And Lee In Su, Han Seong Beom, and Choi Tae Gook had conspired to cover their sons' crimes.

333
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,390
Also, shielding them from judgment were

334
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,600
the police, prosecution, court, and the press.

335
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,580
I hope that they all receive their proper consequences.

336
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,020
 I offer my sincerest thanks to Attorney Oh Su Jae, 

337
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,330
 who stepped forward to reveal the truth, which is not an easy task.

 Choi Tae Gook, Han Seong Beom, Lee In Su 

341
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,780
He forced the investigating agency to violate the victim's rights to make him falsely confess

342
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,380
and refused to accept it when we attempted to correct the false confession

343
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,420
at the trial, by turning it into an issue of trust.

344
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,460
The police, prosecution, and court

345
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,860
treated the trial like a theater play,

346
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:30,070
repeatedly shielded the organized crimes of those who mock judicial justice.

347
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,870
They willingly used the press to strengthen their fortress.

348
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,920
I also was surrounded by their influence not realizing how shameful my life was.

349
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,410
I confess those embarrassments and

350
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:50,030
no matter what kind of punishment that may fall on me, I'll willingly accept that decision.

 Korean Bar Association | Attorney Disciplinary Committee 

352
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,620
Since the chair and some of the committee members

353
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,030
were found to be involved in the mentioned incidents,

354
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,650
the current committee has lost the right to punish the disciplinary action subject.

355
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,200
 Disciplinary Action Subject, Oh Su Jae  
 What the disciplinary action subject— No.

356
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,950
Attorney Oh has exposed

357
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,760
shall be followed up thoroughly by the investigating agency.

358
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,550
Also, as a fellow disciplinary committee member,

359
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:27,050
I confess that this disciplinary committee was highly flawed from the beginning.

360
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:31,520
The committee was formed due to Chairman Choi's influence in the legal field.

361
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,790
Some committee members' objections were not heard.

362
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,140
I apologize to Attorney Oh and the nation,

363
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,270
and offer my respect to Attorney Oh and her team for their lonely fight to

364
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:48,860
reveal the truth about the death of Park So Yeong and Hong Seok Pal as well as the incident from ten years ago.

365
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,240
Ajumma.

366
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,270
Dong Gu.

367
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,870
Thank you.

368
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,920
Thank you so much, Dong Gu.

369
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,340
Ajumma.

370
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,010
I'm sorry it was so late.

371
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,630
Not at all.

372
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,070
Thank you.

373
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,910
 Hansu Bio has 

374
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,230
 made a false impression that the clinical trial of their new pipeline drug has been approved. 

375
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,130
 It was also found that they've committed deal-breaking acts such as accounting fraud 

376
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,750
 and money laundering through a paper company. 

377
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,930
 This violates the seller's statements and guarantees. 

378
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,570
 Thus, SP Partners reserves the sole right to cancel the agreement. 

379
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:04,860
 The down payment and the cancellation penalty shall be refunded to us. 

380
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,930
Father.

381
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,910
Why?

382
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,920
Jeon Na Jeong.

383
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,470
Did you really kill her?

384
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,400
No, right?

385
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,000
Dong Oh, Si Hyeok, and I killed her, right?

386
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,440
And you just told Chief Ha to clean it up.

387
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,590
That's the truth, Father. Isn't it?

388
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,300
It was all for you.

389
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,650
What?

390
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,140
You're wrong, Father. That's...

391
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,360
That's not for me at all.

392
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,550
You know how sorry I was to you and how much I agonized.

393
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,790
That's why I followed your orders without complaint.

394
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,210
I broke up with Su Jae because you told me to and

395
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,220
also made it look like Seung Yeon gave birth to Jae Yi.

396
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,960
So I did all that.

397
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,580
I did everything!

398
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,160
Everything for that reason, Father!

399
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,130
It was revealed that Candidate Lee In Su and his son

400
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,320
were also involved in the matters discussed in Attorney Oh's disciplinary meeting.

401
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,620
Are they all true?

402
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,890
They are all true.

403
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,750
 - What? 
 - What's happening now? 

404
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
 Are our sons' mistakes all taken care of? 

405
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,950
 You got rid of the body as well? 

406
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,480
 Yes, Sunbaenim. 

407
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,810
 We're on the same boat now. 

408
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,150
 Chairman Han, Inspector General Choi Tae Gook, and me, Lee In Su. 

409
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,190
 We're now hashing together toward our future. 

410
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,470
Ten years ago, Assemblyman Lee In Su colluded with

411
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,710
Chairman Choi Tae Gook and Chairman Han Seong Beom to

412
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,560
cover up the crimes of his son, Lee Si Hyeok,

413
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,480
Chairman's son, Choi Ju Wan, and

414
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,240
Chairman Han's son, Han Dong Oh.

415
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,500
He also has a legal responsibility for the death of Park So Yeong and Hong Seok Pal.

416
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,250
As of today,

417
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,070
I resign from the spokeswoman position.

418
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,890
SP Partners claimed that they reserve the sole right to cancel the agreement

419
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,590
and ordered the refund of the down payment and the cancellation penalty.

420
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,420
Will Hansu Group accept that?

421
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,890
They probably should accept it, don't you think?

422
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,000
Chairman Han Seong Beom's money laundering operation through a paper company

423
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,740
deeply involves TK Law Firm Chairman Choi and Assemblyman Lee.

424
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,560
The issue of Hansu Bio's third-stage trial drug. 
    Hansu Bio Pipeline Drug Trial Stage Victims Documentation 

425
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,210
It's true that they attempted to conceal the truth about the victims of trials,

426
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,510
and both Chairman Han and Managing Director Han are

427
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,430
deeply involved in the crimes that Attorney Oh exposed.

428
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,910
I apologize as Head of the Legal Department

429
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,010
and resign from the position as of today.

430
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,520
 Su Jae, my last act was not bad, thanks to you. 

431
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,750
 We three should grab a drink together, Su Jae. 

432
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,230
 Kwang Jin Barber Shop 

433
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,800
 Hansu Group, TK Law Firm, 

434
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,520
 and SP Partners' acquisition are hot issues. 

435
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,370
 According to the agreement terms, Hansu Group and TK Law Firm 

436
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:35,590
 were found liable for an astronomical amount of money owed to SP Partners. 

437
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,830
 As such, both companies and their subsidiaries 

438
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,800
 are on the verge of bankruptcy as well. 

439
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,100
 That is not all. 

440
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,960
 Assemblyman Lee In Su, is no longer a candidate since 

441
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,350
 his candidacy was cancelled. 

442
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,880
 Assemblyman Lee, Chairman Han Seong Beom, Chairman Choi Tae Gook, and 

443
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,130
 their sons now need to be investigated. 

444
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,240
 Tomorrow morning, there will be an emergency arrest. 

445
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,650
 This is my last time contacting you.

  Oh Su Jae, Partner Lawyer 

448
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,650
Ta-da.

449
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,050
What are you thinking so hard about?

450
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,150
How should I live from now on?

451
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,750
What is a good life?

452
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,760
A proper life?

453
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,420
Whatever it is, do it freely.

454
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,480
Slowly.

455
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,670
As happily as possible.

456
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,800
It doesn't matter if you fail on the way.

457
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,480
What?

458
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,700
Since I'll be by your side no matter what.

459
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,920
 In the world that's never fair, 

460
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,300
 where things have never been equal nor balanced, 

461
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,920
 the law must be applied to everyone fairly and equally. 

462
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,620
 You must do your due diligence to undertake the responsibility of this solemn duty.

 Youngpyeong District Promotion Center Opening Ceremony 

465
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,940
 It was so close. 

466
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:57,030
I was almost there.

467
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,520
 Oh Su Jae 

468
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,810
 Oh Su Jae 

469
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,300
 Yes, Chairman. 

470
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,910
Hey!

471
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,280
You are the only one.

472
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,340
 The only one who answers my call. 

473
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,470
  You are the only one. 

474
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,310
You seem drunk.

475
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,990
You should stop now, Chairman.

476
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:56,140
How would it have been if I hadn't raised you?

477
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,410
 If I 

478
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,650
 had taken you in as my daughter-in-law, 

479
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,760
 how would it have been? 

480
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,330
 Would we have still ended up here? 

481
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,140
But Su Jae,

482
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,900
I have always been fierce.

483
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,580
I did my best every moment.

484
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,850
 No, Chairman. 

485
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,690
You can't call that your best.

486
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,450
That was an act of evil.

487
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,430
No, it was not evil.

488
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,470
That was the best for my life.

489
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,230
That power protected me.

490
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,520
That's how I came up this far.

491
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,650
You should regret it.

492
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,060
You should be ashamed.

493
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,920
 You should be humiliated. 

494
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,700
That's...

495
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,640
what weak people

496
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,810
do.

497
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:18,770
I'm not... ashamed of my life.

498
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,200
 Just one. 

499
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,630
 The only regret I have is... 

500
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:33,120
letting you into my fence...

501
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,960
again.

502
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,430
 Although you 

503
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:47,660
 stopped me this time. 

504
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,210
Don't...

505
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,480
be mistaken... and think...

506
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,160
that you won.

507
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,250
Where are you right now?

508
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,580
You... did not...

509
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,470
beat me...

510
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,230
did not beat me...

511
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,360
Chairman. Hello? Chairman!

512
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,350
Is something wrong?

513
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,110
One second.

514
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,650
  119 
 (T/N: Korean 119, emergency number same as US 911.) 

515
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,790
TK Law Firm.

516
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:35,080
Chairman Choi is intoxicated and behaving abnormaly.

517
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,140
 They're my position. All the positions at TK. 
   

518
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,910
 Are mine. 

519
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,280
 Intern, associate, partner, CEO. 

520
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,790
 Even the security guard and maintenance positions. 

521
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,540
 They're all my positions. 

522
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,390
 They're here! 

523
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,450
Do you admit to the paper company money laundering?

524
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,590
How do you feel about the prosecution investigation?

525
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,000
Is the Hansu Bio clinical trial concealment true?

526
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,110
Where did the Hansu Group slush fund go?

527
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,460
I'm an honest person, you know.

528
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,440
See? I'm not making a show on a wheelchair and pretending to be sick like others.

529
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,490
I did do some bad things.

530
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,510
But the real bad guy is the dead Choi Tae Gook.

531
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,690
I'm sure he went to hell.

532
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:40,870
Hansu Group's slush fund. Where did it go?

533
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:47,490
It's a little late for me to say this, but beware who you befriend.

534
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,030
- Please answer! 
 - Wait!

535
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,060
- Assemblyman Lee In Su. 
 - Stop him!

536
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,870
What was that!

537
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,040
It's okay. Let him be.

538
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,980
It's fine. It's fine, everyone.

539
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,440
Don't worry. Everyone.

540
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,150
I'm okay.

541
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:23,520
I'll be forgiven by the people of this nation.

542
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,730
I'll be sure to come back alive!

543
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,590
 - Hang in there! 
 - You're the best! 

544
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,820
 "Fair Country, New Country" 
 "Carry on, Lee In Su!" 

545
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,990
 Choi Tae Gook 

546
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,550
Your Honor,

547
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,820
the defendant has committed a grave crime.

548
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,940
In 2008, after receiving a request from Chairman Geum Se Yeong of Geummyeong Savings Bank

549
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,920
to make a trial go in his favor,

550
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,720
he pressured his junior, who was the judge in charge

551
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,890
and received 200 million won from an illegal lender for introducing him to Chairman Geum.

552
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,190
However, Your Honor,

553
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,710
the defendant is sincerely regretful of his crimes and

554
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,850
had a difficult time taking care of

555
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,500
his daughter, who suffered from a mental disorder, as a result of being the victim of a crime.

556
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,740
He also strived to reveal the truth of the said crime.

557
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,540
Lastly, he donated the entirety of his assets to the

558
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,980
victims of the Geummyeong Savings Bank scheme.

559
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,850
His efforts to secure practical compensation for them.

560
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,640
Please take those facts into consideration.

561
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,920
Defendant. Do you have anything you'd like to say?

562
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,370
 Defendant 

563
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:20,610
I've been extending my pathetic life pitifully.

564
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,600
It was a shameful life, looking back.

565
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,040
Thanks to Attorney Oh Su Jae,

566
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:33,180
my daughter's resentment was relieved and the pile of evil acts was excavated.

567
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,570
Above all, thanks to Attorney Oh,

568
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,120
I can stand here today and

569
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,130
face the consequences of my crimes today.

570
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,880
Thank you.

571
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,790
Your Honor.

572
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,810
Please give me a severe sentence.

573
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,200
Anyone who commits a crime should be punished.

574
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,650
More than anything,

575
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:06,430
please show that a legal professional needs to be punished more heavily.

576
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,530
 6 Months Later 

577
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,300
Long time no see, Attorney Oh.

578
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,440
Father asked me to say hi to you for him.

579
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,810
Is he doing well?

580
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,580
Yes.

581
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,530
He said his heart is at ease.

582
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:57,430
I'm a bit worried because Eun Seo seems to be looking for him.

583
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,820
I came to make a suggestion.

584
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,210
I want to invest in your Central Law Office.

585
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,560
Why don't you build a large law firm properly?

586
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,050
And provide legal advice for my company as well.

587
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:19,130
Hansu Group is still being obnoxious about the agreement cancellation.

588
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:24,590
I'm grateful for the suggestion, but I'll have to turn it down.

589
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,830
I'm happy as I am now.

590
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,530
I'm curious about what makes you so happy.

591
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:35,130
Because you do really look happy.

592
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,330
The fact that every day is entirely mine.

593
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:47,200
That I move and decide with my own will.

594
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,430
That the results are also entirely mine.

595
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,200
Those things were more decent than I thought.

596
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,940
Whether the results are good or bad.

597
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,490
I rejoice in the good things, and if not,

598
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:05,850
just say, "So what?" curse and move on.

599
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,070
Or I don't.

600
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,140
Funny, right?

601
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,500
But I'm

602
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,820
content with myself living this way now.

603
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,600
I envy you.

604
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,910
Congratulations.

605
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,880
 Legal Clinic Center Additional Recruitment. 

606
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,510
 At Legal Clinic Center, 

607
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,880
 we plan to provide class action lawsuit and legal advice 

608
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,310
 for victims of the Hansu Bio trial drug. 
    

609
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:52,490
 We ask for active participation from you, the students. /   

610
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,500
   

611
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,790
Here she goes again.

612
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:04,010
Of course she's consistent.

613
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,440
Not even ten minutes left.

614
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:41,490
  I will never send my client to jail. 

615
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:48,020
This is the first and the last Practical Fundamentals for Lawyers class.

616
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,060
However,

617
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,540
there are things that you need to observe as a lawyer.

618
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,670
Just because you know the law a little, don't abuse the law to suit your taste or

619
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,410
abuse it for specific interests or for specific people.

620
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:10,330
The law needs to be fair and just for anyone and everyone.

621
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,310
Another one.

622
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,700
Every law has a loophole.

623
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:20,560
One of the lawyer's skills is to find that loophole and use it to your clients' advantage.

624
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,880
I also became the so-called "successful lawyer" with that tactic.

625
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,920
Nonetheless, standing before you,

626
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,680
I am not a successful lawyer.

627
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:37,480
My success involved many shameful moments.

628
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,010
Because I have lots of regrets and shame,

629
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:45,050
I plan to become a lawyer who's no longer like that.

630
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,130
A lawyer who isn't regarded as being anyone special.

631
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,820
Rather than the success itself,

632
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:58,620
think more about how you will proceed toward that success.

633
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,980
I hope you all contemplate that more fiercely.

634
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:07,180
Lastly, protect yourself in any situation.

635
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:13,930
Never let anyone control you and become a firmly rooted lawyer.

636
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,570
This semester is the same.

637
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,910
Lectures, once in a while.

638
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,120
What? Again?

639
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,560
- You don't mean... 
 - No way...

640
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,600
Your entire grade will be on verdict analysis, 100 percent.

641
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,790
One hundred percent?

642
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,770
There are some things that I promised the top student last semester.

643
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,400
Twenty million won, enough to cover one year's worth of tuition plus extra.

644
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,660
TK Law Firm intern lawyer employment.

645
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:49,320
Of these, the 20 million won plus extra was awarded last year.

646
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,710
You're here, right? The one who received my money?

647
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:55,760
- Who is it? 
 - Is it her?

648
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,870
Is it you?

649
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:19,090
I'm going to be an intern at your law office instead of an intern at the TK law firm, right?

650
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,390
Never mind if you don't like it.

651
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,670
What do you mean?

652
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:24,090
I'll be there for sure.

653
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:32,300
You can leave now if you don't like my way.

654
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,840
- This is nonsense. 
 - You should stay.

655
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:47,990
This is Legal Clinic Center's guest lawyer, Attorney Song Mi Rim.

656
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:49,740
Seek her help whenever

657
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,250
you have a question about the verdicts.

658
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,600
Since I know a thing or two about these,

659
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,130
your questions are welcome anytime.

660
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,470
There is no "20 million won plus extra " this semester.

661
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,970
- What? 
 - Then why am I here?

662
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,110
I'm broke.

663
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:13,450
Everyone, come up and take a copy each.

664
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:51,390
Had I known, I would've carried a prettier umbrella.

665
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:54,640
♫  And you say the place before we both liked it  ♫

666
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,290
Let's go.

667
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:05,410
♫  Passed the bedtime, you gave the halo away  ♫

668
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:13,500
♫  Try to be okay, be all right  ♫

669
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:21,160
♫  Cause I, I always break down when you cry  ♫

670
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:27,330
♫  What about us? We could have all  ♫

671
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:30,640
 Why Her? 

672
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,770
♫  Forget about that  ♫

673
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:38,700
♫  When I lose control, I wanna hold you back  ♫

674
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,850
♫  What about us?  ♫

675
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:49,500
♫  What about us us today?  ♫

676
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:56,510

678
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:08,420

679
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:15,420

680
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:21,430

681
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:27,480

682
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:49,490
 Why Her? 

683
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:57,760
