1
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,570
 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,660
 Then, think carefully. 

3
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,170
 How you'll take care of Park So Yeong. 

4
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,060
 Take care of what? 

5
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,400
 Why would I do that? Huh? 

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,460
 You know what you do best. 

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,070
 Burying people without anyone knowing. 

8
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,140
Hey, Chief is asking for you.

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:04,890


10
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,770
First, I'll strategize...

11
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,390
I'll make sure you don't get an arrest warrant...

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,930
So...

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,820
So, you have to be honest with me.

14
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,170
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,030
Hong Seok Pal's video is so shocking.

16
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,850
I'm sorry, Attorney.

17
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,740
Mi Rim.

18
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,660
Attorney Oh, I'm not sure about this, to be honest.

19
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,420
I shouldn't be doubting you, but

20
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,850
you did tell Hong Seok Pal to kill Park So Yeong, right?

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,530
I could recognize your voice even in my sleep.

22
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,020
That's your voice on the recording.

23
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,130
Where you said "Bury Park So Yeong..." That part...

24
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,890
That's right.

25
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,980
Her devoted subordinate is doubtful.

26
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,480
You did say that, right... Attorney, Oh?

27
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,160
That's right. Admit it.

28
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,020
Mi Rim...

29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,550
Hey, what's that?

30
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,170
What?

31
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,830
What's going on?

32
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,020
What did you say to her?

33
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,640
I dropped it and picked it up.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,850
I asked what you said to her!

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,570
She told me to get lost! Why?

36
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,510
What did she say? Huh?

37
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,650
What did you whisper to her?

38
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,580
Who's all shaken up over a whisper?

39
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,340
What the hell is she saying?

40
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,290
Hey, do it right!

41
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,500
  Episode 8   
 Chief Kang!

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,180
  Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office 

43
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,470
The right of prosecution and police investigation was reformed a long time ago.

44
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,730
How dare you tell me to turn the case over to you?

45
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,010
The police are still in the middle of the investigation.

46
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,490
We're already investigating Park So Yeong's death.

47
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,660
Since the police made a huge mistake of concluding her death

48
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,340
as a suicide when in fact was a murder.

49
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,640
This has nothing to do with that case!

50
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,530
No, it's not.

51
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,850
Hong Seok Pal even left a suicide video saying that he killed Park So Yeong.

52
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,340
This case should be investigated with Park So Yeong's murder case.

53
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,910
Of course, as for necessary investigation,

54
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,150
we'll make our request to the police.

55
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,330
But Chief...

56
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,020
Inside the guest ledger that Hong Seok Pal left behind, your name came up

57
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,710
like you were his best friend.

58
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,340
I'll request an additional investigation from you if necessary.

59
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,650
  Establishing Law and Order 

60
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,830
You can place the basket in an empty spot on the shelves,

61
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,540
and you can use the blanket underneath.

62
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,090
All right!

63
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,520
- Whoa! 
 - Hey, hey, hey...

64
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,350
Godori is the best! 
  (T/N: A winning move in Go-Stop game.) 

65
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,140
- You like it, right? 
 - Let's go!

66
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,780
- Geez... 
 - Come on...

67
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,760
There!

68
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,470
Oh, I've seen her in the news.

69
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,560
Attorney Oh Su Jae!

70
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,490
You're her, right?

71
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,160
Wow, a powerful bitch joined us.

72
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,770
There!

73
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,600
It's not her?

74
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,860
It's really not Professor's voice?

75
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,890
"Bury Park So Yeong..." That one?

76
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,210
No.

77
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,710
She definitely said it wasn't her.

78
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,090
I didn't say the last part.

79
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,520
The last part isn't my voice. Find out about that.

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,810
How about other stuff?

81
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,800
"Think carefully about how you'll take care of Park So Yeong..." How about that one?

82
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,110
That was her.

83
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,490
She told me that she had said that on the phone with Hong Seok Pal.

84
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,320
Then out of the phone call, the beginning part is her voice and the last part is fake?

85
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,670
Why? Why only that part?

86
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,210
To fabricate a voice, you need several hours of voice data

87
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,140
and you have to give it to a specialist.

88
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,850
That's pretty cumbersome.

89
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,510
The charge of inciting murder...

90
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,580
"Take care" is somewhat vague...

91
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,220
They needed her to say "Bury her."

92
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,940
- Since that clearly means to kill her. 
 - Yeah.

93
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,760
He looked for ways to avoid the blame, even after making up his mind to die.

94
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,850
That guy is really...

95
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,500
Hong Seok Pal had come to the law firm before.

96
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,600
He said he had something to say about Park So Yeong.

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,720
He asked to meet with Chairman Choi.

98
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,330
Why would Hong Seok Pal...

99
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,230
He couldn't meet Chairman,

100
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,550
 and he met Chief Ha briefly. 

101
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,910
That was a week before he died.

102
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,460
We should trace back Hong Seok Pal's whereabouts for that week.

103
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,250
He had to have made up the fake voice

104
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,030
and had to prepare for a car explosion.

105
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,130
He must've been busy.

106
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,760
But why didn't you tell the police?

107
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,750
The fact that it's not Professor Oh's voice?

108
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,630
Is it that you couldn't do it or didn't want to do it?

109
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,320
Since Attorney Oh only told me in secret,

110
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,880
it means she doesn't trust anyone.

111
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,370
Not the police nor prosecutors. Not even the law firm.

112
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,410
Geez, this is crazy...

113
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,130
  Attorney Oh Su Jae, charged with inciting murder and abetting suicide 

114
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,730
Crazy trash reporters!

115
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,670
This is just the beginning.

116
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,800
They'll say worse things, and they'll become facts

117
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
and she'll be marked a culprit even before the trial.

118
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,150
  Suspect 

119
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,260
 Die, you bastard! 

120
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,250
 Come on! 

121
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,490
 You killed her!  

122
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,540
 - You devil! 
 - Are you even human?  

123

  Suspect 

124
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,950
 It's hell. 

125
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,060
We must find evidence that proves Professor's innocence as soon as possible.

126
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,060
We can't let her go through such hell.

127
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,440
We must save her.

128
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,360
When you visit her tomorrow, tell her not to worry

129
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,850
and that we'll rescue her for sure.

130
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,760
For inciting the murder of Park So Yeong

131
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,710
and abetting Hong Seok Pal's suicide,

132
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,650
the search and seizure of Attorney Oh Su Jae's office and residence have begun.

133
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,210
This case has been forwarded to the prosecution working on a relevant case.

134
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,050
The police are continuing to provide additional investigation efforts. 
  TK Law Firm 

135
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,720
Assemblyman An Gang Hoon, who came up as the reason for

136
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,300
Attorney Oh inciting Park So Yeong's murder,

137
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,500
made his statement before he left for the United Kingdom.

138
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,800
That's right. 
   According to Assemblyman An Gang Hoon, 

139
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,550
He said he's never even met Attorney Oh Su Jae in person. 
   According to Assemblyman An Gang Hoon 

140
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,320
He's offended by the allegation of his involvement with deceased Park So Yeong. 
   According to Assemblyman An Gang Hoon 

141
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,610
And says that he has never even heard of the name Hong Seok Pal. 
  "Will take legal actions for misinformation" 

142
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,850
If his name is mentioned again as relevant to this case, 
  "Will take legal actions for misinformation" 

143
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,410
he said he'll take legal action.

144
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,390
 Assemblyman An Gang Hoon is firm on his stance. 

145
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,210
 Yes, Assemblyman An Gang Hoon... 

146
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,800
All the documents are password-protected so it will take some time to open them.

147
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,030
But they're indeed Chief Han Gi Taek's files.

148
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,440
Good work.

149
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,550
And this is

150
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,390
from Police Chief Kang Gil Ju. He asked me to give it to you.

151
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,780
He said he found it while searching through Attorney Oh's home.

  Police Chief Kang Gil Ju 

153
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,010
Hey, Chief Kang.

154
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,070
 Chairman, I went through the things we found during the search and seizure 

155
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,470
and gave it a first look.

156
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,260
I didn't find much in them

157
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,610
except for the thing I gave Chief Ha.

158
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,760
I'm not sure if Attorney Oh was pregnant or not.

159
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,770
 In any case, I sent it over to you, so you can look at it. 

160
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,040
Okay, will do.

Did you get to eat something?

How did you sleep?

169
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,370
It was okay.

The pre-arrest interrogation was set for tomorrow afternoon.

171

And...

172
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,660
It's gone, huh?

173
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,510
Yes.

 Chairman Han, Assemblyman Lee, and you Chairman Choi... 

178
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,530
 These are footage of you enjoying yourselves in my bar. 

179
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,340
 I didn't make any copies. I swear it on my life. 

180
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,610
 I'm telling the truth! 

181
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,530
 And... 

182
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,300
 the trouble I've caused 

183
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,610
 sending you, Chairman Han, and Assemblyman Lee this footage  

184
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,640
 is because I was sad about being left out of the Yeongpyeong District project. 

185
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,140
 To be honest, I put my life on the line to be loyal to the three of you. 

186
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,460
 But it was so unfair, and I got so upset 

187
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,970
 You didn't think about the consequences of being so troublesome? 

188
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,880
 My apologies, Chairman! 

189
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,950
 I deserve to die, Chairman! 

190
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,350
 Assemblyman Lee is especially angry and says to get rid of you. 

191
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,240
 Chairman Han also agreed. 

192
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,730
 But I have no intention of doing that. 

193
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,960
 I like you, Hong Seok Pal. 

194
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,630
 Chairman, thank you! 

195
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,120
 Thank you! 

196
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,390
 Chief Ha will talk to you. 

197
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,570
 Do whatever he says. 

198
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,590
 Yes, sir! I'll never forget this for the rest of my life! 

199
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,830
 And I promise my loyalty to you going forward! 

200
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,860

203
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,740
I'll try harder.

204
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,900
I'll do my best all the way.

205
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,820
Gong Chan also told me to tell you that we'll get you out. Don't you worry.

206
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,670
So, just come out and start dating, two of you.

207
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,400
I already figured out that Chan is interested in you.

208
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,070
I said we'll get you out, Attorney Oh.

209
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,740
The forensics conducted their investigation.

210
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,530
But they said they didn't find much because everything was so burnt.

211
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,260
They suspect the fire got started by the charcoal briquette that was in the trunk.

212
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,100
The fire caught on the gasoline and butane gas and everything exploded.

213
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,040
Any trace of installing explosives?

214
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,780
What explosives? I said it started with charcoal briquettes.

215
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,260
He lit the charcoal briquette himself and put it in there.

216
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,830
This was definitely suicide.

217
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,770
But still, you're already sending the car to the junkyard?

218
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,350
The forensics went through everything

219
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,330
and Chief hates the sight of it. He wanted it out of there.

 You know what you do best.

00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,960
 Burying people without anyone knowing. 

224
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,470
Did you try to separate the voice only?

225
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,340
Yes, I did, but...

226
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,770
Why? It's not working?

227
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,620
You know, there is too much noise in the footage.

228
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,010
Look.

229
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,430
This, over here.

230
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,000
This is all the noise from the background creating interference.

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,920
Most critically, they played the cell phone recording while taping the video.

232
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,570
Stuff like this is too tough.

233
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,310
Good job. Please work on it a little more.

234
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,640
Sure, will do.

235
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,830
What the heck? You were so confident about figuring this out.

236
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,120
I didn't know it was like this.

237
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,070
But Hyung, it's a little creepy hearing it firsthand.

238
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,940
Hey, it's fake. Why be creeped out?

239
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,820
We don't know if it's fake or real.

240
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,940
It could be real.

241
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,000
She would never say that, man!

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,770
Don't talk about her like that.

243
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,500
I'm just saying we should keep various possibilities open.

244
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,580
So there's no other way?

245
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,730
It's not that there is no other way.

246
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,670
What is it?

247
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,830
Bring me the original file.

248
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,040
The original file of where the fake voice came from.

249
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,150
Hello!

250
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,630
Any explosives inside cars...

251
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,810
What are you talking about?

252
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,000
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

253
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,110
Excuse me, but do you also install explosives?

254
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,170
- What did you say? 
 - Install explosives...

255
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,480
 Everyone said that installing explosives in cars was nonsense.  

256
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,740
 They treated us like complete idiots. 

257
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,310
This is nuts.

258
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,260
Gosh, this place is too big.

259
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,620
How are we going to look through this place?

260
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,350
We wasted so much time because we lost him.

261
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,050
He couldn't have destroyed it in the meantime, right?

262
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,900
No way.

263
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,360
I'll look this way.

264
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,840
Okay.

265
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,770
Attorney Song, that way!

266
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,640
Gosh, you crazy punks!

267
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,980
What's the rush? Why junk it so fast?

268
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,200
What do we do?

269
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,470
I feel like the walls are closing in.

270
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,210
And we're running out of time.

271
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,030
I'm going crazy here! Really!

272
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,850
Regarding Attorney Oh Su Jae of TK Law Firm

273
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,900
being under suspicion of inciting murder and abetting suicide,

274
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
I'd like to express deep disappointment

275
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,100
and I'll point out three things in the following.

276
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,100
First of all, TK Law Firm has nothing to do with this case.

277
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,720
 Secondly, 
   

278
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,840
 TK Law Firm and all the lawyers in the firm 

279
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,750
 will not get involved in this case investigation and trial. 

280
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:20,940
 Thirdly, we hope the truth of the case will be revealed. 

281
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,330
 Our position toward Attorney Oh Su Jae 

282
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,560
 will be determined accordingly in swift fashion. 

283
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,700
 That will be all. 

284
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,260
 TK Law Firm has officially announced that they will not get involved in this case. 

285
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,380
 The focus is on what position they'll take toward Attorney Oh Su Jae. 

286
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,600
 Next news. 

287
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,100
 SP Partners halted its acquisition of Hansu Bio altogether. 
   

288
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,770
 SP Partners said Hansu Group has been uncooperative during the inspection process 

289
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,060
 and has taken decisive action by halting the entire process. 

290
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,610
Halting?

291
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,470
What do you mean they want to halt?

292
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,580
CEO Yoon Se Pil decided unilaterally.

293
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,740
We just found out through the news.

294
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,850
 Hansu Group has not made any official statements. 
   

295
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,500
 Depending on the Hansu Group's cooperation on the inspection, SP Partners says 

296
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,190
 - they will decide whether to resume or not.  
 - Damn!

297
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,140
What does he mean by "cooperation during the inspection"?

298
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,080
What's he talking about?

299
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,690
That's all an excuse, Father.

300
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,290
They're making an issue out of the fact that Attorney Oh Su Jae is not around.

301
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,300
What?

302
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,750
Well,

303
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,660
there was a special line item that said the acquisition cannot proceed without Attorney Oh Su Jae.

304
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,150
So, you're saying you put this line item in the contract with your eyes wide open, right? 
   The Hansu Bio acquisition must be processed by TK Law Firm's Attorney Oh Su Jae... 

305
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,360
I mean, I already reported it to you, Chairman...

306
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,200
You're out of your mind, asshole!

307
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,840
Get lost!

308
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,000
My apologies.

309
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,150
Get lost before I beat you up with a pork chop!

310
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,620
It must be crazy over there.

311
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,320
Chief Han Gi Taek is probably getting all the crap dumped on him.

312
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,300
When Su Jae put in that special line item,

313
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,520
she was way ahead of the game.

314
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,310
I'm sure she's way ahead of the game even inside the detention center.

315
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,530
 Someone who had something to do with Park So Yeong.

00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,430
 this person could've found out that Park So Yeong was headed to TK Law Firm. 

323
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,480
  Han Seong Beom, Lee In Su 

324
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,710
  Choi Tae Kook, Han Seong Beom, Lee In Su, Hong Seok Pal 

325
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,960
 On the night Hong Seok Pal died, 

326
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,730
 he knew I was meeting Hong Seok Pal. 

327
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,830
 This person knew how to drag me into it by using Hong Seok Pal. 

328
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,550
  Choi Tae Gook 

329
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,450
  Choi Tae Gook 

330
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,950
I heard you got cut off...

331
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,920
from the company you were devoted to.

332
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,240
You're just book-smart.

333
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,730
The company you were loyal to abandoned you.

334
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,540
Looking good.

335
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,950
You should just go down while at it.

336
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,520
Utterly destroyed.

337
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,330
Gosh, too noisy!

338
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,650
Come on...

339
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,530
My goodness, look at your faces.

340
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,060
Here. Enjoy the food

341
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,900
so that your brains will work fast.

342
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,590
Okay?

343
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,190
We have so many smart people here. What's there to worry about?

344
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,350
You'll find your answer.

345
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,480
For now, eat.

346
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,010
Of course, I knew we could count on you, Hyeongnims.

347
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,510
- Thank you for this food. 
 - Oh, yeah.

348
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,750
I watched that video with Hyeong Chil.

349
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,180
We noticed something strange.

350
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,620
- The video? 
 - Yeah.

351
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,180
Hong Seok Pal's suicide note video.

352
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,170
What about it?

353
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,830
Well,

354
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,520
I noticed his finger,

355
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,950
and I think there's something there.

356
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,980
His finger?

357
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,130
You can't really see that well in the video.

358
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,890
But if you enlarge the snapshot of it...

359
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,940
Look at his finger.

360
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,580
What's that?

361
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,490
Okay, focus on his finger while watching the video.

362
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,350
It looks like he's repeating something.

363
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,360
Is it a hand signal?

364
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,920
Oh, the auction.

365
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,730
Right! You recognize it, right?

366
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,050
- Auction? 
 - Yes.

367
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,340
You used this hand signal at the fish market during the auction.

368
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,150
 I see... 

369
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,880
Il...

370
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,010
Gu...

371
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,640
Il Gu, Il Gu?

372
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,560
Il Gu?

373
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,970
Why, Hyeong? What's Il Gu?

374
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,190
Ha Il Gu.

375
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,020
Ha Il Gu?

376
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,930
Chief Ha?

377
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:52,190
I have everything including what Hong Seok Pal had kept to mess with us, Chairman.

378
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,240
Of course. I also have the USB.

379
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,660
Yes.

380
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,860
You should lower your voice, Chairman.

381
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,810
It's as simple as rescheduling the acquisition date.

382
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,400
The law firm CEO in charge of the acquisition is Choi Ju Wan,

383
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,210
not Oh Su Jae.

384
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,670
Who cares about that special line item?

385
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,740
That rookie Yoon Se Pil...

386
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,380
It depends on how you deal with him.

387
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,000
Yes.

388
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,520
  Assemblyman Lee In Su 

389
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,030
Yes, Assemblyman. Of course, I have it.

390
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,880
Whether I destroy it or sit on it,

391
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,650
I'll take care of it, Assemblyman.

392
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,330
The presidential election is right in front of you.

393
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,400
You have no time to worry about this.

394
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,550
Of course.

395
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,300
You should show that kind of attitude.

396
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,530
I'll hang up now.

397
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,080
They sure have messed around all this time.

398
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,360
 The night of Park So Yeong's death. 

399
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,820
 Where were you when she died? 

400
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,420
 I drove the Chairman home 

401
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,480
 and I came back to take care of unfinished work. 

402
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,280
 While I was in my office working, 

403
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
 I got a call from the maintenance team. 

404
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,100
 that a woman fell to her death. 

405
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,260
 They said she looked like she had fallen from the rooftop garden. 

406
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,000
 So I went to the rooftop garden directly. 

407
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,590
 And? 

408
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,950
 No one was there. 

409
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,320
   
 Chief Ha never makes his moves alone. 

410
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,100
 Chief Ha... 

411
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,710
 and... 

412
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,100
 the person who can do anything using Chief Ha. 

413
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,820
Oh Su Jeong.

414
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,690
We were in the same class in 12th grade.

415
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,100
You were number 27, and I was number 28.

416
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,310
The boy in the picture. Is he your son?

417
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,620
It's amazing that you remember me.

418
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,130
How could I not remember you?

419
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:27,090
I ranked number one in school, and you ranked last.

420
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,320
Gosh, such an annoying girl.

421
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,570
You're still rude as always.

422
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,230
- Why are you in here? 
 - Mind your own business.

423
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,800
Why the hell are you interrogating me?

424
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,920
You told someone to kill a person and helped him kill himself.

425
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,400
I didn't do it. Someone else did it.

426
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,990
Yes. Of course, that's how it is.

427
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,210
Every single person who ends up in here says that.

428
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,520
"I'm not the culprit. I'm innocent."

429
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,230
But not me.

430
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,800
I admit it.

431
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,790
I'm receiving punishment for my crime.

432
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,740
One thing that's unfair.

433
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,200
That the punishment is harsher than my crime.

434
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,640
I just think that's unfair.

435
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,950
I'm leaving today.

436
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,850
- What? 
 - I have my pre-arrest interrogation.

437
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,780
It's 50/50. But if it's dismissed, I'll be out.

438
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,010
You only have a few hours left in the same cell

439
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,550
with a successful lawyer.

440
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,450
Smart girls know how to read people, too.

441
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,570
So annoying.

442
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,610
Do you know that your nickname used to be Oh Jae Su? 
  (T/N: Means unlucky or annoying) 

443
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,460
How can I not know?

444
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,530
You gave it to me.

445
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,840
  Ministry of Justice 

446
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,770
Let's go.

447
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:33,360
  Defendant 

448
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,970
  Prosecution 

449
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,410
 When you were a public defender, 

450
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,910
 Seo Joon Myeong crushed you in Kim Dong Gu's case, right? 

451
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,440
 Is that your trauma for a lifetime? 

452
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,580
 Is that why you're paying it back this way? 

453
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,460
 Console your husband so he doesn't do anything stupid. 

454
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,500
 If you don't, you'll get to see 

455
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,330
 these pictures on the courthouse blog. 

456
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,250
Defendant Oh Su Jae.

457
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,930
Why isn't your attorney here?

458
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,160
Your Honor, so that the interrogation is not delayed,

459
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,890
please exercise your authority and appoint a public defender.

460
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,470
Your Honor, pre-arrest interrogation

461
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,520
is where you confirm whether I need to be under arrest.

462
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,580
I will defend myself.

463
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,530
Defendant, there is no pre-arrest interrogation without an attorney.

464
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,350
Your Honor, I'm here!

465
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,390
I had to confirm something.

466
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,250
My apologies!

467
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,500
Prosecution, please begin.

468
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,940
 That's how Attorney Oh Su Jae blackmailed me 

469
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,530
 and I had no choice 

470
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,340
 but to kill Park So Yeong. 

471
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,450
Defendant Oh Su Jae incited Hong Seok Pal to kill Park So Yeong.

472
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,230
Defendant told Hong Seok Pal to "bury" Park So Yeong.

473
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,100
She clearly conveyed the message to kill her.

474
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,730
If he didn't, she blackmailed him saying that she'd expose his weakness.

475
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,530
Hong Seok Pal couldn't resist her blackmail and killed Park So Yeong.

476
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,140
He committed suicide, not being able to overcome his guilt.

477
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,900
Everything happened because of the defendant's incitement.

478
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,600
Defendant, please make your statement regarding the facts of the crime.

479
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,930
Your Honor, the charges against the defendant of inciting murder

480
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:09,180
and abetting suicide do not even make sense.

481
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,470
Are you denying the charges in their entirety?

482
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,140
I will not accept them.

483
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,080
Defendant, you cannot play the role of your own attorney.

484
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,300
Your Honor, there is something I need to say.

485
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,430
Unlike the forensics report,

486
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,150
I discovered that the crucial cause of Hong Seok Pal's car explosion lies elsewhere.

487
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,590
Your Honor, what the defense counsel is presenting does not apply to pre-arrest interrogation

488
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,040
but they should be dealt with in the criminal trial.

489
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,450
We're not determining whether she committed the crime or not here today.

490
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,690
We're determining the necessity of being in custody.

491
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,930
The defendant is TK Law Firm's partner attorney

492
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,430
and is skilled at destroying evidence.

493
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,360
She's exceptional at defending herself.

494
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,460
Therefore she should be tried in custody.

495
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,570
Please remind the defense counsel that we're here

496
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,230
to determine the necessity of being placed under custody.

497
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,590
Defense counsel,

498
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,150
you can say what you just said to the court at a later date during the trial.

499
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,250
Your Honor,

500
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:04,210
I'm speaking of problems with the critical evidence that placed the defendant here in the first place.

501
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,990
I found proof that the defendant's voice in the suicide note footage was fabricated.

502
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,710
You have proof that the voice was fabricated?

503
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,900
Yes, Your Honor.

504
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,050
I confirmed the evidence.

505
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,880
What type of evidence is it?

506
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,820
Is it in the list of evidence you submitted today?

507
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,010
It's on its way.

508
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,260
I confirmed the existence of the evidence over the phone.

509
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,640
The person with the evidence will arrive shortly.

510
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,440
Counsel, what do you think you're doing right now?

511
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,250
Your Honor, the defense counsel is playing with words and blurring the court's intent.

512
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,930
Your Honor, he brought us the crucial evidence.

513
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,110
Please allow me to submit it as evidence.

514
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,600
Your Honor, my apologies!

515
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,720
He ran off before I could confirm his identity.

516
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,620
Hurry up and let's get out!

517
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,530
Defense counsel, what are you doing in my courtroom?

518
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,100
Your Honor, the defense is out of order.

519
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,360
I don't know what the defense has brought in, but

520
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,750
the defense is more than capable of destroying the evidence

521
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,910
and the potential for her to run away is very high.

522
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,940
The police also tried to reach the defendant numerous times for investigation, but

523
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,400
they ultimately could not.

524
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,760
In the end, they had to arrest her without a warrant on the Seojoong University campus.

525
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,390
Detective Do Jin Myeong?

526
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,680
Yes, ma'am.

527
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,720
I'm Detective Do Jin Myeong from Central Police Station.

528
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,180
It's true.

529
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,690
Your Honor, I ask that you make a wise judgment

530
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,460
so that a fair investigation and trial are possible.

531
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,580
However, Your Honor... if you look at the request for the arrest warrant,

532
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,370
Hong Seok Pal's suicide note footage was a decisive factor in her arrest without a warrant.

533
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,300
If any part of it was fabricated, you must review it.

534
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,240
Also, if there is evidence of someone meddling in the car explosion,

535
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,480
it also means it was a murder, not suicide.

536
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,020
That issue must be determined in this court.

537
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,700
- The evidence not submitted in advance— 
 - Your Honor?

538
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,240
I'm sorry, but I must review it as a detective in charge.

539
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,120
The defense brought in some type of evidence,

540
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,220
and yet if you decide on her arrest without checking,

541
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,360
that really does not make sense.

542
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,310
Look!

543
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,940
If you took the case from us, you should have investigated properly

544
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,840
and asked us for additional assistance, but you didn't.

545
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,890
I already asked you if it was okay to junk the car,

546
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,730
and I also asked if you requested the forensics on the footage,

547
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,180
yet you said it was not necessary.

548
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,110
Why do you bring that up now!

549
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,960
Your Honor! Unnecessary evidence to determine whether or not to arrest—

550
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,670
Let's see it.

551
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,830
Pardon?

552
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:36,500
- Your Honor, we're here to—  
 - I know best why we're here in this place.

553
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,850
Counsel, present it if you'll indeed crack this case. If not, forget it.

554
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,050
To be honest, I think the nature of the defendant's crimes is heinous.

555
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,610
I believe the risk of destroying the evidence is extremely high.

556
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,570
I'm in the middle of considering the fact that she never answered any calls

557
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,770
from the detective on the case, meaning the risk of running away is quite high as well.

558
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,800
Defendant?

559
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,790
Yes.

560
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,610
How would you feel if you were in my shoes?

561
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,130
I would arrest myself.

562
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,090
 Then think carefully. 

563
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,100
 How you'll take care of Park So Yeong. 

564
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,450
Your Honor, if you look at the screen,

565
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,320
you can see the flow of the frequency is consistent.

566
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,560
  Witness  
 This is Oh Su Jae's voice.

567
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,130
However, the second voice is different.

568
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,850
 You know what you do best. 

569
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,970
 Burying people without anyone knowing. 

570
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,630
Your Honor, over there. There, there.

571
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,290
If you look at the screen,

572
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:03,710
you can see that the frequency of this voice is broken up into pieces.

573
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,480
What does that mean?

574
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,540
This means it was manipulated from Oh Su Jae's voice data.

575
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,900
It means it's a fake of her voice.

576
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,760
Thank you.

577
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,850
Next is evidence showing that someone installed an explosive in Hong Seok Pal's vehicle.

578
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,280
 Put an explosive? 

579
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,610
 In the car? Why would you want to do that? 

580
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,420
 We're filming a movie. An action movie. 

581
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,070
 Exploding cars, flying into pieces. Stuff like that. 

582
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,840
 My goodness. I can't believe the stuff I have to do. 

583
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,150
 But this is a bit difficult. 

584
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,700
 I'll compensate you enough, sir. 

585
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,860
This man brought in Hong Seok Pal's car himself

586
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,200
and asked them to install explosives that he brought in.

587
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,550
In order to commit suicide, Hong Seok Pal asked someone

588
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,340
to install explosives.

589
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,950
He could've told someone, right?

590
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,870
You mean a person would tell someone else

591
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,880
to install explosives in his own car to commit suicide?

592
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,950
How can you be so sure that a person wouldn't?

593
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,930
Enough.

594
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,040
Please turn it on.

595
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,620
 Chief Han Gi Taek of Hansu Group was asked by Hong Seok Pal 
   

596
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,940
 and helped install explosives in his car. 
   

597
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,910
 He also confessed his involvement in fabricating Attorney Oh Su Jae's voice in the suicide note video. 

598
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,390
Chief Han Gi Taek?

599
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:47,020
 Chief Han said Hong Seok Pal was tormented over his failed business and for murdering Park So Yeong. 

600
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,740
 He was extremely down on himself, 

601
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,330
 and that's how he came to aid in Hong Seok Pal's suicide. 

602
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,790
 The police plan to issue an arrest warrant 
   

603
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,220
 to investigate exactly how and in what way 
   

604
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,680
 Chief Han Gi Taek was able to aid in Hong Seok Pal's suicide. 

605
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,720
What is your relationship to Hong Seok Pal?

606
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,030
Is it true you aided in Hong Seok Pal's suicide?

607
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,130
It's true.

608
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,940
How could this be, Hyeong.

609
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,710
  Shack 

610
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,510
 He asked me to install explosives in his car, so he would die for sure. 

611
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,560
 I said no. 

612
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,050
 I told him to live no matter what. 

613
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,040
But he said he was tormented from constantly thinking about how he killed Park So Yeong.

614
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,170
He said it was Attorney Oh Su Jae's fault

615
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,660
that he could no longer work for Hansu Construction.

616
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,370
 Even record a suicide note? 

617
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,970
 So, do you have a body to put in there in my place? 

618
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,580
 You think I can't find one? 

619
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,080
 So, when the fire starts, 

620
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,780
 I'll sneak out of the car 

621
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,230
 and another body will be put in there? 

622
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,980
 That's right. 

623
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,850
 Hyeongnim, 

624
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,340
 I'll go to China and change my face completely. 

625
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,000
 I'll make up a new name 

626
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,890
 and I'll be back in two years. 

627
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,600
 You have to protect everything I own until then. 

628
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,190
 You have to do that for me. 

629
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,030
 - I got it. 
 - Hyeongnim. 

630
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,510
 I must survive. 

631
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,310
 My kids and my wife. 

632
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:54,280
 You know that they only have me to trust. 

633
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,050
 So trust Chairman Choi Tae Gook. 

634
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,090
 Both Assemblyman Lee and Chairman Han said to get rid of you. 

635
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:07,150
 But Chairman Choi is doing this because he alone is trying to save you, man. 

636
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,830
 Hey. 

637
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,450
 Because of... 

638
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,220
 Attorney Oh Su Jae at TK Law Firm, 

639
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,450
 I killed Park So Yeong. 

640
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,530
 The one who pushed 

641
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,020
 Park So Yeong from the rooftop of the TK Law Firm building 

642
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,330
 I will meet... 

643
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,470
 Attorney Oh Su Jae for the last time 

644
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,500
 and in front of her eyes, 

645
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,420
 I'll die. 

646
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,950
 I even installed explosives as you instructed, Chairman... 

647
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,010
 but you don't need to kill him... 

648
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,650
 Geez, if you just let him go out of the country... 

649
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,460
 Hong Seok Pal's hostess bar footage... 

650
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,450
 What do you think will happen if your family saw it? 

651
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,990
 You wouldn't want to lose 27 billion won and your family, too, right? 

652
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,530
  Chairman Choi Tae Gook 

653
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:07,440
 Hong Seok Pal had resentment toward Attorney Oh Su Jae for his failing business. 

654
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,360
 He said he wanted to take revenge against Attorney Oh Su Jae before he died. 

655
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,560
That's why he lied and said Attorney Oh Su Jae told him to kill Park So Yeong.

656
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,520
Hong Seok Pal did kill Park So Yeong.

657
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,820
I'm apologetic to Attorney Oh Su Jae.

658
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,810
 That crazy Han Gi Taek! 

659
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,580
How could he aid in Hong Seok Pal's suicide?

660
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,920
This moron. He acts just like his father!

661
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,720
I can't believe I trusted him

662
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,320
 and gave him a chance. That stupid idiot! 

663
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,530
I know, Chairman.

664
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,550
I'm speechless myself. You must feel—

665
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,160
 Hansu Bio and even Yeongpyeong District project! 

666
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
 Geez, there is so much to do! 

667
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,120
Yes, well...

668
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,700
Please calm down—

669
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,610
 I have to go! 

670
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,260
Father, I really don't understand.

671
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,960
Why would Gi Taek hyeong get mixed up with someone like Hong Seok Pal?

672
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,530
I'm sure Hong Seok Pal held something over his head.

673
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,810
Pathetic bastard.

674
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,920
What could he possibly hold over his head?

675
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,240
I just don't get helping someone die

676
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,490
How is SP Partners reacting?

677
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:22,210
I'm meeting CEO Yoon Se Pil tomorrow.

678
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,900
"Oh Su Jae is in charge of the acquisition."

679
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,110
I can't believe he single-handedly halted the acquisition process by mentioning that line item.

680
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,280
That guy is really something else

681
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,200
Han Gi Taek turned himself in and Su Jae will be released once the charges are dropped.

682
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,380
Things will be different.

683
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,840
Yes. Since they halted on their own,

684
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,560
we'll have to put the pressure on and demand that they go twice as fast.

685
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:53,070
Oh, boy.

686
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,920
- Leave us for a moment. 
 - Yes, sir.

687
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,420
Ha Il Gu.

688
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,170
Ha Il Gu?

689
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:12,060
Chief Ha?

690
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,620
  Mr. Goh/i&gt; 

691
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,970
Mr. Go?

692
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,560
Yes.

693
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,000
Attorney Oh had asked you to do that?

694
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,240
Yes.

695
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,750
I'll be right there, Mr. Go.

696
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:33,970
He found evidence of someone coming in with Hong Seok Pal's car to install explosives.

697
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,400
- I'll call you later. 
 - Okay.

698
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,880
Attorney Song, wait for me!

699
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,750
We've got the vehicle covered for now.

700
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,200
Who's Chief Ha Il Gu?

701
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,970
Chief Ha?

702
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,910
Chairman Choi's chief secretary? That Chief Ha?

703
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,610
Chan, come with me.

704
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,070
Let's find out where he is first.

705
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,780
Who cares where he's at?

706
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,930
We'll go right now and ask him to hand it over.

707
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,580
We'll ask him to hand over the original file for the fake voice in the suicide note footage.

708
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,830
Let's think and strategize first.

709
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,440
That should come first. Right?

710
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,430
Mister.

711
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,900
You're stalling. What are you trying to say?

712
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,240
And don't call me out like this anymore.

713
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,750
  Choi Yoon Sang 

714
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,200
 Ajussi, 

715
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,970
the collection of Noona's voice for the fake files...

716
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,410
I took it.

717
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,130
Tell my father.

718
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,520
The guy captured on the CCTV with me, Noona, and my team members...

719
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,270
If he promises not to hurt any of them,

720
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:17,990
tell Father I'll work for him.

721
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,050
 I'm sorry, Ajussi. 

722
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,190
You're my son.

723
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:01,460
My son shouldn't go up against me.

724
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,560
Okay?

725
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,460
Father,

726
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,170
let me be Su Jae Noona's intern.

727
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,490
I don't like you treating Noona harshly,

728
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:19,670
and I'm sure you'd be curious about what she's up to.

729
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,690
I'll help you and Noona in the middle.

730
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,740
I'm considering setting myself up to be a bat. 
  (T/N: Working under the shadows) 

731
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,890
And then if you think I'm pretty good,

732
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,020
this TK Law Firm...

733
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,490
Give it to me.

734
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,970
I could be better than Hyeong.

735
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,390
You know

736
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:39,000
that I was always a better student than he.

737
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,160
 Aiding and abetting suicide. 

738
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,830
 Worst case scenario, it's one year. 

739
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,980
 I'll let you get out on probation. 

740
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,200
 Turn yourself in 

741
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,510
 and exercise your right to remain silent. 

742
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:13,610
 The day you come out on probation, 

743
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,110
 your 27 billion won will become 40 billion won. 

744
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,570
 Forty billion won. 

745
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,170
Forty billion won.

746
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,780
Forty billion won.

747
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,030
I'll dismiss the request for an arrest warrant for defendant Oh Su Jae.

748
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,210
  Prosecution 

749
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,270
Dr. Joon Hui was right, Attorney Oh.

750
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,490
 Why? 

751
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,380
 Are you worried that Su Jae can't get out? 

752
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:18,600
 A long time ago, the number one ranked student in humanities in school was Oh Su Jae 

753
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,170
 and I was number one in science. 

754
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,730
 You know, people in those places find it tough to become friends. 

755
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,920
 But we became best friends as soon as we met. 

756
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,190
 Do you know why? 

757
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:30,690
 Crazy bitches connect with one another. 

758
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,120
 I guarantee it. 

759
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,870
 From now on, the ones who messed with the crazy bitches should be scared. 

760
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:43,120
 "Oh, I shouldn't have messed with Oh Su Jae." 

761
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,720
 "I was going to screw Oh Su Jae over, and now I'm screwed." 

762
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,370
 There'll be a moment when they realize that. 

763
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,130
Eonni! It's dismissed!

764
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,230
What?

765
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,480
Hey!

766
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,470
Dismissed! Dismissed!

767
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:10,940
- Dismissed? 
 - It's dismissed!

768
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,510
 Dismissed! 

769
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:14,840
 Dismissed! Dismissed! Dismissed! 

770
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,870
 Oh, yeah! Hooray, Attorney Song! 

771
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,250
 I knew you could do it! 

772
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,550
 We won! 

773
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:22,080
 Good job, Attorney Song! 

774
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,080
  Yoon Sang Hyeong 

775
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:39,630
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

776
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,410
 Tell me where the secretary's office is. I'll do it. 

777
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:44,930
If they find out you did it, your father won't leave you alone.

778
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,100
That's why I have to do it.

779
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,430
So that everyone will be safe.

780
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,670
And you think I'd let you be cool all by yourself?

781
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:54,520
I want to look good to Noona, too.

782
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:27,130
I heard there's someone determined to purchase your stocks.

783
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,200
It means the acquisition is near.

784
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,460
Buy them.

785
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,690
Attorney Oh has been released.

786
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,180
It will move fast.

787
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,450
Hey, why don't you take a break from SNS until the acquisition is over?

788
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,760
Your rambling twice a day doesn't help the acquisition.

789
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,960
Why?

790
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,650
I enjoy looking at his SNS activity these days.

791
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:50,380
He posts raw chicken photos at 5 o'clock in the morning.

792
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,140
What the heck is "Good morning, chicken"?

793
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,140
But so many people press "Like."

794
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,110
He's got more than one million followers.

795
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:02,750
I was promoting the organic chicken that's sold in our shopping mall.

796
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:06,850
But something more entertaining than me

797
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,500
- came from Choi Ju Wan. 
  - First of all, TK Law Firm 

798
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,690
 has nothing to do with this case. 

799
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,620
 - Secondly, TK Law Firm and all the lawyers in the firm...  
 - Turn it off.

800
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,880
You know, you were so serious here.

801
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,120
I said turn it off, man!

802
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,350
Why are you butting in?

803
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:37,790
Who the hell are you to butt in!

804
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:40,890
My apologies, Managing Director. I'm sorry.

805
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,160
You're fired as of today.

806
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,550
You asshole..

807
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,470
Take it easy, man.

808
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,120
We're in public.

809
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,350
Do you want this all over the SNS you love so much?

810
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:58,810
So why did you have to provoke me and shit?

811
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,890
It's Han Gi Taek Hyeong's wife.

812
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,650
His wife must be in such a shock.

813
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:15,120
Still, that hyeong is pretty family-oriented.

814
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:32,450
 In any case, you and I are both under his shadow all the same. 

815
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:35,160
 How do you think I was able to take 27 billion won? 

816
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,930
 It's all thanks to Chairman Choi Tae Gook. 

817
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,500
 I'll be loyal to him to death. 

818
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,930
 I truly trust him. 

819
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,410
 Han Gi Taek. 

820
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:52,920
 I guess he'll pay the cost of getting 27 billion won. 

821
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:59,910
  Chairman Choi Tae Gook 

822
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,570
Yes.

823
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:04,990
How do you feel?

824
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,270
I feel pretty good, Chairman.

825
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:12,370
My eyes seem sharper and my hearing seems better.

826
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,140
 It's not so bad. 

827
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,370
That's good.

828
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:17,060
Yes.

829
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,280
It's all good.

830
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,120
  Oh Su Jae 

831
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:31,390


832
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:57,310
♫  What should I say  ♫

833
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:04,180
♫  My heart flutters as if I'm dreaming  ♫

834
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:11,110
♫  The star in my heart that keeps showing up  ♫

835
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,670
♫  It keeps haunting me  ♫

836
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,490
♫  I smile for no reason  ♫

837
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:25,460
♫  What I saw clearly  ♫

838
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,250
♫  Our future that is approaching  ♫

839
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,930
Had I known,

840
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,390
I would've had a nicer scarf on.

841
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:39,340
♫  I made a promise to myself since that day  ♫

842
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:45,100
♫  I like you so much that I'm overwhelmed  ♫

843
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,880
Come to my place.

844
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,760
This place isn't safe for you.

845
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:59,080
♫  You blossom so passionately inside my peaceful heart  ♫

846
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:07,980
♫  You came to me in this world  ♫

847
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:14,040
♫  What I had said then, I'll say it again  ♫

848
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,590
♫  I love you  ♫

849
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,620
I'm hungry.

850
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:25,470
♫  What I heard at last  ♫

851
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:32,570
♫  You saying to me that you like me, too  ♫

852
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:39,270
  Why Her? 

853
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:45,850
♫  I like you so much that I'm overwhelmed  ♫

854
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:51,750
♫  Oh, beautiful you  ♫

855
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:56,660
♫  You blossom so passionately inside my peaceful heart  ♫

856
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,360
 Ta-da! 

857
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,350
 Professor is staying at your place? 

858
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:02,730
 Really? 

859
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,950
 Until the remodel of her building is finished. 

860
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,800
 Still, you're living in a student's house? 

861
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,300
 At a male student's place at that? 

862
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,540
 I moved into my father's house. 

863
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,850
 He wants to work as an intern under you. 

864
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,600
 I'll start next week, Attorney Oh. 

865
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,200
 As Chief Prosecutor Choi Tae Gook instructed ten years ago, 

866
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,910
 I took care of all the details for you. 

867
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,270
 Why do you hope for their destruction? 

868
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:24,520
 It started ten years ago. 

869
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,030
 Tell me what you want, Chairman Choi. What is it? 

870
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:32,400
♫  When I'm with you  ♫

871
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,820
♫  I see a rainbow  ♫

872
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:39,300
♫  More beautiful than any given moment  ♫
