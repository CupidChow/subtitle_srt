 This drama is fiction and the characters, names, institutions, events, organizations, and circumstances are not real. 

2
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,310
 Episode 3 

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,680
Hyeongnims, I love you! I want to come here every day.

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,040
You guys kicked out a professor as soon as you entered school.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,890
Amazing people.

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,600
Especially you. You were great.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,380
Thank you.

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,240
It's on me tonight.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,490
Hyeongnims, give us everything on your menu.

10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,480
- Really? 
 - Oh, okay.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,270
They'll really do it, you know.

12
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,740
It's okay. My rate of return has been great lately.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,050
All I've got is money. Money.

14
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,770
Then raise our glass to our Group 8!

15
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,320
 Cheers! 

16
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:16,480


17
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,360
 I didn't do that because I liked Se Ryeon. 

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,640
 I like you, Professor. 

19
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,960
Hey, Quack.

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,300
 Hey, you didn't eat dinner, right? 

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,290
 Hurry over. I'm going to grill meat. 

22
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,820
I'm eating right now.

23
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,800
 Bullshit, you are probably eating cup noodles or chewing on pieces of bread. 

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,820
 Don't argue. Come on over. It's Korean beef! 

25
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,490
 1++! I bought beef first in a long time. 

26
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,930
It's okay. It's a hassle.

27
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,350
 How could you say eating beef is a hassle? 

28
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,850
 You're being rude to the cow-nim. 

29
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,720
How about you?

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,230
Ar you grilling 1++ beef to be polite to the cow?

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,850
 Of course. The most cost-effective way to feel happy is to eat tasty food. 

32
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,400
 Gosh, poor girl. You don't even know that. 

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,490
 Look at this girl. You're drinking it up by yourself? 

34
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,280
Quack, you've got good hearing.

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,080
 Hey, I told you to go easy on the alcohol. Do you want your arrhythmia to get worse? 

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,710
 Do you want to become an alcoholic? 

37
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,860
Shut up. I'm hanging up.

38
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,670
  If a lawyer from TK Law Firm is joining,
      

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,540
it's pretty good.

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,080
Wasn't Professor Jeong Hui Yeong going to be the center director?

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,150
 Class 1 members | Sophomore: Choi Yoon Sang / Freshmen: Gong Chan, Na Se Ryeon, Nam Choon Poong, Jo Gang Ja  
 So, how did they get in?

42
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,610
When were the team members selected?

43
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,230
You didn't have open recruitment.

44
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,720
I mean, selecting team members randomly is unfair.

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
The selection criteria for class 1.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,030
We selected the students who were proactive in the first on-campus sexual harassment

47
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,590
and assault case by a professor

48
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,000
and those who helped to solve the case.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,040
Had you been proactive, you wouldn't have been treated unfairly.

50
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,590
- Let's go. 
 - Geez...

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,150
I see.

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,130
 Director: Professor Oh Su Jae, Adjunct Professor, TK Law Firm Partner 

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,220
 Seojung Law School Legal Clinic Center 

54
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,330
I mean, it's so sudden and one-sided.

55
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,010
We can't even have an opinion about it?

56
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,570
But pro-bono legal service?

57
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,240
How do we do that?

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,990
That's right. We can't do that.

59
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,420
So, it will be okay if we hang around for a sufficient amount of time.

60
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,330
Do you think they'll just let us be idle? There's no such a thing as a free ride.

61
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,980
But I think a pro-bono legal service would be nice if it was done right.

62
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,710
I'm relieved that you think it would be nice.

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,260
I personally selected you guys.

64
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,700
By chance, is anyone unhappy about it?

65
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,930
There's no way.

66
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,970
It's a great honor, Director.

67
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,950
I'll do my best.

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,830
Oh, my! I'm sorry I'm late!

69
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm Guest Attorney Song Mi Rim!

70
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,850
Director, I'll do my best.

71
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,200
It's so reassuring.

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,590
I'd like to take you out to eat.

73
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,620
- Let's all go out together. 
  - Oh, that's so cool! 

74
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,150
Are we having meat?

75
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,280
Wow, sounds great!

76
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,390
Professor Oh Su Jae is a criminal!

77
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,830
 Professor Oh Su Jae killed my sister!  
 Professor Oh Su Jae is a murderer!

78
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,840
Professor Oh Su Jae is not qualified to be a professor!

79
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,200
 Professor Oh Su Jae killed my sister!  
 Professor Oh Su Jae is a criminal!

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,270
Professor Oh Su Jae is a murderer!

81
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,930
- Professor Oh Su Jae is... 
 - You can't do this here. 
  Professor Oh Su Jae killed my sister! 

82
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,660
Don't touch my body!

83
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,260
I'll sue you for sexual harassment!

84
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,910
Professor Oh Su Jae is a criminal! 
  Professor Oh Su Jae killed my sister! 

85
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,290
She drove my sister to her death!

86
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,150
Professor Oh Su Jae is a murderer!

87
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,810
She drove my sister to her death! 
  Professor Oh Su Jae killed my sister! 

88
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,630
 Professor Oh Su Jae killed my sister! 

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,770
You killed my sister.

90
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,730
My sister died because of you!

91
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,330
My apologies, Director.

92
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,210
We'll have to eat together next time.

93
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,590
I'll wrap up here.

94
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Well, I understand how you feel, but you can't do this here.

95
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,310
You know how I feel?

96
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,010
Did your sister die suddenly, too?

97
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,690
Is that why you say you know?

98
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,020
- No, that's not it. 
 - What's your name?

99
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,540
It's Park Ji Yeong. Why?

100
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,740
Park Ji Yeong.

101
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,810
I'm Park Ji Yeong. The younger sister of Park So Yeong, whom you drove to her death.

102
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,210
Did you know what your sister did for a living?

103
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,670
I'm sure your incapable parents didn't ask

104
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,200
what kind of work their daughter did.

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,860
How she made the money that she gave them.

106
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,620
I'm sure you were happy, as long as your sister gave you money.

107
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,060
You, your mom, your dad.

108
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,240
They were all a burden to your sister.

109
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,990
You all had your mouths open, hoping she'd feed you all.

110
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,300
Incapable and a heavy burdensome load.

111
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,710
Listen carefully, Park Ji Yeong.

112
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,470
I'm not the one who killed your sister.

113
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,870
Your family did.

114
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Let's go now.

115
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,600
Don't make me laugh! You're the one who killed my sister!

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,710
You're the one who killed my sister!

117
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,480
You killed my sister.

118
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,870
 What's going on? 

119
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,130
Hey, move.

120
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,790
What are you guys doing? Move!

121
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,480
Hey! Hey!

122
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,040
Who's that?

123
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,990
Don't waste your precious time like this.

124
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,850
It's foolish.

125
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,110
I have proof!

126
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,940
I have proof that you killed my sister!

127
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,600
I have it!

128
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,500
 Park So Yeong, Oh Su Jae 

129
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,780
Nothing comes up.

130
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,780
TK Law Firm probably blocked them all. They'd be more than capable of doing that.

131
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,610
You said you know that field pretty well, Hyeong.

132
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,910
Is it true that Park Ji Yeong's sister died because of Professor Oh?

133
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,230
That's why she couldn't become the managing partner and came here, right?

134
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,810
No.

135
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,420
It looks that way, but it's not true.

136
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,380
 Attorney Oh Su Jae = Murderer? 

137
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,120
What's this?

138
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,600
 Attorney Oh Su Jae = A murderer? 

139
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,427
What?

140
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,720
- What's this? 
 - That's Oh Su Jae.

141
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,580
What is it?

142
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,246
The rooftop?

143
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,640
Chairman.

144
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,850
 Attorney Oh Su Jae = A murderer? 

145
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,860
Attorney Oh.

146
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,120
Yes, Chairman.

147
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,140
You don't have to worry about the cruise.

148
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,790
I'm considering sending Ju Wan one of these days, too.

149
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,520
Yes, why don't you do that?

150
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,270
Yes.

151
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,930
What about the cruise?

152
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,140
Some current affairs program on TV is digging into the paper company in the Bahamas.

153
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,550
Pick a good time and pay a visit. It's about time you go as well.

154
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,290
Yes, sir. Anyway, those broadcasting company people...

155
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,270
What is it?

156
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,170
Father, did you see that video?

157
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,560
In the rooftop garden, Su Jae was with that Park So Yeong woman—

158
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,520
I saw it. What's the problem?

159
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,380
If you watch that video, it looks like Su Jae harmed that woman.

160
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,990
All the comments are suggesting Su Jae killed her... This isn't a small matter, Father.

161
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,510
It is a small matter.

162
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,050
How is that minute issue important to you?

163
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,660
Don't you know what the most urgent for you?

164
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,850
How many of Hansu Bio files did you get back from Su Jae?

165
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,130
Did you even flip through the first pages?

166
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,210
Get to work.

167
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,430
Of course, Su Jae isn't a murderer.

168
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,630
The case closed as suicide.

169
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,870
But when people watch that video,

170
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,760
they'll say, "Oh Su Jae and Park So Yeong were at the rooftop garden together."

171
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,860
"Oh Su Jae made her want to die. She made her fall to her death!"

172
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,830
"Someone like that is a professor at a law school?"

173
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,310
"She is in charge of Legal Clinic Center?"

174
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,350
This is how things will go.

175
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,940
So, Director,

176
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,400
it's unfortunate, but why don't you cancel making Su Jae the legal clinic director?

177
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,890
Because of that case, she let the law firm CEO position slip through her fingers.

178
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:08,720
As a result, I think she'll do an even better job as the legal clinic center director.

179
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,790
There's no way there will be any issues because of that video.

180
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,000
But by chance, if others get suspicious of Su Jae or try to shake her up,

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,250
you should take care of it for her, Assistant Director.

182
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,010
 RF → 31 

183
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,230
 TK Law Firm 

184
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,400
 Smoking Prohibited  

185
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,300
 Ms. Park So Yeong. 

186
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,050
 What? 

187
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,100
 Why did you come here? How did you know? 

188
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,090
 Why are you still here? 

189
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,780
 How did you get in here? 

190
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,040
 So I could die. 

191
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,250
 I've been cornered as a gold digger because of you. 

192
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,250
 I feel such injustice that I want to die right here. 

193
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,070
 So the world will know that I died because of you. 

194
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,380
 No. 

195
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,260
 You didn't come here to die. 

196
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,980
 Tell me who you came to meet. 

197
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,310
 The reason you came. 

198
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,200
 Who is it? 

199
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,090
 Who called you in? 

200
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,770
 No one called me. 

201
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,020
 There is someone who called you here. 

202
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,960
 Then, tell me 

203
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,720
 so that I can help you. 

204
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,270
 Who do you think you are to help me? 

205
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,600
 I've never received this petty thing called help, not even from my parents. 

206
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,900
 You'd help me? Even though you accused me of being a gold digger? 

207
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,720
 You're all the same. 

208
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,450
 At first, you offer me everything. 

209
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,260
 However... 

210
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,440
 they only use me and throw me out. 

211
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,710
 If you don't need my help, I can make a determination for you 

212
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,040
 about whether you're being used again or not. 

213
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,860
 So, tell me. 

214
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,800
 Who is it? 

215
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,050
 Who called you up here? 

216
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,430
 Who the hell are you to make a determination? 

217
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,760
 For my life? 

218
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,940
 How dare you say you'd determine it for me and whatnot? 

219
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,190
 Who the hell do you think you are? 

220
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,170
 Who the hell do you think you are? 

221
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,530
 Did you see her interview with Park So Yeong before she died? What a psychopath 

222
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,140
 And someone like her is the director at Legal Clinic Center? 

223
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,620
 Even though it's a part-time position, shouldn't she resign from the professorship? 

224
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,320
 Professor Oh Su Jae 

225
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,410
 Professor Oh Su Jae 

226
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,300
 Are you okay? 

227
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,550
Yeah.

228
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,170
But what? What about it? You have nothing to do with this.

229
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,970
Your meeting with her before her death and her dying, how is that related to you?

230
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,890
Hey, don't get scared. There's no need.

231
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,990
Scared? Who's scared?

232
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,110
True. Who am I worried about? My worries are a whole mountain by themselves.

233
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,930
 My debt is high, too. 

234
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,330
Wait, look at this, young man.

235
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,810
Look at this!

236
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,160
Attorney Oh Su Jae, who lives here. She's my daughter.

237
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, I see. Unless the resident confirms,

238
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,690
we strictly prohibit any visitors.

239
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,610
Gosh, I'm saying, I'm her mom!

240
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,200
Attorney Oh Su Jae's mom.

241
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,580
So what can we do?

242
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,190
You have to save your older brothers.

243
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,530
They went to prison because of you.

244
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,070
You should provide a way for them to make a living.

245
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,380
They didn't go to prison because of me. They went because they committed a crime.

246
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,160
They wouldn't have gone to prison if you had defended them!

247
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,730
Mom, you almost went, too, and I got you out! Did you forget that?

248
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,310
How could you be so venomous and cold?

249
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,420
I, who am known for being venomous and cold,

250
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,340
should I recite how much money I blew away because of you three?

251
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,970
Gosh, of course, we know, Su Jae.

252
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,600
As your first older brother, I know much you went through because of us.

253
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,900
Shut your mouth.

254
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
Never mind!

255
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,840
I heard you bought the building where your dad's office used to be.

256
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,800
Is it true?

257
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,500
So, why didn't you tell us!

258
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,490
Wow, would we take that from you?

259
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,320
Just open up a convenience store and a billiards hall for us.

260
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,520
What billiards! You can't make any money with that!

261
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,330
You have to open up a cafe.

262
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,430
A cafe?

263
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,680
Fine.

264
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,330
Each of you, sign up for life insurance worth 100 million won and bring me the contracts.

265
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,950
Put my name as the beneficiary.

266
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,960
You venomous girl!

267
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,450
Are you telling us to die if we can't pay you back?

268
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,730
What?

269
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,940
Is that what you mean?

270
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,820
What's wrong with you?

271
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,890
No wonder there's a video going viral that you killed someone.

272
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,810
People are calling you a murderer.

273
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,560
Some say you pushed that woman off the building.

274
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,740
What in the world is this about?

275
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,150
Is it true?

276
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,480
Did you kill someone?

277
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,050
So you can't work as a lawyer anymore?

278
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,420
I guess you can't make money anymore.

279
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,640
That's why you're telling us to sign up for insurance.

280
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,540
Sign up for insurance and bring me the contracts.

281
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,580
Then I'll open up your convenience store, billiards hall, cafe, everything.

282
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,190
Wow, seriously!

283
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,400
Hey, let's go!

284
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,550
Mom, come out.

285
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,980
Mom, what are you doing? Come! Let's go!

286
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,360
Come.

287
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,090
What happened?

288
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,700
Is it true you killed someone? Did you?

289
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,630
If you go to prison, see if we visit you in prison, girl.

290
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,830
 This is Gong Chan. 

291
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,060
 Professor, are you okay? 

292
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,980
 The place where the ice cap captivates the soul of travelers. 

293
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,780
 The magnificent view in South America. 

294
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,340
 Torres Del Paine. 

295
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,540
 The end of the world, the South America's... 

296
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,210
 What's this? 

297
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,580
 Oh Su Jae = A murder? 

298
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,620
 Our criminal code does not punish suicide. 

299
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,000
About a month ago,

300
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,080
a woman fell to her death from a law firm building.

301
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,190
The woman claimed that she was raped by a politician.

302
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,620
- Wow. 
 - Crazy.

303
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,640
The said politician commissioned this case to a lawyer at the law firm.

304
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,600
The lawyer and the woman met in a conference room in the law firm.

305
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,020
That night, the woman fell to her death from the law firm's rooftop garden.

306
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,340
 Coincidentally, the lawyer was heading home at the moment of the woman's fall. 

307
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:35,710
 As the lawyer was leaving the building, she witnessed the woman falling. 

308
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,650
But right before the woman fell to her death,

309
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,830
she discovered the woman in the rooftop garden.

310
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,320
 What in the world... 

311
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,930
The crime of aiding and abetting suicide.

312
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,570
For the person who aids and abets another to commit suicide,

313
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,860
the punishment is imprisonment of more than one year and less than ten years,

314
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,920
according to penal code 252 clause 2.

315
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,870
Can you charge the lawyer with aiding and abetting suicide?

316
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,840
Getting involved in another person's suicide

317
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,990
is the same as infringing on that person's life.

318
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,150
If the lawyer was not proactive in trying to get that woman out of that place,

319
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,340
I think she could be charged with aiding and abetting suicide.

320
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,600
What are the differences between abetting suicide and aiding suicide?

321
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,340
If you don't know, you can do an internet search or look it up in books.

322
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,400
"Abetting suicide refers to making an unwilling person decide to commit suicide."

323
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,112
"Aiding suicide refers to facilitating suicide by helping someone

324
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:53,510
who has already decided to commit suicide, regardless of the method."

325
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,340
"It includes material aid, mental aid, tangible aid, and intangible aid."

326
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,660
Under what category does that lawyer's crime fall if that's the case?

327
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,730
Wouldn't it be aiding suicide?

328
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,290
For that woman to go up to the rooftop garden means

329
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,300
she has already decided to commit suicide.

330
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,070
You could view it as the lawyer cornering the woman.

331
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,480
So I think it could fall under the charge of aiding suicide.

332
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,100
Wouldn't it also fall under abetting suicide?

333
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,790
That could apply.

334
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,760
If that woman did not intend to commit suicide,

335
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,870
if she killed herself because of her conversation with the lawyer,

336
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,030
it could be abetting suicide, couldn't it?

337
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,650
What are some ways the lawyer could claim her innocence?

338
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,830
It's not clear what she talked about with the woman.

339
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,790
Whether the conversation could have aided the suicide or completely opposite,

340
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,810
only the parties involved know.

341
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,240
So, what did you talk about at that ti—

342
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,650
Oh, nothing.

343
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,940
Whether that woman went to that location to ultimately commit suicide

344
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,400
or whether she had another objective,

345
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,310
don't we have to make that determination first?

346
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,660
I heard there was no suicide note, according to the police investigation.

347
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,850
If the evidence of suicide is not clear—

348
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,200
But it's not a murder, though.

349
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,700
There's no way someone could've pushed her over.

350
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,170
Even if you leave the possibility of a murder open,

351
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,270
the lawyer did not do it. Never.

352
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,500
The moment the woman fell to her death, the lawyer was leaving the first-floor exit.

353
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,410
So...

354
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,710
you're not the culprit, Professor.

355
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,670
What's with him?

356
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,620
Don't be too upset about the video.

357
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,180
You'd never be the culprit.

358
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,070
- Oh look, it's raining. 
 - Let's just go.

359
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,740
♫  Can you say the place before we both liked it  ♫

360
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,495
Please, use this umbrella while walking.

361
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:01,350
Had I known, I would've carried a pretty umbrella.

362
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,570
♫  You gave the halo away  ♫

363
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,320
♫  Tried to be okay, be all right  ♫

364
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,700
Be sure to tie it when you fold the umbrella.

365
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,810
No, wait...

366
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,690
♫  What about us, we could have all  ♫

367
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,020
♫  We could have all the things we liked  ♫

♫  I want to see you again  ♫

370
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,710
♫  What about us  ♫

371

♫  What about us today  ♫

372
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,980
Geez, it's pouring.

373
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,010
Oh my, be careful. Bring it out.

374
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:09,700

20th One Heart Event

376
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,280
There.

377
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,320
I'm a little busy right now...

378
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,400
Gosh, no matter how busy you are, you should still eat.

379
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,860
It's free, Professor.

380
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,810
Instead, you need to just eat while making a face that says it's so delicious.

381
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,950
You know how, right? A face that says it's so tasty that you're going to die eating it.

382
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,060
Please be understanding. His pride in cooking is almost like a disease.

383
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,110
Hyeong, you're proud of the ingredients we use.

384
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,290
Saying we only use the best.

385
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,900
Take your time and eat comfortably.

386

 Gosh, come on now!

00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,490
Come on! What's with you!

389
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,090
 Chairman Choi Tae Gook 

390
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,330
Good news, Attorney Oh. There's a new tabloid.

391
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,630
"The son of a large-scale law firm, heir to a conglomerate.

392
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,560
"A drug scandal involving the son of a prominent politician."

393
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,540
"The three have been best friends since high school."

394
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,840
"In a Gangnam nightclub, they had drug parties with women in their twenties

395
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,650
all night long and are also under suspicion of buying sex."

396
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,370
It went viral two hours ago.

397
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,690
They all have been identified—

398
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,900
Chairman is fuming right now.

399
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,030
I'll be back.

400
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,940
Geez! They should clean up their own shit!

401
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,570
They always make our Attorney Oh do it.

402
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,290
Why? What's going on?

403
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,310
Is Attorney Oh on her way to clean up some shit? Whose shit?

404
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,880
I don't know whose shit it is, either.

405
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,070
Attorney Song!

406
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,850
Seoul Western District Prosecutors' Office is conducting a large-scale investigation of a drug case.

407
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,360
Due to controversy over poor investigations in recent times,

408
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,290
the chief district prosecutor is personally conducting the investigation.

409
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,070
Control the press. Stop the internet and go find Ju Wan.

410
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,400
Yes, got it.

411
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,090
Hey, have a seat

412
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,260
Father!

413
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,640
Father, I can explain...

414
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,440
I did have a drink, but I really didn't do drugs.

415
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,080
I was so wasted that,

416
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,160
I didn't even know what those guys put in my—

417
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,850
The three of you.

418
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,430
Again?

419
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,520
No, Father.

420
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,550
Yes, we did get together, but we never did that.

421
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,550
Get out!

422
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,730
Meet Chief Hyeon Gi Choon of the Seoul Western District Prosecutors' Office and take care of it.

423
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,540
I'm not feeling it, Chairman.

424
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,790
I made a promise to myself after Park So Yeong's death.

425
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,250
I will not touch a case where I don't feel it.

426
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:37,960
I don't feel comfortable helping out CEO Choi Ju Wan.

427
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,700
My apologies, Chairman.

428
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,740
I saw that video, too.

429
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,220
I'm sure you wanted to kill her.

430
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:51,630
An Gang Hoon, who you were dating, has a scandal with a girl like that.

431
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,430
I'm sure you wanted to kill her.

432
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,710
So, you gave me the case knowing that, huh?

433
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,740
Because you'd take care of it better than anyone else.

434
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,920
Whether it's a feeling of betrayal from An Gang Hoon or hatred toward Park So Yeong,

435
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,890
I thought you'd take care of it once and for all, loaded up with that emotion.

436
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,890
Of course, I had no idea she'd die like that.

437
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,880
So, did you kill her?

438
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,940
A thing like An Gang Hoon means nothing in my life.

439
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,910
I don't put my life on the line over such a small matter, Chairman.

440
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,510
You should've just said so.

441
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,740
"I know you're dating An Gang Hoon, so you take care of it."

442
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,680
You should've said so.

443
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,610
Nothing is more powerful than honesty.

444
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,230
Please meet Chief Prosecutor Hyeon.

445
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,330
I'm requesting this of you as a father. I'm being honest.

446
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,400
I'll do it for you.

447
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,190
But don't misunderstand thinking I'm doing this on your behalf, Chairman.

448
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,220
Even more so, not for CEO Choi.

449
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:15,540
I'm doing it because I don't want TK Law Firm to be flawed or tainted.

450
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,910
Because you're TK Law Firm and TK Law Firm is you?

451
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,790
Is that why?

452
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,920
- Chief Ha! 
 - Yes.

453
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,050
The night of Park So Yeong's death.

454
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,590
Where were you when she died?

455
00:32:54,590 --> 00:33:00,290
I drove the chairman home and I came back to take care of unfinished work.

456
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:04,630
While I was in my office working, I got a call from the maintenance team

457
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,390
that a woman had fallen to her death.

458
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,380
They said she looked like she had fallen from the rooftop garden.

459
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,540
So I went to the rooftop garden directly.

460
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,490
And?

461
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,360
No one was there.

462
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,420
Anything that Park So Yeong left behind or dropped?

463
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,130
Nothing.

464
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,670
The police also said they didn't find anything at the site.

465
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,070
- All right, then. 
 - Yes.

466
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,360
 Look into me. 

467
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,250
Even though I was on the first floor at the time of Park So Yeong's fall,

468
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,310
the suspicion of aiding and abetting suicide hasn't cleanly gone away.

469
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,670
Look into it.

470
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,600
If you could tell us what your intention is behind us looking into it...

471
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,220
My intention isn't important.

472
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,710
The outcome is.

473
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,380
It looks like she's searching for something.

474
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
What could that be?

475
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,440
The culprit.

476
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,960
Don't talk to me about it here. Go and talk to the administrative office.

477
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,600
I told you I'll pay the bills by the end of this month.

478
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,910
Did you have to say that in front of the patient?

479
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,970
Hey, Jiyeong! Have you come?!

480
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,870
Honey!

481
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,520
Get out!

482
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,320
Why did you come here? Get out!

483
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,140
What's wrong with this girl!

484
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,270
Am I not allowed to be here?

485
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,180
How dare you push your dad like this and throw a fuss?

486
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,930
Mom's hospital money, our rent, and my academy fee!

487
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,550
You wasted every penny of the money that Eonni gave us on gambling!

488
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,800
Get out!

489
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,440
Before I just die with Mom, get out!

490
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,890
You, crazy bitch!

491
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,160
Wow, look at this bitch.

492
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,800
What? So, you're just going to die?

493
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,460
Huh? Fine! Then die!

494
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,140
That bitch So Yeong died like that, too!

495
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,900
Take your mom, and you should just die, too!

496
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,060
Shit! How venomous!

497
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,390
What the hell are you looking at!

498
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,680
Go away! Is there some show?!

499
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,160
These people! I'll just set this place on fire!

500
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,100
Go!

501
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,350
Hey, do you have any money left?

502
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,470
If I record a mukbang channel with you, it would be totally awesome!  (Mukbang: Livestream featuring a person eating a large quantity of food.) 

503
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,520
Hey!

504
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,140
Don't touch it. It's all mine.

505
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,120
I looked into it.

506
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,010
Attorney Oh Su Jae was interrogated after Park So Yeong's death as a material witness.

507
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,340
- She was interrogated? 
 - Yeah.

508
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,320
She even told them that she ran into Park So Yeong in the rooftop garden that night.

509
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,270
But you know, she fell to her death when Attorney Oh Su Jae was on the first floor.

510
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,710
So, she's not directly connected.

511
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,930
That's why it was wrapped up as a suicide.

512
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,290
- Ow. 
 - Get your own.

513
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,610
 TK Law Firm at the Scene 

514
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,560
What's this?

515
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,010
What's she doing here?

516
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,870

517
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,260
I'll be back after lunch, so watch carefully until I'm back.

518
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,650
Yes, got it.

519
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,090
Have a nice lunch.

520
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,690

 Na Seryeon 

522
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,620
Hello!

523
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,770
Who...

524
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,610
Oh, I'm an employee here.

525
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,070
So, how can I help you...

526
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,800
Actually, I'm working on a lawsuit relevant to CCTV these days.

527
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,410
I have a few questions.

528
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:45,070
Actually, the lawyer I work under is pretty scary and so weird.

529
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,140
I have a lot to look into.

530
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,390
Yes, go ahead and ask me anything.

531
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,660
Thank you.

532
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,250
So, in a large-scale building like this,

533
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,470
you have regularly scheduled inspections, right?

534
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,790
Oh, yes, yes.

535
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,960
Yes, we actually...

536
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,050
 TK Law Firm 

537
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:26,040
Chairman, it's all been resolved well.

538
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,370
 Breaking news on the drug incident involving entertainers. 

539
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:39,670
 Including actor Lee and idol member Jeon, a total of five people have been arrested for selling to fellow entertainers drugs  

540
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,460
 that were smuggled in from overseas. 

541
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,730
 The Seoul Western District Prosecutors' Office on the case 
    

542
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,170
- Turn it off. 
  - are looking into the idol group that supplied... 

543
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,410
They turned the focus on the entertainers.

544
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,980
 Chairman Choi Tae Gook 

545
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,760
 Chairman Han Seong Beom 

546
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,840
Aren't you going to pick up the phone?

547
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,910
They always turn my son into the bastard.

548
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,200
They've climbed up so high thanks to me and they indulge so much.

549
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,700
They're so shameless, huh?

550
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,190
 Business Day Hansu | Issue Maker 2012 

551
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,480
It's not me.

552
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,870
Really. I told them not to do this.

553
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
I didn't do it, either.

554
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,130
Choi Ju Wan, that jerk.

555
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,180
That j-j-jerk got crazy on us!

556
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,880
Gosh, I didn't do it, Father!

557
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,780
Father!

558
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,270
Move your hand.

559
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,630
Move your hand!

560
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,590
Father... I didn't do it...

561
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,210
To this jerk I will—

562
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,870
I'm sorry, Father.

563
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:34,000
I'll never disappoint you again.

564
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I'll never get pushed around by Su Jae

565
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,060
so that you can entrust me with the TK Law Firm.

566
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,480
I like it well done.

567
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,970
Others say it tastes delicious with blood dripping drip, drip.

568
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,900
But I hate the smell of blood the most.

569
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,790
I know your preference well, Chairman.

570
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,730
Yes.

571
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,850
The best way to get rid of the blood smell is to cut the meat into pieces and grill both sides.

572
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,750
You...

573
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,940
Why do you think I'm heading the Hansu Bio sale?

574
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,390
What I couldn't have,

575
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,650
what I couldn't swallow whole because it was too big,

576
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:15,720
you should break into pieces and eat one at a time.

577
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,450
As expected, you grill the meat the best, Manager Park.

578
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,620
Thank you.

579
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,530
I think it's been grilled pretty well.

580
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,690
Up until now, the financial management of Hansu Group and all its subsidiaries

581
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,560
has been conducted by Han Gi Taek.

582
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,070
Even though Chairman Han pushed out his father

583
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:53,280
and clearly witnessed him get kicked out horribly.

584
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,310
Still, he laid down flat on his face in front of Chairman Han and was loyal to him.

585
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:00,570
That doesn't mean he was completely loyal.

586
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,960
Wouldn't he have resentment toward Chairman Han, who kicked his father out?

587
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,530
Even then, why do you think he let not his son but

588
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,880
his nephew manage his money bag?

589
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,750
His intention is to frame Han Gi Taek

590
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,900
if there are any problems?

591
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,010
That's right.

592
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,580
For the last ten years,

593
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,790
we managed all the lobby, lawsuits, and legal issues on things that

594
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,810
Chairman Han was involved in.

595
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:33,370
I always threw Su Jae into all those tasks.

596
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,580
The reason I let Su Jae lead

597
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,580
is the same reason Chairman Han used Han Gi Taek.

598
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,380
If any problems arise, Su Jae...

599
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,520
So that Su Jae could take the fall.

600
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,250
But Su Jae took all those files.

601
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:55,290
The files that contain facts that Su Jae shouldn't find out

602
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,470
are in Su Jae's hands right now.

 Storage Box: Hansu Bio Financial Structure 

604
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:41,020
Do you think those files contain information that can be detrimental to you, Father?

605
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,160
Yeah, not only me but the two other gentlemen as well.

606
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,580
Also, for TK Law Firm, which is like my life.

607
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,120
Not everything in the world is completely bad.

608
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:06,890
I touched shit for your sake but it's okay.

609
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,520
I'm saving my own child.

610
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,850
Who cares if I touch some shit?

611
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,180
I could eat it if I had to.

612
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,210
That's me. Your father.

613
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,500
That was me, but you should be different.

614
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,970
I still have those men hanging under my crotch,

615
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,180
but you should have Lee Si Hyeok and Han Dong Wook...

616
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,480
Those bastards.

617
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,710
You should make them crawl under your crotch.

618
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,290
Those files...

619
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,940
If you hold them in your hands, to those two gentlemen,

620
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,540
to the two bastards in your case and the two men in my case, there isn't a need to be stepped on.

621
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,940
Yes, Father.

622
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,170
Ju Wan.

623
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,720
You're my son.

624
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,640
Su Jae will always be under you.

625
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,730
Eat.

626
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,770
- Eat up. 
 - Yes.

Gosh, I don't think I saw this that day.

633
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,670
Where did you find this?

634
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,470
In between the file rings. Accidentally.

635
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,310
In between the file rings?

636
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,800
 They tried to be clever. 

637
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,730
 I didn't see this that day. 

638

I'll try to open this with my coworkers somehow.

639
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,970
Stop if you can't resolve it internally.

640
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,000
I don't want any outsiders getting involved.

641
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,800
Of course.

642
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,550
And please look further into Park So Yeong.

643
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,670
Okay.

644
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,730
Please call me.

645
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,470
 KG Car Service 

646
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,230
"Everyone should come to TK Law Firm tomorrow."

647
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,620
TK Law Firm?

648
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,850
- Who says? 
 - Professor.

649
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,940
Do you text personally with the Professor?

650
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,050
Well, when I saved her number, it automatically showed up.

651
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,560
What's her number?

652
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,740
You don't even save the Professor's number?

653
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,880
I'll tell you.

654
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,540
Me, too. Me, too.

655
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,680
 Su Jae noona 

656
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,740
Hey. You tell them.

657
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,760
What is it?

658
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,140
010...

659
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,280
It's so cool...

660
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,610
It's impressive.

661
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,620
It's nice.

662
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,630
Over here!

663
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,170
Hello.

664
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,160
Whoa, it's awesome, Seonbaenim.

665
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,100
Right?

666
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,390
But I don't see Student Gong Chan.

667
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,730
- He's on his way. Let's go ahead. 
 - I see.

668
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,580
This way.

669
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,480
 Haechi | Seoul 

670
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,500
I heard Attorney Oh's law school students swarmed in today.

671
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,490
After getting pushed out from the CEO position, she's playing professor all of a sudden.

672
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,620
When Park So Yeong died, wouldn't it have been nice if Chairman had just cut her loose?

673
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,770
I know.

674
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,270
This is where Park So Yeong fell from.

675
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,410
At that hour, I was leaving the front lobby headed toward my car.

676
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,290
What are your thoughts after looking into it?

677
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,370
Is it true that I caused Park So Yeong's death?

678
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:54,690
Does it formulate aiding and abetting suicide?

679
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,370
Right after the incident, you were interrogated as a material witness

680
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,400
and you told them you had met Park So Yeong here.

681
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,900
Why did you stay quiet when the video was released?

682
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,900
Next.

683
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,140
Right after Park So Yeong fell,

684
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,180
Park Ji Yeong was captured in one of the pictures people took.

685
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,150
You can also see one where she's leaving the underground parking.

686
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,920
 Did Park Ji Yeong come here? 

687
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,730
Next.

688
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,820
That night was the night of the CCTV inspection.

689
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,570
But the emergency stairwell, the hallway on Chairman's office level,

690
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,920
and the maintenance office hallway CCTVs weren't turned off.

691
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,310
I couldn't obtain it in my capacity,

692
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:36,330
but the CCTV files get archived for a year.

693
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:40,070
But since we've confirmed that Park Ji Yeong was here...

694
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,540
We should check the younger sister, Park Ji Yeong's movements as well.

695
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,900
Well, you know those instances

696
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,440
where the family member becomes a suspect.

697
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,730
An instance such as that?

698
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,900
It's truly horrific, but

699
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:58,550
the younger sister could have k-killed the older sister.

700
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,800
But I think your premise is wrong.

701
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,310
If so, why would she upload the video and do a 1-person protest like that?

702
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,600
She'd stop the case from getting even bigger, first.

703
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,510
Right on. That's right.

704
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,600
Park Ji Yeong...

705
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,480
Her care towards her sister was exceptional.

706
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,940
Ji Yeong went home early no matter what on days her older sister came by.

707
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:24,940
She said her sister works at a great company and that she makes lots of money.

708
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,160
But after her sister died,

709
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,270
kids asked if she worked at a bar or if she was a gold digger.

710
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,280
Kids really trash-talked.

711
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,330
After that, she missed school a lot.

712
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,720
She used to rank number five in the entire school but is ranked below 50 now.

713
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,140
By chance, that video...

714
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,930
Did Ji Yeong ever talk about that?

715
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,810
That someone filmed it or saved it...

716
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,740
Ji Yeong's eonni had two cell phones.

717
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,800
I heard she left one of them at home.

718
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,390
Ji Yeong said that she found it after her sister died

719
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,540
and was totally traumatized.

720
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:05,560
So that video was recorded with her own cell phone.

721
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,010
It uploaded automatically to the other phone that was at home.

722
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,280
But the strange thing is that

723
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,770
Park So Yeong's cell phone was never discovered at the scene.

724
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:16,320
My hoobae says that they searched this rooftop,

725
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,380
the areas surrounding the fall, around the building.

726
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,190
They even looked into the sewers, but they didn't find it.

727
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,090
What's the reason Park Ji Yeong came to see her sister?

728
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:28,810
How did she know that her sister was in TK Law Firm's rooftop garden?

729
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,030
I heard Ji Yeong had been extremely worried about her sister recently.

730
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:34,430
She had said, "I'm getting tons of money. Let's all emigrate."

731
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,350
She used to say puzzling things

732
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:39,460
and would suddenly be out of touch for several days.

733
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,410
So she had said she wanted to track her sister's location on her phone.

734
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,230
That's how she located her sister and came here.

735
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:49,840
But she couldn't stop her sister from dying.

736
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:55,330
The reason Park Ji Yeong came to our school was to get some attention.

737
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,690
Asking people to hear her out.

738
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:01,180
Because no one would listen to her or believe her.

739
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:07,430
Park Ji Yeong is now having a hellish time.

740
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,630
Even if Park So Young was murdered,

741
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:15,370
even if you consider that possibility, Park Ji Yeong isn't the one.

742
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,440
If you were going to get some information, you should've brought forth something new.

743
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,980
If you're suspicious of Park Ji Yeong, you need firm evidence.

744
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,220
If it's not Park Ji Yeong, who then?

745
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,170
Why did you tell us to look into this?

746
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,170
The reason you asked us to look into this case involving you.

747
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:39,650
Do you think that this was a murder and that there's a real culprit elsewhere?

748
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,290
If I'm curious, I should look into it myself.

749
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,740
How could you handle it like this? Just quit it!

750
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,660
What happened? I asked you what happened?

751
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,210
Change it right away. Right now.

752
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:53,480
You didn't leave yet?

753
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:55,810
I have a question.

754
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:56,900
What is it?

755
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,630
When you met Park So Yeong in the rooftop garden,

756
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,240
what did you say to her?

757
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,030
 Who the hell do you think you are? 

758
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,450
 Who the hell do you think you are? 

759
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,030
 Yeah, you're right. 

760
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,150
 Who the hell am I, huh? 

761
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:18,210
 But both our lives, yours and mine, are precious. 

762
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,020
 Don't scrape away your life recklessly. 

763
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,180
 So that those bastards can't treat you carelessly. 

764
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,670
Did you two plan to meet, or did you bump into her by coincidence?

765
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:34,180
I'm curious about that, too.

766
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,110
By coincidence.

767
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:37,980
I almost didn't get to meet her.

768
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,990
Then Park So Yeong could've come here to meet someone, right?

769
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,130
By chance, could you think of anyone?

770
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,250
Who is he?

771
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,370
You can go.

772
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,670
Legal clinic or whatever. Is he one of them?

773
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,730
How old are you?

774
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,750
I'm the law firm CEO Choi Ju Wan.

775
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,140
Do you want to work here after you graduate?

776
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,980
It's our first time meeting, yet you ask my age first.

777
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,400
Unless you want to be my hyeong, I don't want to reply to that.

778
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,270
Do you want to be my hyeong?

779
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,890
I don't really like you, though.

780
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,920
- What? 
 - And being an intern here...

781
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,700
What's the big deal?

782
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,270
It's not cool at all.

783
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,280
Since people say TK Law Firm is all that,

784
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,510
and all the lawyers aspire to work here, I came here with high expectations.

785
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,670
I've only been here for a short time but it makes me wonder if this place is meant for people.

786
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:34,800
I worry about your mental health sharing the same space with a guy like this, Professor.

787
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,220
- What? "A guy like this"? 
 - Yes.

788
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,250
A punk.

789
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,010
A punk?

790
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,750
I'll see you at school.

791
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,740
Who the hell is he that he's so rude?

792
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,140
Which family is he from?

793
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,960
I guess you could only accept his rudeness if he's from some grand family.

794
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,450
But he's so polite to other people. It's so interesting.

795
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,670
Forget it.

796
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:06,000
Stop sitting on Hansu Bio files and hand them over.

797
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,720
You won't be studying them if I hand them over to you

798
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,500
and you wouldn't find a solution even if you studied it.

799
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,130
Why should I?

800
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,590
Why should I do that?

801
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,500
I heard that you

802
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,110
were dating An Gang Hoon and broke up because of the Park So Yeong case.

803
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,330
Did you think that punk would marry you or something?

804
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:26,480
Did you think that An Gang Hoon's family would accept you?

805
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,640
Gosh, come on.

806
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,690
What's wrong with you, Su Jae?

807
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:33,100
Dreaming of rising in status by catching a successful guy.

808
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,370
Stop that now.

809
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,570
I feel pity for you.

810
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:44,040
I guess Chairman gave you a special order to bring those files back to him no matter the method.

811
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,540
Stop trying with might that you don't have.

812
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,170
It's pitiful to see you pestering me like you're a puppy that needs to poop.

813
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:54,060
I'm telling you this for your sake.

814
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,990
Don't let my words fall to the ground, and hand them over.

815
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,730
That would be best in many ways.

816
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,570
Got it?

817
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,000
Park Ji Yeong?

818
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,490
Park Ji Yeong, you're under arrest as a suspect for the murder of Park So Yeong.

819
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,630
You have the right to hire a lawyer.

820
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:36,170
You have the right to remain silent.

821
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,680
You understand it, right?

822
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,550
Ji Yeong...

823
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:41,450
 Police 

824
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,530
 What's going on? 

825
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:50,300
 Did you kill your sister? 

826
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,590
 - Please tell us! 
 - Acknowledge, please. 

827
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:53,770
 Breaking news. 

828
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:57,900
 The suspect of the 20-something woman who fell to her death from the TK Law Firm building 

829
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,860
 has been arrested by the police. 

830
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,860
 The suspect is the victim's younger sister. 

831
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,080
 Park, who was arrested without a warrant for the murder of her sister, 

832
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,560
 is currently under police investigation. 

833
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,250
 The arrest warrant will be issued shortly. 

834
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,660
 The arrested Park, who is 18-years old, 

835
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:18,560
  is currently exercising her right to remain silent.
   

836
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,310
You didn't do that, did you, Professor?

837
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:41,620
Park Ji Yeong's arrest without a warrant.

838
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,580
Did you do that, Professor?

839
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,800
You didn't, right?

840
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,470
What we found. All of that information.

841
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,210
You didn't turn it over to the police, did you?

842
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,630
Your question is wrong, isn't it?

843
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:56,390
You should ask me why Park Ji Yeong was arrested without a warrant.

844
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:01,240
To ask me if I handed that information over to them is quite rude.

845
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,600
I thought you wanted to find the real culprit.

846
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,700
When you told us to find out about you. That time,

847
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:13,110
when we talked in the rooftop garden that day, I only looked at you.

848
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:16,020
 You were deep in thought. 

849
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,740
 You were a little surprised. 

850
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,940
 You were shaken. 

851
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,370
But I trust you, Professor,

852
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,800
that there has to be a reason.

853
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,230
It doesn't make sense.

854
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,090
You say you trust me, but ask me the wrong question?

855
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,760
Because I trust you

856
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,910
I want to hear you deny it.

857
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,600
Please answer me.

858
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,180
You're crossing the line again.

859
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:44,960
Imagining whatever you want about me and judging anyway you want.

860
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:48,990
That's crossing the line.

861
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,750
I don't like it.

862
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:56,010
And I'm not interested in whether you trust me or not.

863
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:59,030
Asking me if I'm okay, giving me an umbrella,

864
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,240
preparing a meal for me...

865
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,160
All the actions you take, based on your feelings alone...

866
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,850
Fine, those were fun for a moment, and I was grateful.

867
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:10,200
But don't do that from now on.

868
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,820
At the time, I went along with it without giving it much thought.

869
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,710
But I was foolish.

870
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:16,980
Don't do that going forward.

871
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,030
Did I ask you to like me?

872
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,960
I like you, Professor.

873
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,660
Because I like you, I worry about the person I like.

874
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,460
I get curious if you're okay.

875
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,560
I don't like that the person I like is getting rained on.

876
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,710
And that day...

877
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,270
you had it rough.

878
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,960
 Professor Oh Su Jae is a murderer! 

879
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,940
 My sister died because of you! 

880
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,630
 Some say you pushed that woman off the building. 

881
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,600
 People are calling you a murderer. 

882
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:08,510
There's a saying that my hyeongs always say to me.

883
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:14,280
"When you're tired and weary, eating tasty food is the best.

884
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,980
That it's the best value for your money."

885
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,120
 That's why I wanted to prepare delicious food for you. 

886
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,680
 Take your time and eat comfortably. 

887

even if you turned over information to the police,

890
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,520
I believe you had your reasons.

891

Don't you understand what I said?

892

Whether you trust me or not—

893
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,920
You don't have to answer what I said about liking you.

894

I'm liking you by myself.

895

If this is crossing the line, too,

896
00:59:52,473 --> 00:59:54,693
then I'll just cross it.

897

I can't help it, even if you don't like it.

 There's something very fishy here.

 I think Park So Yeong was pregnant at the time of her death.
