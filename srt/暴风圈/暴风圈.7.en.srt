1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:11,011
Answer the fucking phone. You… Shit.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,394
Okay. All right.

3
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,271
Let's go.

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,273
What…

5
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,652
You really didn't know
that the client was Kim Hansang?

6
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,237
I told you, man. I didn't know.

7
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:33,075
Okay, okay. I heard it was someone else.

8
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,201
Who was it?

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,663
Some American woman named Stella Young.

10
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,668
Find out everything about her.

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,253
I mean, everything.

12
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,338
Don't leave a single thing out.

13
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,506
You do that,

14
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,716
and I'll let you retire in peace.

15
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,094
Yeah. Yes. Yes!

16
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>Miji, can you come pick me up?</i>

17
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,730
<i>Where are you?</i>

18
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,649
<i>I was actually gonna call you.</i>

19
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,234
<i>We got in touch with Anderson.</i>

20
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,155
You remember Hassan, right?

21
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,201
I told him about your situation,
and he insisted you stay at his place.

22
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,995
He's in the States right now
staying at my place.

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,664
He said he had the room cleaned
and the bedsheets changed for you.

24
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,126
<i>Is this real?</i>

25
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,672
<i>'Cause this matches</i>
<i>the crew members' description exactly.</i>

26
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,676
I ran it through
a deepfake detection program,

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,345
and there's a 98% chance
that the video is real.

28
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,808
So the submarine really exists?

29
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,228
<i>Yesterday, I got word that</i>
<i>the submarine's chief engineer,</i>

30
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,231
<i>the one that got shot,</i>
<i>woke up after his surgery.</i>

31
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,983
That submarine

32
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,610
definitely isn't fake.

33
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,862
I… I saw it.

34
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,115
<i>He said for the past five years,</i>

35
00:01:56,074 --> 00:02:00,329
<i>they have been building</i>
<i>two submarines simultaneously</i>

36
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,747
<i>at Youngpo Shipyard.</i>

37
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,249
The one that they unveiled
is a modified version

38
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,251
of an older Russian model,

39
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,087
and the real one, the nuclear one,

40
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,050
is hidden somewhere below.

41
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,894
Don't move! Don't fucking move!

42
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,691
<i>He also said…</i>

43
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,276
I'm sorry, Chief.

44
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,445
<i>…after their initial testimony,</i>

45
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,947
-<i>somebody got to that young crew member…</i>
-I'm sorry.

46
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,408
<i>…and ordered him to shoot his comrades.</i>

47
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,452
<i>So I emailed my FBI contact</i>

48
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,912
<i>asking him what's going on.</i>

49
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,791
He said he never sent me anything.

50
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>He doesn't know anything about it.</i>
<i>He doesn't have a record of it.</i>

51
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,088
<i>Somebody sent me that video.</i>

52
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,800
Why? I think it's because
I'm the only Korean-American

53
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,134
on the Security Council.

54
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:00,013
They think I'm gonna do anything
to prove there is no submarine

55
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,973
to prevent a war.

56
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,736
<i>An endless line of trucks</i>
<i>carrying food and other basic necessities</i>

57
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,823
<i>continues to move across</i>
<i>the New Amnok River Bridge</i>

58
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,535
<i>between Sinuiju in North Korea</i>
<i>and Dandong in China.</i>

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,498
In China, the 139th and 202nd Group Armies

60
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,834
have started moving toward the border.

61
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,503
The North Sea Fleet's also on the move.

62
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,174
The war seems inevitable.

63
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,637
No preemptive strikes, Terry.

64
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,515
The US cannot go to war
without justification.

65
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,810
Well, we will have confirmation
of the submarine's existence shortly--

66
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,312
Enough with the goddamn submarine.
I don't want to hear it, okay?

67
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,986
-What have they decided?
-Well, Russia's still on the fence.

68
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,781
We're on the edge of a crisis where

69
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,993
the slightest misstep could start a war.

70
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,872
And North Korea will make a mistake.

71
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,956
Soon.

72
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,335
We just need to be ready to act
when that happens.

73
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,396
TEMPEST

74
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,108
Do you think someone
used Anderson and the ambassador

75
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,986
to stop the submarine
from being destroyed?

76
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,322
Every piece of information
Anderson has given us

77
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,282
is something only he can verify.

78
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,451
We have no way to verify the information
here in Korea.

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,161
None of it.

80
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,498
Not Stella Young's contracts
or his FBI contact.

81
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,335
What if Anderson used Mr. Jang to keep
the submarine from getting destroyed?

82
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,420
Then he used his friend…

83
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,174
He used him and got him murdered.

84
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,802
How could he do that?

85
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,095
Let's go back and rethink everything.

86
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,141
No, please don't, ma'am.

87
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,518
Why?

88
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,603
You're thinking about going there,
aren't you?

89
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,106
You want to go to Geumseol Port so you can
find out the truth about the submarine.

90
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,109
-Miji.
-I don't care anymore

91
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,528
whether the submarine exists or not.

92
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,030
How many people have died because of this?

93
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,950
You have to leave right now.

94
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,368
And go where, Miji?

95
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,995
The NIS and the police are after her.

96
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,747
She must be on the no-fly list.

97
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,875
What about a ship?

98
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,337
You want her to stow away on a ship?

99
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,340
It'd be difficult for most people,
yes, but…

100
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,094
I know I'm able to make it happen.
I'll come up with the perfect plan.

101
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,848
This is an embassy employee's residence,
it'll be safe to stay here for a few days,

102
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,599
but you can't stay any longer than that.

103
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,018
Excuse me.

104
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,397
Hello? Hassan?

105
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,483
By the way,
about the boat we talked about last time…

106
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,068
What do you want to do, Ms. Seo?

107
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,821
If I don't uncover the truth
about the submarine,

108
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,407
I'll become a traitor
who betrayed her country.

109
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:10,996
I need to find out who asked me
to be there and why.

110
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,291
Help me, Changhee.

111
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,502
Help me get to Geumseol Port.

112
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,930
It's too complex.

113
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,932
I don't think I'll be able to
cover it alone.

114
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,020
Let me just check it out first.

115
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,607
Who ordered you to come here this time?

116
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,821
Why did you do that to me?

117
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,490
Why go that far?

118
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,994
Why did you make me need you?

119
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,746
Make me want to run away with you?

120
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,875
Was that also part of your plan?

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,629
Why did you lie to me, Sanho?

122
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,217
I didn't want you to get killed.

123
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,305
Who's there?

124
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,725
-Who said you could be here?
-You can't be here, all right?

125
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,727
-Right, I'm sorry.
-This area is restricted to the public.

126
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,979
-Get out!
-Get out of there! Now!

127
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,278
I was the one who needed you.

128
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,617
I wanted to run away with you.

129
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,247
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,332
Everyone who tried their best to kill me,

131
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,586
Kim Hansang, the NIS,
but more than any of them,

132
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,173
I was angry with you the most.

133
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,886
But I'm grateful for one thing.

134
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,723
When I was completely broken,

135
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,726
you gave me this.

136
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,358
You taught me that I'm the one
who has to protect myself.

137
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,444
No one else can do it for me.

138
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,534
"The one who shoots first
gets to go home," right?

139
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,541
If you follow me, I'll shoot.

140
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,130
I was at my weakest when I trusted you.

141
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,471
I refuse to be weak again.

142
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:59,390
Ms. Seo,
is Mr. Paik Sanho ever coming back?

143
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,019
You were right about him, Changhee.

144
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,397
Bad things happen wherever he goes.

145
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,816
You won't see him again.

146
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,823
I know I was suspicious of him initially,
but I think I was wrong.

147
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,536
I'm worried that you could be in danger
with just me helping you.

148
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,164
-With Mr. Paik, you'd be more--
-Right now,

149
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,166
my safety doesn't matter to me.

150
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,462
I'm not gonna let my feelings
jeopardize what's most important.

151
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,769
Could you pull over for a second?
I don't feel good.

152
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,438
Let me step outside alone.

153
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,232
Sure, yeah.

154
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,703

DECLINE

<i>Find out everything about Stella Young.</i>

158
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,070
I want every arms deal contract,

00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,030
who she met with, where she's been.

160

<i>All the records of her movements.</i>
<i>I want it all.</i>

KIM YONGJUN

163
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,720
Oh. Uh, we've got a problem, Ms. Seo.

164
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,474
Do you remember José Kim,
the lawyer for Shiv Holdings?

165
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,853
<i>My name is José Kim,</i>
<i>corporate lawyer for Shiv Holdings.</i>

166
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,731
We were supposed to meet him
a few days ago.

167
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,118
<i>But with all the chaos</i>
<i>from the nationwide alert…</i>

168
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,413
EMERGENCY ALERT

169
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,998
PLEASE PREPARE
FOR IMMEDIATE EVACUATION

170
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,507
<i>I completely forgot about the appointment.</i>

171
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,264
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>he's been waiting all this time.</i>

172
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,810
<i>He came all the way from Argentina.</i>

173
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,187
<i>What should we do?</i>

174
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,571
Um, Mr. José Kim?

175
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,407
-Miji?
-Oh, please get in.

176
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,492
Oh, yeah, yeah.

177
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,829
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

178
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,666
I'm visiting Seoul
for the first time in 30 years.

179
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,584
Excuse me.

180
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,803
My father took me and my family to
the Southern Hemisphere to escape the war.

181
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,305
Figures that just as I arrive…

182
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,768
I have offices in Panama
and in Buenos Aires.

183
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:44,402
<i>Five years ago, I was approached</i>
<i>by Mr. Jang Junik's representative</i>

184
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,155
<i>to set up four shell companies in Panama.</i>

185
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,074
<i>Through these companies,</i>

186
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:54,662
<i>Mr. Jang wanted to acquire</i>
<i>real estate in Argentina.</i>

187
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,540
<i>A massive amount of land.</i>

188
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,209
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>that had always been my dream.</i>

189
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,837
<i>To build a large farm</i>
<i>in the Pampas of Argentina</i>

190
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,256
<i>and live as an unnamed gaucho.</i>

191
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:10,511
<i>So I secretly grew to love acquiring</i>
<i>and managing land on his behalf.</i>

192
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,513
<i>Then one day…</i>

193
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,852
Did you see the news?
Jang Junik was shot and killed yesterday.

194
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,938
What?
Jang Junik, the presidential candidate?

195
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,024
Someone assassinated a candidate?

196
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,817
What's going on in Korea?

197
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,737
I heard it was some
anti-reunification fanatic who killed him.

198
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,990
<i>I heard that a South Korean</i>
<i>presidential candidate named Jang Junik</i>

199
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,533
<i>had been assassinated.</i>

200
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,329
<i>And I realized that</i>
<i>the man who had been killed</i>

201
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,665
<i>was the same Jang Junik</i>
<i>that I had been working for.</i>

202
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,459
PYEONGCHEON-RO,
SEONGWON-GU, SEOUL

203
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,877
<i>I was in total disarray.</i>

204
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,337
<i>Because just the week before,</i>

205
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,216
<i>I had finalized a real estate contract</i>
<i>in his name</i>

206
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,927
<i>and was scheduled</i>
<i>to make the final payment soon.</i>

207
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,138
Thank you.

208
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,183
<i>I was still exchanging emails</i>
<i>with his representative too.</i>

209
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,102
<i>Then when I saw the news</i>
<i>that you, his widow,</i>

210
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,688
<i>had been the target of a bomb attack,</i>

211
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,233
<i>everything became as clear as day.</i>

212
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,152
The Korean media believes
there's political motives

213
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,404
behind the assassination and the attack,

214
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:14,033
but as a lawyer with 25 years
of experience, I see only one reason.

215
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,957
-It's about the inheritance.
-Hmm?

216
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,418
Are you talking about
the inheritance of his land in Argentina?

217
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,839
The four shell companies in Panama
owned by Mr. Jang Junik

218
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,009
currently hold assets
worth approximately two trillion won.

219
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,807
Ms. Seo, you probably would've
contacted me had you been aware.

220
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,768
But even at this moment,

221
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,772
someone out there is still pretending
like Mr. Jang's alive and breathing.

222
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,274
Who do you think it is?

223
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,611
Well, as far as I know,
you haven't had any children,

224
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,531
but do you have any other family?

225
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,033
My parents are gone
and I have no siblings.

226
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,786
I don't know much
about my relatives either.

227
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,830
But my husband, Jang Junik,

228
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,707
has a son.

229
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,917
Ah, I wasn't aware of that.

230
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,503
Then it must be someone connected
to that child.

231
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,754
Just so you know,

232
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,632
before coming here, I looked into
Mr. Jang's representative.

233
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,509
The one who handled

234
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,470
the real estate dealings
in Argentina on behalf of him.

235
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,975
And I found out Stella Young is her name.

236
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,893
Huh? Seriously? What?

237
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,896
- What? What is it?
- That…

238
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,732
She's the child's mother.

239
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,529
Oh, okay.

240
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,959
How do you feel about
being questioned by the police?

241
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,170
So what exactly made you decide
to leak the private recording?

242
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,755
Do you have anything to say
to Ms. Seo Munju?

243
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,715
<i>A woman in her 30s identified as Kang</i>

244
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,383
<i>has appeared before the police</i>
<i>for questioning</i>

245
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,302
<i>over allegations of leaking</i>
<i>a private recording</i>

246
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,055
<i>of the New Republic Party</i>
<i>presidential candidate Seo Munju</i>

247
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,181
<i>and her bodyguard, Paik.</i>

248
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,308
-<i>What was your intention?</i>
-<i>What's your relationship with…</i>

249
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,893
<i>My name is Kang Hanna.</i>

250
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,397
<i>It's true that I informed the media</i>
<i>about the relationship</i>

251
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,901
<i>between Seo Munju</i>

252
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,488
and Paik Sanho because

253
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,824
the late Assemblyman Jang Junik
and I were in love.

254
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,162
We have a child.

255
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,706
A nine-year-old boy
who looks exactly like him.

256
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,545
<i>Are you saying you were in a</i>
<i>relationship with Mr. Jang until recently?</i>

257
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,048
<i>Can you tell us whether</i>
<i>he was aware of this child's existence?</i>

258
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,175
- Grandma.
<i>- When exactly did your affair</i>

259
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,677
-<i>with Mr. Jang begin?</i>
-<i>Does Seo Mun--</i>

260
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,806
-Yeah?
-Mom isn't here.

261
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,184
Where did she go? Hmm?

262
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,521
What if Mom doesn't come home?

263
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,606
She always comes right back, doesn't she?

264
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,983
But what if she doesn't this time?

265
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:57,905
Eunseong,

266
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,993
a child is able to live
without their mother.

267
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,622
And I'm here to make sure
you're protected.

268
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,918
I raised your father the same way
I'm raising you right now.

269
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,256
The reason that I leaked the recording

270
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,219
is that I believe they are the ones
that are responsible

271
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,388
for my beloved Junik's untimely death.

272
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,223
Is she saying Seo Munju killed him?

273
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,058
Could North Korea be involved?

274
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,812
<i>Are you saying that Ms. Seo</i>
<i>was directly involved in Mr. Jang's death?</i>

275
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,105
<i>Do you have any evidence?</i>

276
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,690
<i>I intend to fully cooperate</i>

277
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,068
<i>with the police in their investigation</i>
<i>of my own wrongdoing. But after that,</i>

278
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,070
I'll pass on all the evidence
I've gathered

279
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,989
regarding Seo Munju's involvement
in the killing

280
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,743
and make sure that those responsible
are immediately held accountable.

281
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,369
<i>Miss Kang, over here, please.</i>

282
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,844
Oh, wow.

283
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,391
It really wasn't easy for me
to come here, you know.

284
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,728
But when I realized
that I was the only one

285
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,646
who knew the secret
worth two trillion won,

286
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,318
and the only one who was able to
protect all of Ms. Seo's assets…

287
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,864
- I found the courage to come.
- Thank you.

288
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,282
I'm one step closer to getting

289
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,868
all the facts about my husband's murder
because of you.

290
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:30,998
I usually charge a commission,
about 3 to 5%, but…

291
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,292
I'll offer you a special rate.

292
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,586
From the total amount,
I'll just charge 2%.

293
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,797
Huh?

294
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,678
How about we make it 1%?

295
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,058
1% of 2 trillion won?
So you mean 20 billion?

296
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,352
The thing is,

297
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,646
I really don't think the inheritance

298
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,232
was the only reason
Stella Young tried to kill me.

299
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:01,529
I'm not related to my husband's child,
so even if I die,

300
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,697
he wouldn't get a share
of the inheritance.

301
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,535
Well, that is accurate, but…

302
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,498
they still could try to resort to
some illegal methods

303
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,791
to erase you from the picture--

304
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,668
I'll give you a 5% commission, Mr. Kim.

305
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,838
-Jeez.
-Why?

306
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,759
To you, that money seems like
an amount to kill for, but for me…

307
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,178
this is worth so much more.

308
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,639
Okay. What do you mean by that?

309
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,685
Send Mr. Kim all the contracts Stella
Young has signed over the last five years

310
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,186
and her transaction details.

311
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,021
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,279
Do you think you'd be able to trace
the transactions of those shell companies

313
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,490
and then find out
where all the money came from?

314
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,083
I'll do the best I can.

315
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,937
I'm looking for Stella Young.

316
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,690
And who is that?

317
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,194
The woman who's spent the last five years

318
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,780
traveling the world
acquiring submarine parts.

319
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:12,117
The one with connections
to high-ranking Russian officials.

320
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,497
The one who hired me through Valkyrie
to keep an eye on Seo Munju.

321
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,002
Well, she sounds interesting.

322
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,172
You think that I'm her?

323
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,717
Your real name's Jeon Sukhyang.

324
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,054
Daughter of North Korea's ambassador
to Russia.

325
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,890
<i>You defected to the US</i>
<i>with your family at 16.</i>

326
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,685
<i>By 19, you were working</i>
<i>as a CIA contractor,</i>

327
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,982
<i>operating under various identities</i>
<i>across Romania, Hungary, and Poland.</i>

328
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,488
But many people know you as Stella Young.

329
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,328
How do you think a… woman like that
could speak in front of the press

330
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,081
and let herself get humiliated
over a man she loved?

331
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,709
Because of the inheritance?

332
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,922
Even if Seo Munju dies,

333
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,759
Eunseong still won't inherit
Jang Junik's entire estate.

334
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,513
There's only one way
to make sure Eunseong gets it.

335
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,435
If Seo Munju was the one
who murdered Jang Junik.

336
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,605
It won't be because of me
if she turns out to be the killer.

337
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,482
It'll be the evidence.

338
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,069
I'm sure you planted
some evidence already,

339
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,531
just like you were able to
plan the murder.

340
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,534
Even Stella Young couldn't have killed

341
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,205
the man she loved,
wouldn't you agree, sir?

342
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,752
I just wanted

343
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,380
to be able to beat her for once.

344
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,387
Seo Munju and I were tied,

345
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,513
1-1.

346
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,517
Junik loved her and they were married,

347
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,104
but I got to bear his first-born son.

348
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,982
I wanted to show the world

349
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,401
that I was actually the woman he loved.

350
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,323
Then very quickly, it's 2-0, right?

351
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,582
You're not the Stella Young
I'm looking for.

352
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,960
On the same day
Stella Young signed a contract

353
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,545
with a Russian underwater drone company…

354
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,511
<i>She signed another contract</i>
<i>for structural steel plates in Poland.</i>

355
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,057
<i>Even with a private jet, it wouldn't have</i>
<i>been possible to travel that distance.</i>

356
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,895
<i>And on the day she met</i>
<i>with Valkyrie's CEO in New York…</i>

357
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,652
SEPTEMBER 17, 2025

358
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,821
You were in Korea.

359
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,741
<i>Who are you?</i>

360
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,035
Is your name…

361
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,580
Stella Young?

362
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,629
So tell me, doesn't that mean…

363
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,680
there's at least two Stella Youngs?

364
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,014
Is there someone that you're afraid of?

365
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,852
Someone who might wanna take you out
when you're no longer of use?

366
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,367
Who's the real Stella Young?

367
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,246
And think very carefully…

368
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,292
…about how you and Eunseong
can survive all this.

369
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,463
I could protect you and him.

370
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:44,640
Ms. Seo.

371
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,475
Ah.

372
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,269
I need to bring something up.

373
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,981
Truth is…

374
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,235
I was suspicious of you

375
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,406
when I found out that you inherited
all of Mr. Jang's estate.

376
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,743
I understand.

377
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,953
So…

378
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,748
when his mother asked,

379
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,751
I stole your phone, put an app on it,
and then I gave her…

380
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,338
I gave her cloud access
to the wiretap recordings.

381
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,967
I'm sorry, Ms. Seo.

382
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,804
I just wanted to find out

383
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,391
who was behind Mr. Jang's murder.

384
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,523
Were you aware
that I was wiretapping Mr. Paik Sanho?

385
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,610
I never listened to the recordings.

386
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,864
Back then…

387
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:49,162
-Ms. Lim gave me a watch and…
-Give me your hand.

388
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,374
<i>I remember thinking,</i>

389
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,171
"What kind of person would give me
such an expensive watch?"

390
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,763
YU SEONGJIN
SECURITY ON

391
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:07,848
DEACTIVATED

392
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,883
Surprised you got in here.

393
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,802
This is the most secure hospital
in South Korea.

394
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,181
Why is the NIS accusing Seo Munju
of being a spy?

395
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:59,274
We consider anyone who acts against…

396
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,486
the nation's interests a spy.

397
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,698
This war needs to happen
for the good of all our citizens.

398
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,619
Seo Munju's in the way.

399
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:21,838
First, I believed it was the US
that wanted her dead.

400
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,220
Then I thought maybe it was North Korea
who hired me to put her in danger.

401
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,560
But this isn't really that kind of game.

402
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,687
It doesn't matter which country.

403
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,732
There are only those who want war,

404
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,859
those who want to stop them,

405
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:46,363
and those who stand to gain from
the chaos, whether there's a war or not.

406
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,539
The submarine was never
the real reason for the war.

407
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,751
They needed to make it happen
for another reason.

408
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,087
Something else.

409
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,135
Tell me that reason

410
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,596
and I'll get you the real spy.

411
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,988
You think I'd reveal state secrets

412
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,866
to a spy that I don't trust?

413
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,327
Going after someone
who's trying to start a war

414
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,247
for their own benefit…

415
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,916
would be far more beneficial
than taking her down.

416
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,004
For this nation…

417
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,382
and its people.

418
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,275
Ma'am.

419
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,820
Here, look at this.
It's the plan to get you out.

420
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,323
We'll be departing from Morae Port here,
which is no longer in use,

421
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,825
on a day with rough weather
and high waves.

422
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,038
First, we'll take a small boat,

423
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,832
then transfer to a foreign vessel
in international waters.

424
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,959
We're ready to leave when you are.

425
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,337
You need to get to Argentina
and secure that two trillion won.

426
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,887
I'll think about it, Miji,
but it's gonna be hard right now.

427
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:45,398
Is it because of Mr. Paik Sanho?

428
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,611
What are you talking about?

429
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,239
I still have a lot to do here, Miji.

430
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,699
Speaking of which,
why hasn't he called yet?

431
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,493
I told him not to.

432
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,079
But still, how could he not call?

433
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,956
I mean, you're…

434
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,210
You're going through…
You know, a really difficult time.

435
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,757
Right.

436
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,385
Mr. Im Dujin has been released.

437
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,680
He called asking about you.

438
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,598
I told him I didn't know anything.

439
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,693
Who is it?

440
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,449
Hello.

441
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,661
THE FATE OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA

442
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,875
-Sorry you had to go through that.
-No, it wasn't bad.

443
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,919
They don't torture people these days,

444
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,255
and if they don't get a warrant
within 48 hours,

445
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,882
they release you immediately.

446
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,593
So…

447
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,846
how have you been?

448
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,560
Sir, I'm planning to leave Korea.

449
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,438
Leave Korea?

450
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,647
And go where?

451
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:13,028
-Didn't they put you on a no-fly list?
-I'll stow away on a ship.

452
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,321
A ship?

453
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,905
I'm leaving tonight.

454
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,409
Wait, from where?

455
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,370
Do you want to come with me?

456
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,372
You were planning to leave too.

457
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:30,211
Well, I think I'm too old for that now.

458
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,674
So if you leave,

459
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,968
I'll never see you again?

460
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,774
Mr. Im, can I take this?

461
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,817
Of course you can.

462
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,943
BY IM DUJIN

463
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,323
Will you sign it for me?

464
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,659
Yeah, I'll get the pen.

465
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,848
You're gonna come with me, sir.

466
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,185
You said you were going to
your relative's farm in Argentina, anyway.

467
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,403
I really don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

468
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,822
Have you completely lost your mind?

469
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,035
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding. Just look at me.

470
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,995
You know me!

471
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,039
Tell me why you are doing this!

472
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,137
Tell me what you want from me.

473
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,390
What do you want, Munju?
What do you want me to do?

474
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,187
Why didn't I realize it sooner?

475
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,774
<i>The first person Junik showed</i>
<i>Anderson's letter to.</i>

476
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,694
<i>After receiving that letter,</i>

477
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,822
I prayed to the Lord all night.

478
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,991
<i>The one who knew</i>
<i>Father Yang had that letter.</i>

479
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,954
MILITARY
TOP SECRET

480
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,539
COMPREHENSIVE WAR
PREPAREDNESS PLAN

481
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:33,168
<i>A person who had access to</i>
<i>all the NIS's classified information.</i>

482
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,171
<i>The kind of person</i>
<i>who carefully picks the right paper</i>

483
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,547
<i>even for a single business card.</i>

484
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,015
<i>And…</i>

485
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,020
<i>the only person</i>
<i>I ever opened up to about my pain.</i>

486
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,326
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is not in service or cannot be completed…</i>

487
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,311
Did you kill my husband?

488
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,024
Did you kill Father Yang Inbo?

489
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,946
Are you a spy for North Korea?

490
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,451
I'm an undercover NIS secretary,

491
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,536
a spy hunter.

492
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,205
The agency's name may have changed,

493
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,792
and many directors have come and gone,

494
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,794
but my job's always the same.

495
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,630
Finding spies among left-wing activists.

496
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,299
And your husband was going to be

497
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:08,763
the best product of all the spies
I ever created

498
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,349
in the last 50 years.

499
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,184
It can't be.

500
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:17,146
We'd been searching for proof
that Jang Junik was a spy for a long time.

501
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,607
All of his call records,
financial transactions!

502
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,733
I don't believe you.

503
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,902
I obtained proof from

504
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,655
a reliable source.

505
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,824
Prosecutor Jang Junsang!

506
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,992
Stop lying!

507
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,128
<i>This phone is turned off.</i>

508
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,214
<i>You will be directed to voicemail</i>
<i>and charged after the to--</i>

509
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,344
When your husband brought me
the letter, I knew.

510
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,556
That it was going to be
a historic turning point.

511
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,561
When people found out that the New
Republican Party's candidate was a spy,

512
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:01,065
the complacent and distorted illusion
of peaceful reunification

513
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,984
was going to shatter,

514
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,403
and our people were finally
going to see the right path.

515
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,905
You're insane.

516
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:13,244
I had the ultimate weapon
to turn Jang Junik into a spy.

517
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,163
And you know what?

518
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,247
It was you.

519
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:18,708
What?

520
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,793
Your father, Seo Hyeongsik!

521
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,468
In 1983, he was arrested in the spy case
involving Korean miners in Germany.

522
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,638
He was tortured
and died in prison from his injuries.

523
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,474
That can't be true.

524
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,767
Do you get it now?

525
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,312
You see why your mother had
to flee to America with you

526
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,565
and why she told you
never to go back to Korea?

527
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:48,112
When you got married,
your mother-in-law came to see me.

528
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,158
And asked me to erase all records
of your father's spying.

529
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,577
I told her it was my expertise,

530
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:58,957
knowing I could bring them back
anytime I wanted.

531
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,963
You can imagine what was supposed
to happen tonight, can't you?

532
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:08,925
You were going to be arrested by the NIS
at Geumseol Port while fleeing.

533
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,052
Tomorrow,

534
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,846
the whole country
would be talking about you.

535
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,350
A spy's daughter who came back for revenge

536
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,646
and tried to become the president
to overthrow the South Korean government!

537
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,651
Then everyone would finally realize
who our true enemy is

538
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,736
and why this war must happen!

539
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,906
That's the South Korea
that I want to create!

540
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,825
That is my dream!

541
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,664
So this is how the NIS
would frame people as spies?

542
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,708
By spreading lies,

543
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,752
and turning them into whatever you want,
regardless of the truth.

544
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:51,634
This is how people become spies and end up
killed, or crippled, or exiled from Korea.

545
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:56,055
And you say you're doing this
for the good of the country.

546
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,601
Your father was the type of person
I hate the most.

547
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,397
Even when his limbs were
being ripped apart under torture,

548
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,399
he never gave up a single name.

549
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,862
And do you know how I know that?

550
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,742
Because I was the one who turned him in!

551
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,594
Tell the person behind the curtain

552
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,680
that Seo Munju won't be going
to Geumseol Port tonight.

553
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,309
She's leaving from Morae Port.

554
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:56,532
Seo Munju won't be going
to Geumseol Port tonight.

555
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,786
She's leaving from Morae Port.

556
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,850
<i>What were you doing at Geumseol Port?</i>

557
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,185
<i>What's your plan?</i>

558
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,979
Did someone call you there?

559
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,150
If they did, it's a trap.

560
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,838
MORAE PORT

561
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,971
Don't meet them where they want.

562
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,932
Don't do anything on their terms, Munju.

563
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,393
Go meet them on your own terms.

564
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,981
It's you.

565
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,399
Hi, Eunseong.

566
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,360
My mom's not here.

567
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,862
Yeah, I know.

568
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,241
Then who are you here to see?

569
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,785
You, Eunseong.

570
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,491
I must say, I'm impressed.

571
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,494
Coming here was never a part of my plan.

572
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,792
Let me go first.

573
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,460
I did what you wanted!

574
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,635
Hanna is a highly trained marksman.

575
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,137
The second you even twitch your finger,

576
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,640
she'll put a bullet right
through your head…

577
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,984
to finally get her revenge.

578
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:28,160
My plan is to get a confession out of her.

579
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:31,080
I know it'll be difficult,
but don't do anything until then.

580
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,543
The day I went to meet you
for the first time,

581
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,587
Junik said this to me.

582
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,716
My mother might seem a bit intimidating,

583
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,884
but she's actually a good person.

584
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,263
I'm sure you'll get along great.

585
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,556
Mother,

586
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,684
did you kill Junik?

587
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,232
Wasn't me.

588
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,362
<i>Do you remember?</i>

589
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,073
Every Parents' Day,

590
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,328
Junik would bring you a bouquet
of beautiful peonies…

591
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,333
<i>saying they were your favorite flowers.</i>

592
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,589
Did you kill your son?

593
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,510
I did not.

594
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:34,643
Junik and I never had anything
to argue about, except you.

595
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,980
<i>He couldn't bear hearing</i>
<i>even the slightest criticism of you.</i>

596
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:41,025
Can't you be more understanding?
She's my mother.

597
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,155
Mother.

598
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,368
Did you kill your son?

599
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,793
Junik…

600
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,214
was a child from my husband's affair.

601
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,224
The first time I held him in my arms,
I made up my mind.

602
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,687
"If I can't raise him as my own,
I'm finished."

603
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,484
Junik changed, and it's your fault, Munju!

604
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,027
It's because of you.

605
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,239
He died because of you.

606
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,371
Go ahead, Hanna.

607
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,641
Shoot!

608
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,229
Who are you?

609
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,361
Is your name Stella Young?

610
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,157
<i>Who's the real Stella Young?</i>

611
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,950
Stella Young…

612
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,579
is the woman who built the submarine.

613
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,999
<i>Open the drawer with no name.</i>

614
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,908
Ms. Seo.

615
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:05,419
I've been waiting for this moment
to finally avenge Junik.

616
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,798
I know you're the one who killed him.

617
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,480
Hands up! Don't move!

618
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,651
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!
Don't move! Hands up!

619
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:39,078
Shoot any armed spy, whoever it is.

620
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,720
Come on, shoot them!

621
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,317
Get up!

622
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,836
Whatever happens, find Seo Munju first.

623
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,422
Unit 2, block the exit!

624
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,257
If you hear anything, just shoot.

625
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,444
How can I ever trust you?

626
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,697
Don't trust me.

627
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,409
Just know I'll be right behind you.

628
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:03,746
Always.

629
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,638
Captain! Captain!

630
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:22,056
They jumped!

631
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,613
<i>I had a dream.</i>

632
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,662
<i>There was something in the water.</i>

633
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,878
<i>I wished I could get close enough</i>
<i>to see it clearly.</i>

634
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,304
<i>Who killed my husband?</i>

635
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,519
<i>Why did my mother have to</i>
<i>live her entire life in pain?</i>

636
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,403
<i>Why can't I let go of the child I lost,</i>

637
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,989
<i>and why does my heart still yearn</i>
<i>for that man?</i>

638
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,514
<i>It felt like seeing it</i>
<i>could answer all these questions.</i>

639
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,356
<i>If only I could get</i>
<i>close enough to see it…</i>

640
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,907
<i>I thought I'd finally have</i>
<i>the answers to all my questions.</i>
