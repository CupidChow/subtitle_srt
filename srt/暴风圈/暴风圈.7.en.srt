I told him about your situation, and
he insisted you stay at his place.

He's in the States right
now staying at my place.

26

He said he had the room cleaned
and the bedsheets changed for you.

'Cause this matches the crew

29
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,676
I ran it through a
deepfake detection program,

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,345
and there's a 98% chance
that the video is real.

31
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,808
So the submarine really exists?

32
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,228

submarine's chief engineer,

33
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,231

woke up after his surgery.

34

That submarine

I… I saw it.

37
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,115
He said for the past five years,

38
00:01:56,074 --> 00:02:00,329
they have been building two
submarines simultaneously

39
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,747
at Youngpo Shipyard.

40
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,249
The one that they unveiled
is a modified version

41
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,251
of an older Russian model,

42
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,087
and the real one,
the nuclear one,

43
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,050
is hidden somewhere below.

shoot his comrades.

50

52
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,791
He said he never
sent me anything.

53
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,960
He doesn't know anything about it.
He doesn't have a record of it.

54
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,088
Somebody sent me that video.

Every piece of information
Anderson has given us

83
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,525

[♪ Serious music playing]

177
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,720
Oh. Uh, we've got
a problem, Ms. Seo.

178
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,474
Do you remember José Kim,
the lawyer for Shiv Holdings?

179
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,853
[José] My name is José Kim,
corporate lawyer for Shiv Holdings.

180
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,731
We were supposed to
meet him a few days ago.

181
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,739
[siren blaring]

182
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,118
But with all the chaos
from the nationwide alert…

183
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,413
EMERGENCY ALERT

184
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,017
PLEASE PREPARE FOR
IMMEDIATE EVACUATION

185
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,507
I completely forgot
about the appointment.

186
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,264
It looks like he's been
waiting all this time.

187
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,810
He came all the
way from Argentina.

188
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,187
What should we do?

189
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,571
Um, Mr. José Kim?

190
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,407
-Miji?
-Oh, please get in.

191
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,492
Oh, yeah, yeah.

192
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,829
-I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
-[grunts]

193
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,666
I'm visiting Seoul for the
first time in 30 years.

194
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,584
Excuse me.

195
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,047
[sighs]

196
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,803
My father took me and my family to the
Southern Hemisphere to escape the war.

197
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,305
Figures that just as
I arrive… [chuckles]

198
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,768
I have offices in Panama
and in Buenos Aires.

199
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:44,402
Five years ago, I was approached
by Mr. Jang Junik's representative

200
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,155
to set up four shell
companies in Panama.

201
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,074
Through these companies,

202
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:54,662
Mr. Jang wanted to acquire
real estate in Argentina.

203
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,540
A massive amount of land.

204
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,209
To be honest, that had
always been my dream.

205
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,837
To build a large farm in
the Pampas of Argentina

206
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,256
and live as an unnamed gaucho.

207
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:10,511
So I secretly grew to love acquiring
and managing land on his behalf.

208
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,513
Then one day…

209
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,852
[customer 1] Did you see the news? Jang
Junik was shot and killed yesterday.

210
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,938
[customer 2] What? Jang Junik,
the presidential candidate?

211
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,024
Someone assassinated
a candidate?

212
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,817
What's going on in Korea?

213
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,737
I heard it was some anti-reunification
fanatic who killed him.

214
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,990
[José] I heard that a South Korean
presidential candidate named Jang Junik

215
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,533
had been assassinated.

216
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,329
And I realized that the
man who had been killed

217
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,665
was the same Jang Junik
that I had been working for.

218
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,459
PYEONGCHEON-RO,
SEONGWON-GU, SEOUL

219
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,877
I was in total disarray.

220
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,337
Because just the week before,

221
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,216
I had finalized a real
estate contract in his name

222
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,927
and was scheduled to make
the final payment soon.

223
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,138
[in Spanish] Thank you.

224
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,183
[in English] I was still exchanging
emails with his representative too.

225
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,102
Then when I saw the news
that you, his widow,

226
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,688
had been the target
of a bomb attack,

227
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,233
everything became
as clear as day.

228
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,152
The Korean media believes
there's political motives

229
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,404
behind the assassination
and the attack,

230
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:14,033
but as a lawyer with 25 years of
experience, I see only one reason.

231
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,957
-It's about the inheritance.
-Hmm?

232
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,418
Are you talking about the
inheritance of his land in Argentina?

233
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,839
The four shell companies in
Panama owned by Mr. Jang Junik

234
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,009
currently hold assets worth
approximately two trillion won.

235
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,678
[grunts, gasps]

236
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,807
Ms. Seo, you probably would've
contacted me had you been aware.

237
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,768
But even at this moment,

238
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,772
someone out there is still pretending
like Mr. Jang's alive and breathing.

239
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,274
Who do you think it is?

240
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,611
Well, as far as I know, you
haven't had any children,

241
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,531
but do you have
any other family?

242
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,034
My parents are gone
and I have no siblings.

243
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,786
I don't know much about
my relatives either.

244
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,830
But my husband, Jang Junik,

245
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,707
has a son.

246
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,917
Ah, I wasn't aware of that.

247
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,503
Then it must be someone
connected to that child.

248
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,754
Just so you know,

249
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,632
before coming here, I looked
into Mr. Jang's representative.

250
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,509
The one who handled

251
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,470
the real estate dealings in
Argentina on behalf of him.

252
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,975
And I found out Stella
Young is her name.

253
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,893
Huh? Seriously? What? [exclaims]

254
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,896
-What? What is it?
-That… [stammers]

255
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,732
She's the child's mother.

256
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,529
[in Spanish] Oh, okay.

257
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,960
[in English] How do you feel about
being questioned by the police?

258
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,170
So what exactly made you decide
to leak the private recording?

259
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,755
Do you have anything to
say to Ms. Seo Munju?

260

30s identified as Kang

00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,302
over allegations of
leaking a private recording

presidential candidate Seo Munju

-What's your relationship with…

My name is Kang Hanna.

267
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,397
It's true that I informed the
media about the relationship

268
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,901
between Seo Munju

269
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,488
and Paik Sanho because

270
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,824
the late Assemblyman Jang
Junik and I were in love.

271
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,162
We have a child.

272
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,706
A nine-year-old boy who
looks exactly like him.

[reporters murmuring]

274
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,546
[reporter] Are you saying you were in a
relationship with Mr. Jang until recently?

275
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,048
[reporter 2] Can you tell us whether
he was aware of this child's existence?

276
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,175
-[Eunseong] Grandma.
-[reporter 3] When exactly did your affair

277
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,738
-with Mr. Jang begin?
-Does Seo Mun...

278
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,806
-Yeah?
-Mom isn't here.

279
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,184
Where did she go? Hmm?

280
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,521
What if Mom doesn't come home?

281
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,606
She always comes right
back, doesn't she?

282
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,983
But what if she
doesn't this time?

283
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:57,905
Eunseong,

284
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,993
a child is able to live
without their mother.

285
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,622
And I'm here to make
sure you're protected.

286
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,918
I raised your father the same
way I'm raising you right now.

287
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,256
The reason that I
leaked the recording

288
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,219
is that I believe they are
the ones that are responsible

289
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,388
for my beloved Junik's
untimely death.

290
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,223
[reporter] Is she saying
Seo Munju killed him?

291
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,058
[reporter 2] Could
North Korea be involved?

292
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,812
[reporter 3] Are you saying that Ms. Seo
was directly involved in Mr. Jang's death?

293
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,105
Do you have any evidence?

294
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,690
[Hanna] I intend
to fully cooperate

295
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,068
with the police in their investigation
of my own wrongdoing. But after that,

296
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,070
I'll pass on all the
evidence I've gathered

297
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,989
regarding Seo Munju's
involvement in the killing

298
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,743
and make sure that those responsible
are immediately held accountable.

299
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,370
[reporter] Miss Kang,
over here, please.

300
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,747
[reporters clamoring]

301
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,794

302

[sniffs]

303
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,844
Oh, wow.

304
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,391
It really wasn't easy for
me to come here, you know.

305
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,728
But when I realized
that I was the only one

306
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,646
who knew the secret
worth two trillion won,

307
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,318
and the only one who was able to
protect all of Ms. Seo's assets…

308
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,864
-I found the courage to come.
-[Munju] Thank you.

309
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,282
I'm one step closer to getting

310
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,868
all the facts about my
husband's murder because of you.

311
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:30,998
I usually charge a commission,
about 3 to 5%, but…

312
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,292
I'll offer you a special rate.

313
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,586
From the total amount,
I'll just charge 2%.

314
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,797
Huh?

315
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,678
How about we make it 1%?

316
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,058
1% of 2 trillion won?
So you mean 20 billion?

317
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,352
The thing is,

318
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,646
I really don't think
the inheritance

319
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,232
was the only reason Stella
Young tried to kill me.

320
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:01,529
I'm not related to my husband's
child, so even if I die,

321
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,697
he wouldn't get a share
of the inheritance.

322
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,535
Well, that is accurate, but…

323
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,498
They still could try to
resort to some illegal methods

324
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,791
to erase you from the picture...

325
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,668
I'll give you a 5%
commission, Mr. Kim.

326
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,838
-Jeez.
-Why?

327
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,759
To you, that money seems like an
amount to kill for, but for me…

328
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,178
This is worth so much more.

329
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,639
Okay. What do you mean by that?

330
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,685
Send Mr. Kim all the contracts Stella
Young has signed over the last five years

331
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,186
and her transaction details.

332
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,021
[Miji] Yes, ma'am.

333
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,279
Do you think you'd be able to trace the
transactions of those shell companies

334
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,490
and then find out where
all the money came from?

335
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,083
I'll do the best I can.

And who is that?

340
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,194
The woman who's spent
the last five years

341

traveling the world
acquiring submarine parts.

342

The one with connections to
high-ranking Russian officials.

343

The one who hired me through
Valkyrie to keep an eye on Seo Munju.

[chuckles]

345
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,002
Well, she sounds interesting.

346
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,172
You think that I'm her?

347
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,717
Your real name's Jeon Sukhyang.

348
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,054
Daughter of North Korea's
ambassador to Russia.

349
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,890
You defected to the US
with your family at 16.

350
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,685
By 19, you were working
as a CIA contractor,

351
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,982
operating under various identities
across Romania, Hungary, and Poland.

352
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,901
[speaks indistinctly]

353
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,488
But many people know
you as Stella Young.

354
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,328
How do you think a… woman like that
could speak in front of the press

355
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,081
and let herself get humiliated
over a man she loved?

356
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,709
Because of the inheritance?

357
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,922
Even if Seo Munju dies,

358
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,759
Eunseong still won't inherit
Jang Junik's entire estate.

359
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,513
There's only one way to
make sure Eunseong gets it.

360
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,435
If Seo Munju was the one
who murdered Jang Junik.

361
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,605
It won't be because of me if
she turns out to be the killer.

362
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,482
It'll be the evidence.

363
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,069
I'm sure you planted
some evidence already,

364
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,531
just like you were able
to plan the murder.

365
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,534
Even Stella Young
couldn't have killed

366
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,205
the man she loved,
wouldn't you agree, sir?

367
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,752
I just wanted

368
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,380
to be able to beat her for once.

369
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,387
Seo Munju and I were tied,

370
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,513
1-1.

371
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,517
Junik loved her and
they were married,

372
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,104
but I got to bear
his first-born son.

373
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,982
I wanted to show the world

374
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,401
that I was actually
the woman he loved.

375
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,323
Then very quickly,
it's 2-0, right?

376
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,582
You're not the Stella
Young I'm looking for.

377
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,960
On the same day Stella
Young signed a contract

378
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,644
with a Russian
underwater drone company…

379
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,511
She signed another contract for
structural steel plates in Poland.

380
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,057
Even with a private jet, it wouldn't have
been possible to travel that distance.

381
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,895
And on the day she met with
Valkyrie's CEO in New York…

382
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,652
DATE: SEPTEMBER 17, 2025

383
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,821
You were in Korea.

384
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,741
[Junik] Who are you?

385
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,035
Is your name…

386
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,580
Stella Young?

387
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,629
So tell me, doesn't that mean…

388
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,680
There's at least
two Stella Youngs?

389
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:55,966
[spits]

390
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,136
[grunts]

391
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,014
Is there someone that
you're afraid of?

392
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,852
Someone who might wanna take you
out when you're no longer of use?

393
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,023
[both grunting]

394
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,367
Who's the real Stella Young?

395
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,246
And think very carefully…

396
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,873
[Sanho grunting]

397
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,292
…about how you and Eunseong
can survive all this.

398
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,463
I could protect you and him.

399
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:44,640
[Changhee] Ms. Seo.

400
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,475
Ah.

401
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,269
I need to bring something up.

402
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,981
Truth is…

403
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,235
I was suspicious of you

404
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,406
when I found out that you
inherited all of Mr. Jang's estate.

405
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,743
I understand.

406
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,953
So…

407
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,748
When his mother asked,

408
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,751
I stole your phone, put an app
on it, and then I gave her…

409
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,338
I gave her cloud access
to the wiretap recordings.

410
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,967
I'm sorry, Ms. Seo.

411
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,804
I just wanted to find out

412
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,391
who was behind
Mr. Jang's murder.

413
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,523
Were you aware that I was
wiretapping Mr. Paik Sanho?

414
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,610
I never listened
to the recordings.

415
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,864
Back then…

416
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:49,162
-Ms. Lim gave me a watch and…
-Give me your hand.

417
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,374
[Changhee] I remember thinking,

418
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,171
"What kind of person would give
me such an expensive watch?"

419
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,763
YU SEONGJIN SECURITY ON

420
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:07,848
DEACTIVATED

421
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,883
[Unhak] Surprised
you got in here.

422
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,802
This is the most secure
hospital in South Korea.

423
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,181
Why is the NIS accusing
Seo Munju of being a spy?

424
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:59,274
We consider anyone
who acts against…

425
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,486
The nation's interests a spy.

426
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,698
This war needs to happen for
the good of all our citizens.

427
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,619
Seo Munju's in the way.

428
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:21,838
First, I believed it was
the US that wanted her dead.

429
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,220
Then I thought maybe it was North Korea
who hired me to put her in danger.

430
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,560
But this isn't really
that kind of game.

431
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,687
It doesn't matter which country.

432
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,732
There are only
those who want war,

433
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,859
those who want to stop them,

434
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:46,363
and those who stand to gain from the
chaos, whether there's a war or not.

435
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,539
The submarine was never the
real reason for the war.

436
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,751
They needed to make it
happen for another reason.

437
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,087
Something else.

438
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,135
Tell me that reason

439
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,596
and I'll get you the real spy.

440
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,988
You think I'd
reveal state secrets

441
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,866
to a spy that I don't trust?

442
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,327
Going after someone who's
trying to start a war

443
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,247
for their own benefit…

444
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,916
Would be far more beneficial
than taking her down.

445
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,004
For this nation…

446
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,382
And its people.

447
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,275
[Miji] Ma'am.

448
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,820
Here, look at this. It's
the plan to get you out.

449
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,323
We'll be departing from Morae Port
here, which is no longer in use,

450
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,825
on a day with rough
weather and high waves.

451
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,038
First, we'll take a small boat,

452
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,832
then transfer to a foreign
vessel in international waters.

453
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,959
We're ready to
leave when you are.

454
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,483
You need to get to Argentina and
secure that two trillion won.

455
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,887
I'll think about it, Miji, but
it's gonna be hard right now.

456
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:45,398
Is it because of Mr. Paik Sanho?

457
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,611
What are you talking about?

458
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,239
I still have a lot
to do here, Miji.

459
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,699
Speaking of which, why
hasn't he called yet?

460
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,493
I told him not to.

461
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,079
But still, how
could he not call?

462
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,956
I mean, you're…

463
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,210
You're going through… You
know, a really difficult time.

464
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,757
[sighs] Right.

465
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,385
Mr. Im Dujin has been released.

466
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,680
He called asking about you.

467
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,598
I told him I didn't
know anything.

468
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,939
[knocking]

469
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,693
Who is it?

470
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,449
Hello.

471
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,773
THE FATE OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA

472
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,875
-Sorry you had to go through that.
-No, it wasn't bad.

473
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,919
They don't torture
people these days,

474
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,255
and if they don't get a
warrant within 48 hours,

475
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,882
they release you
immediately. [laughs]

476
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,593
So…

477
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,846
How have you been?

478
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,560
Sir, I'm planning
to leave Korea.

479
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,438
Leave Korea?

480
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,647
And go where?

481
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:13,028
-Didn't they put you on a no-fly list?
-I'll stow away on a ship.

482
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,321
A ship?

483
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,905
I'm leaving tonight.

484
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,409
Wait, from where?

485
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,370
Do you want to come with me?

486
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,372
You were planning to leave too.

487
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:30,211
[chuckles] Well, I think
I'm too old for that now.

488
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,674
So if you leave,

489
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,968
I'll never see you again?

490
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,774
Mr. Im, can I take this?

491
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,817
Of course you can.

492
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,943
BY IM DUJIN

493
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,323
Will you sign it for me?

494
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,659
Yeah, I'll get the pen.

495
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,428
[gasps]

496
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,848
You're gonna come with me, sir.

497
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,185
You said you were going to your
relative's farm in Argentina, anyway.

498
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,403
I really don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

499
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,822
Have you completely
lost your mind?

500
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,035
There must be some kind of
misunderstanding. Just look at me.

501
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,995
You know me!

502
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,039
Tell me why you are doing this!

503
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,137
Tell me what you want from me.

504
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,390
What do you want, Munju?
What do you want me to do?

505
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,187
Why didn't I realize it sooner?

506
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,774
The first person Junik
showed Anderson's letter to.

507
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,694
[Inbo] After
receiving that letter,

508
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,822
I prayed to the Lord all night.

509
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,991
[Munju] The one who knew
Father Yang had that letter.

510
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,954
MILITARY TOP SECRET

511
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,539
COMPREHENSIVE WAR
PREPAREDNESS PLAN

512
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:33,168
A person who had access to all
the NIS's classified information.

513
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,171
The kind of person who
carefully picks the right paper

514
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,547
even for a single business card.

515
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,015
And…

516
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,020
The only person I ever
opened up to about my pain.

517
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,326
The number you have dialed is not
in service or cannot be completed…

518
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,286
[phone buzzing]

519
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,311
Did you kill my husband?

520
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,024
Did you kill Father Yang Inbo?

521
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,946
Are you a spy for North Korea?

522
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,451
I'm an undercover NIS secretary,

523
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,536
a spy hunter.

524
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,205
The agency's name
may have changed,

525
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,792
and many directors
have come and gone,

526
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,794
but my job's always the same.

527
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,630
Finding spies among
left-wing activists.

528
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,299
And your husband was going to be

529
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:08,763
the best product of all
the spies I ever created

530
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,349
in the last 50 years.

531
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,184
It can't be.

532
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:17,146
We'd been searching for proof that
Jang Junik was a spy for a long time.

533
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,607
All of his call records,
financial transactions!

534
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,733
I don't believe you.

535
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,902
I obtained proof from

536
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,655
a reliable source.

537
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,824
Prosecutor Jang Junsang!

538
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,992
Stop lying!

539
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,128
This phone is turned off.

540
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,214
You will be directed to voicemail
and charged after the to...

541
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,344
When your husband brought
me the letter, I knew.

542
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,556
That it was going to be
a historic turning point.

543
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,561
When people found out that the New
Republican Party's candidate was a spy,

544
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:01,065
the complacent and distorted
illusion of peaceful reunification

545
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,984
was going to shatter,

546
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,403
and our people were finally
going to see the right path.

547
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,905
You're insane.

548
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:13,244
I had the ultimate weapon to
turn Jang Junik into a spy.

549
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,163
And you know what?

550
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,247
It was you.

551
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:18,708
What?

552
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,793
Your father, Seo Hyeongsik!

553
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,468
In 1983, he was arrested in the spy
case involving Korean miners in Germany.

554
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,638
He was tortured and died in
prison from his injuries.

555
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,474
That can't be true.

556
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,767
Do you get it now?

557
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,312
You see why your mother had
to flee to America with you

558
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,565
and why she told you
never to go back to Korea?

559
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:48,112
When you got married, your
mother-in-law came to see me.

560
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,158
And asked me to erase all
records of your father's spying.

561
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,577
I told her it was my expertise,

562
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:58,957
knowing I could bring them
back anytime I wanted.

563
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,375
[breathes heavily]

564
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,963
You can imagine what was supposed
to happen tonight, can't you?

565
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:08,925
You were going to be arrested by the
NIS at Geumseol Port while fleeing.

566
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,052
Tomorrow,

567
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,846
the whole country would
be talking about you.

568
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,350
A spy's daughter who
came back for revenge

569
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,646
and tried to become the president to
overthrow the South Korean government!

570
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,651
Then everyone would finally
realize who our true enemy is

571
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,736
and why this war must happen!

572
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,906
That's the South Korea
that I want to create!

573
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,825
That is my dream!

574
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,664
So this is how the NIS
would frame people as spies?

575
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,708
By spreading lies,

576
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,752
and turning them into whatever
you want, regardless of the truth.

577
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:51,634
This is how people become spies and end up
killed, or crippled, or exiled from Korea.

578
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:56,055
And you say you're doing this
for the good of the country.

579
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,601
Your father was the type
of person I hate the most.

580
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,397
Even when his limbs were being
ripped apart under torture,

581
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,399
he never gave up a single name.

582
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,862
And do you know how I know that?

583
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,742
Because I was the one
who turned him in!

584
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:19,996
-[gunshot]
-[Munju grunts]

585
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,539
[Dujin groaning]

586
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,594
[Sanho] Tell the person
behind the curtain

587
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,680
that Seo Munju won't be going
to Geumseol Port tonight.

588
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,309
She's leaving from Morae Port.

589
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:56,532
Seo Munju won't be going
to Geumseol Port tonight.

590
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,786
She's leaving from Morae Port.

591
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,165
[heavy breathing through phone]

592
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,046
[line ends]

593
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,850
[Sanho] What were you
doing at Geumseol Port?

594
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,185
What's your plan?

595
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,979
Did someone call you there?

596
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,150
If they did, it's a trap.

597
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,838
MORAE PORT

598
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,971
Don't meet them where they want.

599
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,932
Don't do anything on
their terms, Munju.

600
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,393
Go meet them on your own terms.

601
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,839
[page turning]

602
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,981
It's you.

603
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,399
Hi, Eunseong.

604
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,360
My mom's not here.

605
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,862
Yeah, I know.

606
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,241
Then who are you here to see?

607
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,785
You, Eunseong.

608
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,251
[thunder rumbling]

609
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,756
[phone buzzing]

610
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,054
[door opens]

611
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,770
[buzzing continues]

612
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,150
[line ringing]

613
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,194
[line ends]

614
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,491
I must say, I'm impressed.

615
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,494
Coming here was never
a part of my plan.

616
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,792
Let me go first.

617
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,460
I did what you wanted!

618
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,635
[Okseon] Hanna is a
highly trained marksman.

619
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,137
The second you even
twitch your finger,

620
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,640
she'll put a bullet
right through your head…

621
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,984
To finally get her revenge.

622
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:28,160
My plan is to get a
confession out of her.

623
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:31,080
I know it'll be difficult, but
don't do anything until then.

624
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,543
The day I went to meet
you for the first time,

625
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,587
Junik said this to me.

626
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,716
[Junik] My mother might
seem a bit intimidating,

627
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,884
but she's actually
a good person.

628
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,263
I'm sure you'll get along great.

629
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,556
Mother,

630
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,684
did you kill Junik?

631
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,232
Wasn't me.

632
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,362
[Munju] Do you remember?

633
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,073
Every Parents' Day,

634
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,328
Junik would bring you a
bouquet of beautiful peonies…

635
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,333
Saying they were your
favorite flowers.

636
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,589
Did you kill your son?

637
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,510
I did not.

638
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:34,643
Junik and I never had anything
to argue about, except you.

639
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,980
He couldn't bear hearing even
the slightest criticism of you.

640
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:41,025
Can't you be more
understanding? She's my mother.

641
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,155
[Munju] Mother.

642
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,368
Did you kill your son?

643
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,793
Junik…

644
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,214
Was a child from my
husband's affair.

645
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,224
The first time I held him in
my arms, I made up my mind.

646
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,687
"If I can't raise him as
my own, I'm finished."

647
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,484
Junik changed, and
it's your fault, Munju!

648
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,027
It's because of you.

649
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,239
He died because of you.

650
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,371
Go ahead, Hanna.

651
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,641
Shoot!

652
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,229
[Junik] Who are you?

653
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,361
Is your name Stella Young?

654
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,157
[Sanho] Who's the
real Stella Young?

655
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,950
Stella Young…

656
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,579
Is the woman who
built the submarine.

657
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,999
[Hanna] Open the
drawer with no name.

658
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,908
Ms. Seo.

659
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:05,419
I've been waiting for this
moment to finally avenge Junik.

660
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,798
I know you're the
one who killed him.

661
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,480

weapons! Don't move! Hands up!

anything, just shoot.

Don't trust me.

Just know I'll be
right behind you.

675
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:03,746
Always.

680
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,613
[Munju] I had a dream.

681
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,662
There was something
in the water.

682
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,878
I wished I could get close
enough to see it clearly.

683
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,304
Who killed my husband?

684
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,519
Why did my mother have to
live her entire life in pain?

685

[sonar echoes]

686
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,403
Why can't I let go
of the child I lost,

687
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,989
and why does my heart
still yearn for that man?

688
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,514
It felt like seeing it could
answer all these questions.

689
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,356
If only I could get
close enough to see it…

690
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,907
I thought I'd finally have the
answers to all my questions.
