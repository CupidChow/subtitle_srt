1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,569
I had a dream.

2
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:44,002
And in the dream, I was a man.

3
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,429
He served warm soup to the elderly…

4
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,600
reaching out first…

5
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,689
hugging first.

6
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,778
He sang with children…

7
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:14,825
My fellow Koreans,
change happens through communication,

8
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,036
making our voices heard.
And in times like this…

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,163
…opened his heart before the world,

10
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,210
and inspired the younger generation.

11
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,594
People would even follow him to war.

12
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,637
And we have not yet lost hope.

13
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,764
Together, let's face these challenges!

14
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,685
There was also a woman he loved.

15
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,876
That woman…

16
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,422
was taking her last breath.

17
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,282
Munju.

18
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,913
President Hauser
delivered a strong warning

19
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,540
in response to
North Korea's recent declaration

20
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:49,711
to deploy ICBMs
capable of hitting the US mainland.

21
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,466
Well, obviously, David,
North Korea has crossed the line.

22
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,386
And, uh, we will not
suffer their belligerence any longer.

23
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,556
Sadly, uh, peace can only be attained
through strength.

24
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,934
This is how we make the world beautiful.

25
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,853
If North Korea wants to provoke us
with their nukes,

26
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:10,232
the United States will have no choice
but to respond in kind.

27
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,900
You got my word on that.

28
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,403
White House spokesperson, Adam Maxwell,

29
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,154
denied that President Hauser's remarks

30
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,991
signaled imminent military action
against North Korea.

31
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,078
However, he clarified that
the White House is not limiting

32
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,831
its considerations to diplomatic
or peaceful solutions,

33
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,209
while declining to comment
on any specific response measures.

34
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,879
Maxwell went on to state that halting
North Korea's nuclear missile provocations

35
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,923
remains the administration's top priority,

36
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,968
and that all possible measures
will be pursued in coordination

37
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,262
with allied nations to achieve that goal.

38
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,015
As the United States
dispatched a delegation

39
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,600
to the Idician capital of Kirus

40
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,770
for cease-fire negotiations
under UN mediation,

41
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,023
King Anshar Nabu of Idicia
unilaterally announced

42
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,984
the suspension of talks via state media…

43
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,323
Why did you have me followed?

44
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,992
You know I can't sleep

45
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,828
when you're out there
running alone so early.

46
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,873
God knows where you were.

47
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,416
Did you forget how cranky I get

48
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,126
-when I lose sleep?
-Stop worrying about it.

49
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,045
It's the one thing I asked for
before coming back here.

50
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,173
Let me do my morning run alone.

51
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,509
It's like morning prayers for me.

52
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,727
Go run, by all means.

53
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,395
I'm not stopping you.

54
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,481
Just pretend nobody's there following.

55
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,067
Or if you want, you can just run on
the treadmill, and you'll be all alone.

56
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,445
I need to run for real.

57
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,155
And I don't want people around.

58
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,450
Could you pray out loud
with people listening to you?

59
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,328
The only time a politician prays

60
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,747
is when someone's listening.

61
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,549
Munju.

62
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,761
If someone really wanted to have me
taken down, they could.

63
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,681
They could run you over while you're
jogging or throw you off of a cliff.

64
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,099
And after that, what's next?

65
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,186
The future of the entire country
is changed forever.

66
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,146
So I want to be careful, okay?

67
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,525
I'm sorry,
you're not the president, right?

68
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,402
Let alone a candidate.

69
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,029
Far into the future,

70
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,616
when we look back
and think about what we have done,

71
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,368
I sincerely hope

72
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,996
that we will be able to say
that we did the right thing

73
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,165
for the people in North Korea…

74
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,885
Ms. Seo!

75
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,846
Ms. Seo!

76
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,727
During her tenure,

77
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,855
Ambassador Seo was a strong advocate
for our nation

78
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,608
in the international community,
engaging in various diplomatic issues.

79
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,110
However, she unexpectedly resigned

80
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,737
and returned via
Incheon Airport last night.

81
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,581
Although my three year tenure
as the UN ambassador

82
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,915
was filled with challenges,

83
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,794
I was honored to represent my country
on the international stage.

84
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,921
Seo did however refrain
from commenting on

85
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,215
the reasons for her sudden resignation.

86
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,828
TEMPEST

87
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,258
PRESIDENT CHAE KYUNGSIN
OF SOUTH KOREA

88
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,302
What is President Hauser thinking?

89
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:11,014
You know, I've heard this guy
can't even locate Korea on a map.

90
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,059
Just ignore him.
Everyone knows he's a nutjob.

91
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,062
But who knew Kim Hansang
would turn out worse?

92
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,939
He had been so quiet
that people were calling him a recluse,

93
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,400
a hikikomori, they say in Japan.

94
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,319
Now they're competing
to see who's crazier.

95
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,781
In the age of nuclear war,
the lunatic wins.

96
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,742
Their leverage is held by the legitimate
fear that they could fire a nuke.

97
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,619
The expats here are losing it.

98
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,622
They're too scared to remain in Korea,
war could break out.

99
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,916
They'll eventually accept the idea.

100
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,294
New ambassadors get scared
when they first hear news like this,

101
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,962
packing their bags and calling home.

102
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,839
But after a while they get used to it.

103
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,967
They sleep at night, like the rest of us.

104
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,219
You know?

105
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,306
Actually, I was up all night.

106
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,891
And why's that?

107
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,436
They talk about Hansang
on the news all day in the States.

108
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,440
The Iraq War, the Idicia War.
It was propaganda that started those.

109
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,942
The US…

110
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,443
They're still stuck in the Middle East

111
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,279
because they can't seem to bring an end
to the Idicia War.

112
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,532
I doubt it's another war they're planning.

113
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,368
Speaking of which,

114
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,870
tell us the real reason you resigned.

115
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,206
Come on, you know!

116
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,334
Her husband's the opposition's
front-runner for the president this year.

117
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,419
Yeah, I know.

118
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,337
But what I'm wondering is

119
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,258
if it was the ambassador's idea
or the president's.

120
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,301
Oh, here she is.

121
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,347
Good afternoon, Madam President.

122
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,266
-Honor to meet you, Madam President.
-It's an honor.

123
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,601
I'm sorry to drag her away.

124
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,520
Could I just borrow her a while?

125
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,022
You didn't have to answer
all their questions.

126
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,526
You could've just said I told you
to either quit or divorce your husband

127
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,861
since he's about to become president.

128
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,363
Sorry if I caused you any trouble.

129
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,533
When you got North Korea,
China, and the US,

130
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,203
each with their own
special brand of crazy,

131
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,958
to agree on the word "peacefully"
in the Basel Quadripartite Agreement,

132
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,168
I thought,

133
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,421
"Wow, if I am the next president,

134
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,007
I hope she'll help me
deal with foreign affairs."

135
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,510
Only, then I found out
who you were married to,

136
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,096
and… …I was heartbroken.

137
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,349
Still, we've worked together for a decade.

138
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,810
And I've appreciated it.

139
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,979
But when you turned down
the minister position,

140
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:28,693
I had a feeling Jang Junik
was going to be running for president.

141
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,036
I wanted the ambassador position

142
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,247
to deal with North Korea's nuclear issue,
like you have.

143
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,251
Putting aside everything else,

144
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,464
his views on reunification
are risky at best.

145
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,716
-He's still figuring it out.
-Do you know why?

146
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,928
Because he doesn't care.

147
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,597
The policy that his campaign
first introduced

148
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,307
was the Social Isolation initiative.

149
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,351
Then climate, and food, and agriculture.

150
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,936
After that, gender.

151
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,316
And when is he going to discuss…

152
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,651
inter-Korean relations?

153
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,860
The North could fall any day,

154
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,238
and most young people oppose reunifying.

155
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,282
Last year Jang was a star, after he said,

156
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,701
"If it requires
South Korea being sacrificed,

157
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,538
reunification isn't desirable
or necessary."

158
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,999
He even said that we should consider
a constitutional revision

159
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,585
to split Korea into separate nations.

160
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,340
Even a young politician,
going for the cool factor.

161
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,425
Should know better, right?

162
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,095
Reunification issues…

163
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,723
will hit us suddenly,

164
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,519
like some inevitable disaster.

165
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,772
I wanted to tell you,

166
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:51,276
he's attending a mass
for reunification today.

167
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,821
He says he has an announcement
to make when the service is done.

168
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,908
Regarding the reunification?

169
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,871
Madam President…

170
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,334
No matter how late,
Junik wants to speak with you today.

171
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,961
He said that?

172
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,005
Why?

173
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,299
He hasn't told me. Not yet at least.

174
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,968
I understand.

175
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,140
Yes, I've been ready for this.

176
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,610
Sorry.
This work thing came out of nowhere.

177
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,362
Will you please
tell your folks I apologize?

178
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,156
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

179
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,868
I would have canceled my appointment here
if you had let me know.

180
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,746
Tonight was also important to me.

181
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,080
You've worked so hard,

182
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,874
and I've wanted to tell your parents

183
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,251
what a great job you've been doing
in the States.

184
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,502
You see, um…

185
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,258
I was prepared to follow you wherever
you had to go as your personal aide.

186
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,930
So I closed out all my savings accounts
and then I…

187
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,974
was ready to leave whenever you'd call.

188
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,268
Sudan, Syria, Iraq…

189
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:11,439
I really didn't care if it was the most
dangerous place in the whole entire earth.

190
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,235
Except of course, there's one place
I never, ever want to go.

191
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,153
The New Republicans.

192
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,406
Yeah, your husband's the
New Republican Party's top candidate.

193
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,869
I just can't work for that party
in any capacity, I can't do it.

194
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,954
Yeah.

195
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,375
When you're married you…

196
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,418
accept your husband's weakness
as your own.

197
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,879
Is this really what you want to do?

198
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,174
Junik will run for president
regardless of how I feel.

199
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,220
So if he wants this,
then it's better I stay by his side.

200
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,808
Your political career
is going to end if you do.

201
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,028
What's this?

202
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,909
I really needed you.

203
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,246
Thanks for coming back, Munju.

204
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,627
It's pretty.

205
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,838
What's with the cross?

206
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,425
I hear it's the most popular design

207
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,093
for two thousand years now.

208
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,888
You want me to wear this
to the church later?

209
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,058
A picture of you praying
with that necklace on would be incredible,

210
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,560
don't you think?

211
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,187
You want me to pray now, too?

212
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,273
I think I could do all right…

213
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,525
if you would pray for me.

214
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,862
You want me to pray
that you'll be president?

215
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,297
Pray that I handle the challenges,

216
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,258
although I can be weak at times.

217
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,392
You called and asked
that I come back last month.

218
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,938
I could tell in your voice
something was wrong.

219
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,902
What's going on?

220
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,071
Why won't you just tell me?

221
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,658
Why don't we talk tonight?

222
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,703
To be honest, it's a long story.

223
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,852
The two of you will sit right here,
with security here--

224
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,604
Let's keep them out of the church.

225
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,066
-I'm sorry?
-Well, it is a mass for peace, isn't it?

226
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,943
A lot of important people will be there.

227
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,447
I don't want it to look like I'm scared
in the house of God.

228
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,908
Keep them out of sight.

229
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,245
But, sir, I think…

230
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,163
Should we get some peaches later?

231
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,129
Peaches this time of year?

232
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,090
You'll get some, right?

233
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,843
I thought you didn't like peaches.

234
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,679
Well, suddenly I'm craving them.

235
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,023
No peaceful reunification!

236
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,192
No peaceful reunification!

237
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,069
Eliminate the traitors!

238
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,155
Eliminate the traitors!

239
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,365
No peaceful reunification!

240
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,784
No peaceful reunification!

241
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,411
Eliminate the traitors!

242
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,954
Eliminate the traitors!

243
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,040
No peaceful reunification!

244
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,834
We're here at
Peace and Forgiveness Church,

245
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,295
where a mass for peaceful
reunification will be held.

246
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,921
The mass, scheduled to begin shortly,

247
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,924
will be attended by prominent figures
from several fields.

248
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,467
It's generating a lot of buzz

249
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,179
because Assemblyman Jang Junik
of the New Republican Party,

250
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,140
known for opposing reunification,
is attending.

251
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,766
No peaceful reunification!

252
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,393
Eliminate the traitors!

253
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,395
Eliminate the traitors!

254
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,898
History repeats itself!

255
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,233
Jang Junik must step down!

256
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,736
Step down! Step down!

257
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,362
Eliminate the traitors!

258
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,616
DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNISM IS
THE ONLY WAY FOR REUNIFICATION

259
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,828
History repeats itself!
Jang Junik must step down!

260
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,247
Step down! Step down!

261
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,835
-No peaceful reunification!
-No peaceful reunification!

262
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,713
-Eliminate the traitors!
-Eliminate the traitors!

263
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,381
REUNIFICATION IS HELL

264
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,551
-No peaceful reunification!
-No peaceful reunification!

265
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,846
-No peaceful reunification!
-No peaceful reunification!

266
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,374
Have the security team wait outside.

267
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,461
And Changhee, find a safe place
for Munju to stay for a while, okay?

268
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,715
Make sure it's ready
so she can head straight there.

269
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,383
Right away, sir.

270
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,365
ENTRANCE HYMN
THE LITTLE TREE BOYS CHOIR

271
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,827
What's that?

272
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,078
Nothing.

273
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,462
Let us pray.

274
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,590
Almighty and eternal God,

275
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:57,219
please have mercy on this nation
divided into North and South.

276
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,765
And bring peace and forgiveness
to our land.

277
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,224
Amen.

278
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,143
Amen.

279
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,480
"Wake up."

280
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,525
"But if you do not wake up,
I will come like a thief,

281
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,947
and you will not know
at what time I will come to you."

282
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,492
This is the word of the Lord.

283
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,286
Let us all stand.

284
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,814
Assemblyman Jang!

285
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,572
Why would you betray us?

286
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,327
You swore not to reunify.

287
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,295
No! No!

288
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,090
Oh, honey, sweetie!

289
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,758
You'll be okay!

290
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,303
Mr. Jang!

291
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,727
You're going to be okay, Junik.

292
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,486
"No peaceful reunification"?

293
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,824
REUNIFICATION IS HELL

294
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,829
I'll convince him.

295
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,459
Sergeant Kim Yongjun.

296
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,879
Drop the gun.

297
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,512
Go in!

298
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,853
Sweetie.

299
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,651
You're okay.

300
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,075
Our…

301
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,162
peaches…

302
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,703
Junik.

303
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:10,955
Junik!

304
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,499
Junik! Honey!

305
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,125
No, sweetie!

306
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,464
JANG JUNIK SHOT…
TAKEN TO HOSPITAL

307
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,217
We've just received breaking
news that Assemblyman Jang Junik

308
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,136
of the New Republican Party has been shot.

309
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,388
Our reporter on the scene
has further details.

310
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,557
We're here
at Seongmun University Hospital,

311
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,685
where Assemblyman Jang Junik
is undergoing emergency surgery.

312
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,020
His family, including his mother,

313
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,315
Chairwoman Lim Okseon
of Aseom Shipping, has just arrived.

314
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,234
Aseom Shipping,
the nation's largest shipping company,

315
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,986
operates over a hundred vessels,

316
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,739
as well as a global network
of logistics facilities.

317
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,490
Uh, yes, hello.

318
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,492
I have a flight to Washington DC
scheduled tomorrow

319
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,952
that I'm gonna have to cancel.

320
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,079
The suspect, Kim,
a 27-year-old man,

321
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,497
with a military background

322
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,500
is known to be involved
with an anti-reunification group.

323
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,055
OPERATING ROOM 1

324
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,641
He's coming out.

325
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,319
Mr. Jang Junik passed away
tonight due to excessive blood loss.

326
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,696
His time of death was 9:15 p.m.

327
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,200
Oh, God.

328
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,164
Are you okay?

329
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,290
Let's get you out of here.

330
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,299
Breaking news.

331
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,927
Assemblyman Jang Junik,
who was shot during the mass

332
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,721
and rushed into emergency surgery,
tragically passed away

333
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,723
at 9:15 p.m. tonight.

334
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,855
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG JUNIK

335
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,607
OF NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY
ASSASSINATED

336
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,515
Following the sudden death
of Assemblyman Jang Junik,
Following the sudden death
of Assemblyman Jang Junik,

337
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,809
the political sphere remains in turmoil.

338
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,020
The New Republican Party
is discussing countermeasures

339
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,229
after losing its candidate.

340
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,399
And it seems changes to
the primary schedule are unavoidable.

341
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:37,870
My husband is dead, my son is dead,
and now my grandson's dead.

342
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,664
I guess we'll have three widows
living under one roof.

343
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,961
You're not alone, Grandma, okay?

344
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,505
When my son died,

345
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,009
I resented you for being alive, Okseon.

346
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,304
You understand my pain now, don't you?

347
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:02,728
Now you have to watch your son's widow,
who didn't even give him a child,

348
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,396
enjoy his inheritance.

349
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,689
You're right, Mother.

350
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,358
When my husband was sick,

351
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,279
you made sure that our oldest son
got everything instead of me.

352
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,116
Which only served you in the end.

353
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,328
How was I to know?

354
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:25,375
Grandma, Mother, Munju.

355
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,713
I know it's not the best time to tell you,

356
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:33,300
but I've decided to run for president
in Junik's place.

357
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,097
You're going to do what?

358
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,934
The party's approval ratings
since Junik's death

359
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,937
are the highest they've been
since its founding.

360
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,106
Someone has to take his place.

361
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:50,025
And the party believes
I'm the right person for the job.

362
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,654
According to the most recent polling,
I'm likely to win…

363
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,448
by a landslide, actually.

364
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,451
Who's been telling you this?

365
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,371
Hwang Mangi, the party leader.

366
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,503
I always knew…

367
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,173
there'd be snakes with Junik's death.

368
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,260
I expected that from Hwang Mangi.

369
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,305
But you, my own son?

370
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,766
So you don't think…

371
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,477
I have what it takes?

372
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,647
Junsang, you're best as a prosecutor.

373
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,192
If anyone takes his place in the election,

374
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,527
it should be Munju.

375
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,573
Okseon. What are you saying?

376
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,742
There's something called
a widow's succession in American politics.

377
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,453
People will always
vote for a politician's widow.

378
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,622
That's how we win this.

379
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,374
You think I'll lose…

380
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,086
but Munju will win?

381
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,680
Sorry I'm late.
The review took longer than expected.

382
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,890
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

383
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,976
I thought I would choke from how
uncomfortable this has become.

384
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:11,815
The late Assemblyman Jang Junik
personally hired a lawyer two weeks ago

385
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,067
to handle arrangements for his estate.

386
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,361
I only received the details yesterday.

387
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,078
STATEMENT OF THE GIFTED PROPERTY

388
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:29,625
He left a total of 4,410,550,090 won

389
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,461
to Ms. Seo Munju, his wife.

390
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,798
He also left five real estate properties
worth a total of 28 billion won

391
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:37,883
to Seo Munju.

392
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,761
His tangible assets worth 5.5 billion…

393
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:41,887
BENEFICIARY
SEO MUNJU

394
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,515
-…he left to her as well.
-Look, stop complicating this.

395
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,019
Just tell us
what do we get after her share?

396
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,271
I have yet to receive the details
to his overseas assets,

397
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,940
so I can't say for sure,

398
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,318
but I don't think there's anything left.

399
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,237
That's absurd. It's just nonsense.

400
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,240
How do you know this wasn't forged,
or if that lawyer is a fraud?

401
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,118
It's been confirmed
that each of the transfers

402
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,746
was legitimate and-and legally valid.

403
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,540
The Jang family started by selling salt.

404
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,835
We built this fortune
over three generations of hard work.

405
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,171
There's no way that girl
who came into this family

406
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,465
with no home or status
has any claim to it!

407
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,343
Go ahead.

408
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,846
I want an explanation. What's is all this?

409
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,724
I have no idea.

410
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,727
Look, I'm as surprised as all of you.

411
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,604
He said he'd sort out his assets

412
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,482
and that I should
turn in my ID to a lawyer.

413
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,150
You see, I told you.

414
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,903
You never should have let him
marry such worthless trash.

415
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,030
Grandma, don't start this again.

416
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,408
You couldn't even give him a child.

417
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,910
Why not?

418
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,538
He spent every night alone because of you.

419
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,248
Mother, would you please stop!

420
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,546
And you, be honest with us.

421
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,216
You had to know people would gossip.

422
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,301
They'll think you killed Junik for money.

423
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,846
A woman who had nothing
before she was married

424
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,640
becomes a widow right after
her husband gives her everything.

425
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,476
How do you explain that?

426
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,438
Who would give away
their entire fortune for no reason?

427
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,148
And you didn't know anything about it?

428
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,735
After sitting here
with you and Grandmother tonight…

429
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,113
I can understand
why he left me everything.

430
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,532
Grandmother.

431
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,619
I am not worthless trash.

432
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,206
I had a mother who gave everything
to raise me with love and care.

433
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,297
You always treated me like I was a beggar
and I just ignored it.

434
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,299
My mother taught me not to feel inferior

435
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,218
and to never be ashamed of who I am
or where I'm from.

436
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,097
I guess Junik couldn't stand it.

437
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,517
He left me all his money
so you wouldn't look down on me anymore.

438
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,479
My goodness, look at her face.
See how she's glaring at us.

439
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,773
If you truly loved Junik so much…

440
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,734
…why didn't you shed
a single tear at his funeral?

441
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,278
I always had a feeling, you know?

442
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,363
There's something wrong with you.

443
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,909
I get it now.

444
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,746
Junik was just angry

445
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,416
with all of us for how…
how we treated you, correct?

446
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,795
And this is him expressing
that resentment.

447
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,964
But

448
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,052
this whole thing feels like
some kind of cruel joke.

449
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,347
I didn't have it easy here.

450
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,601
Still, I endured and helped
this family grow its fortune.

451
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:42,734
Every piece of land and property you
inherited has my fingerprints all over it.

452
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:48,490
But above all, I poured my heart
and soul into raising my son.

453
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,202
It's like tending to a tree
through a storm,

454
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,455
and then waiting for it
to bear fruit after so long,

455
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,458
only to lose it just before the harvest.

456
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,960
Try to imagine

457
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,129
what that feels like.

458
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,842
I'm not accepting this.

459
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,553
Losing Junik ripped out my heart.

460
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,139
And now I'm supposed to watch you
take everything that's left of him?

461
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,724
It took three generations
to build your wealth.

462
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:15,809
And I don't want it.

463
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,813
-I'll donate everything and leave Korea.
-Who says it's yours to donate?

464
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,984
-You're not going anywhere.
-We should sue, all right?

465
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:28,488
First off, we'll file an injunction
to freeze all of the assets,

466
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,867
and then a claim for the return
of the statutory share of the inheritance.

467
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,493
None of this adds up.

468
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:34,578
Got it?

469
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,415
Get the best lawyers you can.
The cost is irrelevant.

470
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,624
Very well.

471
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,003
This isn't about the money for me either.

472
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,797
It's about the pride I have as a mother.

473
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,757
And I'm going to fight until the end.

474
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:52,345
I'll file endless lawsuits,
and ensure you'll never get anything.

475
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,139
Do whatever you want.

476
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,432
I'm not afraid of you.

477
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,437
I want everyone here early tomorrow.
There's a lot of work to do.

478
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,688
Yes, ma'am.

479
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:05,775
Ah, you're meeting here at my house again?

480
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,281
I'm sorry,
since when does she own this house?

481
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,368
Since ten days ago.

482
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,662
Don't worry, Grandmother.

483
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,789
I'm not as cruel as you think I am.

484
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:30,508
Munju. The best way to handle a lawsuit
is to not get involved in one.

485
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,596
People will talk,
and no one walks away without being hurt.

486
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,891
I know you're uncomfortable

487
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,771
-with having all this inheritance.
-No, it's okay.

488
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,608
The only ones who get hurt
in lawsuits are the ones in the wrong.

489
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,402
Grandmother will…

490
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:52,364
Listen, they won't
just go after the money.

491
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,492
They'll try to break your soul,
down to the last piece.

492
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,670
I've always wanted to help you out.

493
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,090
Trust me, let's end this on good terms.

494
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:16,137
And if you really want to donate it,
how about contributing to my election?

495
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,267
If you and I team up, we could have
the most incredible synergy…

496
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,311
I'd prefer if you just sued me.

497
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,816
INTERNATIONAL CALL

498
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,403
Mark? Hey, you there? It's Ethan.

499
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,071
How did you get my number?

500
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:18,074
It's nice to hear your voice too, buddy.
I've got a job for you.

501
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,534
I'm done with that.

502
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,077
Mmm, you sure?

503
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:25,373
It's a big one, like Swiss-account big.
And the client says it's got to be you.

504
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,208
It's a security detail.

505
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:31,129
Widow of a South Korean politician,
name of Munju Seo.

506
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,306
She's the client?

507
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,184
No, Seo doesn't even know she's in danger.

508
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,271
Our client wants you to be her bodyguard,
but keep it a secret.

509
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,315
What does that mean?

510
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,151
Well, it means she needs to think
hiring you was her idea.

511
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,195
You can't disclose anything
about our client

512
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,741
and they want some intel on her,
who she meets, what they're talking about…

513
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:09,834
His name was Kim Yongjun, 27 years old.
He was with the Special Warfare Command.

514
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,005
I can tell you the guy was a nutcase.
But one with a cause. You know the type.

515
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,383
I went to check out his place,

516
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,094
and he had tons of photos
and information on Mr. Jang Junik.

517
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,346
I think he got angry
when Mr. Jang's actions

518
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,306
didn't line up with what he expected.

519
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:24,849
Did he have any family?

520
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,687
One older sister and a father,
but his sister got married and moved out.

521
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,064
And his father is deaf
and can't communicate.

522
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,067
People like him all have one thing
in common. They're loners.

523
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,903
And the anti-reunification group
didn't seem to know who he was.

524
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,572
So they'll probably conclude
he acted alone.

525
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,908
What about that man?

526
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,451
The one from the church.

527
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,829
Oh, Mark Paik?

528
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,955
Mr. Paik Sanho.

529
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,749
People at the church say
he's a North Korean defector,

530
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,501
his neighbors say he's from Yanbian,

531
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,045
and his co-workers say he's from Russia.

532
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,297
But from what we've found,
he's actually American.

533
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,924
We've been looking all over
for him just to

534
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,552
get his witness statement,
but we can't find him.

535
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,345
I don't believe he just disappeared.

536
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,765
Oh, honey! Sweetie, you'll be okay.

537
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,936
Why not?
He spent every night alone because of you!

538
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,731
A woman who had nothing
before she was married

539
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,359
becomes a widow right after
her husband gives her everything?

540
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,203
Thanks for coming back, Munju.

541
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,797
I've been watching her.

542
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,383
She experienced a serious trauma, but…

543
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,265
she hides her emotions well.

544
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,815
She still maintains her daily routine,

545
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,193
stays incredibly busy,

546
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,154
not interested in eating.

547
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,662
And also,

548
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,373
a little careless.

549
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,895
But she has no idea that she's in danger.

550
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,150
So,
you had your little investigation.

551
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,152
What's it going to be? You taking the job?

552
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,237
No.

553
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,989
Not interested.

554
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,951
I don't see a need to be involved here.

555
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,081
She seems strong.

556
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,252
Stronger than you would think.

557
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,732
You're Munju, right?

558
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,235
Your husband, Junik,

559
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,573
visited here the day before he passed.

560
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,992
Confessed to all of his sins.

561
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,871
and was forgiven for all of it.

562
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,125
I got baptized
when I was married 20 years ago.

563
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,337
I've been wanting to leave the church,

564
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,756
but the Catholic Church
has no way to do that.

565
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,509
After my husband's death…

566
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,638
I lost him recently,

567
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,765
so I'm allowed to be honest,
right, Father?

568
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,643
Junik always believed in this place.

569
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,813
He said the house of God
was the safest place.

570
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,567
But if this really was the house of God,

571
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,571
then he allowed one of his guests
to be killed inside of it.

572
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,283
If God were a human, Father,

573
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,287
I'd call him a monster.
A monster or a psychopath.

574
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,290
Except that's a blasphemous thing to say.

575
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,712
So I think that, respectfully,
I'll choose not to believe in him.

576
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,384
At times like this,

577
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,930
I can't help but think about Job,

578
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,851
a man who went through
so much suffering for no reason.

579
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,938
Don't tell me I'll understand
the meaning of this one day, Father.

580
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:45,276
That's the kind of thing people say
when you lose a baby.

581
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,195
The devil himself

582
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,865
is responsible for this.

583
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,620
I felt the pain

584
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,416
of losing my whole family
right before my eyes.

585
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,837
And 70 years later,
the meaning of it still evades me.

586
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,465
So I won't tell you anything like that.

587
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,758
However,

588
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:13,137
Job saw the face of God
in the middle of a storm.

589
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,433
Munju… Sorry, Ms. Seo.

590
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,561
A storm is heading towards us.

591
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,022
And when the time comes,
you will have a question

592
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,816
to ask him desperately.

593
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,526
Then…

594
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,071
come and talk to me.

595
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:35,410
In the meantime, remember,
I'll be praying for you.

596
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,830
Mr. Paik Sanho.

597
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,668
I came here to speak to him.

598
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,505
Could you tell him

599
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,466
that I came looking?

600
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,297
Paik Sanho, right?

601
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,677
I'm really sorry

602
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,929
about your husband.

603
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,202
He looks like the guy
who was at the church.

604
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,038
The American, Paik Sanho.

605
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,416
Let the boss know.

606
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,798
-I need to ask you something.
-Are you aware someone's trailing you?

607
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,386
Let's talk somewhere else.

608
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,351
-I think they're onto us.
-Follow them. This is Team 1.

609
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,435
The target's in pursuit.

610
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,201
-Ms. Seo, stop please.
-Keep walking.

611
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,370
Could you stop for a moment? Ms. Seo?

612
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,454
Close your eyes and then open them.

613
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,775
Seoul is a very well-lit city.

614
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,570
Those guys will never be able to catch us.

615
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,198
They don't know how
to operate in the dark.

616
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,752
You're keeping up pretty well,
for someone from the city.

617
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,507
Are you familiar with these mountains?

618
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,636
I know every mountain in Seoul,

619
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,972
all the waterways, underground passages,
abandoned buildings…

620
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,016
Basically anything that's not on the map.

621
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,978
For people like me, the first thing we do
is figure out escape routes,

622
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,146
places to hide,

623
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,732
and where to stay the night,
should the reason arise.

624
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,444
What exactly do you mean,
"people like you"?

625
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,364
Someone who doesn't have a country.

626
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,081
You said you wanted to ask me something.

627
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:03,552
It's about…

628
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,640
the man who murdered Junik.

629
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,521
You heard the last thing he said, right?

630
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,481
Junik.

631
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,441
Junik! Honey!

632
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,367
I killed the spy.

633
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,294
"I killed the spy," he said.

634
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,429
People say that the man was crazy.

635
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,808
But his voice…

636
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,103
his eyes.

637
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,984
Every single night I think about it.

638
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,278
And I feel more sure.

639
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,489
That he wasn't crazy.

640
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,203
Mr. Paik, you saw him a lot
closer than I did.

641
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,874
So you're the only person that I can ask.

642
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,504
I don't believe that Mr. Kim was,
uh, crazy or lying. But I do think…

643
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:24,091
I do think that there was someone else
pulling the strings.

644
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:34,727
"Wake up…"

645
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,645
This man is Mr. Kim.

646
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,066
And I've watched this over and over again,

647
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,903
wondering if I could've stopped it
if I got there sooner.

648
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,488
…This is the word of the Lord.

649
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,032
And then,
I noticed something strange here.

650
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,622
What did he put in there?

651
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,099
What is this?

652
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,856
I tried to call this number,
but it was out of service.

653
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,820
There were people who
clearly wanted to know who made the call.

654
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,863
All right, let's move.

655
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:33,494
I looked into it, and it turns
out that number was never in use.

656
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:38,082
So whoever's card it is, well,
they must have the ability

657
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,876
to erase phone records.

658
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,003
That, or they're able to use

659
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,714
whatever caller ID they want.

660
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,511
Madam President.

661
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,311
Seo Munju, how much can you trust her?

662
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,777
What is it, Director?

663
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,881
Look at this.

664
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,426
I checked all the CCTV footage
from the church,

665
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,802
and here's what I found.

666
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,294
That's my husband's brother.

667
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,505
So, Junsang…

668
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,591
met with Sergeant Kim that day.
