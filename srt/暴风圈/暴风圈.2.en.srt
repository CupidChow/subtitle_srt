1
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,936
TEMPEST

2
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,972
Sir.

3
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,529
Sir, I don't know what…
…what I'm--

4
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,953
TWO MONTHS BEFORE
JANG JUNIK'S ASSASSINATION

5
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,373
How reliable is your intelligence?

6
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,791
Well, we can trust the satellites,

7
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,335
but the real question is,
how did they build it?

8
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,046
It's not possible
without Russian and Chinese cooperation.

9
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,132
Which means their tacit approval here
is a given.

10
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,009
Better believe they have
the resolve to launch those missiles.

11
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,136
Yeah, I'm afraid
I agree with the chairman.

12
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,637
Mr. President.

13
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,850
Sit down, everyone.

14
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,011
Hey.

15
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,721
Really appreciate it.

16
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,807
-All right, take care. Travel safe.
-Of course.

17
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,975
All right.

18
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,487
Hello there, sir.
The two of us spoke on the phone.

19
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,485
I had a dream.

20
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,697
In the dream,

21
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,990
I was a woman.

22
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:24,996
For South Koreans,
people in North Korea are not just anyone.

23
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,790
IRAQ, 2023

24
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,585
Millions of South Koreans
still have our family members

25
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,171
and relatives living in the north.

26
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,426
To us, they're still
our brothers and sisters.

27
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:43,432
Far into the future when we look back
and think about what we have done,

28
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,893
I sincerely hope that
we will be able to say

29
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,647
that we did the right thing
for the people in North Korea

30
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:56,903
who deserve to live a decent life,
just like us.

31
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,323
Even in a storm…

32
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,910
…I wanted to run.

33
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,177
JANG JUNIK

34
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,558
When did my husband
tell you to increase security?

35
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,270
-I'm sorry?
-It wasn't so heavy before?

36
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,439
He was clearly on edge about something.

37
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,149
I'm wondering, Changhee.

38
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,817
You know his routine.

39
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,194
Everything about him.

40
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,739
It was a few months ago.

41
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,285
He began taking personal calls
and meetings in complete secrecy.

42
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,537
-I was kept out of it.
-…make time soon to talk.

43
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,748
I received a letter from the States.

44
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,375
I need to discuss it with you.

45
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,296
Hey, where are you…
Sir, where are you going?

46
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,380
Mmm.

47
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,760
He was especially anxious
the day before you got back.

48
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,054
He requested
that I double the security team.

49
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,598
And then he asked for a detour
on the simplest route.

50
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,683
But, sir, may I ask you
what this is about?

51
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,775
A squirrel is following us.

52
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,277
A squirrel?

53
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,018
When Junsang was young,
he got bitten by a squirrel

54
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,311
and was left with a scar.

55
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,900
Look who it is.

56
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,819
Junsang?

57
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,905
That's how he earned the nickname.
Squirrel.

58
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,324
The violent little squirrel.

59
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,370
Looks like him, right?

60
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,312
Hey, Miji.

61
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,772
I'm looking into Kim's family
like you asked,

62
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,067
I came to see his father at his house.

63
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,070
But they're packing up
like they're going on a trip.

64
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,156
I see a lot of luggage.

65
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,742
And they're all getting in a van.

66
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,493
Something feels off.

67
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,329
There's these guys here helping them.

68
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,206
But they don't seem like family.

69
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,459
Someone's trying to cover this up.

70
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,545
-I can follow behind.
-No.

71
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,213
It's too dangerous.

72
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,381
I got this.

73
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,593
I was a divorce attorney's…
…right hand.

74
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,637
Comes with the territory.

75
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,597
Let me know where they're going.

76
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,351
And I'll see you there.
Don't get out until I arrive.

77
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,610
Last Sunday,

78
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:28,073
some members of the Catacomb
in the north visited your grandmother

79
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,534
and left her a bundle of rice,
bread and a letter.

80
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,995
She seems healthy.

81
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,043
The letter says that you'll be there
the day after tomorrow

82
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,628
to take her to China.

83
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,715
She hung up a white shirt
as her signal back.

84
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,468
It means that she understands.

85
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,597
You should go with her while you can.

86
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,058
So today?

87
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,644
The situation is bad and getting worse.

88
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,729
If you don't hurry, you might not make it.

89
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,149
What is this about, Father?

90
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,613
There was something that Mr. Jang
wanted me to do.

91
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,786
I have been asking God
how I can uphold that agreement.

92
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,666
The church will fall into chaos soon.

93
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,545
What was it that Mr. Jung
had requested from you?

94
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,381
If it's somehow connected to the murder,

95
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,592
you'll be in as much danger as he was.

96
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,177
Our promise.

97
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,140
A promise that was made in the face of God
between myself and Junik.

98
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,893
It's most important right now

99
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,104
that you move your grandmother
out of the country.

100
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,524
If you don't do this,
you'll regret it your whole life.

101
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,322
It's something to do
with North Korea, isn't it?

102
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,581
This is Saint Anthony.

103
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,916
All this time, he's kept me safe.

104
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,352
Good evening.

105
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,690
That's three adults and one child,
four total.

106
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,984
One-way tickets to Melbourne, Australia
for tonight?

107
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,152
Yes, that's correct.

108
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,654
One-way to Melbourne? But why?

109
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,868
Sorry to bother you.

110
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,162
Mind if we ask you some questions?

111
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,918
The person
you are trying to reach is not available--

112
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,966
Junsang.

113
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,512
So Miss Miji Yeo,
where'd you come across a gem like her?

114
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,930
She's a tough one.

115
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,767
-Where are you?
-It was not an interrogation.

116
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,144
I kept telling her I just wanted to talk.

117
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,439
But she claimed
you had nothing to with this

118
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,858
and insisted on her right to silence.

119
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,443
Ah, shit.

120
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,155
I said, "Where are you?"

121
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,243
I'm surprised.

122
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,037
You're being quite rude.

123
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,835
When you come and pick up your friend,
let's see how far that gets you.

124
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,878
Okay?

125
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,428
What are you up to, Munju?

126
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,223
I'm looking for answers about my husband.

127
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,142
Didn't you read the report?

128
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,228
The murderer was anti-reunification.

129
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,815
Why did you follow Junik?

130
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,117
Are you implying
I had something to do with it?

131
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,043
I expect this from other people,
but…

132
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,462
…we're family, Munju, right?

133
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,800
Would you be interested to know
what I've actually done for Junik?

134
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,218
What I've gone through for him?

135
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,762
A reason?

136
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,683
That a prosecutor of this country…

137
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,562
had his brother tailed.

138
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,735
He was a spy.

139
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,909
That's not true.

140
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,577
You think I'd say this without proof?

141
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,289
After they caught the shooter,
I assembled a special unit.

142
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,042
To cover it all up.

143
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,170
All the evidence.

144
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,505
And everyone involved.

145
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,258
Why?

146
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,094
At any moment,
inter-Korean relations could change.

147
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,684
What happens when a presidential candidate
is revealed to be a spy?

148
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,145
Think of the damage that would do.

149
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,235
Or a plot from North Korea
could've been behind the murder.

150
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,695
Then we're on the brink of war.

151
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,908
And if the United States
has become involved,

152
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,912
the bond between our two nations
could be ruptured.

153
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,957
Are you implying

154
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,584
the US was involved with this?

155
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,262
We will meet again someday, won't we?

156
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,513
Mmm.

157
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,394
Oh, right.

158
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,312
The wine is for you.

159
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,690
Don't forget to take it with you
when you get back.

160
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,327
Father, would you mind
if I took this as well?

161
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,454
I might need it.

162
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,915
To find guidance in the darkness.

163
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,757
My son, take care.

164
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,510
Be safe out there, my young friend.

165
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,098
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

166
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,683
Amen.

167
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,656
HOLY BIBLE

168
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,676
Attention, passengers,

169
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,680
boarding will soon begin for flight 1945
service to Dalian.

170
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,933
Boarding will close
ten minutes prior to departure.

171
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,810
Attention, passengers,

172
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,854
boarding will soon begin for flight…

173
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,939
Sanho Paik, an American.

174
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,278
Top mercenary with Valkyrie,
the military contractor.

175
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,781
Heard of him?

176
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,325
They'll protect or kill anybody.

177
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,952
As long as the money's right.

178
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,537
No questions asked.

179
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:40,546
People like me, first thing we do
is figure out escape routes.

180
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,216
What exactly do you mean,
"people like you"?

181
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,260
Someone who doesn't have a country.

182
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,517
The man caught at the scene,
what do you think he was doing there?

183
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,438
Just a little coincidence?

184
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,734
Do you see it now?

185
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,072
Do you understand why it has to be me?

186
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,367
For my family, my country,

187
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,120
and even global peace,

188
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,288
I have to clean this all up.

189
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,583
Just imagine

190
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,794
if my mother

191
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:25,383
discovered that her handsome, beloved,
and charming son was…

192
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,928
a spy for another country.
It'd be awful.

193
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,014
Obviously, you envied Junik.

194
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,434
You were hoping he would fail
and you wanted to take his place.

195
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,899
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

196
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,861
Right.

197
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,113
Opportunity of a lifetime for you.

198
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,700
The thing is, I know who my husband was.

199
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,870
He may have been foolish at times

200
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,706
but he wasn't a spy.

201
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,502
You say you have evidence,

202
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,132
but I suspect that someone
went out of their way to fake this.

203
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,551
Proof that frames an innocent man.

204
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,469
That's your specialty.

205
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,431
We decide who spies are.

206
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,309
And what constitutes as evidence.

207
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,563
It's just what we have to do
to protect out country.

208
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,649
Really?

209
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,234
How patriotic.

210
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,030
The truth around Junik's death
will come out.

211
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,073
I don't know about world peace,

212
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,534
but I'll do what it takes
to find peace of my own.

213
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,047
I really did want to help
when you came to me.

214
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,424
But you've left me with no choice.

215
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,551
This is not my style.

216
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,095
Miji…

217
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,557
Oh, the blood?

218
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:00,228
Let's just say biting a sitting prosecutor
will have its legal consequences.

219
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,273
Well, I'm sure you deserved it.

220
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,027
The two of you

221
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,240
should make arrangements
to leave Korea in 24 hours.

222
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,368
Your Mrs. Yeo has older parents.

223
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,036
I would hate for them

224
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,706
to spend the rest of their lives
waiting for her return.

225
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,005
If Miji's okay, let me see her.

226
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,472
Now's when you learn
about how we use real power

227
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,058
to get someone
to act against their interests.

228
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,896
It's really something to behold.

229
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,739
-Ms. Seo?
-I'm here, Miji.

230
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,950
Are you doing okay?

231
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,578
Doing okay here. Sorry to worry you.

232
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,414
Just keep thinking
about getting home to your parents.

233
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,625
Stay focused on that. You'll be with them
within the next 24 hours.

234
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,961
Don't bow down
to these pieces of shit for me.

235
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,963
All right, Ms. Seo? I'll be fine.

236
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,341
Try and stay calm, okay?

237
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,510
Just trust me.

238
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,387
I'll have all taken care of by morning.

239
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,930
I trust you, Ms. Seo.

240
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,024
If you so much as lay a hand on Miji,

241
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,525
I'll make sure you pay for it.

242
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,610
How about

243
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,696
we both keep our promises?

244
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,429
Father Yang? It's Seo Munju.

245
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,379
Father?

246
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,053
Calm down.

247
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,223
Keep quiet, okay?

248
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,035
I was too late.

249
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,754
-I'm calling the police.
-I need to get out of here first.

250
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,133
Whoever did this
was looking for something.

251
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,645
Who put you up to this?

252
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,271
What were you looking for?

253
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,028
The whale in the distant sea.

254
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,785
Father Yang,
are you in there?

255
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,537
What's going on?

256
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,080
Father Yang!

257
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,583
Father Yang!

258
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,045
Go get the key.

259
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,404
Wait a minute.

260
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,535
Someone out there will help you, Ms. Seo.

261
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,120
Hang on.

262
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,623
I gotta ask you something.

263
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,813
We haven't used the tea room
since my husband passed away.

264
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:24,194
Have you ever been here before,
by any chance?

265
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,113
My first time actually.

266
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,699
But I've definitely heard about it.

267
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:33,454
The old men who were worried
about the country would gather here.

268
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,585
Well, as I'm sure you've heard,
this room is safe to say anything in.

269
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,171
The strictest security is in place.

270
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,508
You know, I really put in a lot of effort
into getting you appointed

271
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,927
to your position.

272
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,763
And can I ask why, ma'am?

273
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,560
I wouldn't think of myself as very close
with you or the late minister.

274
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,695
I've been a part of this circle
of military wives for quite a while.

275
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,199
In those 40 years,

276
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:14,495
I can't recall meeting anyone else
as gracious as your wife.

277
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,832
When there's somebody as perfect as her,

278
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,670
it says a lot about her husband.

279
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,050
My wife is the one to thank
for me being here.

280
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,511
She made sure I kept this appointment.

281
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,182
She reminded me how terrible it would be
to abandon you in your time of need.

282
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,850
Although beyond that,

283
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,560
she refused to say why.

284
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,188
Mr. Yu.

285
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,941
Think back on your life.

286
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,860
When were the challenges insurmountable?

287
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,449
When my second child was ill.

288
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,493
Mmm.

289
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,164
We had a mystery donor.

290
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,292
Someone who covered the cost of surgery.

291
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,588
I wish she hadn't told you.

292
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,884
Keeping our spouses from worrying,
that's a wife's duty.

293
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,933
Now, tell me, Mr. Yu.

294
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,979
In the case of my dear son Junik,

295
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,398
was the US involved?

296
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,485
Can't be sure.

297
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,989
But we've received intel.

298
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,534
Anderson Miller,
an Assistant Secretary of State,

299
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,161
is being sought by the US,

300
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,746
the FBI to be precise,

301
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,374
under suspicion of disclosing
classified government secrets.

302
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,045
This Miller is wanted as a spy,

303
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,630
and it sounds like Junik
was talking to him.

304
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,968
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding.

305
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,219
The truth is,

306
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:58,724
in the months leading up to his death,
your son was being watched by us.

307
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,642
Why?

308
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,311
Under suspicion of treason.

309
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,649
We think he may have communicated
with the North from this very house.

310
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,322
Absolutely absurd.

311
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,574
Ms. Lim.

312
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,827
There a bugs planted
throughout the mansion.

313
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,502
Who's doing this? And why?

314
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,837
Is the president trying to frame my son?

315
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,893
Keep an eye out for this man.

316
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,482
He's a private mercenary for Valkyrie.

317
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,526
Those people will do anything for money.

318
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,528
We don't know what he's doing,

319
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,947
we don't know why
he's approached your son,

320
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,490
or who brought him into this.

321
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,912
What is this place?

322
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,540
An underground tunnel
from the Japanese occupation.

323
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,716
This network of churches
with underground tunnels

324
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,468
connecting the North and South
is called the Catacombs.

325
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,763
Only a handful of people,
including Father Yang and myself,

326
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,265
know about them.

327
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,567
I heard that you're a mercenary
for a private military group.

328
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,445
At Valkyrie, contracts are
renewed every one or two years.

329
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,282
My contract was done a year ago,
and I chose not to renew it.

330
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,537
You were the closest person to my husband
and Father Yang when they died.

331
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,456
Is that a coincidence?

332
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,588
This passage is 40 feet below ground.

333
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,925
If you really thought I was dangerous…

334
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,721
then it's very curious
that you would follow me down here.

335
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,975
I found this
in one of Father Yang's bibles.

336
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,233
On the back of his hand, a puncture wound.

337
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,237
He was poisoned to death.

338
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,199
Ordinary people don't use those methods.

339
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,955
The killer was looking
for something in his room, right?

340
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,123
Father Yang said
that at mass tomorrow,

341
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,710
he'd be relaying a message left with him
by Assemblyman Jang.

342
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,549
Junik had planned to announce something
at the end of mass that day.

343
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,694
SANHO, MARK

344
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,819
That's Mayang Island.

345
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,906
Youngpo Shipyard.

346
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:17,417
"Dear Junik, this is a satellite image
from DIA two weeks ago."

347
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:21,505
This object is suspected to be
a 10,000-ton class nuclear submarine.

348
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,175
We suspect that the object
is a 10,000-ton nuclear submarine,

349
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,968
spanning 460 feet.

350
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,514
It's equipped with 16 of the most
advanced vertical SLBM launch tubes,

351
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,101
capable of holding 128 nuclear warheads.

352
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,394
If… If our analysis is correct,

353
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,231
then the North Korean nuclear threat
is very real.

354
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,193
Holy shit.

355
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,445
-Yeah.
-Hey, fucktard!

356
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,572
Weren't you the one
who insisted that the submarine

357
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,659
the North Koreans were building
was a 3,000-ton rickety piece of junk?

358
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,579
What if one day that venereal dipshit
says he's gonna nuke our country?

359
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,165
What… What are you going to do then?
Fuck's sake.

360
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,501
-Could you be any shittier at your job?
-Sir, I don't know what--

361
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,794
-No, no, no.
-W-W-What I'm--

362
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,213
Shut the fuck up! That was rhetorical.

363
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,299
The news hit us like a ton of bricks.

364
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,682
The submarine is expected
to be unveiled two months from now.

365
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,518
In time for North Korean leader
Kim Hansang's birthday.

366
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,814
Mr. President.
We're planning a precision strike

367
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:24,734
with low-yield tactical nuclear weapons
on a total of 40 targets,

368
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:28,572
including North Korea's
nuclear storage facilities, missile silos…

369
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,409
US military is planning
to launch simultaneous precision strikes

370
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,996
to wipe out all of North Korea's
military nuclear facilities.

371
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,124
Our missile guidance system
has a strike record of over 98%.

372
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,168
We're confident
we can destroy these targets.

373
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,011
Excuse me, what…

374
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:57,142
What about the possibility of a full-scale
escalation across the Korean peninsula?

375
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,478
The Herman report suggests
there's a 32% chance

376
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,564
that a preemptive strike
against North Korea

377
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,524
could result in full-scale war,

378
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,318
and while there's a 41% chance

379
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,945
that we could contain the conflict
to this region,

380
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,280
if it does escalate,

381
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,366
the entire East Asian region
will become a battlefield.

382
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,994
Something isn't right here.

383
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,873
The North Koreans don't have the capital
or the technology to pull this thing off.

384
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,584
We could be putting
millions of lives at risk, sir.

385
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,419
Let me just check to see
if this thing is real.

386
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,088
I don't need you
to do shit, all right?

387
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,757
This operation will be over
in five minutes.

388
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,593
I'm talking about
the warfare of the future,

389
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,387
with the weapons of the future,
and the strategies of the future.

390
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,765
And the history
of future warfare starts now.

391
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,517
You know what?

392
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,354
Stop trying to act like
you're being objective.

393
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,692
You're barred from this room from now on.

394
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,194
Presidential orders.

395
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,410
Having a Korean face

396
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,872
and advocating for the most
aggressive policies against Korea,

397
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,708
that plays well in Washington.

398
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,379
But this plan needs to be reconsidered.

399
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,506
Help me, Junik.

400
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:16,096
My phone, laptop, all my electronics…

401
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,391
there might be eyes and ears
on all of them.

402
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,738
Please reply via encrypted email
using the enclosed key,

403
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,032
and burn this letter once you've read it.

404
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,626
"Anderson Miller."

405
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,587
The US Assistant Secretary of State.

406
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:53,091
My husband met him while they were
both getting doctorates at Georgetown.

407
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,930
This must be what Junik
was planning to announce that day.

408
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,473
He wanted to prevent a war.

409
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,643
I have to get to North Korea soon.

410
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,478
That's what Father Yang told me to do.

411
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,817
He knew a war could break out.

412
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,240
You have family in the north?

413
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,999
You should go.

414
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,293
I'll take care of the letter.

415
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,921
You'll be putting yourself
in a lot of danger.

416
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,132
Are you ready for that?

417
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,888
Yes.

418
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,908
This is the only way.

419
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,202
It's what my husband was planning to do.

420
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,954
You sure you can trust them?

421
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,542
She's the most reliable
and powerful person in this country.

422
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,423
You can leave now, Mr. Paik.

423
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,592
I'll take it from here.

424
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,696
He's the patron saint
for counter-revolutionaries.

425
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,282
It's a gift from Father Yang.

426
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,453
But I have miles to go
and should travel light.

427
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,389
Yes, of course, sir. I understand.

428
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,184
I realize she's not someone who
can just take a last-minute appointment.

429
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,521
I know she's very busy,
but it doesn't have to be immediately.

430
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,022
I just need a moment.

431
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,191
I'll be here.

432
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,943
No, I'm not pressuring her.

433
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,154
I have something urgent we--

434
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,471
Why are you bothering my Chief of Staff?

435
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:48,308
Sorry I did that, Madam President.
I know it's not protocol,

436
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,393
but this news was too important to wait.

437
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,562
The country could be at stake.

438
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,693
US military is planning
to launch simultaneous precision strikes

439
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,697
to wipe out all of North Korea's
military nuclear facilities.

440
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,409
But this plan needs to be reconsidered.
Help me, Junik.

441
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,375
I think that Junik was planning
to discuss this with you,

442
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,294
to work together to find a solution.

443
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,921
Mmm.

444
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,528
Why didn't Assemblyman Jang
burn the letter after reading it?

445
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,865
If he did,
Father Yang would be alive right now,

446
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,245
and you wouldn't have to deal
with all of this mess, would you?

447
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,642
For days after the Assemblyman's death,

448
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:17,230
South Korean and American
intelligence agents were in turmoil.

449
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,150
Once I began to understand the situation,

450
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,820
I came to the same conclusion
as the Assemblyman.

451
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,156
We have to prevent war at all costs.

452
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,952
Which means you stay out of this.

453
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,205
What?

454
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,293
Diplomacy is done. This is war.
A game of chicken.

455
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,671
Two men of debatable sanity
are speeding directly towards one another.

456
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,883
They are both daring each other
to make the move.

457
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,468
But they won't stop.

458
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:52,015
We could be standing there, waving a flag
saying, "Peaceful solution, gentlemen."

459
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,017
You think they'll listen?

460
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,313
So what exactly is your plan?

461
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,565
Next step is to pick a car to ride in

462
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,276
and try to make them change directions.

463
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,029
Munju.

464
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,700
You know what your problem is?

465
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,578
You are always too honest.

466
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,081
For a diplomat, that's a disadvantage.

467
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,333
As a smaller nation,

468
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,127
when we were scrambling
for anything we could get

469
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,588
that type of charm had its uses, but…

470
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,674
as a tool for standing up
to Hauser's regime,

471
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:30,720
managing hostile, multilateral diplomacy,
you are absolutely hopeless.

472
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,933
Do you really think
quitting was your choice?

473
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,935
You were fired.

474
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,937
In order to get results in this world,

475
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,023
one must use deception, betrayal,
scheming, lying and slander.

476
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,858
So, we replaced you.

477
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,693
Because you couldn't do it.

478
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,988
You see?

479
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,075
Even now you can't believe
that I would betray you.

480
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,086
Listen to me.

481
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,547
Death and war isn't the same as murder.

482
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,134
Your husband's tragic death
will get handled,

483
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,804
but we'll handle it politically
and with strategy.

484
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,892
So you know who killed him
and you're just covering it up.

485
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,270
The death of your husband
provides an opportunity

486
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,481
to hitch a ride with the Americans.

487
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,401
You should leave the country.

488
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,319
You're interested
in nonprofit work, right?

489
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,570
Just go.

490
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,781
Doesn't matter where
as long as it's quick.

491
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,368
And don't think of this as advice.

492
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,746
This is an order.

493
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,416
And what if I refuse?

494
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,500
You won't.

495
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,254
I'm responsible for preventing war
on the Korean peninsula.

496
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,091
This is a lot bigger than any one person.

497
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,186
DALIAN, CHINA

498
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,519
Pay up first.

499
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,201
Let's go.

500
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:45,641
We found a new house.

501
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,393
We'll all be out of here soon.

502
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,947
I have to ask you, Mother.

503
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,868
Why were you against
Junik and I getting married?

504
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,707
You said you would cut him off
and never see him again.

505
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,174
I wanted for my son

506
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,385
to marry someone warm, someone happy.

507
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,305
But you're the opposite of that.

508
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,935
I thought he'd be unhappy,

509
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,520
and then the worst happened.

510
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,190
Finally we got your approval.

511
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,609
I know we couldn't get married without it.

512
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,780
On the outside, it may have looked like
Junik's father was in charge,

513
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,366
but I know that you made
all the decisions.

514
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,087
Before the wedding,
I conducted a thorough background check.

515
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,382
Your mother raised you alone in America.

516
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,509
There's so much she went through…

517
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:06,847
she worked at a nail salon,
as a hospital janitor, and a cashier…

518
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,391
So many different jobs.

519
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,434
When she got sick,

520
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,105
Junik helped you take care of her
until she died.

521
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:22,071
In college,
you made your model UN speech go viral,

522
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,282
and I came across this article about you.

523
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,954
A young student with the Korean
national flag on her wall.

524
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,165
Even in South Korea,
young patriots can be rare.

525
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,377
I always wanted to be accepted
in my home country.

526
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,921
For a long time,

527
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,632
I dreamed of having a life in Korea.

528
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,467
And that is why

529
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,263
we wanted Junik to go into politics.

530
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,433
Our family worked towards this
for generations.

531
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,518
But there was always something he lacked.

532
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,521
Something I could never give to him.

533
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,398
And then,

534
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,192
I realized it was patriotism.

535
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,237
That's why I accepted you.

536
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:07,867
I had to admit that you were exactly
the partner he needed. A good asset.

537
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,871
Let me ask you something.

538
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,749
Do you still think…

539
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,047
that I should be the one
running for president

540
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:23,716
instead of Junsang?

541
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,689
Junsang was never likable,
not even as a child.

542
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,941
Junik was always the popular one.

543
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:42,818
But you…

544
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,489
You're something special.

545
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:48,532
How can I put it?

546
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,119
People are willing to back you.

547
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,746
They feel safe with you

548
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,581
and not because they want to win,

549
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,000
but because they wouldn't mind
losing with you.

550
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,338
If I were the party chair,
I would choose you.

551
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,841
Certain traits can be worked on
with proper training,

552
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,928
although some you have to be born with.

553
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:19,563
Junik became a top presidential candidate
at such a young age.

554
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,942
I'm aware of how much of that
was your work.

555
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,778
His party, the media,
sponsors, the district…

556
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:29,573
You must have spent decades
preparing everything for him.

557
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,207
Why are you telling me
what I already know?

558
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,335
I thought it must be painful for you.

559
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,838
You laid out all these…

560
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,507
intricate plans just to--

561
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,010
Come up short at the very end?
You assume I'm devastated.

562
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,763
That's why I thought that

563
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,349
if I offered my hand, you might take it.

564
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,518
Even though you don't like me,

565
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:01,480
I may be your only chance
to finish what you started.

566
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,833
If my son…

567
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,420
hadn't done what he did with his money,

568
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,173
I could have felt sorry for you.

569
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,885
I lost my child and you lost your husband.

570
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,387
All women are different, but…

571
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,515
we are very much the same.

572
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:43,481
I will take this
the rest of the way, Mother.

573
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:50,988
AMNOK RIVER, CHINESE BORDER

574
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,490
We won't make it today either.

575
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,658
I have to cross
the border today!

576
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,494
You know my family's been waiting for me.

577
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,330
Forget about them.
It doesn't matter if you're dead!

578
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,707
River's blocked. You can't go any further.

579
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,337
The Storm Corps has been all over here
the past few days.

580
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,384
What is this?

581
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,345
Just go.
This is how everyone else does it.

582
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:18,599
Run!

583
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,226
Shoot them!

584
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,354
In the water!

585
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,981
Get in the water! Get them!

586
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,483
Don't let them cross!

587
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,864
Let's talk business, Munju.

588
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,659
What do you want from me?

589
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,579
And what do I get in return?

590
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:47,253
I want you to put me in the presidential
race right where Junik left off.

591
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:50,798
If I become a candidate…

592
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:55,761
I will hand over the remainder
of Junik's assets.

593
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,847
Including this house.

594
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,352
AGREEMENT ON THE DIVISION
OF INHERITED PROPERTY

595
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:07,481
So if I help you get the nomination,

596
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,527
you'll hand over everything,
even his overseas assets?

597
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,117
If this were a novel,
the author would write,

598
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,077
"She had been waiting…

599
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:26,250
a long time for the day
when her husband would die,

600
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,211
so she could reclaim
the dream she had lost."

601
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,388
STUDENT RECORD

602
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,973
Tell me what it says.

603
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,061
That used to be your dream.

604
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,066
PRESIDENT

605
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,490
So, Munju. How should we begin?

606
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,327
What would you like me to do first?

607
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,000
I want you to call Junsang.

608
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,837
Tell him to return my assistant.
Miji is to be sent home.

609
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,423
Junsang will withdraw his candidacy,

610
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,342
and leave the country in 24 hours.

611
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,411
I know you don't believe in God.

612
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:50,542
You may utter prayers with your mouth,
but your soul doesn't truly rely on Him.

613
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,337
You try to do everything by yourself.

614
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,922
But, my dear boy,

615
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:59,718
even if you never know God's love, you
can't go through life without human love.

616
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,262
Who says that
I haven't experienced human love?

617
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:08,060
Leaving home and going off to wander
the world is something we do to find love.

618
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,522
But you're risking everything
to go back home.

619
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,113
I'm going to stop this war.

620
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,865
You'll be putting yourself
in a lot of danger.

621
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,451
Are you ready for that?

622
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,455
Yes.

623
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,496
Tell the client…

624
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,835
I'll take care of her.
