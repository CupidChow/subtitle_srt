00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,936
TEMPEST

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,812
There they are!

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,982
Hurry! Get moving. Radio HQ.

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,360
Requesting immediate apprehension
of a small vessel

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,694
that just left Morae Port.

6
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,615
Onboard are North Korean assassin
Paik Sanho and Seo Munju,

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,159
wanted for the murder
of Assemblyman Jang Junik.

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,374
<i>This is the Coast Guard.</i>
<i>Stop your ship.</i>

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,752
<i>Cut your engines,</i>
<i>put down your weapons and stand down.</i>

10
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,464
<i>Stop your vessel immediately.</i>
<i>There's still time to end this peacefully.</i>

11
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,924
Status report!

12
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,927
<i>We've arrested one male</i>
<i>and one female.</i>

13
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,014
<i>There's no sign of Seo Munju.</i>
<i>No sign of Paik Sanho either.</i>

14
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,475
-<i>Neither of them were on board.</i>
-Ow. Stop!

15
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,856
Start a checkpoint dragnet
and seal off all the roads.

16
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,569
Get all units mobile.
I want choppers and drones in the air.

17
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,571
We need to capture them.

18
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,824
President Chae is following this.

19
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,827
Understood, sir.

20
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,246
<i>Breaking news.</i>

21
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,499
<i>Seo Munju, the leading candidate</i>
<i>for the New Republican Party,</i>

22
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,794
<i>is reportedly on the run,</i>
<i>facing allegations of espionage</i>

23
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,548
<i>and planning the murder of</i>
<i>her late husband, Assemblyman Jang Junik.</i>

24
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,175
Call the NIS director.

25
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,136
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,390
<i>Her personal bodyguard, Mr. Paik Sanho,</i>

27
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,474
<i>who fled with her,</i>

28
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,894
<i>is said to have fired roughly 20 rounds</i>
<i>during the attempted arrest</i>

29
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,063
<i>and is believed to still be armed.</i>
<i>Police are--</i>

30
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,941
<i>They're likely to be using</i>
<i>the ambassador's car to escape.</i>

31
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,111
<i>All checkpoint units,</i>
<i>review suspect descriptions</i>

32
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,155
<i>and thoroughly inspect all vehicles.</i>

33
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,198
I feel like I'm dreaming.

34
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm suddenly called a murderer,

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,871
and you're some North Korean spy.

36
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,375
So what do we do now?

37
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

38
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,511
<i>police have arrested Director Im Dujin</i>
<i>of the Institute for Peace.</i>

39
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,973
<i>Im has acted both as</i>
<i>Seo Munju's reunification policy adviser</i>

40
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,850
-<i>and a close personal mentor.</i>
-Good to see you, sir.

41
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,729
<i>He has confessed to espionage and</i>
<i>confirmed Ambassador Seo's involvement.</i>

42
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>Team One. No vehicles</i>
<i>in sight. Continuing surveillance.</i>

43
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,286
<i>Team Two.</i>
<i>Barrier is up. We're standing by.</i>

44
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,455
<i>Team Three.</i>

45
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,124
<i>Setting up our barrier now.</i>
<i>Will report if anyone tries to flee.</i>

46
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,460
<i>All teams,</i>
<i>suspects may be armed.</i>

47
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,878
<i>Tighten inspections.</i>

48
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,547
<i>We've established</i>
<i>a joint police and military task force</i>

49
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,715
<i>to apprehend Seo Munju,</i>

50
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,510
<i>on suspicion of espionage</i>
<i>and murder conspiracy.</i>

51
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,514
<i>2,800 police and 1,300 military personnel</i>
<i>have been deployed</i>

52
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,432
<i>to block all possible escape routes.</i>

53
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:07,229
{\an8}As we learn more regarding the whereabouts
of the suspect, Ambassador Seo Munju,

54
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,606
{\an8}we'll be informing the public routinely

55
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,316
{\an8}and doing all that we can
to keep you safe.

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,277
But it's not a crime
to take a boat out to sea, is it?

57
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,780
Y-You're… You're holding me
here illegally, sir.

58
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,532
I have rights, don't I?

59
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,076
You're not here
because you took a boat out to sea.

60
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,327
You wired 50 million won

61
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,080
to Sergeant Kim Yongjun's sister's husband
Oh Sanguk,

62
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,707
at 5:48 p.m. on October 7th, correct?

63
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,462
You are suspected of conspiring
to murder Assemblyman Jang.

64
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:36,842
Wait, me?

65
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,593
Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,138
You sure it was me?

67
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,476
<i>Police have launched</i>
<i>a large-scale search by land and sea,</i>

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,479
<i>but the whereabouts</i>
<i>of presidential candidate, Seo Munju,</i>

69
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,399
<i>and her bodyguard, Paik Sanho,</i>
<i>remain unknown.</i>

70
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,944
<i>Meanwhile, suspicions of a personal</i>
<i>relationship with her bodyguard,</i>

71
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,864
{\an8}<i>along with accusations of espionage</i>
<i>and incitement to murder…</i>

72
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,534
{\an8}Well, I knew that young woman
was making way too much noise.

73
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,745
<i>We'll update you again</i>
<i>as soon as we learn more.</i>

74
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,422
This was my plan.
I can still make it work.

75
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,303
I was going to orchestrate
a major incident she was at the center of.

76
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,600
One where a leading candidate
in the race for the presidency

77
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,687
is arrested as a spy and murderer
in front of the whole country.

78
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,135
Did you really wanna forget what we had?

79
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,350
I wasn't gonna forget you.

80
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,979
When I left you it hurt me so much.

81
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,940
I felt like bleeding out.

82
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,569
But I just started to accept that…

83
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,907
that I would just continue
to keep bleeding

84
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,619
for the rest of my life, Sanho.

85
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,872
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,959
I had no idea who I was working for.

87
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,005
All I knew was that I had to protect you.

88
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,133
Well, I'm sorry too.

89
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,804
It's my fault that recording got out.

90
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,018
My mother-in-law broke into my computer
and forced Kang Hanna to release it.

91
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,812
I saw how much it hurt you,

92
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,649
but I just couldn't bring myself
to tell you.

93
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,277
You would never have been through that
if it wasn't for me.

94
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,239
That night that we had,

95
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,118
I finally realized who I really was.

96
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,041
And what I have been missing
for a long time.

97
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,295
I realized
I'd never been truly happy before.

98
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,549
That I never had what I actually wanted.

99
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,931
I couldn't believe…

100
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,643
that in just one night,

101
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,104
I could feel so alive.

102
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,447
That's why I could take
all the criticisms and personal attacks.

103
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,242
I always knew that, sooner or later,

104
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,994
I would pay the price for my happiness.

105
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,375
I was ready to give it all up.

106
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,336
And I'm still ready to do that.

107
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,674
If we can make it out of here
tonight safely, then we should go.

108
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,468
No.

109
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,556
You shouldn't have to accept that.

110
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,224
I know I couldn't.

111
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,606
Do you know where I was
when I first saw you?

112
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,318
Wasn't it at the church?

113
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,155
Before that.

114
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,034
I was in Iraq.

115
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:59,914
<i>For South Koreans,</i>
<i>people in North Korea are not just anyone.</i>

116
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,417
- <i>Millions of South Koreans…</i>
<i>- I saw you on the news.</i>

117
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,629
<i>…still have our family members</i>
<i>and relatives living in the North.</i>

118
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,800
<i>To us they're still</i>
<i>our brothers and sisters.</i>

119
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:16,389
<i>Far into the future, when we look back</i>
<i>and think about what we have done,</i>

120
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,058
<i>I sincerely hope</i>

121
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,477
- <i>that we will be able to say…</i>
<i>- I didn't think someone like you…</i>

122
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,686
<i>…that we did the right thing.</i>

123
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,481
<i>…could exist.</i>

124
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,193
<i>Even the light looked different on you.</i>

125
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,864
For peaceful streets,

126
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,574
happy families,

127
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,826
a world where people have each other.

128
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,665
And also for a nice cold beer to drink
at the end of a long, hard day.

129
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,126
<i>That was</i>
<i>the greatest day of my life.</i>

130
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,546
You were a shining beacon of hope
for everyone,

131
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,299
and I was asked to protect you.

132
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,930
My whole life had been spent
guarding people for money.

133
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,267
Suddenly I was protecting
someone precious to me.

134
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,271
I know when you're most
like yourself, Munju.

135
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,278
And that's when you're trying to protect
everyone's peace and happiness.

136
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,573
I know that's who you really are.

137
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,913
I'll keep protecting you, and only you.

138
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,540
So don't quit.

139
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,043
Please keep going, Munju.

140
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,589
Uncover the truth about the submarine
and stop this war.

141
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,260
I'll be right there with you.

142
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,152
Where are we supposed to go now?

143
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,124
Peaches?

144
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,841
Our…

145
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,719
peaches…

146
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,888
Should we get some peaches later?

147
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,072
With the weather turning,

148
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,159
uh, it will be difficult
to keep searching through the night.

149
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,953
So criminals can escape in the rain,

150
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,207
but the police can't chase them? Idiot.

151
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,888
Madam President.

152
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,140
<i>Labeling Seo Munju a murderer…</i>

153
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,895
Was this also part of your plan?

154
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,697
You looked everywhere?
Even the attic and basement?

155
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,867
Yes, ma'am, we did.
But we couldn't find him anywhere.

156
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,829
Eunseong is good at hiding.

157
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,041
When his mother's not here,
he always finds a place to hide.

158
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,128
I'm sure he's just asleep in a corner.

159
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,631
Ms. Lim.

160
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,259
I was checking security footage.

161
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,346
And cameras 2, 8, and 11 were frozen
for three minutes and thirty seconds.

162
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,683
Do you understand
how much that child is worth?

163
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,396
Find him.

164
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,232
Search to the ends of the earth
if you have to.

165
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,658
Mom, are you awake?

166
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,077
Mm-hmm.

167
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,247
I'm so happy that you're here.

168
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,293
You are?

169
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,591
I've always wanted
to come and hide away with you.

170
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,845
I wanted that too.

171
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,116
SIMSIM TEMPLE

172
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,278
You should've come sooner.

173
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,666
UNNAMED CHILD

174
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:56,104
<i>No one else knows about this place</i>
<i>except for me and Junik.</i>

175
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,691
JULY 11, 2014

176
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,277
<i>Just like no one else remembers our baby.</i>

177
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,030
<i>Dear Munju,</i>

178
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,325
<i>it's taken me a long time</i>
<i>to write you this letter.</i>

179
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,744
<i>I have a son.</i>

180
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,205
<i>His name is Eunseong.</i>

181
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,040
<i>He's nine years old.</i>

182
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,627
What's going on?

183
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,129
Why won't you just tell me?

184
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,047
Why don't we talk tonight?

185
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,134
To be honest, it's a long story.

186
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,187
No.

187
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,148
Tell me now.

188
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,154
Or you may never have a chance to.

189
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,206
I have a son.

190
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,752
I know that I should've told you
a while ago.

191
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,089
But I was scared.

192
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,261
I wasn't sure I could live without you.

193
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,057
<i>But thinking that I might die,</i>
<i>it became clear.</i>

194
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,560
I should've set you free years ago.

195
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,981
I will be telling everybody everything.

196
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:08,236
I'll be resigning from my posts
and withdrawing from the election.

197
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,696
Then I plan to tell the truth
about Mother.

198
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,075
I am in the position
to put a stop to this war.

199
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,831
Everything is in here.

200
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,627
My mother's secrets, her ledgers.

201
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,217
<i>If I'm gone use this to protect yourself.</i>

202
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,970
Tell me that you understand.

203
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,729
You're leaving me like this?

204
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,899
Munju,

205
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,319
our marriage was already over…

206
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,073
a long time before I died.

207
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,157
Remember?

208
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,327
I said if you ever lost your way,

209
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,081
I would come and find you
even if it were years later.

210
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,166
This is it.

211
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,711
Here I am…

212
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,590
setting you free.

213
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,927
You have to be careful.

214
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,640
Munju, my mother is more dangerous
than you can imagine.

215
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,395
There is something awful inside of her.

216
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,099
I HOPE YOU WILL BE SAFE

217
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,221
Thank you for waiting for me.

218
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,186
Where do we go now?

219
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,821
<i>Across every key institution,</i>

220
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,699
<i>from the KCIA to the NIS,</i>

221
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,327
<i>my mother kept close ties with the wives</i>
<i>of over 30 former leaders.</i>

222
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:08,165
<i>She held their firstborns and cried</i>
<i>with them when their mothers died.</i>

223
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,597
Hey, what happened?

224
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,851
What-What the hell?
Get in there! He needs help!

225
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,520
<i>That's how she had the influence</i>
<i>to choose who lived and died.</i>

226
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,523
-All right, get an EMT. Go!
-Yes, sir.

227
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,527
<i>At the NIS,</i>
<i>there's no file of her activities.</i>

228
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,323
This morning,
Im Dujin was poisoned to death.

229
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,493
Forensic services sent the test results.

230
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,662
It was neostigmine bromide.

231
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:52,668
The exact toxin Sergeant Kim Yongjun
ingested after shooting Jang Junik.

232
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,760
Is my daughter-in-law
responsible for his death as well?

233
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,018
The first person
who suspected Junik of spying

234
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,480
was Prosecutor Jang Junsang,
working for the NIS.

235
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,191
<i>He was going through call records</i>
<i>for a Chinese front</i>

236
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,610
<i>that turned out</i>
<i>to be a North Korean spy network.</i>

237
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,033
And then he saw an outgoing call
made from inside his own house.

238
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,787
<i>After that he discovered</i>
<i>the name of a company…</i>

239
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,334
<i>…one owned by Jang Junik.</i>

240
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,670
<i>They'd wired money to</i>
<i>a North Korean shell account in Macau.</i>

241
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,798
{\an8}<i>Assemblyman Jang Junik,</i>

242
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,925
{\an8}<i>running in the primary for</i>
<i>the New Republican Party,</i>

243
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,968
{\an8}<i>continues to rise steadily in the polls.</i>

244
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,555
{\an8}<i>He is rapidly solidifying his position</i>
<i>as the leading presidential contender.</i>

245
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,016
<i>Jang is quickly closing this gap</i>
<i>with current front-runner,</i>

246
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,851
<i>former Governor Hong Seongo,</i>

247
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:54,146
<i>while continuing to widen his lead</i>
<i>over the remaining candidates.</i>

248
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,818
After a lot of thinking,
he came to me with it.

249
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,569
I believe…

250
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,198
my brother could be a spy.

251
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,835
But then…

252
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,462
I had this thought.

253
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,631
"Why didn't he consider the possibility

254
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,008
that someone else in the house
made the call?"

255
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,850
Are you accusing me of something?

256
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,979
Aseom Shipping. They've supplied cargo
to North Korea for 16 years,

257
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,730
going between North and South.

258
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,734
Your husband,
Chairman Jang Gilhwan, died in 2015.

259
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:45,281
Although you were always
the power behind the company.

260
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,658
I think it's entirely possible…

261
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,955
the person who made that call
to North Korea was you, Ms. Lim.

262
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,921
Ah.

263
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,258
Also Prosecutor Jang is here right now.

264
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,013
Junsang's here?

265
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:13,601
<i>We'll clear things up</i>
<i>when we bring you face-to-face.</i>

266
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,022
There's a fine line
between a spy and a patriot.

267
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,025
But you're a businesswoman,
so you'll understand exactly what I mean.

268
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,735
We're preparing an…

269
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,697
operation to eliminate Kim Hansang.

270
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,158
This is the only way that South Korea

271
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,454
can regain control
from the US in this war.

272
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,709
If you help us succeed,
you won't be seen as a spy.

273
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,420
I'll promise that.

274
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,799
You will be seen as a patriot.

275
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:46,884
Or better…

276
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,304
you'll be a true heroine.

277
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:06,403
Do you know why you were selected
as the director of NIS, Mr. Yu?

278
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,907
Because you were deemed ready.

279
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,204
Twenty years ago, in your book
on information warfare for reunification,

280
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:20,292
you had already started devising
how to win over public opinion

281
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,628
beyond just military victories.

282
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,421
I remember this passage.

283
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,840
"To start a war, you need momentum.

284
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:30,386
It requires the power of a rocket launch
to gain public opinion.

285
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,139
To ignite the support
of the public for war,

286
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,310
you need a specific incident
to light the fuse for you,

287
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,478
such as the…

288
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,358
sacrificing of Joan of Arc at the stake."

289
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:47,903
Unhak,

290
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,157
you know very well
that's happening, don't you?

291
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,080
So let's speak frankly.

292
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,793
To start this war, who do you think
should be burned at the stake?

293
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,713
Seo Munju or me?

294
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,812
Arrest Seo Munju first,
and then I'll help you.

295
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,818
Kim Hansang's head could be yours.

296
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,281
You said Junsang is here?

297
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,450
I'll take him with me.

298
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,764
Mother?

299
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:57,848
Stand up.

300
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,606
Let's go.

301
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,837
Did you make this call?

302
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,385
Mom, did you…

303
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,935
really kill your own son?

304
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,107
You fool.

305
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,360
Junsang,

306
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,321
you were the only son I've ever had.

307
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,386
<i>We got something.</i>

308
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,305
<i>Mr. Anderson Miller and I</i>
<i>have looked through</i>

309
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,891
<i>all the Shiv Holdings</i>
<i>transactions together</i>

310
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,310
<i>and noticed a consistent cash flow.</i>

311
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,814
<i>Money flows from Idisha's benami</i>
<i>account to Shiv Holdings,</i>

312
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,608
<i>and from Shiv Holdings</i>
<i>to North Korea's benami account.</i>

313
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,238
The cash flow suggests that
North Korea's selling something to them.

314
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,074
Is that cash flow related
to the submarine?

315
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,201
<i>Okay. We're not sure.</i>

316
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,413
<i>What we do know is that</i>
<i>Idisha has been waging a war</i>

317
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,208
<i>against the United States</i>
<i>using North Korean weapons.</i>

318
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,712
{\an8}<i>And Shiv Holdings is the broker.</i>

319
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,257
We've got the slush fund ledger
from Aseom Shipping.

320
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,137
"BANK STATEMENT
FOR SELECTED PERIOD"

321
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,348
<i>Money came in</i>
<i>from the United States' enemies</i>

322
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,768
<i>and went to Apex Starlight Ltd.</i>
<i>through Aseom Shipping.</i>

323
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,190
<i>But according to my research</i>
<i>on Apex Starlight Ltd…</i>

324
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,485
I found the CEO, Matthew Sinclair.

325
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,155
Coldrain's financial head.

326
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,117
Secretary of Defense Eagleton
served as an adviser for them.

327
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,537
And from now on you're barred
from this room. Presidential orders.

328
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,416
What?

329
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,710
Does that mean someone in the US

330
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,130
is exporting weapons
to America's enemy nations?

331
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,715
Stella Young is an arms dealer

332
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,551
who provides weapons from
the United States and North Korea

333
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,055
for the failed states and enemy countries
of the United States.

334
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,100
Eagleton is a fucking traitor.

335
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,603
This is it. This is the answer.

336
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,439
<i>This is how North Korea</i>
<i>has been so well-armed</i>

337
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,900
<i>despite aggressive sanctions</i>
<i>for the past 20 years.</i>

338
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,987
I was curious as well,
why war never stops in this world,

339
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,740
and who benefits from those wars.

340
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,742
Eagleton never refused a war.

341
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:08,497
While America's enemies fight
against America with American weapons,

342
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,833
any war benefits him.

343
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,588
Meanwhile Chairwoman Lim Okseon
has been behind the scenes,

344
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,300
boosting North Korea's
weapons manufacturing capabilities.

345
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,219
We could go public.

346
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,389
Let the people know that
the Secretary of Defense

347
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,266
has been inciting conflicts
around the world to sell arms.

348
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,936
I mean, imagine what would happen
if the people knew

349
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,481
that enemy states were using
American arms against American soldiers.

350
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,274
This would be worse than Watergate.

351
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,026
America's fucked!

352
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,947
I think I should meet the president.

353
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,158
If President Chae can deliver this news
to the US president,

354
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,494
he won't choose war.

355
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,376
I've ordered
a new investigation.

356
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,966
A re-examination of all the evidence
tying Seo Munju to the murder.

357
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,344
You have, ma'am?

358
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,309
I suspect that someone
has been orchestrating this whole thing.

359
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,026
Miji.

360
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,488
Thank God. I'll be right there.

361
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,075
Ms. Seo, Miji's arrest warrant was denied.

362
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,327
She's being released soon.
I'll go get her.

363
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,329
-Okay. Be careful though.
-Yeah.

364
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,679
Mom is busy.

365
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,766
We're going far away,
and she has to pack and get ready.

366
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,727
What are you drawing?

367
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,939
It's for that man
who was nice to me.

368
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,193
I think he kinda looks like a deer.

369
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,071
He does?

370
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,075
They can be really fierce.
Did you know that?

371
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,162
A male deer would even fight a lion

372
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,333
if it meant they would protect
a female deer or their baby.

373
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,016
Ugh!

374
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,102
<i>Where are you?</i>

375
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,186
Miji, are you out?

376
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,063
Yeah, I'm at the crosswalk.

377
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,357
-I'm almost there so I'll see you soon
-<i>All right. Hang on a sec.</i>

378
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,067
I'm on my way, but I got stuck.

379
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,486
<i>Gotcha.</i>

380
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,904
I'll wait for you then.

381
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,280
Does across the street work or…

382
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,121
Miji?

383
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:55,664
Miji!

384
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,965
Ms. Seo,

385
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,676
I think Miji got into an accident.

386
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:14,599
People are saying an ambulance came
and took her away, but…

387
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,400
Mother.

388
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,694
<i>You're not easy</i>
<i>to get on the phone.</i>

389
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,530
What did you do to her?

390
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,003
Her organs were ruptured
and internal bleeding is severe.

391
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,838
<i>They say she'll die</i>
<i>without emergency surgery.</i>

392
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,553
ASEOM SHIPPING AIRFIELD

393
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,766
I'll keep her alive for now.
Bring Eunseong to me within the hour.

394
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,189
<i>You'd better not be late.</i>

395
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,691
<i>Apparently her legs are pretty mangled.</i>

396
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,318
<i>If you're even a minute late,</i>

397
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,238
<i>I'll tell the doctor</i>
<i>to start amputating, one leg at a time.</i>

398
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,714
Come on.

399
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,471
Mother has kidnapped my aide.

400
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,975
If I don't give her Eunseong
within an hour, then Miji is…

401
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,816
We need to leave.

402
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,818
Take Eunseong and go.

403
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,238
Go before she can find you.

404
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,948
What are you going to do?

405
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,699
I have a handle on this.

406
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,746
But you should get out of here too.

407
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,706
Your aide isn't what matters now.

408
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,045
<i>My beloved citizens of Idisha,</i>

409
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,256
<i>I am here with you.</i>

410
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,424
<i>We are not losing this war.</i>

411
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,345
{\an8}<i>By sunset tomorrow, we will win the war.</i>

412
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,474
<i>The King of Idisha has</i>
<i>declared war on the United States.</i>

413
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,352
The submarine isn't at Youngpo Shipyard.

414
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,021
It left for the Pacific a while ago.

415
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,440
It will be in Idisha's hands in 24 hours.

416
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,418
<i>Okseon is following the submarine.</i>

417
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,965
Terrible things are about to happen.

418
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,386
{\an8}<i>People of America, hear my words.</i>

419
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,348
{\an8}<i>If you kill one of ours,</i>
<i>we will kill ten of yours.</i>

420
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:06,187
<i>Do you think what happens on our land</i>
<i>cannot take place on yours?</i>

421
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,278
I'm headed to Australia.

422
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,780
The entire Northern Hemisphere
could be in danger.

423
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,784
Don't think about trying
to prevent this war.

424
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,954
What could you or I possibly do?

425
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,167
We need to get going.

426
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,502
Things are moving quickly now
so stay sharp.

427
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,633
{\an8}<i>We have found the ultimate solution.</i>

428
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,177
{\an8}<i>You have one day.</i>

429
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:42,891
<i>America must start withdrawing its troops</i>
<i>from our land before the end of tomorrow.</i>

430
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,310
-Is that footage real?
-What are they talking about?

431
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,604
Well, I mean,
are they talking about nukes?

432
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,107
Find out what they mean
by "the ultimate solution."

433
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,946
{\an8}<i>You will see what I will bring</i>
<i>to your doorstep.</i>

434
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,992
<i>The King of Idisha's</i>
<i>announcement is, in essence,</i>

435
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,370
<i>an ultimatum towards the United States.</i>

436
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,872
<i>The King called for the withdrawal</i>
<i>of the US troops</i>

437
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,792
<i>from its territory</i>
<i>and warned of retaliation…</i>

438
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,670
Without the NIS knowing,
I need to see Seo Munju.

439
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,339
Get it done fast.

440
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,174
Yes, ma'am.

441
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,646
Can you wait one second?

442
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,493
This necklace is fake.

443
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,498
I was jealous of the one Junik bought you.

444
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,125
I had a replica made of yours.

445
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,335
He never loved me.

446
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:55,839
He came by every week just to see his son.

447
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,187
See you soon.

448
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,568
Sanho.

449
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,612
Drive safely.

450
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,043
<i>I just got word</i>
<i>that a secret Idishan account</i>

451
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,296
has made a series of large transfers…

452
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,343
…to multiple shell companies

453
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,722
all owned by Aseom Shipping.

454
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,017
We have to freeze that account, Anderson.

455
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,727
<i>That must be the payment</i>
<i>for the submarine.</i>

456
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,566
The submarine will be delivered
to Idisha soon.

457
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,155
So,

458
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,951
the King of Idisha intends to strike
the United States with missiles

459
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,704
launched from that submarine
in the next 24 hours.

460
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,416
<i>We have found the ultimate solution.</i>

461
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,502
When he says, "ultimate solution," he's…

462
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,130
he's talking about a nuke.

463
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,096
No payment, no deal.

464
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,849
Kim Hansang would never
hand over the submarine

465
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,935
<i>if there is no payment in advance.</i>

466
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,771
Can you find a way to freeze that account?

467
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,773
I-I-I don't know.

468
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,527
But I'm going to try.

469
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,112
<i>I know how hard this is for you, Anderson.</i>

470
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,781
<i>I'm really sorry,</i>

471
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,866
<i>but now you are the only hope we have.</i>

472
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,497
You know what I'd say back?

473
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,792
"I guess we're in trouble then."

474
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,462
Munju, I don't know
how many moves I've got left.

475
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,757
But I'm gonna use 'em all, okay?

476
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,676
I really appreciate it.

477
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,263
Hope to see you someday.

478
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:12,725
<i>I'd love that.</i>

479
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,411
EVER PARK MOTEL

480
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,872
Munju.

481
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,165
<i>Sanho, listen to me.</i>

482
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,374
Carefully.

483
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,586
I'm on my way to see Lim Okseon.

484
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,298
-You're what?
-<i>Mother's holding Miji hostage.</i>

485
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,259
She said she'll kill her
if Eunseong isn't there in an hour.

486
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,304
Where are you? I'm on my way now.

487
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,519
<i>No, I need something else from you.</i>

488
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,481
Once you grab Eunseong,
get to the president.

489
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,149
What did you say?

490
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,943
<i>It looks like Idisha paid North Korea</i>

491
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,819
<i>for the submarine</i>
<i>through Aseom Shipping's account.</i>

492
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,531
Once the submarine is delivered to Idisha,
we don't know what's gonna happen.

493
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,200
<i>We need to let President Chae know</i>

494
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,203
<i>so she can get President Hauser</i>
<i>to act on the intel.</i>

495
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,461
I'm going after Mother.
She'll be following his submarine.

496
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,509
-Munju, wait.
-<i>This is our best shot, Sanho.</i>

497
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,720
Someone has to stop Okseon,

498
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,931
and someone else
has to tell the president.

499
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,684
<i>Just this once,</i>

500
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:22,021
<i>I want you to choose everyone</i>
<i>and not just one person.</i>

501
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,148
<i>You're the only one who can do this.</i>

502
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,449
Some people I trust have been enlisted to
help me get the message to the president.

503
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,787
You'll be hearing from them
fairly soon, I think.

504
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,421
I'll make contact with President Chae.

505
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,800
<i>Then I'm coming for you as fast as I can.</i>

506
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,429
<i>I've had plenty of missions</i>
<i>harder than this.</i>

507
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,225
You'll look back and see me
before you know it.

508
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,353
I have this under control.

509
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,232
Keep yourself safe until then.

510
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,365
And I have this under control.
I know my mother-in-law.

511
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,911
She's not gonna kill me.

512
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,498
I'm not worried about what she'll do.

513
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,631
Make it fast.

514
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,300
I'll get there soon.

515
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,482
Where's Eunseong?

516
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,567
He's left Korea.

517
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,986
He isn't coming here.

518
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,450
Doctor, take her leg.

519
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,503
Eunseong's mother
dropped the paternity lawsuit.

520
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,046
She'll never return to Korea.

521
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:15,968
If you wanted Eunseong for the money,
there's nothing to worry about anymore.

522
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,513
"WAIVER OF INHERITANCE"

523
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,306
And if it wasn't about that?

524
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,975
Then cut off my leg.

525
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,395
Mother, I know what you want,
and it's not Eunseong or Miji.

526
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,649
Even if you take her leg,
how will you be satisfied?

527
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,317
It's me you're after.

528
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,528
And you can take whatever you want.

529
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,488
I have nothing.

530
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,490
I'm all alone here.

531
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,995
Miji's been released
for the lack of evidence, right?

532
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,082
It won't be easy to prove that I'm guilty.

533
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,211
However, I'd be willing to confess

534
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,340
to the murder of Jang Junik,
my own husband.

535
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:59,262
After that you and Junsang will
get access to what you're really after:

536
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,889
the money in Junik's secret accounts.

537
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,696
What do you say?

538
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,081
Doctor,

539
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,709
forget the amputation.

540
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,336
Start emergency surgery now.

541
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,346
Let's go.
