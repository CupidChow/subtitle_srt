1
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,936
TEMPEST

2
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,283
Mr. Im.

3
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,454
You're here.

4
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,862
UNITED MOTHERLAND

5
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,998
-You published a new book?
-I did.

6
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,126
Although I didn't really wanna have
anything printed. Those poor trees.

7
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,753
THE FATE OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA

8
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,049
BY IM DUJIN

9
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,851
Why didn't you visit me sooner?

10
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,604
I thought if I did,
I'd cry the second I saw you.

11
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,607
So what if you did?
Your husband had just died.

12
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,944
I still have so much to do.

13
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,654
Oh, really? Like what?

14
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,659
I never did anything
for him when we were married.

15
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,748
So the least I can do is find out
why he was murdered.

16
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,295
If he risked his life for something,
I wanna finish it for him.

17
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,215
I guess you feel like
you didn't show Junik

18
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,385
enough affection when he was alive.

19
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,558
I thought eventually
I could open up to him.

20
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,853
He was always such a warm and sweet man.

21
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,359
All I had to do was just sit next to him.

22
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,486
Peace and unity are hard to achieve.

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,614
Even in the case of husband and wife.

24
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,745
I saw your number
in Junik's call history pretty recently.

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,288
Were you two seeing each other?

26
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,625
Yeah. Over a month ago.

27
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,712
He showed me the letter he received
from his friend, the one in America.

28
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,675
I thought reunification

29
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,344
was just an option
that was available to us.

30
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,264
But I realize now we're sitting on
a time bomb that is war.

31
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,850
Like death, reunification is inevitable.

32
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,977
No matter how we try to avoid it.

33
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,980
It's something that we have to face.

34
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,775
I still have so much to learn, sir.

35
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,735
Teach me, please.

36
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,614
After that,
he asked me to join his campaign

37
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,700
to oversee the reunification initiative.

38
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,326
Did you accept?

39
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,791
The New Republican Party,
I just couldn't imagine joining them.

40
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,170
By the way, are you moving soon?

41
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,713
It looks like you're packing.

42
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,965
Yeah.

43
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,136
Over to Argentina.
I have relatives with a ranch.

44
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,512
Argentina?

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,937
You know that I introduced Junik
and Father Yang.

46
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,607
Just because they spoke out
about peace and reunification,

47
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,901
they were both killed horribly.

48
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,572
People in this country love hate
more than peace.

49
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,740
They're obsessed
with faction and division,

50
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,453
and I just don't…
I don't want to live here anymore. So…

51
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,330
Sir.

52
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,833
I'm planning to run for president.

53
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,462
You're the one
who taught me about the North

54
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,715
when I first returned to Korea to work
at the ministry of foreign affairs.

55
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,843
Even though I did all my studying
in the US,

56
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,887
you were the person
I actually learned from.

57
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,055
Your predictions about North Korea,

58
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,058
their actions and motives,
have always been accurate.

59
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,227
I need your help, Mr. Im.

60
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,066
Munju.

61
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,278
North Korea is helpless
and they're collapsing.

62
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,907
The US has to intervene.
The North has nuclear weapons.

63
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,159
It's inevitable that war is near.

64
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,827
Those with compassion

65
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,790
will be crushed
under the wheels of history.

66
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,833
I'm fine with getting crushed,

67
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,795
and so was Junik, and so was Father Yang.

68
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,884
But if you're willing to help me,

69
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,968
MUNJU CAMPAIGN OPERATION PLAN

70
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,637
I'll do my best

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,680
to change the course of those wheels.

72
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,101
How were you able to capture that photo?

73
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,938
As soon as I heard the gunshot,
I just kept pressing the shutter.

74
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,816
I was stunned to see a woman
suddenly enter the frame.

75
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,193
My God, who is that woman?

76
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,238
How could she stand at gunpoint
staring him down?

77
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,198
I think that that's the question
on everyone's mind.

78
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:28,161
It is evident that Ambassador Seo
just exhibited extraordinary bravery

79
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:32,290
as she stood unarmed and faced the man
who had just shot and killed her husband.

80
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,252
The newsmaker
of the week is Seo Munju.

81
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,421
Former UN Ambassador and the widow
of the late assemblyman Jang.

82
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,048
Look at Ambassador Seo's eyes.

83
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,424
The courage and anger.

84
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,261
Even in an extreme situation,
she remains completely composed.

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,637
People are now saying

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,347
she should've been the one
running for president

87
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,641
and that they'd vote for her
without giving it a second thought.

88
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,518
If Seo does decide
to run for president,

89
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,478
which party do you think she'll join?

90
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,897
I strongly think she should join
the New Republican Party

91
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,401
and carry out her husband's
political legacy for him.

92
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,195
Her candidacy will only have meaning
if she does.

93
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,114
However, Seo Munju has been

94
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,533
a symbolic figure in the administration
of Chae Kyungsin,

95
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,202
the very face of our government, in fact.

96
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,537
I know

97
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,081
that you went out of your way

98
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,959
to make sure Junik lost the primary.

99
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:20,380
Assemblyman Jang truly was
a-a valuable asset to our party.

100
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,134
Thanks to him, we gained a strong base
of young supporters,

101
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,344
but that was really it.

102
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,472
There are principles that define
who we are as a party,

103
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:33,351
and a key value is anti-communism.

104
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:37,647
Our party was built on the blood spilled
across the 38th parallel.

105
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,025
And well, someone
who doesn't understand that…

106
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,736
He couldn't be our candidate.

107
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,617
So then,

108
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,536
you were glad the day Junik died?

109
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,583
Why would you say that, ma'am?

110
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,254
In September, 2015, in Santa Barbara,
California…

111
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,424
…a drunk driver crashed her car
into a bar.

112
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,053
Two were killed
and three seriously injured.

113
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,389
Two Koreans were arrested at the scene.

114
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,558
A local masseuse and a prosecutor

115
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,520
who was supposedly there
for overseas training.

116
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,732
Prosecutor Jang Junsang.

117
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,777
She was just someone I met that night.

118
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,405
I saw her being sexually harassed
and tried to help.

119
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,408
But she panicked and then ran to her car.

120
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,787
There wasn't enough evidence to charge me.

121
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,833
There wasn't enough then.

122
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,919
What if there is now?

123
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,096
You know, when my husband died, he, um…

124
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,016
he left me this huge file cabinet
with drawers.

125
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,142
Kind of funny, right?

126
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,520
After all those years in politics,

127
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,855
the only thing he left behind
was one file cabinet.

128
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,232
The thing is,

129
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,693
one of those drawers had your name on it.

130
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,319
HWANG MANGI

131
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,614
And when I opened it,
I found some very interesting things.

132
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,785
So today…

133
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,913
I thought I'd share this.

134
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,963
Look at that face,
like father, like daughter.

135
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,507
I mean, it'd be embarrassing to deny it.

136
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,593
That was over 20 years ago!

137
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,139
Everyone in politics had
illegitimate kids then!

138
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,850
The woman told the police
that she was the driver, okay?

139
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,017
I don't remember anything!

140
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,231
Come here, get over here!

141
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,482
Shut up! You better not say a word…

142
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,651
I spoke to your wife
for the first time in a long time.

143
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,778
-You hear me?
-She's willing to testify against you.

144
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,406
She was gonna stay silent for her kids.

145
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,325
But she couldn't bear the thought
of her abusive husband

146
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,618
running for president.

147
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,996
Mom did this?

148
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,586
You got my own mother to help you.

149
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,049
Seo Munju had
an excellent global reputation

150
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,092
as a UN ambassador.

151
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:16,097
Plus, she's a woman, and female leadership
is the dominant trend worldwide right now.

152
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,516
Leave.

153
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,188
Just say you're going to Germany to see
your kids while they study abroad.

154
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,655
This is what she always does.

155
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,116
She does, she…

156
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,827
She always makes me feel like trash.

157
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,455
Well, you can tell her

158
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,000
that since this is where she's
taking things, I'll see you all in hell.

159
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,419
And you should also remember

160
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,922
that when I leave the country,

161
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,383
I won't be empty-handed when I return.

162
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,309
After this,

163
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,938
your political career will be finished
for good.

164
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,109
I gotta say,

165
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,861
I've always wondered…

166
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:17,200
What gave you the audacity to plot
with all of those people against Junik?

167
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,038
You remember, showing up
at our house for the New Year

168
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,082
knowing that you didn't belong there?

169
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,683
Okay, so what is it that you want from me?

170
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,483
Junsang leaves for Germany tonight.

171
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,404
And Munju runs for president this year.

172
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,952
And I want you to stay out of her way.

173
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,954
Considering her background with the UN,

174
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,666
some folks are skeptical about her skill
set in managing the government, right?

175
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,211
Well, regarding past presidents who were
diplomats, we've had Choi Gyuha.

176
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,756
South Korea is among
the ranks of the world powers,

177
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,925
which makes diplomacy
a matter of survival.

178
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,010
That's right.

179
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,680
First of all, I'm going
to turn her into a spectacle.

180
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,477
Then, the spectacle will grow
into a phenomenon.

181
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,981
And eventually…

182
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,484
she'll become a legend.

183
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,279
Representative Hwang, hello!

184
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,199
Is it true Seo Munju will
run in the presidential primary

185
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,325
for the New Republican Party?

186
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,160
As far as I am concerned,

187
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,331
Ambassador Seo Munju is entirely focused
on determining the ideal way

188
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,666
to share the vision of
the late Assemblyman Jang with the world.

189
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,045
You know, truthfully, the biggest
criticism I've faced from my party lately

190
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,923
is that I didn't bring on
Ambassador Seo any sooner!

191
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,966
-Excuse me.
-When will the primary…

192
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,427
What was it that made
the Ambassador decide to run?

193
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,804
Report any issues from the advance
team's inspection,

194
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,432
double-check the contact network
of the local authorities.

195
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,850
Oh, yes, hold on, please.

196
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,518
Uh-huh. Let me know
if anyone gives you a problem.

197
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,229
And which hospital did you speak to?

198
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,690
Hi, Miji Yeo, campaign manager. Yes?
Yeah. Uh, three people?

199
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,609
Ms. Seo.

200
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,904
Six different organizations
did a flash poll

201
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,531
on the New Republican Party's
presidential candidate yesterday,

202
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:24,244
and you've suddenly jumped to first
or second rank in all categories.

203
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,995
PRIMARY CANDIDACY
ANNOUNCEMENT D-6

204
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,708
Wow, do you… Do you have any clue
how nuts it is outside?

205
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,085
I don't know how they got our number.

206
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,088
The phone's ringing constantly,
people want to volunteer for the campaign!

207
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,716
Man, this is so one of those times where
you say, "You're slaying it, baby girl!"

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,051
Did you say, "slaying it?"

209
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,928
So fire, girl! You're totally lit!

210
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,889
Wait, fire? Why are you…

211
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,642
Anderson, did you get ahold of him?

212
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,520
Uh, I've been trying using
various channels,

213
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,063
I still haven't reached him though.

214
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,982
I got his sister's contact
number yesterday.

215
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,900
The minute after I've heard back,
I'll reach out.

216
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,945
Uh, no, I'll try it myself.

217
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,031
Also, Miji, I keep getting these emails
from someone.

218
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,741
Can you do me a favor
and see what it's about?

219
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,201
JOSE KIM
SHIV HOLDINGS INHERITANCE INQUIRY

220
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,036
-I'll forward you everything.
-Yep, got it.

221
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,831
I unlocked Assemblyman Jang's computer,
and his cell phone,

222
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,499
and restored all deleted logs.

223
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,168
Multiple records exist of him
accessing a secure email site.

224
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,004
It's hosted on an encrypted server.

225
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,465
It's known for airtight security,
that even the FBI can't crack.

226
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,052
Each user is given a fifteen-character
encryption key to use.

227
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,848
You think you could crack the code?

228
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,892
These SincereMail emails aren't easy
to decrypt.

229
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,854
I can give it a try, but I can't
promise you that it'll work.

230
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,942
Are you in a meeting?
I couldn't get you on the phone.

231
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,696
It's been ringing constantly,
so I put it away.

232
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,783
Get another phone under your aide's name.
It's what everyone does.

233
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,371
This is going well for us.

234
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:54,292
The first ones to sniff out a rising
politician are the ones with money,

235
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,503
and a lot of those folks are dying
to sponsor you as the candidate.

236
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,964
I mean, I haven't done anything.

237
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,968
We've set the stage for you.
Put the lights on. Music's cued up.

238
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,680
And now it's your turn to show up
and perform for the crowd.

239
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,183
Your debut must dazzle them.

240
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,895
So, let's… let's kick it off
with a triple axel.

241
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,857
Wait, a triple axel? How?

242
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,568
This coming Sunday,

243
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,154
your campaign announcement is
at Gwanghwamun Square.

244
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,115
We'll pull in a huge crowd
without using any agencies.

245
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,078
The public sees you as Joan of Arc.

246
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:35,041
The woman who stood unarmed in front
of her husband to protect him from a gun.

247
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:41,005
And we need to keep them seeing you
that way and make them shed tears for you.

248
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,384
The easiest thing would be for you

249
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,513
to shed some tears of your own
when the time is right.

250
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,185
I don't think that I can.

251
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,606
Do you really want to be the president?

252
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,651
No one's ever become president
without shedding tears in public.

253
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:06,656
Crying shows all of them what you value
the most, it's your vulnerability.

254
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,201
And as far as how convincing
everything looks,

255
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,037
well, that's entirely up to you now,
isn't it?

256
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,124
You nail it and that's your triple axel.

257
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,214
I've had an experienced writer draft
your speech for you.

258
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,717
Also, the cue is marked
where you should start crying,

259
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,553
so get that down before Sunday.

260
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,728
TOP NEWS AT THIS HOUR

261
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,188
FORMER UN AMBASSADOR SEO MUNJU

262
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,527
SEO MUNJU

263
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,990
TO ANNOUNCE CAMPAIGN ON THE 19TH

264
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,908
7 P.M. IN GWANGHWAMUN SQUARE

265
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,381
Mr. Hwang?

266
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,592
The director of the NIS called me.

267
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,676
Why?

268
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,637
Well, he said there's been suspicious
action from the US.

269
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,098
Several Americans flew in
ahead of her announcement.

270
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,683
Who is it?

271
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,393
The CIA?

272
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,937
They weren't the only ones.

273
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,648
Seo could be in a lot of danger.

274
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,797
Cheers.

275
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,841
Come on in, guys.

276
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:01,771
We received intel that "Red Feather"
Billy Gray arrived in Seoul yesterday.

277
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,858
He's putting on quite the show
for the cameras.

278
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,830
To us, they're still
our brothers and sisters.

279
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:24,252
The recent Human Rights Commission report
on North Korea was heartbreaking.

280
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:30,049
Far into the future, when we look back,
and think about what we have done,

281
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:35,263
I sincerely hope that we will be able
to say that we did the right thing

282
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,098
for the people in North Korea,

283
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:43,187
who deserve to live
a decent life just like us.

284
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,481
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

285
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:08,838
Hello?

286
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,047
Did I wake you?

287
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,549
Why are you calling?

288
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,593
You're about to be
a presidential candidate.

289
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,802
You should be awake already.

290
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,763
If you have something to say, say it.

291
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,932
If your goal was
to surprise me, you nailed it.

292
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,728
Honestly, it was like I was slapped
in the face. Which is new.

293
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,897
I never thought that you would stand up
to me like this.

294
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,691
You know,

295
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,902
I don't care if you do become president.

296
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,989
But this is still my term
and I have my own plans.

297
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,324
I told you…

298
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,160
…I'll do whatever I have to,
to stop this war.

299
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,537
If you get in my way,
I will come after you.

300
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,789
Just thought I'd give you a heads-up.

301
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,791
I was always fond of you.

302
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,712
I wasn't trying to surprise you.
And it wasn't to stand up to you.

303
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,716
But still, I highly doubt
you'll be able to do this.

304
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,428
You don't think I can manage
to stop the war,

305
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,264
but somehow you could do it?

306
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,934
You said, Junik's death was our chance
to work with the US,

307
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,603
to handle it diplomatically.

308
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,189
I disagree.

309
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,983
It's our chance to learn
what really happened.

310
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,904
A diplomatic attempt will fail
if it's rooted in lies.

311
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,781
Hmm, by the way,

312
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,158
I hope you realize…

313
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,329
a candidate without approval
from the US could never get elected

314
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,914
as the president of South Korea,

315
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,874
and they don't want you
leading this country.

316
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,212
So watch your back.
I say that with genuine concern.

5.18 MEMORIAL PARK, GWANGJU

318

Today will be a very long day.

319
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:41,657
The journey you make
from Gwangju to Seoul…

320
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,871
should serve as a campaign announcement.

A NEW ERA WITH SEO MUNJU!

322
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,139
Did you see how many people
came out here today?

323
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,102
And they're all in black
to mourn Assemblyman Jang.

-Let's go!

329
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,973
Munju! Over here!
Come here, Munju!

330
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,058
You look great!

331
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,560
-We believe in you!
-You're the best!

332
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,188
-I appreciate it.
-We support you. Yeah!

333
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,400
Nice to meet you, Munju.

334
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,694
We believe in you, okay!
You gonna do this!

335
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:05,491
Munju! Munju! Munju!

336
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,868
S One, have you secured the area
for her exit?

337
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,624
Okay, go ahead and scan her route,
and check for anomalies, okay?

338
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,045
Seo Munju!
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

We've identified
the Korean man Billy Gray came in with.

341
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,352
His name is Dustin Hyun.

342
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,063
He's a bomb technician
with a Caltech degree.

MEMORIAL GATE

348
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:22,359
Hey, you know, I've honestly
always dreamed of this day.

349
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,737
You finally making your debut in politics.

350
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,200
I have to say, I think this is possibly
the best day of my life.

351
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:39,668
I took this time to embrace
the stories of those who built Korea

352
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,422
into what it is today,
and their grief, which still lingers.

353
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,965
My next stop is Seoul.

354
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,010
Many of your supporters have
already gathered at Gwanghwamun Square.

355
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,763
-Can you see them?
-Yes, I can see them.

356
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,849
Hi everyone!

357
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,144
You must've been waiting a while.
I hope you're not completely exhausted.

358
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,271
No!

359
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,941
Thank you.

360
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,737
Seo Munju, I need to see her.

361
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,072
Who are you?

362
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,492
I have to speak to her now.
It's an emergency.

363
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,119
You were at the church, weren't you?

364
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,831
Listen to me.
Seo Munju can't get on that train.

365
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,294
Okay. Uh, Ms. Seo,
it's Changhee on the phone.

366
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,215
-Hi, Changhee.
-Get off that train now, Ms. Seo.

367
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,842
What?

368
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,514
Don't sit down, do you hear me?
Don't sit down!

369
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,605
Ms. Seo.

370
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,565
Paik Sanho, is that you?

371
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,027
You need to stay in that seat now,
don't get up.

372
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:48,779
Is that clear?

373
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,198
What are you saying?

374
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:55,661
Stay in your seat, and make sure
you do not get up for any reason.

375
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,085
Are you seeing this?
We should stop broadcasting for a minute.

376
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,464
What should I do?

377
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,009
I want you to try to find the man
that fixed your seat.

378
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,346
Miji.

379
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,060
LIVE BROADCAST WILL RESUME ONCE
THE TRAIN ARRIVES IN 40 MINUTES!

380
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,568
So, I guess he wasn't even an employee.

381
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,153
Apparently, they only fix things like that

382
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,988
after the trains are shut down
for the day.

383
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,656
My name is Paik Sanho.

384
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,410
I was special forces in Iraq
running security since 2007.

385
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,996
Terrorists often plant
explosives under seats.

386
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,458
And if I get up again, it'll detonate?

387
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,127
It will if it has a pressure
release switch.

388
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,130
But if it's a time bomb
it'll detonate at a set time.

389
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,677
First, call the police.

390
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:54,762
I-I'll call now.

391
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,264
-Which stop is next?
-Asan Station.

392
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,141
-And after that one?
-Gwangmyeong.

393
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,351
See you in Gwangmyeong.

394
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,564
I need to step away.

395
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,232
I'll come right back.

396
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,035
Some guy came and fixed the seat,

397
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,913
but the railway confirmed
he wasn't one of their workers.

398
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,292
In Iraq, that would likely mean
they planted explosives under the seat.

399
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,295
Ma'am,
you're not in Iraq. You're in Korea.

400
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,885
The police are gonna meet us
at Gwangmyeong Station.

401
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,512
Okay, I'm on the way there.

402
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,389
I'll arrive in 15 minutes at the station.

403
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,849
We're in first class, car three.

404
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,896
Miji, go talk to everyone else who's here
and get them to another car.

405
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,482
Yeah, I'll make it happen.

406
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,444
What's going on?

407
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,155
We start in an hour.

408
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,282
Just get her here now.

409
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,451
Okay, I'll reach out
when everything's done.

410
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,143
That guy's crazy.

411
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,307
NO. 1 SEOUL

412
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,992
Are you okay?

413
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,578
Yeah.

414
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,251
Police.

415
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,423
Please cut the power here,

416
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,717
and evacuate everyone from this station.

417
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,387
What about the bomb squad?
Are they on their way?

418
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,141
Ah, they won't be here
for another ten minutes.

419
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,647
All right, folks,
please exit the train quickly.

420
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,567
We're conducting a brief inspection
due to a safety issue.

421
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,402
This way, okay? This way, please.

422
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:24,448
Right this way, yes.
This way please. That's right.

423
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,636
Try not to breathe so fast.

424
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,722
What?

425
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,768
Too much oxygen could end up causing you
to feel lightheaded.

426
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,482
This bomb is a standard pressure-release
unit, with a timer set as a fail-safe.

427
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,233
How much time is left?

428
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,194
Six minutes.

429
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,792
Look at me.

430
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,798
The more urgent the mission is,
the more calmly I proceed.

431
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,390
We're having a normal conversation,
all right?

432
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,110
Beer.

433
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,779
If I survive this,

434
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,283
then the first thing I'll do
is have a cold beer.

435
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,122
All right.

436
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,457
First we're gonna switch seats
very carefully,

437
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,418
and then you're gonna get off this train.

438
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,211
I want to stay here.

439
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,338
No, you can't stay here.

440
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,550
You have a crowd waiting for you.

441
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,761
It doesn't matter. Since I lost my baby…

442
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,561
I don't have anyone.

443
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,242
Just follow my lead, okay?

444
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,036
I promise it won't be difficult.

445
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,366
I'll be out soon.

446
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,272
-Get out of there!
-It's too dangerous!

447
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,317
Based on witness accounts
and analysis of CCTV footage

448
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,612
from inside the train, the police
have identified a man in his forties…

449
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,781
…congested with passengers
who evacuated the train.

450
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,241
The explosive device was found installed
under a train seat.

451
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,082
Have you identified
the suspect?

452
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,418
We're still tracking him,
but we'll keep you updated.

453
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,338
So you still don't know who it is?

454
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,049
For now,
would you all come down to the station

455
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,759
to give statements?

456
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,886
You may want to cancel the event.

457
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,098
It's best to hold off
until after the investigation's complete.

458
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,102
Continuing today could look like
we're trying too hard.

459
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,104
And safety comes first.

460
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,563
Changhee, what do you think?

461
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,609
Well, I think it should be your call.

462
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,695
There are no security concerns for now
at the venue.

463
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:37,779
Are you…

464
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,280
I'll keep going.

465
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,990
This is never gonna be easy,

466
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,159
and I know you all prepared thoroughly
for today.

467
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,203
If we have the police escort us,

468
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,997
I think we can continue my schedule
and head to the last stop tonight.

469
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,583
Understood. Then we'll proceed as planned.

470
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,837
I'll ride with Ms. Seo.

471
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,136
Yes.

472
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,598
Yes, we're headed to the square now, and
she will announce her campaign as planned.

473
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,352
Uh-huh. I think that we'll get there
in about 20.

474
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:15,984
THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY

475
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,742
Here. Watch your step.

476
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,002
Candidate has arrived.

477
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,545
Everyone, stand by.

478
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,088
Are you sure you're up for this?

479
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,840
They've been waiting in the cold.

480
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,802
Why don't you just rest a little?
I don't want you to be nervous out there.

481
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,557
I don't get nervous talking
to a big crowd.

482
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,859
You'll see a teleprompter
on both sides of the podium.

483
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,943
Don't worry.

484
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,958
Everyone, Candidate Seo Munju, let's
give her a great big round of applause!

485
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,643
THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY

486
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,825
WE SUPPORT SEO MUNJU

487
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:47,992
Keep them back.

488
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,620
And check what's in their hands.

489
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,334
-Please! It's a gift!
-No, it's all right.

490
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,797
Thank you.

491
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,590
We love you, Ms. Seo.

492
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,844
You have my support.
We know you can do it.

493
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,609
SEO MUNJU SAVE US

494
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,825
Many of you here probably don't know
who I am.

495
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,411
And I imagine that
those of you who do know me

496
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,705
only know me as the widow of Jang Junik.

497
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,711
Good evening, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Seo Munju, an ambassador.

498
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:51,347
You probably heard that I traveled all the
way here today on a train from Gwangju.

499
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,894
I passed through Daejeon,
bringing with me the warmth of the people,

500
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,729
and their desire for peace.

501
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,772
But in truth, my journey began
long before that.

502
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,524
The words she's speaking
are entirely different.

503
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:02,734
Want me to cut the teleprompters?

504
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,569
No, no, leave 'em on for now.

505
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,905
…my years in America,
studying with the Korean flag

506
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,239
on the wall above me,

507
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:13,661
all the way to the very tragic death
of my husband Jang Junik

508
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,788
who fought for peace and reunification,

509
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:21,002
and up until this day,
when I almost was killed on that train.

510
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,047
The whole time,
I was running toward this moment.

511
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,301
And I wondered,
what was that bomb trying to keep me from?

512
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,014
It was all of you.
I was trying to reach you.

513
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,435
Some people say I can't be the president
because I'm a woman and a diplomat,

514
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,438
and I don't have
a traditional political background.

515
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,775
Some say that I shouldn't be
running for president

516
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,945
with the party of my late husband.

517
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,948
And some say I'm not fit
to lead this nation

518
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,575
because I spent most of my life
out of Korea.

519
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,787
However, all of you thought
that I could be the one

520
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,747
to bring change to this great nation.

521
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,250
That I could help us work
towards peaceful reunification.

522
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:07,256
That I could be a president for the weak,
the forgotten and the unheard.

523
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:12,637
remember, you are the hope for that unity.

524
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,103
I don't know why people are trying
to stop us,

525
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:24,232
but I know that I'm not afraid, and
I swear that I won't give up this fight,

526
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,695
as I keep on running towards the goal
for hope and change.

527
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,196
For peaceful streets,

528
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,158
happy families,
a world where people have each other.

529
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:40,039
And also for a nice cold beer to drink
at the end of a long, hard day.

530
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,171
And to make sure we achieve
all of these things,

531
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:53,553
I'd like to announce that I'm a candidate
for the 21st election of the presidency.

532
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:02,311
Seo Munju!
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

533
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,781
Congratulations.

534
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,534
Looks like a superstar is on the rise.

535
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,665
She just landed her triple axel.

536
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,044
Seo Munju!
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

537
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,213
Did you see that?

538
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,674
She just slayed it.

539
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,473
Every night in my dreams…

540
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,602
I walked as lightly as a leaf.

541
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,106
And death…

542
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:32,819
never scared me.

543
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,280
But I had no idea…

544
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,408
that someone…

545
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,623
had been holding me up this whole time.

546
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,809
Seo Munju!
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

547
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,756
Why did you go back there
from Yongsan?

548
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,466
There are a few more things to work out.

549
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,969
-Where's Ms. Seo?
-She's still talking to those guys.

550
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,679
-Oh, here she comes.
-There she is.

551
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,475
This is a serious case.
And we need your cooperation, sir.

552
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,312
Ms. Seo, are you ready to head out?

553
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,521
Let's go.

554
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,775
-Hello.
-If this how your candidacy is beginning,

555
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,819
what should we expect as it
gets closer to the election?

556
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,654
Ambassador Seo, wait, one more question!

557
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,489
Sir, is there anything…

558
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:31,998
Mr. Paik.

559
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,041
It's been a really long day.

560
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,503
Is your leg okay?

561
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,674
Yeah, just a few scratches.

562
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,136
I don't even know
how to thank you.

563
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,221
Mr. Paik, I…

564
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,474
I'm still as confused as I was earlier.

565
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:54,353
How did you manage to get to me
at the right time again?

566
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:58,441
They killed Assemblyman Jang.
And Father Yang after that.

567
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,070
I had a feeling that you
would be the next one,

568
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,156
since you're continuing
the Assemblyman's work.

569
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,993
If you'd have been hit by that bomb,
you'd have been fatally wounded.

570
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,663
Someone is attempting
to send you a message.

571
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,999
That anyone who tries to stop this war…

572
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,960
is next to meet that same fate.

573
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,963
You're probably still in danger.

574
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,925
I'll reinforce my security then.

575
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,886
I don't really think they can manage it.

576
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,972
Valkyrie just renewed my contract.

577
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,309
No one is able to protect you
as well as I can Ms. Seo.

578
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,605
You should hire me as your bodyguard.

579
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,650
And why should I trust you?

580
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:43,944
Do a background check.

581
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,948
Look into the battles I've fought
and the roles I took on.

582
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,659
Feel free. Have me followed.

583
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,662
Why would you do all this?

584
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,707
Seo Munju, you want to stop this war?

585
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,628
Well, I do too. Okay?

586
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,673
Father Yang left me with a task.

587
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,469
Do you think that I can do it?

588
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,349
I had this dream.

589
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,559
And in it,

590
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,230
I believe that I could do it.

591
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,566
In my dream I was you.

592
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,570
But you're gonna need my help.

593
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,575
Well, my team is…

594
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,369
They're very meticulous.

595
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,538
And they will pour over
everything, Mr. Paik.

596
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,665
Fine. Then I hope that
they can finish it quickly.

597
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:42,044
You understand that I'm your boss
and you will follow my instructions.

598
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,505
Well, every soldier knows
how to take orders.

599
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,591
However, in case there's an emergency,
you must do as I say.

600
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,343
And then I'm the boss.

601
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,226
Okay, Mr. Paik.

602
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:03,983
Welcome to the team.

603
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,826
Thank you, very much. Ms. Seo.
